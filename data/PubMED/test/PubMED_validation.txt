Insights into GATA-1-mediated gene activation versus repression via genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis. The transcription factor GATA-1 is required for terminal erythroid maturation and functions as an activator or repressor depending on gene context. Yet its in vivo site selectivity and ability to distinguish between activated versus repressed genes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed GATA-1 ChIP-seq in erythroid cells and compared it to GATA-1-induced gene expression changes. Bound and differentially expressed genes contain a greater number of GATA-binding motifs, a higher frequency of palindromic GATA sites, and closer occupancy to the transcriptional start site versus nondifferentially expressed genes. Moreover, we show that the transcription factor Zbtb7a occupies GATA-1-bound regions of some direct GATA-1 target genes, that the presence of SCL/TAL1 helps distinguish transcriptional activation versus repression, and that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in epigenetic silencing of a subset of GATA-1-repressed genes. These data provide insights into GATA-1-mediated gene regulation in vivo.

Preparation and characterization of (15)N-enriched, size-defined heparan sulfate precursor oligosaccharides. We report the preparation of size-defined [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides from Escherichia coli-derived (15)N-enriched N-acetylheparosan. Optimized growth conditions of E. coli in minimal media containing (15)NH(4)Cl yielded [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan on a preparative scale. Depolymerization of [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan by heparitinase I yielded resolvable, even-numbered oligosaccharides ranging from disaccharide to icosaccharide. Anion-exchange chromatography-assisted fractionation afforded size-defined [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides identifiable by ESI-TOFMS. These isotopically labeled oligosaccharides will prove to be valuable research tools for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides and for the study of their structural biology.

Transgenic zebrafish eggs containing bactericidal peptide is a novel food supplement enhancing resistance to pathogenic infection of fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a bioreactor to produce bovine lactoferricin (LFB), which has wide-ranging antimicrobial activity. We constructed an expression plasmid in which LFB was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and driven by zebrafish beta-actin promoter. After microinjection, six transgenic founders were screened on the basis of GFP appearance. Among them, a stable ZBL-5 line was selected by the ubiquitous and strong expression of GFP. Using PCR and Western blot analysis, we confirmed that the recombinant LFB-GFP protein was produced by the F2 progeny derived from the ZBL-5 line. The bactericidal agar plate assay proved that the functional domain of LFB was released from the LFB-GFP fusion protein, resulting in strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, adult zebrafish were given one feeding of fifty 72-hpf transgenic embryos. The treated fish were then immersed in freshwater containing 1 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1)E. tarda for 7 days. The survival rate of the treated zebrafish was significantly higher than that of fish fed with fifty wild-type embryos (75 +/- 12.5% versus 4 +/- 7.2%). This line of evidence suggested that pathogen resistance can be enhanced by using transgenic embryos containing LFB-GFP as a food supplement for fish, while, at the same time, reducing the demand of chemical antibiotics.


Role of YiaX2 in L-ascorbate transport in Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882.

EGF-induced ERK activation promotes CK2-mediated disassociation of alpha-Catenin from beta-Catenin and transactivation of beta-Catenin. Increased transcriptional activity of beta-catenin resulting from Wnt/Wingless-dependent or -independent signaling has been detected in many types of human cancer, but the underlying mechanism of Wnt-independent regulation remains unclear. We demonstrate here that EGFR activation results in disruption of the complex of beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, thereby abrogating the inhibitory effect of alpha-catenin on beta-catenin transactivation via CK2alpha-dependent phosphorylation of alpha-catenin at S641. ERK2, which is activated by EGFR signaling, directly binds to CK2alpha via the ERK2 docking groove and phosphorylates CK2alpha primarily at T360/S362, subsequently enhancing CK2alpha activity toward alpha-catenin phosphorylation. In addition, levels of alpha-catenin S641 phosphorylation correlate with levels of ERK1/2 activity in human glioblastoma specimens and with grades of glioma malignancy. This EGFR-ERK-CK2-mediated phosphorylation of alpha-catenin promotes beta-catenin transactivation and tumor cell invasion. These findings highlight the importance of the crosstalk between EGFR and Wnt pathways in tumor development.

Requirement of the cytoplasmic portion for dimer formation of Fcalpha/micro receptor expressed on cell surface. Fcalpha/mu receptor (Fcalpha/muR), an Fc receptor for IgA and IgM, is the only Fc receptor for IgM identified on hematopoietic cells in human and rodents and for IgA in rodents. Fcalpha/microR is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing one immunoglobulin-like domain in the extracellular portion. Both human and mouse Fcalpha/microR mediate endocytosis of the ligands IgA and IgM, for which the cytoplasmic portion of Fcalpha/microR is responsible. However, molecular characteristics of Fcalpha/muR involved in the function have been incompletely understood. Here, we show that both monomeric and dimeric Fcalpha/microR are expressed in a mouse B cell line BCL1-B20 and BW5147 or Ba/F3 transfectants stably expressing Fcalpha/microR. We also show that the dimeric, but not monomeric, Fcalpha/microR is preferentially localized to the cell surface of the transfectants. BW5147 transfectant expressing mutant Fcalpha/microR lacking the cytoplasmic portion expressed only the monomeric Fcalpha/microR. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic portion is required for the dimer formation and thus for efficient cell surface expression of Fcalpha/microR.


Critical role of TLR7 in the acceleration of systemic lupus erythematosus in TLR9-deficient mice.

Hydrothermal pre-treatment of rapeseed straw. As a first step for ethanol production from alternative raw materials, rapeseed straw was studied for fermentable sugar production. Liquid hot water was used as a pre-treatment method and the influence of the main pre-treatment variables was assessed. Experimental design and response surface methodology were applied using pre-treatment temperature and process time as factors. The pretreated solids were further submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis and the corresponding yields were used as pre-treatment performance evaluation. Liquid fractions obtained from pre-treatment were also characterized in terms of sugars and no-sugar composition. A mathematical model describing pre-treatment effects is proposed. Results show that enzymatic hydrolysis yields near to 100% based on pretreated materials can be achieved at 210-220 degrees C for 30-50 min, equivalent to near 70% of glucose present in the raw material. According to the mathematical model, a softer pre-treatment at 193 degrees C for 27 min results in 65% of glucose and 39% of xylose available for fermentation.

B-mode ultrasonographic evaluation of the testis in relation to serum testosterone concentration in male Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) during the breeding season. The use of ultrasonography as a noninvasive tool for assessing the reproductive status of the male Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) was validated by correlating ultrasonographically determined testicular volume (TV) and testicular parenchyma pixel intensity (PI) with serum testosterone (T) concentration. The testes of 13 free-ranging male YFPs from the Tian-e-Zhou Reserve and three captive animals from the Baiji Dolphinarium (Wuhan, China) were examined ultrasonographically during April 2008. Testis volume was determined using Lambert's formula for an ellipsoid. Testicular parenchyma PI was evaluated by analyzing testicular ultrasonograms using pixel analysis software (Image J). Serum T concentrations were determined using a single-antibody radioimmunoassay. The TV, PI, and serum T concentration were low and similar in animals with body length <133 cm, highest in those with body length >or=142 cm, and highly variable in those with body length from 133 to 141 cm. Both TV and PI were closely correlated with serum T concentration (r=0.91 and r=0.85, respectively; P<0.01), indicating a consistent association between structural and functional development of the testis. In conclusion, we inferred that puberty onset in male YFPs occurred when TV was >150 cm(3) and PI was >60 during the breeding season and that testicular ultrasonography and pixel analysis was an efficient, noninvasive, real-time tool to evaluate testicular function of live male YFPs.

[Subsequent pregnancy among adolescents]. To evaluate epidemiological aspects in recurrent adolescence pregnancy. Cohort study including 187 pregnant adolescents attended and followed-up for five years after delivery in an adolescent's attendance service in Ceará state. Age group, being or not at school, living with parents, schooling, marital status and the present partner's condition were analyzed. Data were processed by the EPI-INFO program. Statistical analysis of the independent variables (age, schooling, being at school, having a job, living with parents, marital status and switching partners) was done and compared to the dependent variable (being or not pregnant after five years). The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association among factors which could influence the pregnancy recurrence, the association being present when p<0.05. Risks related to schooling, marital status and multiple partners have been calculated, since these were significant factors for pregnancy recurrence. 61% of the adolescents got pregnant in the five years after the first delivery. Factors such as age, school, work or living with parents were not protective. Nevertheless, when the adolescents had eight or less years of schooling, the risk of getting pregnant has almost duplicated (relative risk (RR)=1.8 (CI 95%=1.3-2.6)). New pregnancies were more frequent among the single adolescents without a stable partner (RR=1.3 (CI 95%=1.1-1.6) and among the ones who had multiple partners (RR=1.4 (CI 95%=1.1-1.7)). Low schooling, multiple partners and non-stable bonds were risk factors for pregnancy recurrence.

Sclerosing polycystic adenosis of the parotid gland: report of one case diagnosed by fine-needle cytology with in situ malignant transformation. Sclerosing polycystic adenosis (SPA) is a rare pathological condition affecting the salivary glands, first described by Smith etal. in 1996. Even though this lesion is being increasingly diagnosed, less than 50 cases have been published in the world literature to date. In line with numerous other pathological analogies between breast and salivary gland lesions, SPA shares with fibrocystic disease of the breast many histopathological features, i.e., fibrosis, oncocytic (apocrine) changes, hyperplasia of ductal and acinar epithelium, cystic dilation of ducts, and, often, atypical epithelial changes. Most of the described cases have followed a benign clinical course, despite the frequent possibility of atypical hyperplasia in more than 50% of the cases and of the more than occasional in situ malignant transformation. In this article, we introduce a new case occurring in the parotid gland of a 57-year-old male showing atypical epithelial hyperplasia and low-grade in situ mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Fine-needle cytology (FNC) was performed on the lesion and, when a diagnosis of SPA was prospected, the variegated cytological features of the obtained sample posed several differential diagnostic problems. The spectrum of pathological lesions entering differential diagnosis comprised sebaceous adenoma, Warthin's tumors with presence of sebaceous remnants, and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Histopathological examination disclosed SCA with intraductal neoplastic transformation resembling noninvasive low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The cytological diagnosis of SPA should be entertained whenever a polymorphous picture is found on FNC samples comprising oncocytic/apocrine changes, sebaceous cells, cystic background, and epithelial hyperplasia with low-grade cytological atypias.

Immobilization of bacteriophages on modified silica particles. Bacteriophages are selective anti-bacterial agents, which are receiving increasing acceptance by regulatory agencies for use both in the food industry and in clinical settings for biocontrol. While immobilized phage could be particularly useful to create antimicrobial surfaces, current immobilization strategies require chemical bioconjugation to surfaces or more difficult processes involving modification of their head proteins to express specific binding moieties, for example, biotin or cellulose binding domains; procedures that are both time and money intensive. We report that morphologically different bacteriophages, active against a variety of food-borne bacteria: Escherichia coli; Salmonella enterica; Listeria monocytogenes; and Shigella boydii, will effectively physisorb to silica particles, prepared by silica surface modification with poly(ethylene glycol), carboxylic acid groups, or amines. The phages remain infective to their host bacteria while adsorbed on the surface of the silica particles. The number of infective phage bound to the silica is enhanced by the presence of ionic surfaces, with greater surface charge - to a maximum - correlating with greater concentration of adsorbed phage. Above the maximum charge concentration, the number of active phage drops.

Functional monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promoter -2518 polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism has been reported inconsistently to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this study was to explore whether the MCP-1 polymorphism confers susceptibility to SLE or LN. We surveyed studies on the MCP-1 polymorphism and SLE or LN identified by MEDLINE or manual searches. Meta-analysis was conducted on the AA genotype (recessive effect), AA, and AG genotypes (dominant effect), AA versus GG (genotype contrast), and on the A allele of MCP-1 in SLE and LN in each ethnic population studied and on all subjects. Ten studies, which included 1,739 SLE patients and 1,680 controls, were included in our meta-analysis. These consisted of two European, six Asian, one Latin American, and one mixed study. We did not find any association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE in all subjects or in ethnic groups. Meta-analysis also failed to reveal an association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphisms and LN. This meta-analysis on 3419 subjects indicates that no association exists between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE or LN.

Identification of an endogenous retroviral envelope gene with fusogenic activity and placenta-specific expression in the rabbit: a new "syncytin" in a third order of mammals. Syncytins are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been co-opted by the host to mediate a specialized function in placentation. Two of these genes have already been identified in primates, as well as two distinct, non orthologous genes in rodents. Here we identified within the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus-which belongs to the lagomorpha order- an envelope (env) gene of retroviral origin with the characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin, that we named syncytin-Ory1. An in silico search for full-length env genes with an uninterrupted open reading frame within the rabbit genome first identified two candidate genes that were tested for their specific expression in the placenta by quantitative RT-PCR of RNA isolated from a large set of tissues. This resulted in the identification of an env gene with placenta-specific expression and belonging to a family of endogenous retroelements present at a limited copy number in the rabbit genome. Functional characterization of the identified placenta-expressed env gene after cloning in a CMV-driven expression vector and transient transfection experiments, demonstrated both fusogenic activity in an ex vivo cell-cell fusion assay and infectivity of pseudotypes. The receptor for the rabbit syncytin-Ory1 was found to be the same as that for human syncytin-1, i.e. the previously identified ASCT2 transporter. This was demonstrated by a co-culture fusion assay between hamster A23 cells transduced with an expression vector for ASCT2 and A23 cells transduced with syncytin-Ory1. Finally, in situ hybridization of rabbit placenta sections with a syncytin-Ory1 probe revealed specific expression at the level of the junctional zone between the placental lobe and the maternal decidua, where the invading syncytial fetal tissue contacts the maternal decidua to form the labyrinth, consistent with a role in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytin-Ory1 gene is found in Leporidae but not in Ochotonidae, and should therefore have entered the lagomorpha order 12-30 million years ago. The identification of a novel syncytin gene within a third order of mammals displaying syncytiotrophoblast formation during placentation strongly supports the notion that on several occasions retroviral infections have resulted in the independent capture of genes that have been positively selected for a convergent physiological role.

Observational study of prevalence of long-term Raynaud-like phenomena and neurological side effects in testicular cancer survivors. Sensory neuropathy (paresthesias), tinnitus, hearing impairment, and Raynaud phenomena are side effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy used to treat testicular cancer patients. We assessed the long-term occurrence of these side effects among testicular cancer survivors according to the treatment they received. A total of 1814 men who were treated for unilateral testicular cancer in Norway during 1980-1994 were invited to participate in a national multicenter follow-up survey conducted during 1998-2002. The men were allocated to six groups according to the treatment they had received. Self-reported symptoms were assessed by a mailed questionnaire that included the Scale for Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity. A total of 1409 participants who responded to the questionnaire and/or underwent audiometry were assessable in this study. Respondents to the questionnaire (n = 1402) scored the relevant symptoms according to how troubled they were by each (not at all, a little, quite a bit, or very much). Hearing impairment was objectively assessed by audiometry at 4000 Hz in 755 men (seven of whom did not respond to the questionnaire). Group comparisons of symptom assessments were performed with chi2 or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Associations between relevant factors and self-reported symptoms or hearing impairment measured by audiometry were assessed using proportional odds ordinal logistic regression models and linear regression models, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided. The median follow-up for the 1409 assessable men was 10.7 years (range = 4-21 years). All chemotherapy groups had statistically significantly higher odds for increasing severity of all assessed symptoms and inferior audiometric results compared with men who did not receive chemotherapy. Among chemotherapy-treated men, 39% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 43%) reported Raynaud-like phenomena (defined as white or cold hands or fingers [or feet or toes] on cold exposure), 29% (95% CI = 25% to 33%) reported paresthesias in the hands or feet, 21% (95% CI = 18% to 25%) reported hearing impairment, and 22% (95% CI = 19% to 26%) reported tinnitus as major symptoms troubling them quite a bit or very much. Hearing impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 5.3, 95% CI = 3.0 to 9.2) and tinnitus (OR = 7.1, 95% CI = 4.1 to 12.4) were particularly common in the dose-intensive chemotherapy group compared with the no chemotherapy group. Men who were treated with radiotherapy had higher odds of self-reported paresthesias in feet compared with those not treated with radiotherapy (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.01 to 2.1, P = .04). Long-term survivors of testicular cancer who were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were more often troubled by dose-dependent neurological side effects and Raynaud-like phenomena compared with those who were not treated with chemotherapy.

[Recombinant human gapM1 expressed in Pichia pastoris and its anti-diabetic effect]. Adiponectin is an adipokine predominantly synthesized and secreted by adipocytes in the white adipose tissue, and it can lower the blood glucose level and increase free fatty acid oxidation. In the current study, we developed the globular domain of adiponectin (gapM1) to treat type II diabetes. In both flask and fermentor, we cultivated Pichia pastoris expressing recombinant gapM1 and established the purification procedure by using gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. To evaluate the biological activity of recombinant gapM1, we used rat type II diabetes model fed high-fat diet in combination with low-dose STZ (Streptozocin) induction. We purified 200 mg gapM1 with purity of 96% from 10 liters of supernatant. The recombinant gapM1 significantly lowered blood glucose (34.2%), serum triglyceride (79.6%) and total cholesterol (62.1%) in type II diabetes induced rat. Therefore, the recombinant human gapM1 is successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and effectively treated type II diabetes in rat models.

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: a case report. In this paper we report a case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, a rare abdominal tumour. A 72-year-old male with a medical history of heart disease presented to our Clinic because of pain in the right half of the abdomen. Diagnostic procedures, including clinical and laboratory examination, X-ray, ultrasonography and computed tomography, revealed a tumour in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The approximate size of the tumour size at initial detection was 7 cm. During the pre-operative procedure an evident growth of the tumour was noticed, indicating exploratory laparotomy. Intra-operative findings revealed a large tumour of the anterolateral abdominal wall, involving the greater omentum. Tumour resection was performed, as well as resection of the portion of the anterolateral abdominal wall and omentectomy. Postoperative immunohistochemical analysis revealed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

Understanding the key factors for enzymatic conversion of pretreated lignocellulose by partial least square analysis. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic substrates and enzyme digestion is still not well known. After different pretreatments, cellulase hydrolysis and measurements of physicochemical characteristics by column solute exclusion, particle size analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid state (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance were performed in this study. Partial least squares was then applied to seek the key factors limiting the rate and extent of cellulose digestion. According to the PLS results, the most important factor for cellulose digestion was accessible interior surface area, followed by delignification and the destruction of the hydrogen bonds. The cellulose digestion at 2 and 24 hr were improved with the increased accessibility of interior surface area to the reporter molecules of 5.1-nm diameter. Removal of lignin and breaking of hydrogen bonds were also found to significantly promote cellulose conversion. Other properties, including the breakdown of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, cellulose crystallinity, and hemicellulose content, had less effect on the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis.

Changes in the oral health of US children and adolescents and dental public health infrastructure since the release of the Healthy People 2010 Objectives. We examined progress in US children's oral health and dental public health infrastructure since the Healthy People 2010 Oral Health Objectives were issued. We summarize trends in the prevalence of dental caries and dental sealants on the basis of national and state-specific data. Trends in state oral health program activities, funding, and staffing were derived from annual surveys. The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth of children aged 2-4 years increased from 18% in 1988-1994 to 24% in 1999-2004. Racial disparities persisted in that age group, with caries significantly more prevalent among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children than among non-Hispanic white children. Caries prevalence in primary teeth of non-Hispanic white children aged 6-8 years remained unchanged, but increased among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. State-specific prevalence of caries among third-graders ranged from 40.6% to 72.2%. Caries in permanent teeth declined among children and adolescents, while the prevalence of dental sealants increased significantly. State oral health programs' funding and staffing remained modest, although the proportion of states with sealant programs increased 75% in 2000 to 85% in 2007 and the proportion with fluoride varnish programs increased from 13% to 53%. Progress toward improving the oral health of America during the past decade has been mixed. Greater attention to the oral health of young children is clearly needed, and child health professionals can be valuable partners in the effort. With continued high prevalence of a largely preventable disease, ongoing problems with access to basic oral health services, and increased national attention to health care reform, there is a clear need and opportunity for governments to make serious and sustained investments in dental public health.

The fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3 adapter is a developmentally regulated microtubule-associated protein expressed in migrating and differentiated neurons. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mediated signaling is essential to many aspects of neural development. Activated FGF receptors signal primarily through the FGF receptor substrate (Frs) adapters, which include Frs2/Frs2alpha and Frs3/Frs2beta. While some studies suggest that Frs3 can compensate for the loss of Frs2 in transfected cells, the lack of an effective Frs3 specific antibody has prevented efforts to determine the role(s) of the endogenous protein. To this end, we have generated a Frs3 specific antibody and have characterized the pattern of Frs3 expression in the developing nervous system, its subcellular localization as well as its biochemical properties. We demonstrate that Frs3 is expressed at low levels in the ventricular zone of developing cortex, between E12 and E15, and it co-localizes with nestin and acetylated alpha-tubulin in radial processes in the ventricular/subventricular zones as well as with betaIII tubulin in differentiated cortical neurons. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that endogenous Frs3 is both soluble and plasma membrane associated while Frs3 expressed in 293T cells associates exclusively with lipid rafts. Lastly, we demonstrate that neuronal Frs3 binds microtubules comparable to the microtubule-associated protein, MAP2, while Frs2 does not. Collectively, these data suggest that neuronal Frs3 functions as a novel microtubule binding protein and they provide the first biochemical evidence that neuronal Frs3 is functionally distinct from Frs2/Frs2alpha.

Tumor regression after systemic administration of a novel tumor-targeted gene delivery system carrying a therapeutic plasmid DNA. The possibility of using genes as medicines to treat cancer is limited by the lack of safe and efficacious delivery systems able to deliver therapeutic genes selectively to tumors by intravenous administration. We investigate if the conjugation of the polypropylenimine dendrimer to transferrin, whose receptors are overexpressed on numerous cancers, could result in a selective gene delivery to tumors after intravenous administration, leading to an increased therapeutic efficacy. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the targeting and therapeutic efficacies of a novel transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer. The intravenous administration of transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine polyplex resulted in gene expression mainly in the tumors. Consequently, the intravenous administration of the delivery system complexed to a therapeutic DNA led to a rapid and sustained tumor regression over one month, with long-term survival of 100% of the animals (90% complete response, 10% partial response).The treatment was well tolerated by the animals, with no apparent signs of toxicity. Transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine may thus be a promising gene delivery system for cancer therapy.

Refined methods for propagating vesicular stomatitis virus vectors that are defective for G protein expression. Propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors that encode a truncated G protein (VSV-Gstem) or lack the G gene entirely (VSV-DeltaG) are attractive vaccine vectors because they are immunogenic, cannot replicate and spread after vaccination, and do not express many of the epitopes that elicit neutralizing anti-VSV immunity. To consider advancing non-propagating VSV vectors towards clinical assessment, scalable technology that is compliant with human vaccine manufacturing must be developed to produce clinical trial material. Accordingly, two propagation methods were developed for VSV-Gstem and VSV-DeltaG vectors encoding HIV gag that have the potential to support large-scale production. One method is based on transient expression of G protein after electroporating plasmid DNA into Vero cells and the second is based on a stable Vero cell line that contains a G gene controlled by a heat shock-inducible transcription unit. Both methods reproducibly supported production of 1 x 10(7) to 1 x 10(8) infectious units (I.U.s) of vaccine vector per milliliter. Results from these studies also showed that optimization of the G gene is necessary for abundant G protein expression from electroporated plasmid DNA or from DNA integrated in the genome of a stable cell line, and that the titers of VSV-Gstem vectors generally exceeded VSV-DeltaG.

[Anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in mice of water and ethanol extracts of roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum]. To compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of the different water extracts which were prepared by regular decoction time or removing volatie oil and ethanol extracts which were prepared in different concentration ethanol of Xixin (the roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum), and then to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive mechanisms. Xylene-induced ICR mouse ear edema and hot plate test were utilized to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of Xixin at different dose level (water extracts of regular decoction time or removing volatie oil at the dose of 0.8 g x kg(-1) and 1.6 g x kg(-1); 95% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.91 g x kg(-1) and 1.82 g x kg(-1); 50% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.76 g x kg(-1) and 1.52 g x kg(-1)). Xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edema model was used to study the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. To reveal the anti-nociceptive mechanisms, mice were pretreated with naloxone in the hot plate test. The water extracts significantly reduced the weight of ear edema as compared with control group. Inhibition ratios were 43.20% and 63.69% at the higher dose, respectively. The ethanol extracts also significantly reduced the weight of ear edema and the inhibition ratios were 61.86% and 52. 56% at the higher dose, respectively. Mice administered water extracts delayed the latency times in the hot plate test. The anti-nociceptive effects of water extracts peaked at 2.0 h after i.g. administration. The hot plate latency times were increased by 51.27%, 62.78%, 60.08% and 68.00% at peak time, respectively. Regular decoction time group showed more significant effects in both models. The anti-inflammatory effect of 95% ethanol extracts was similar to 50% ethanol extracts. The water extracts were not effective in reducing xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edema. The anti-nociceptive effect of water extracts was blocked by naloxone. Both the water extracts and ethanol extracts of Xixin showed considerable anti-inflammatory potency against xylene induced inflammation. The water extracts produced anti-nociception in thermal model. The water extracts prepared in regular decoction time showed better anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Both the 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol extracts showed similarly anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effect of water extracts related to adrenal gland. The anti-nociceptive effect of water extracts was involved in activating opioid receptor.

[Acinic cell carcinoma of the nasal septum]. Nasal cavity acinic carcinoma are exceptional and often of turbinal origin. We report a case of acinic carcinoma of septal origin and discuss this histological type rare in this site. A 47-year-old women, with no pathologic history, consulted for right nasal obstruction and hyposmia having evolved for a year. The clinical examination revealed a right nasal cavity lesion adhesive to the septum. Tomodensitometry showed a right nasal cavity and ethmoid opacity without bone destruction. The surgical treatment was endonasal tumor resection. The histological examination revealed a nasal fossa acinic carcinoma completely resected. A postoperative radiotherapy was initiated. The evolution was uneventful without recurrence after 4 years of follow-up. Acinic carcinoma is rarely located in the nasal cavity. Its septal origin is exceptional. It is usually located at the salivary gland level. Curative treatment is surgery associated or not to radiotherapy. The prognosis is related to tumor extension and quality of resection.

[Enteral non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young age--difficult diagnosis]. Lately, we have been confronted with an increased number of malignant tumors of the large bowel, appearing at younger patients. Among all histopathologic forms of malignant colonic tumors treated in our Clinic, lymphoma is the fifth as frequency of apparition, respectively the fourth at patients less than 40 years old. We present the case of a 22-years-old patient, having colonic polyposis and multicentric non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the terminal ileum and ascending colon. This pathologic association represented for us an uncommon situation. The rest of malignant colonic tumors developed on patients with rectocolonic polyposis were adenocarcinoma.

Adherence to waiting-time targets for pediatric nephrology clinic referrals. Waiting times for specialist consultation have not been adequately studied, especially in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which pediatric nephrology subspecialty clinic referral waiting times are adhered to with regard to previously determined access targets. Referrals to the pediatric nephrology clinics at Children's Hospital, London, Ontario, Canada, received between October 2007 and November 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Appointment schedule was allotted by a nephrologist based on the patient's presenting complaint, reported in the referral, in accordance with the previously determined access targets. Adherence to access targets was assessed by the actual clinic visit. There were a total of 250 referrals during the timeframe studied. The median waiting time was 73 (range 0-193) days. Overall, 64% (159/250) of patients met their access target. The median time that patients waited over their access target was 6 (range 0-78) days. Of the patients who did not meet their access targets, 31% (28/91) exceeded their target by 20% or more. Office handling was a component for patients with access target <1 week, whereas availability of clinic space was the main reason for nonadherence to access targets.

Functional foods for health promotion: state-of-the-science on dietary flavonoids. Extended abstracts from the 12th Annual Conference on Functional Foods for Health Promotion, April 2009. The extended abstracts in this report are based on presentations from the 12(th) Special Conference on Functional Foods for Health Promotion, cosponsored by the North American branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI North America) Project Committee on Flavonoids and the American Society for Nutrition at the Experimental Biology meeting in April 2009. The theme of this year's special conference was "State-of-the-Science on Dietary Flavonoids." The conference began with a general introduction and overview of flavonoids and their presence in the diet as well as the estimated intake levels in the US population. Subsequent presentations addressed issues pertaining to study design and interpretation, mechanisms of action, and the potential health impacts related to inflammation, the vasculature, and the brain. The present summary of the current science indicates that dietary flavonoids, particularly flavanols, show promising potential for reducing cardiovascular disease risk via reduction of inflammation and improvement in vascular function. However, the existing data must be interpreted cautiously, with consideration given to the compound tested (i.e., parent or metabolite), the use of controls, and the practicality of the concentrations used. While more data are needed on the long-term health impacts of dietary flavonoids in humans, including the efficacious dose, current data indicate it may soon be possible to develop public health messages about flavonoid-rich foods.

Sequence-function correlation of aromatase and its interaction with reductase. Aromatase is an enzyme required for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Estrogens are female sex hormones involved in the development and growth of breast tumors. It has been of significant interest to investigate the structure-function relationship of aromatase since its inhibitors have shown great promise in fighting breast cancer. Aromatase belongs to the cytochrome P450 family, and forms an electron-transfer complex with its partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), during the aromatization reaction. Aromatase is found to be widely expressed in vertebrates with unique substrates androstenedione and testosterone, but with various catalytic capacities reflecting species differences in K(m), Vmax, etc. This report will summarize current progress in sequence-function correlation analysis of the aromatase protein family and molecular characterization of the interaction between aromatase and CPR. These studies may lead to a novel field for the development of new inhibitors which interfere with the interaction between aromatase and CPR in order to inhibit the aromatization reaction.

Data File Standard for Flow Cytometry, version FCS 3.1. The flow cytometry data file standard provides the specifications needed to completely describe flow cytometry data sets within the confines of the file containing the experimental data. In 1984, the first Flow Cytometry Standard format for data files was adopted as FCS 1.0. This standard was modified in 1990 as FCS 2.0 and again in 1997 as FCS 3.0. We report here on the next generation flow cytometry standard data file format. FCS 3.1 is a minor revision based on suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the standard is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type.The FCS 3.1 standard retains the basic FCS file structure and most features of previous versions of the standard. Changes included in FCS 3.1 address potential ambiguities in the previous versions and provide a more robust standard. The major changes include simplified support for international characters and improved support for storing compensation. The major additions are support for preferred display scale, a standardized way of capturing the sample volume, information about originality of the data file, and support for plate and well identification in high throughput, plate based experiments. Please see the normative version of the FCS 3.1 specification in Supporting Information for this manuscript (or at http://www.isac-net.org/ in the Current standards section) for a complete list of changes.


Screening of antimycotics in Swedish sewage treatment plants--waters and sludge.

Low molecular weight polyethylenimine cross-linked by 2-hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin coupled to peptide targeting HER2 as a gene delivery vector. Gene delivery is one of the critical steps for gene therapy. Non-viral vectors have many advantages but suffered from low gene transfection efficiency. Here, in order to develop new polymeric gene vectors with low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency, we synthesized a cationic polymer composed of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) of molecular weight of 600 Da cross-linked by 2-hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP gamma-CD) and then coupled to MC-10 oligopeptide containing a sequence of Met-Ala-Arg-Ala-Lys-Glu. The oligopeptide can target to HER2, the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which is often over expressed in many breast and ovary cancers. The new gene vector was expected to be able to target delivery of genes to HER2 positive cancer cells for gene therapy. The new gene vector was composed of chemically bonded HP gamma-CD, PEI (600 Da), and MC-10 peptide at a molar ratio of 1:3.3:1.2. The gene vector could condense plasmid DNA at an N/P ratio of 6 or above. The particle size of HP gamma-CD-PEI-P/DNA complexes at N/P ratios 40 was around 170-200 nm, with zeta potential of about 20 mV. The gene vector showed very low cytotoxicity, strong targeting specificity to HER2 receptor, and high efficiency of delivering DNA to target cells in vitro and in vivo with the reporter genes. The delivery of therapeutic IFN-alpha gene mediated by the new gene vector and the therapeutic efficiency were also studied in mice animal model. The animal study results showed that the new gene vector HP gamma-CD-PEI-P significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect on tumor-bearing nude mice as compared to PEI (25 kDa), HP gamma-CD-PEI, and other controls, indicating that this new polymeric gene vector is a potential candidate for cancer gene therapy.

Changes in antibiotic susceptibility and ribotypes in Clostridium difficile isolates from southern Scotland, 1979-2004. An increase in the incidence of clinical cases of Clostridium difficile infection has been reported in recent years, but few studies have examined changes in molecular epidemiology and antibiotic resistance over a long period of time. A collection of 179 isolates of C. difficile obtained from symptomatic adult patients in southern Scotland between 1979 and 2004 was used to determine changes in the prevalence of epidemiological types and antibiotic susceptibilities to common antibiotics. PCR ribotyping and MIC determination were performed on all isolates. A total of 56 different ribotypes were identified, among which ribotype 002 was the commonest type overall (14 .0%), followed by ribotypes 014 (7.3 %), 012 (5 .0%), 015 (5.0 %), 020 (5 .0%) and 001 (4.5 %). Ribotype 078 was also identified. The 10 commonest ribotypes comprised 55 % of the total isolates. Ribotype 001 increased in prevalence from 1.5 to 12.2 % over the study years, whereas the prevalence of ribotype 012 decreased from 8.7 to 2 .0%. Resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin and ceftriaxone was found in 95.5, 14.0 and 13.4 % of isolates, respectively. Resistance to vancomycin or metronidazole was not detected. Thirty-two (17.9 %) and 14 (7.8 %) isolates were resistant to two and three or more antibiotics, respectively. Ribotype 001 displayed maximum resistance, with 50 % of isolates resistant to erythromycin, moxifloxacin and ceftriaxone, and 100 % resistant to clindamycin. Over the 26 years of the study, antibiotic resistance and ribotype prevalence have changed, and antibiotic pressures may have been the major driver of this change.

Slavic Village: incorporating active living into community development through partnerships. The Slavic Village neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, is a diverse community of 30,524 residents that is struggling economically yet strong in tradition. The neighborhood is located just south of downtown and adjacent to the city's industrial valley. Slavic Village Development (SVD) works with local and state partners to improve the quality of life for its residents, including low-income and market-rate housing developments, economic development, community organizing, and greenspace planning. Using the Active Living by Design framework (ALbD), SVD developed strong partnerships to address preparation, promotions, programs, policy, and physical projects. Efforts were focused on Safe Routes to School, neighborhood activities, asset mapping, worksite wellness, and social marketing. The ALbD project changed both the physical environment of Slavic Village and its marketed image. The initiative built cross-disciplinary partnerships that leveraged individual strengths to implement strategies to make Slavic Village a vibrant, healthy, family-friendly neighborhood that promotes active living. There is a strong connection between health and community development. When partners from multiple disciplines work together on a common goal, it is easier to leverage resources and create change. Resource development will always be a challenge. Through the leadership of SVD and its strong ties in the community, the ALbD initiative has re-engaged residents and businesses in efforts to restore the vitality of the community. The partnership in Cleveland has successfully incorporated health into community development, a model of collaboration that can be replicated in other communities.


Fas-induced apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma is mediated by apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 via mitochondrial damage-dependent caspase-8 activation.

Functional but not structural networks of the human laryngeal motor cortex show left hemispheric lateralization during syllable but not breathing production. The laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) is indispensible for the vocal motor control of speech and song production. Patients with bilateral lesions in this region are unable to speak and sing, although their nonverbal vocalizations, such as laughter and cry, are preserved. Despite the importance of the LMC in the control of voluntary voice production in humans, the literature describing its connections remains sparse. We used diffusion tensor probabilistic tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based functional connectivity analysis to identify LMC networks controlling two tasks necessary for speech production: voluntary voice as repetition of two different syllables and voluntary breathing as controlled inspiration and expiration. Peaks of activation during all tasks were found in the bilateral ventral primary motor cortex in close proximity to each other. Functional networks of the LMC during voice production but not during controlled breathing showed significant left-hemispheric lateralization (p < 0.0005). However, structural networks of the LMC associated with both voluntary voice production and controlled breathing had bilateral hemispheric organization. Our findings indicate the presence of a common bilateral structural network of the LMC, upon which different functional networks are built to control various voluntary laryngeal tasks. Bilateral organization of functional LMC networks during controlled breathing supports its indispensible role in all types of laryngeal behaviors. Significant left-hemispheric lateralization of functional networks during simple but highly learned voice production suggests the readiness of the LMC network for production of a complex voluntary behavior, such as human speech.

Chronic neuropathic pain in women after breast cancer treatment. Chronic neuropathic pain affects between 20% and 50% of women after their breast cancer treatment. The Human Response to Illness (HRTI) model provides a comprehensive theoretic framework to guide the assessment and management of this pain in women with breast cancer. Knowledge of the physiologil, pathophysiologic, behavioral, and experiential perspectives, as well as personal and environmental factors, will assist nurses and other health care professionals to develop better assessment tools and improve interventions and treatment modalities. This will provide guidance for nursing practice, education, and research and ultimately improve the quality of life, optimize outcomes, and reduce the incidence of chronic neuropathic pain in the breast cancer population.

Prostate needle biopsy quality in reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events study: worldwide comparison of improvement with investigator training and centralized laboratory processing. To compare biopsy quality factors among study sites worldwide at entry and at year 2 in the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events study. The accuracy of prostate cancer detection is influenced by the length and number of biopsy cores. Biopsy quality factors at entry and at year 2 were compared for subjects enrolled from 6 geographic regions: North America, South America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Australia, and Africa. Investigator training was provided for prostate biopsy collection before year 2, emphasizing core length and number of cores obtained. Data were collected prospectively from 4649 subjects at entry and 6267 subjects at year 2. At entry, the aggregate length, number of cores, and mean length of cores differed significantly among regions. Aggregate length was longest in biopsies from Australia, and number of cores was highest from South America. At year 2, each region collected the protocol-required 10 cores, and aggregate length and mean length of cores were greater than for entry biopsies; site variance was reduced for all factors. There were significant differences in aggregate length, number of cores, and mean length of cores among regions at study entry. After investigator training by the study sponsor and use of a central laboratory for standardized processing, year 2 biopsies showed an increase in all 3 quality factors when compared with entry biopsies. Variance in biopsy quality can be reduced by investigator training and standardization of collection and processing, thereby optimizing detection of cancer. Biopsy quality may be a useful comparative measure in urologic practice.


Plasmodium vivax malaria in children: uncommon manifestations.

Hyperlipidemia in older adults. Older adults carry the highest risk for coronary artery disease and the highest burden of atherosclerosis. Although most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy have not specifically targeted older persons, growing evidence supports treatment of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in older patients, especially those at high risk for coronary events. The decision to treat a high or high-normal cholesterol level in an elderly individual must be individualized based on chronologic and physiologic age. This article summarizes current data on lipid-lowering therapy in older adults and the management of hyperlipidemia in elderly patients.

Assessment of the consensus about tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy among pediatricians and otolaryngologists. Several recent publications have shown that the current indications for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (T&A) in children vary considerably between and even within countries. The objective of our study is to present statistically valid information to surgeons and pediatricians, primary care physicians, and family physicians as key referral channels to the operation, whether there is consensus between pediatricians and otolaryngologists regarding the appropriateness of T&A. Six academic pediatricians and six otolaryngologists participated in the study. After otolaryngologists visited 200 patients, the cases were referred to a pediatrician who also visited the patients independently on the same day pre-operatively. They ranked the appropriateness of T&A on a numerical Likert scale from 0 (never indicated) to 9 (always indicated) in a questionnaire. Overall, 200 (102 boys and 98 girls) children with a mean age of 6.1+/-5.6 were enrolled in this study. Otolaryngologists and Pediatricians had agreed about the history of tonsillitis attacks in the previous 6 months and previous year. The patients provided them with the same history. The agreement between otolaryngologists and pediatrician's views about T&A was poor. This study can serve as an initial warning in developing a national community-based working group to prepare a transparent local guideline regarding T&A indications. More attention should focused the role of pediatricians, primary care physicians, and family physicians for more follow up and determining which patients will eventually need T&A.

Availability and comparability of human biomonitoring data across Europe: a case-study on blood-lead levels. Recently, it has become clear that the complexity of environmental health issues requires an approach that takes into account the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. An urgent issue that has surfaced is the need for accurate tools to better describe exposure characterization to environmental chemicals. By including human biomonitoring (HBM) data, a greater precision in exposure and associated risk estimates and more accurate dose-response relationships may be achieved. A restricting issue still is the availability of reliable and comparable HBM data. The aim of the current study was twofold: (1) to find out whether it is practically feasible to collect raw, individual HBM data across Europe; and (2) to evaluate the comparability and use of these HBM data for environmental health impact assessment at a European scale. Blood-lead (B-Pb) was selected as the chemical of choice because of its long history as an environmental pollutant in HBM programs and its known public health relevance. Through literature search and identification of HBM experts across Europe, HBM programs that measured B-Pb were identified and asked to share individual data on age, gender and B-Pb levels. Following this request, more than 20,000 individual data points from 8 European countries were collected. Analysing these data made clear that it is difficult to use disparate data collections because of the inherent variability with respect to the gender and age of participants and calendar-years sampled. When these confounders were taken however, there was no additional variability in B-Pb distributions among different countries. It was concluded that while it is possible to collect HBM data from different sources across Europe, the need to get data from comparable (sub-)populations is essential for appropriate use and interpretation of HBM data for environmental health impact assessment.

A true laparoscopic herniotomy in children: evaluation of long-term outcome. Thirteen years of experience with a laparoscopic technique mimicking, as closely as possible, the classical open technique are presented in this report. Consecutive laparoscopic herniotomies in 385 children (178 girls and 207 boys; age 0.13 to 16.8 years) with a total of 525 hernia repairs were included into a retrospective review. Overall, 95% of children were treated on a day-care basis; all operations were completed laparoscopically. Mean operation time was 32.1 minutes (26.2 for unilateral hernias and 34.5 for bilateral). In total, 10.1% of children presented with clinically bilateral hernias, whereas 29.2% of clinical unilateral hernias had a patent contralateral processus vaginalis. We discovered femoral hernias in 2.6% and direct inguinal hernias in 0.5% of the cases. In 79 cases, a concomitant of umbilical herniorraphy was performed. There were no cases of testicular malposition or atrophy. We had a 1% hernia recurrence rate. Cosmetic outcome was excellent. Laparoscopy provides the surgeon with a superior diagnostic tool, facilitating the diagnosis of any kind of inguinal hernia or controlateral patent processus vaginalis and its repair in the same session; surgery- and anesthesia-related stress is minimized. This makes it an interesting alternative to the open repair of inguinal hernias in children, providing an excellent view on the cord structures and leaving them, as well as the testis, untouched.

Atrophic enlargement of CSF volume after subarachnoid hemorrhage: correlation with neuropsychological outcome. Ventricular dilation and sulcal enlargement are common sequelae after aSAH. Our aim was to quantify the late ventricular dilation and volumes of the CSF spaces after aSAH and to determine if they correlate with neurologic and cognitive impairments frequently detected in these patients. 3D T1-weighted images needed for volumetry were available in 76 patients 1 year after aSAH, along with 75 neuropsychological assessments. Volumes of CSF segments and ICV were quantified by SPM in 76 patients and 30 control subjects to determine CSF/ICV ratios. The mCMI was calculated to roughly evaluate the ventricular dilation. The contributing factors for enlarged ventricles and CSF volumes were reviewed from radiologic, clinical, and neuropsychological perspectives. The mCMI was higher in patients with aSAH (0.23 +/- 0.06) compared with control subjects (0.20 +/- 0.04; P = .020). In line with these planimetric measurements, the SPM-based CSF/ICV ratios were higher in patients with aSAH (35.58 +/- 7.0) than in control subjects (30.36 +/- 6.25; P = .001). Preoperative hydrocephalus, higher HH and Fisher grades, and focal parenchymal lesions on brain MR imaging, but not the treatment technique, were associated with ventricular enlargement. The clinical outcome and presence of neuropsychological deficits correlated significantly with CSF enlargement. Ventricular and sulcal enlargement, together with reduced GM volumes, after aSAH may indicate general atrophy rather than hydrocephalus. Enlarged CSF spaces correlate with cognitive deficits after aSAH. A simple measure, mCMI proved to be a feasible tool to assess the diffuse atrophic brain damage after aSAH.

The glycemic and peak incremental indices of honey, sucrose and glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: effects on C-peptide level-a pilot study. Our study was a case-control cross-sectional study that was conducted on 20 children and adolescents suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus and ten healthy non-diabetic children and adolescents serving as controls. The mean age of patients was 10.95 years. Oral sugar tolerance tests using glucose, sucrose and honey and measurement of fasting and postprandial serum C-peptide levels were done for all subjects in three separate sittings. The glycemic index (GI) and the peak incremental index (PII) were then calculated for each subject. Honey, compared to sucrose, had lower GI and PII in both patients (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.05) groups. In the patients group, the increase in the level of C-peptide after using honey was not significant when compared with using either glucose or sucrose. However, in the control group, honey produced a significant higher C-peptide level, when compared with either glucose or sucrose. In conclusion, honey, because of its lower GI and PII when compared with sucrose, may be used as a sugar substitute in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Clinician experiences of employing the AmpliChip® CYP450 test in routine psychiatric practice. These findings are from a qualitative study examining clinician experiences of employing the AmpliChip® CYP450 test in psychiatric practice. One hundred tests were made available to secondary care mental health service clinicians commencing patient treatment with risperidone across three District Health Boards within New Zealand. Feedback was sought on clinicians' (n = 33) experiences of ordering the test and receiving results, utilization of results, and perceived advantages and disadvantages. Difficulties were reported regarding ordering the test and receiving the results; however, real or perceived advantages of employing the test results in practice were widely reported. Analysis of the ways in which the test results were reportedly utilized revealed that they generally played a supporting role with regard to dosing decisions, rather than being the main influence on clinician behaviour. The test itself, and subsequent results, was viewed as potentially useful in facilitating the development of the doctor-patient relationship. Reported disadvantages of the test included potential over-reliance at the expense of clinical wisdom, cost, and challenges inherent in introducing a new clinical procedure into routine practice. These findings indicate that psychiatric clinicians are receptive to employing this test as a clinical support tool if its implementation is carefully considered and economically justifiable.

Methodology for mapping non-forest wood elements using historic cadastral maps and aerial photographs as a basis for management. The objective of this study was to test a method for analysing long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a newly developed classification system and relevant landscape characteristics. Although these non-forest wood elements are biotopes that have positive effects for the ecological stability of the landscape little is known about their long-term dynamics. The newly developed knowledge of the historical impact of various landscape management practices on non-forest wood elements can be applied in landscape planning procedures (e.g. planning ecological networks) in order to ensure relevant landscape management in the future. The method was applied in two contrasting study sites, Honbice (244 ha) and Krida (268 ha), located in east Bohemia and north Bohemia, in the Czech Republic. The study was based on old cadastral maps (from 1839 to 1843), black and white aerial photographs (from 1938, 1950, 1966, 1975 to 2006) and field control data from 2006. At the Honbice study site, the proportion of non-forest wood elements increased from 2.0 to 2.9% of the study site, due to large plantations of scattered vegetation in the open landscape. On the other hand, more than half of the wood vegetation in the village was cut down between 1966 and 2006. In addition, the relative length of the tree alleys decreased from 0.021 km ha(-1) to 0.018 km ha(-1) between 1950 and 1966. At the Krida study site, there was a significant increase in non-forest vegetation (from 2.4 to 8.2%), due to abandonment of the landscape (former military area). As the village disappeared, the total amount of scattered vegetation grew, due to the natural succession process. The relative length of the tree alleys decreased from 0.009 km ha(-1) to 0.005 km ha(-1). The method that was applied and based on the analysis of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a (newly developed) classification system and relevant landscape characteristics has proved to be a suitable procedure for making a detailed description of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements in the landscape. The detailed classification system can be used most efficiently when it is applied to rather small territories. Some characteristics display a similar ability to describe changes in non-forest wood structures (e.g. relative length, proportion of the category).

Selection of RNA aptamers specific to active prostate-specific antigen. A counter-SELEX procedure with recombinant purified active prostate specific antigen (PSA) was used to identify specific RNA aptamers against the active PSA. We developed two different kinds of counter-SELEX methods; one includes pre-clearance step with inactive proPSA protein, and the other with tagged GST protein. After 9 iterative selection cycles, several identical RNA aptamers can be identified from both counter-SELEX methods. Real-time PCR analysis and gel retardation experiment showed that the aptamers have a specific binding activity against the active PSA, but not for GST or proPSA. These aptamers could be of potential use as specific diagnostic, imaging and/or therapeutic agents against prostate cancer.

[22q11.2 microdeletion]. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), most frequently caused by a de novo microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22, is one of the most common neurogenetic syndromes. The cognitive and behavioral characteristics associated with the 22q11.2 phenotype can be quite heterogeneous, part of the reason the syndrome is often detected very late, if at all. Though in individuals with more severe cardiac, respiratory, or speech and language problems, 22q11DS is more easily detected at a young age. The cognitive profile in 22q11DS varies between borderline IQ and mild mental retardation. Less than half children have mental retardation but a majority suffer from learning difficulties. It is also typically characterized by a verbal-visual dissociation, with verbal abilities higher than visuo-spatial and abstract reasoning. Psychiatric comorbidity is also frequent in 22q11DS, and the presence of psychotic symptoms in pre-adolescence may be unique to the syndrome. In older adolescents and young adults, social withdrawal often becomes more intense and can be an indicator of psychiatric disorder. Neuroimaging studies in 22q11DS indicate different patterns of structural alterations in affected children and adults that directly relate to cognitive impairments in the syndrome. For these reasons, we believe that treatment of persons affected by 22q11DS should include periodic evaluations and frequent clinical check-ups that integrate recommendations for medical, speech, psychiatric, and academic problems.

Neurophysiological monitoring in spinal cord surgery. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) during spine surgery consists of several functional tests including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), motor evoked potentials (MEPs), dermatomal potentials (DPs) and EMG (electromyography). Permanent neurological damage after spine surgery performed without intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is frequent and often very costly. The main goal of IOM is the immediate detection, prevention and correction of neurological damage during surgery, which may go unnoticed without using these tests. A total of 351 clinical files of patients with spinal surgery and continuous neurophysiological monitoring were transversally and descriptively reviewed from 2007 to 2008. There were 135 male patients (38.46%) and 216 female patients (61.54%); 82% of the cases were osteodiscal pathology with or without medullar involvement, 12% were patients with traumatic injuries, 4% with scoliosis and 2% had medullary tumors. Regarding localization, 62.1% were lumbar, 33% cervical, 4.3% thoracic and 0.5% sacral involvement; 12.4% of our cases showed significant improvement of the basal responses on SSEPs, and 56.8% showed no significant change during the procedure. In 28.4% of the cases, the surgical team had to be advised of potential neurological damage and in 2.4% there was absence of neurophysiological responses. No patient showed complete loss of any neurophysiological response. All patients reported clinical improvement after hospital discharge. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring may help avoid certain neurological risks during spine surgery, which may go unnoticed without the use of this technique.


Household water treatment in developing countries: comparing different intervention types using meta-regression.

[Matrix metalloproteases as molecular markers in gastric cancer]. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in the world. Prognosis in patients with gastric cancer is difficult to establish because it is commonly diagnosed when gastric wall invasion and metastasis have occurred. Currently, some members of the extracellular matrix metalloproteinases have been identified, whose expression in gastric tumor tissue is significantly elevated compared to healthy gastric tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases are 24 zinc-dependent endopeptidases that catalyze the proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. This degradation allows the cancer cells invade the surrounding stroma and trigger metastasis. Upregulation of certain matrix metalloproteinases in gastric cancer has been associated with a poor prognosis and elevated invasive capacity. This review compiles evidence about the genetic expression of matrix metalloproteinases in gastric cancer and their role in tumour invasion and metastasis, emphasizing their potential as molecular markers of prognosis.

Methionine metabolism in human pregnancy. Hyperhomocysteinemia during pregnancy, which is a consequence of perturbations in methionine and/or folate metabolism, has been implicated in adverse outcomes such as neural tube defects, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery. The adaptive changes in methionine metabolism during pregnancy in humans have not been determined. Our objective was to examine the kinetics of methionine and its rate of transsulfuration and transmethylation in healthy women with advancing gestation. The whole-body rate of appearance (Ra) of methionine and phenylalanine was measured in healthy pregnant women during the first (n = 10), second (n = 5), and third (n = 10) trimesters of pregnancy. These data were compared with those for nonpregnant women (n = 8). Tracers [1-(13)C]methionine, [C(2)H(3)]methionine, and [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine were administered as prime-constant rate infusions. The effect of enteral high-protein, mixed-nutrient load on tracer-determined variables was also examined. In pregnant women, the Ra of phenylalanine was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the first trimester than in the second and third trimesters and was significantly lower than that in nonpregnant women. A linear positive correlation was evident between gestational age and phenylalanine Ra. The fractional rate and total rate of transsulfuration of methionine was significantly (P < 0.05) higher during the first trimester, whereas the rate of transmethylation was higher during the third trimester. Plasma concentrations of total cysteine and homocysteine were lower during pregnancy. Uncomplicated pregnancy in humans is associated with a higher rate of transsulfuration early in gestation and a higher rate of transmethylation of methionine in late gestation. These data may have implications for understanding the role of methionine and homocysteine in complications of pregnancy and for the nutritional care of pregnant women.


The effect of traumatic bereavement on tsunami-exposed survivors.

Immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific antigen ESAT-6 among south Indians. The 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) is a T-cell antigen recognized by individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of the study was to identify "protective epitopes" of ESAT-6 protein in the south Indian population. Proliferative and Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) responses to ESAT-6 peptides were studied by flow cytometry and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Healthy household contacts (HHC) recognized Esp1 (10/17) and Esp6 (9/17) peptides. Among pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTB), Esp1 (3/11) and Esp6 (5/11) were recognized. Maximal response (7/10) was found for Esp1 and Esp8 in treated patients (TR). Median values for the responding subjects gave the following results: Esp1 (76pg/ml), Esp6 (64pg/ml), induced IFN-gamma production in HHC; PTB gave low IFN-gamma responses for the peptides. TR responded to the peptides Esp1 (141pg/ml), Esp8 (102pg/ml). The proliferation of CD4 cells was similar in both PTB and TR for all peptides; but HHC showed an increase for Esp1 (p<0.05) and Esp6 (p<0.01). Esp1 (amino acids aa 1-20) and Esp6 (aa 51-70) were the immunogenic peptides recognized by the alleles HLA DRB1*04 and HLA DRB1*10 among HHC. But the association of the alleles with ESAT-6 peptide presentation needs to be confirmed in a large cohort of subjects. We speculate that ESAT-6 can be used along with other immune-eliciting proteins for vaccine design strategies in south Indian population.

Thermometry and calorimetry assessment of sweat response during exercise in the heat. Our objective was to characterise sweat rate responses in a hot environment during rest and subsequent increasing levels of exercise in relation to thermometrically (i.e., rectal, tympanic, mean skin and mean body temperatures) and calorimetrically derived (i.e., change in body heat storage) thermal parameters. Ten healthy males volunteered and entered an environmental chamber set at 42 degrees C. Participants rested seated during their first hour inside the chamber. Thereafter, they exercised to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer at 20 W with step increments of 20 W h(-1). Across time, fluctuations in sweat rate were systematically associated with similar fluctuations in the integral of body heat storage (t = 13.16, P < 0.001), but not rectal (t = 0.98, P > 0.05), tympanic (t = 0.81, P > 0.05), mean skin (t = 0.12, P > 0.05), or mean body (t = 0.93, P > 0.05) temperatures. In addition, 95% limits of agreement and regression analyses showed that the changes in sweat rate demonstrated the highest agreement and strongest associations with changes in the integral of body heat storage. It is concluded that in a hot environment during rest and subsequent increasing levels of exercise sweat rate is associated with the cumulative changes in the rate of body heat storage.


Interobserver agreement between on-call radiology residents and radiology specialists in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism using computed tomography pulmonary angiography.

Postpartum increase of serum thioredoxin concentrations and the relation to CD8 lymphocytes. There are few data on oxidative stresses during and after pregnancy, although aggravation of autoimmune disease is implicated in oxidative stress and occurs frequently in the postpartum period. Thioredoxin (TRX) is a stress-inducible protein, and is used as a good biomarker for oxidative stress. To clarify the changes in the levels of oxidative stress during and after pregnancy, we examined serum TRX levels and the numbers of lymphocyte subsets. We measured serum TRX levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and neutrophils, lymphocytes, and CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes by flow cytometry in peripheral blood from 88 healthy pregnant women, 26 just after delivery women, 77 healthy postpartum women and 19 healthy non-pregnant women. The serum levels of TRX did not change during pregnancy, but increased in four, seven and 10 months postpartum. Serum TRX levels were correlated with the percentages of neutrophils in normal non-pregnant women and women one month postpartum, and with those of CD8 lymphocytes in early pregnant women and women one and four months postpartum. Oxidative stress increased in the postpartum period, and the levels at one and four months postpartum were related to CD8 lymphocytes.


Long-term effects of dietary sodium intake on cytokines and neurohormonal activation in patients with recently compensated congestive heart failure.

Systolic blood pressure at admission as a predictor of the response to initial carperitide therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), the role of initial vasodilator therapy remains uncertain. The present study aimed to evaluate the acute efficacy of initial carperitide therapy and to predict its response in ADHF patients with LVSD. Twenty-four consecutive patients with ADHF and LVSD were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, systolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mm Hg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >or=18 mm Hg at baseline. Hemodynamic parameters were evaluated by right heart catheterization before and after carperitide infusion. Responders were defined as a >or=30% reduction of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or a decrease to < 16 mm Hg within 6 h after carperitide infusion. Seventeen (71%) of the 24 patients were responders for initial carperitide therapy. The responders had significantly higher systolic BP and cardiac index at baseline compared with nonresponders. The area under the curve (AUC) for systolic BP was 0.93 and a cut-off value of 120 mm Hg had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 86% for predicting the efficacy of carperitide. The AUC for the cardiac index was 0.88 and a cut-off value of 2.30 L/min/m(2) had a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 100% for predicting the response to carperitide. The initial use of carperitide therapy safely reduces PCWP in ADHF patients with LVSD and baseline systolic BP may be useful for predicting the response to initial carperitide therapy for ADHF with LVSD.

Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin. Two series of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. Compounds 4j and 4k were the most potent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which were comparable to those of clarithromycin and azithromycin. Compounds 4d, 4h and 4i showed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and compounds 4h and 4i displayed greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. Compound 7c exhibited improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm and mef genes.

An ancient light-harvesting protein is critical for the regulation of algal photosynthesis. Light is necessary for photosynthesis, but its absorption by pigment molecules such as chlorophyll can cause severe oxidative damage and result in cell death. The excess absorption of light energy by photosynthetic pigments has led to the evolution of protective mechanisms that operate on the timescale of seconds to minutes and involve feedback-regulated de-excitation of chlorophyll molecules in photosystem II (qE). Despite the significant contribution of eukaryotic algae to global primary production, little is known about their qE mechanism, in contrast to that in flowering plants. Here we show that a qE-deficient mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, npq4, lacks two of the three genes encoding LHCSR (formerly called LI818). This protein is an ancient member of the light-harvesting complex superfamily, and orthologues are found throughout photosynthetic eukaryote taxa, except in red algae and vascular plants. The qE capacity of Chlamydomonas is dependent on environmental conditions and is inducible by growth under high light conditions. We show that the fitness of the npq4 mutant in a shifting light environment is reduced compared to wild-type cells, demonstrating that LHCSR is required for survival in a dynamic light environment. Thus, these data indicate that plants and algae use different proteins to dissipate harmful excess light energy and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage.


Serologic survey for toxoplasmosis in domestic birds from the Czech Republic.

A lethal ovitrap-based mass trapping scheme for dengue control in Australia: II. Impact on populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Cairns, Australia, the impacts on Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) populations of two types of 'lure & kill' (L&K) lethal ovitraps (LOs), the standard lethal ovitrap (SLO) and the biodegradable lethal ovitrap (BLO) were measured during three mass-trapping interventions. To assess the efficacy of the SLO, two interventions (one dry season and one wet season) were conducted in three discrete areas, each lasting 4 weeks, with the following treatments: (i) SLOs (>200 traps, approximately 4/premise), BG-sentinel traps (BGSs; approximately 15, 1/premise) and larval control (container reduction and methoprene treatment) and (ii) larval control alone, and (iii) untreated control. Female Ae. aegypti populations were monitored for 4 weeks pre- and post-treatment in all three areas using BGSs and sticky ovitraps (SOs) or non-lethal regular ovitraps (ROs). In the dry season, 206 SLOs and 15 BGSs set at 54 and 15 houses, respectively, caught and killed an estimated 419 and 73 female Ae. aegypti, respectively. No significant decrease in collection size of female Ae. aegypti could be attributed to the treatments. In the wet season, 243 SLOs and 15 BGSs killed approximately 993 and 119 female Ae. aegypti, respectively. The mean number of female Ae. aegypti collected after 4 weeks with SOs and BGSs was significantly less than the control (LSD post-hoc test). The third mass-trapping intervention was conducted using the BLO during the wet season in Cairns. For this trial, three treatment areas were each provided with BLOs (>500, approximately 4/premise) plus larval control, and an untreated control area was designated. Adult female Ae. aegypti were collected for 4 weeks pre- and post-treatment using 15 BGSs and 20 SOs. During this period, 53.2% of BLOs contained a total of 6654 Ae. aegypti eggs. Over the intervention period, collections of Ae. aegypti in the treatment areas were significantly less than in the control area for BGSs but not SOs. An influx of relatively large numbers of young females may have confounded the measurement of changes in populations of older females in these studies. This is an important issue, with implications for assessing delayed action control measures, such as LOs and parasites/pathogens that aim to change mosquito age structure. Finally, the high public acceptability of SLOs and BLOs, coupled with significant impacts on female Ae. aegypti populations in two of the three interventions reported here, suggest that mass trapping with SLOs and BLOs can be an effective component of a dengue control strategy.

Prediction of post-operative necrosis after mastectomy: a pilot study utilizing optical diffusion imaging spectroscopy.

Onset of exercise training 14 days after uncomplicated myocardial infarction: a randomized controlled trial. Exercise training is an important part of cardiac rehabilitation to reduce morbidity and mortality. Low-intensity exercise training can start as soon as the myocardial infarction (MI) patient is stable. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of an early start of exercise training in MI patients. A randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine MI patients were randomized to either an early start of exercise training group (EG) or to a delayed start control group (CG). The EG participated in an outpatient low-intensity EG (phase 2a) two times a week for 4 weeks before entering ordinary exercise training of moderate-to-high intensity (phase 2b). CG entered phase 2b directly after 4 weeks of delay. Primary outcome measure was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and after 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measure was health-related quality of life. VO2peak did not change from baseline to 4 weeks, either in EG [30.6+/-6.7 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, not significant (NS)] or CG (29.8+/-6.1 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, NS). After 16 weeks VO2peak increased in both groups to 33.1+/-7.1 ml/kg/min in EG (P<0.005) and 33.0 ml/kg/min+/-8.6 in CG (P<0.005), group differences NSH. Health-related quality of life increased in every domain but physical functioning for both groups (group differences NS). An early start of exercise training did not increase VO2peak compared to 4 weeks of delay. For low-risk patients with high motivation for exercise training, home-based walking is an option as a moderate start of cardiac rehabilitation the first weeks after MI.

ZAP-70 intron1 DNA methylation status: determination by pyrosequencing in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The role of co-culture systems on developmental competence of preimplantation mouse embryos against pH fluctuations. To determine the effect of pH fluctuations of culture media, and the role of co-culture systems on embryo development. Mouse embryos were incubated in phosphate buffered solutions (PBSs) with different pH for various lengths of time. After 3 h incubation of embryos at various pH, the embryos were transferred into four media with human (HEF) and mouse (MEF) embryonic fibroblast cells, and without feeder cells; HTF and MEM-alpha. Developmental rate at day three (morula), four (expanded blastocyst) and five (hatching or hatched blastocyst) was evaluated. Developmental rate at day three, four and five decreased when the incubation time at pH 6.2 and 8 increased to 3 h and more. In addition, significantly less embryos incubated at pH 6.2 and 8 developed to hatching and hatched blastocysts compared with pH 7.35. Embryos incubated at pH 6.2, co-cultured with MEF or HEF showed a significant improvement (P < 0.05) at day three in HEF compared to HTF, and at day five in MEF compared to HTF. At pH 8, a significant improvement (P < 0.05) was observed at day five in HEF and MEF compared to MEM-alpha. Mouse 2-cell embryos could tolerate minor pH fluctuations, but that major pH changes affect subsequent development. Besides, feeder cells could improve embryo development, especially when embryos are prone to rise or fall in pH.

Surfing the wave, cycle, life history, and genes/proteins expressed by testicular germ cells. Part 3: developmental changes in spermatid flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet and interaction of sperm with the zona pellucida and egg plasma membrane. Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.

[Usefulness of pathological diagnosis for two cases of candidal onychomycosis]. We report two cases of candidal onychomycosis with severe nail deformities. Case 1: The patient was an 81-year-old man who complained of onycholysis and nail deformity of the right forefinger nail which had occurred over a period of a year. He had no obvious previous illness. Case 2: The patient was an 81-year-old woman who complained of nail deformity with periungual erythema which had occurred over a period of several months. She had been treated with oral corticosteroid for bronchial asthma and with Ca blocker for hypertension for a long period. The initial KOH-prepared direct microscopy in each case failed to detect any spores or pseudohyphae. Therefore, an incisional biopsy was performed in both cases. Histopathological findings demonstrated numerous fungal elements with similar appearance of dermatophytes in the middle to lower level of the horny cell layer by PAS and Grocott staining in each case. Candida albicans was isolated and identified by cultivation on ATG agar. In case 1, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) was administered for 14 weeks, which was effective clinically and mycologically. In case 2, however, a coadministered drug (Ca blocker), oral terbinafine (125 mg/day) was not effective mycologically. Therefore, after having changed the antihypertensive agent, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) was administered for 16 weeks, which was effective clinically and mycologically.

Esophageal mucosal injury with low-dose aspirin and its prevention by rabeprazole. Aspirin is used widely as an antithrombotic drug for the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Although aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal mucosal injury, the effect on esophageal mucosa is unclear. This study investigates whether aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury and whether a proton-pump inhibitor can prevent such injury in relation to CYP2C19 genotypes. Fifteen healthy Japanese volunteers are dosed for 7 days in a 5-way randomly crossover trial: placebo, aspirin 100 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, and aspirin 100 mg plus rabeprazole 10 mg either once daily or 4 times per day. All subjects undergo endoscopy and 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on day 7. With the aspirin regimen, esophageal mucosal disorders occur in 7 patients (46.7%) (5, grade M; 2, grade A). The median 24-hour pH differs significantly among subjects who develop grade M or A gastroesophageal reflux disease and those who do not develop gastroesophageal reflux disease; the median pH in grade A gastroesophageal reflux disease is significantly lower (1.5 [range, 1.1-1.9]) than that in patients without gastroesophageal reflux disease (5.6 [range, 0.8-8.4], P = .04). Rabeprazole significantly inhibits acid secretion irrespective of CYP2C19 genotypes and decreases the incidence of aspirin-related esophageal injury and symptoms according to increasing pH value. Aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury in an acid-dependent manner. Concomitant proton-pump inhibitor therapy may prevent advanced effects of low-dose aspirin.

Ethnic differences in the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ethnic differences in warfarin maintenance doses have been documented amongst the three major Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay and Indian) in Singapore. Studies have shown that cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) polymorphisms alone did not entirely account for these differences. Recent reports suggest that VKORC1 (subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase) haplotypes are more predictive of warfarin response. Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling techniques were employed to characterise the PK and PD of warfarin in a healthy volunteer study of 16 Chinese and Indian subjects following a single 25 mg dose of warfarin. To further investigate the underlying differences in warfarin response, a semi-mechanistic modelling approach (using an indirect response model for PCA activity) incorporating the vitamin K cycle was attempted using population methods with Bayesian inference. All eight Indian subjects had H7H7 VKORC1 haplotypes and three had either *2/wt or *3/wt CYP2C9 genotypes. Six Chinese subjects had H1H1 VKORC1 haplotypes and one had H1H7. All Chinese subjects were homozygous wt/wt for CYP2C9. Simulations to steady state were performed to examine warfarin response in subjects with different CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms. The presence of a single *2 or *3 CYP2C9 allele reduced mean [SE (standard error)] S-warfarin clearance by 35% from 0.276 (0.04) to 0.180 (0.11) l/h. Subjects with VKORC1 haplotype groups of H7H7 had increased mean (SE) C (50,S) (concentration of S-warfarin required to achieve 50% of maximum effect) of 479 (7.3) compared to 206 (6.7) ng/ml in subjects with the H1H1 groups. For subjects with the H1H7 haplotype, mean (SE) C (50,S) increased 1.4 times to 288 (1.3) ng/ml compared to subjects with H1H1 haplotypes. Steady state simulations showed that whilst CYP2C9 polymorphisms affect the PK of warfarin, VKORC1 haplotypes may be better predictors of warfarin response. Since 90% of Chinese subjects had the VKORC1 H1 haplotype and 100% of Indian subjects the H7 haplotype in this study, ethnic differences in warfarin response in this study appear to be linked to differences in VKORC1 haplotypes.

Influence of amide versus ester linkages on the properties of eight-armed PEG-PLA star block copolymer hydrogels. Water-soluble eight-armed poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-lactide) star block copolymers linked by an amide or ester group between the PEG core and the PLA blocks (PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) and PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8)) were synthesized by the stannous octoate catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of l-lactide using an amine- or hydroxyl-terminated eight-armed star PEG. At concentrations above the critical gel concentration, thermosensitive hydrogels were obtained, showing a reversible single gel-to-sol transition. At similar composition PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels were formed at significantly lower polymer concentrations and had higher storage moduli. Whereas the hydrolytic degradation/dissolution of the PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8) takes place by preferential hydrolysis of the ester bond between the PEG and PLA block, the PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels degrade through hydrolysis of ester bonds in the PLA main chain. Because of their relatively good mechanical properties and slow degradation in vitro, PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels are interesting materials for biomedical applications such as controlled drug delivery systems and matrices for tissue engineering.

Growth pattern analysis of sphenoid wing meningiomas. Complete resection is crucial for the management of sphenoid wing meningiomas (SWM). We hypothesized that specific anatomical growth patterns are predictive for recurrence and worse prognosis. We therefore analyzed the extension patterns of SWM and correlated them with intraoperative findings, extent of resection and recurrence rate. MRI and CT scans were utilized to analyze soft tissue and bone extension, respectively. Soft tissue extension was quantified using four, bone infiltration using eight anatomical landmarks. The extent of resection was graded according to the Simpson classification (grade I-V). Finally,the growth pattern analysis was correlated with recurrence rate. We included 44 patients, 37 female (84.1%) and 7 male (15.9%). Tumor recurrence was observed in 13 patients (29.5%). Patients with recurrent tumors had a significantly worse Simpson score (p=0.01). Soft tissue spread into the cavernous sinus and bony infiltration of the superior orbital fissure was associated with a poor Simpson grade (p=0.001). Bony infiltration of the orbital roof superior orbital fissure was highly predictive for tumor recurrence (p=0.002). Structured radiological and anatomical analysis of the SWM growth pattern may influence the surgical strategy and facilitate the management and prognostication of patients with SWM.

Analysis of a post-translational steroid induction system for GIGANTEA in Arabidopsis. To investigate the link between the flowering time gene GIGANTEA (GI) and downstream genes, an inducible GI system was developed in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. Transgenic Arabidopsis plant lines were generated with a steroid-inducible post-translational control system for GI. The gene expression construct consisted of the coding region of the GI protein fused to that of the ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This fusion gene was expressed from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and was introduced into plants carrying the gi-2 mutation. Application of the steroid dexamethasone (DEX) was expected to result in activation of the GI-GR protein and its relocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Application of DEX to the transgenic plant lines rescued the late flowering phenotype conferred by the gi-2 mutation. However, despite their delayed flowering in the absence of steroid, the transgenic lines expressed predicted GI downstream genes such as CONSTANS (CO) to relatively high levels. Nevertheless, increased CO and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcript accumulation was observed in transgenic plants within 8 h of DEX treatment compared to controls which was consistent with promotion of flowering by DEX. Unlike CO and FT, there was no change in the abundance of transcript of two other putative GI downstream genes HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN 3A (HAP3A) or TIMING OF CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 1 (TOC1) after DEX application. The post-translational activation of GI and promotion of flowering by steroid application supports a nuclear role for GI in the floral transition. Known downstream flowering time genes CO and FT were elevated by DEX treatment, but not other proposed targets HAP3A and TOC1, indicating that the expression of these genes may be less directly regulated by GI.


[Pathogenesis of chronic acalculous cholecystitis in inhabitants of the Republic of Chuvashia].

The hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin is required to protect transactivator-promoter complexes from destabilization by the proteasomal ATPases. Mono-ubiquitylation of a transactivator is known to promote transcriptional activation of certain transactivator proteins. For the Sacchromyces cerevisiae transactivator, GAL4, attachment of mono-ubiquitin prevents destabilization of the DNA-transactivator complex by the ATPases of the 26S proteasome. This inhibition of destabilization depends on the arrangement of ubiquitin; a chain of ubiquitin tetramers linked through lysine 48 did not display the same protective effect as mono-ubiquitin. This led to an investigation into the properties of ubiquitin that may be responsible for this difference in activity between the different forms. We demonstrate the ubiquitin tetramers linked through lysine 63 do protect from proteasomal-mediated destabilization. In addition, we show that the mutating the isoleucine residue at position 44 interferes with proteasomal interaction in vitro and will abolish the protective activity in vivo. Together, these data implicate the hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin as required to protect transactivators from destabilization by the proteasomal ATPases.


Stimulation-induced dyskinesia in the early stage after subthalamic deep brain stimulation.

2-methoxyestradiol inhibits atorvastatin-induced rounding of human vascular smooth muscle cells. The cardiovascular benefits of statins, including atorvastatin (ATV), have been reported to be gender-dependent, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study we examine whether estrogen and its metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), affect the rounding response of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) induced by ATV. Twenty-four hour treatment with ATV (10-100 microM) induced rounding of cultured human SMCs. Addition of 2ME (1-20 microM), but not 17beta-estradiol, for 2 h induced re-spreading of rounded cells. Our further studies showed that the effects of 2ME were mimicked by microtubule-disrupting drugs and inhibited by taxol. Inhibition of RhoA and ROCK (Rho-kinase) by C3-toxin and H-1152, respectively, blocked 2ME effects. 2ME effects were also blocked by treatment with either actin-interfering drugs, such as cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide, or myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. ML-7 and -9, the inhibitors for myosin light chain kinase, inhibited 2ME effect as well. ATV treatment induced a decrease of F-actin content and Thr18/Ser19 dual phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), which was rescued by 2ME or mevalonate. The rescue effects of 2ME on F-actin content and MRLC dual phosphorylation were abolished by taxol or H-1152. In addition, kinesin Eg5 inhibitor monastrol and dynein inhibitor erythro-9-3-(2-hydroxynonyl) adenine (EHNA) significantly blocked 2ME effects. Finally, our results revealed that 2ME inhibited the migration of SMCs induced by ATV (0.1 microM) in wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. In summary, our data show that 2ME, but not estrogen, inhibits ATV-induced rounding of human SMCs through induction of microtubule disassembly and activation of the Rho-ROCK-actinomyosin pathway.


Perspective: Physician leadership in quality.

Leveraging neighborhood-scale change for policy and program reform in Buffalo, New York. The Healthy Communities Initiative (HCI) affects 8500 employees working in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and 8925 residents of adjacent neighborhoods, where 37% of people live below the poverty line, and a majority (68.7%) identify themselves as African-American. The HCI partnership, which includes multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary organizations and neighborhood residents, implemented the Active Living by Design community action model with greatest emphasis on achieving policy and planning changes to support active living behaviors. The master plan of the campus now incorporates active living as a guiding principle. Physical improvements to support walking and bicycling in the target area have been planned and implemented through a $14 million federal transportation grant. The partnership facilitated the creation of a citywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Board and the passage and implementation of an ordinance to enhance bicycling infrastructure within the city. Buffalo's experience suggests that to achieve lasting environmental change in the context of a medical campus and its surrounding neighborhoods, it is critical to: (1) engage neighborhood residents from the outset to build social capital; (2) cultivate a diverse partnership; (3) use a comprehensive approach; (4) balance long-term goals with short-term accomplishments; (5) integrate active living concerns within existing policy and planning mandates; and (6) make sustainability a priority. Environmental changes in the public domain that support active living require collaboration among public, nonprofit, and private sectors; citizen engagement; and the presence of a legal and structural framework provided by government policies and plans to direct future development.

Animals to heal animals: ethnoveterinary practices in semiarid region, northeastern Brazil. Animal-based remedies constitute an integral part of Traditional Medicine and this is true in Brazil as well both in rural and urban areas of the country. Due to its long history, zootherapy has in fact become an integral part of folk medicine in the country. The use of these natural resources for medical purposes, however, is not restricted to human diseases treatment, being also widely used for the treatment of animal illnesses. Ethnoveterinary is a science that involves the popular practical knowledge used to treat and prevent animal diseases. This study documents ethnoveterinary practices in one local semi-arid region in Northeast Brazil and discusses the findings in the surveyed area. Information was obtained through the use of semi-structured questionnaires. A total of 20 respondents (09 men and 11 women) provided information on animal species and body parts used as medicine, information concerning the illnesses to which the remedies were prescribed were also obtained. Eleven animal species were used in the treatment of 11 diseases in the surveyed area. The species inventoried comprise 3 taxonomic categories: mammals (05), reptiles (04) and birds (02). The obtained results proves that the use of animals or their derived products as therapeutic resources to the treatment of animal diseases represent a common practice and is culturally important in the studied area. It is evident that the popular knowledge about the ethnoveterinary practices is, frequently, passed through generations. We also noticed that, besides the cultural aspects, the socio-economic context permeates the use of zootherapics, since these practices constitute an alternative to the medicines acquired in veterinarian pharmacies, which have a high cost.

Rate determination and distribution of anammox activity in activated sludge treating swine wastewater. This paper presents a quantitative investigation and analysis of anammox activity in sludge taken from biological swine wastewater treatment plants. An incubation experiment using a (15)N tracer technique showed anammox activity in sludge taken from 6 out of 13 plants with the rate ranging from 0.0036 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h to 3.1 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h, and in a biofilm with the highest activity at 25.8 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h. It is notable that 9 out of 11 sludges in which the pH was maintained between 6.6 and 8.1 retained anammox activity, while those with either a lower or higher pH did not. Moreover, anammox-positive sludge had a significantly higher concentration of NO(2)(-)-N plus NO(3)(-)-N than did anammox-negative sludge. A significant difference was not observed between anammox-positive and -negative sludge regarding BOD/NH(4)(+)-N in the influent, DO concentration in aeration tanks, and the concentrations of NH(4)(+)-N, free nitric acid, and free ammonia.

[Production of cloned goats by transfer of nuclei from transfected caprine mammary gland epithelial cells]. In this study, we evaluated the development potential of caprine mammary gland epithelial cells (CMGECs) after transfection and nuclear transfer into enucleated, ovulated oocytes. We first isolated CMGECs from udders of lactating goats which were transfected with expression plasmid for human lacterrin and selected by G418. Then we chose sixteen neomycin resistant lines and induced them with prolactin for the expression of human lactoferrin checked by Western blotting. The donor cells, expressing human lactoferrin of 75 kD, were fused and activated with enucleated ovulated oocytes. Pronuclear-stage reconstructed embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 16 recipient goats. There were fourteen (87.5%), thirteen (81.3%), and ten (62.5%) pregnancies confirmed pregnant by ultrasound on Day 30, 60, and 90, respectively. Three recipients carried the pregnancies to term and delivered one goat each. Nested PCR-RFLP analysis confirmed that all of the kids were clones of the donor cells. These results demonstrated that CMGECs after transfection remain totipotent for nuclear transfer.

Expression of GAT1 in male reproductive system and its effects on reproduction in mice. The present study was carried out to identify GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transport protein I (GAT1) in male reproductive organs and to study the effect of GAT1 overexpression on the male reproductive system in GAT1 transgenic mice (TG). Expression and location of GAT1 in testes, epididymis, and sperm of wild-type (WT) mice were identified by immunohistochemistry and western-blot. Histological changes of testes, epididymis, and sperm of transgenic mice overexpressing GAT1 were detected by immunofluorenscent staining and haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. GAT1 expression was detected in the testes, epididymis, and sperm of non-transgenic mice. Vacuolization and deformity of spermatogenic cells were observed in the transgenic mice, but the epididymis was unremarkable. Immunofluorenscent staining showed that the number of diastrophic and decapitated sperm increased significantly in transgenic mice to 46.9% from 7.3% in nontransgenic mice. These results suggest that abnormal expression of GAT1 could result in spermiogenesis function injury, sperm paramorphia and dysgenesis.

Fecal triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations change in response to thyroid stimulation in Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). Variation in concentrations of thyroid hormones shed in feces may help to identify physiological states of animals, but the efficacy of the technique needs to be validated for each species. We determined whether a known physiological alteration to thyroid hormone production was reflected in hormone concentrations in the feces of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). We quantified variation of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations in feces following two intramuscular injections of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH) at 24h intervals in four captive female sea lions. We found fecal T3 concentrations increased 18-57% over concentrations measured in the baseline sample collected closest to the time of the first TSH injection (p=0.03) and 1-75% over the mean baseline concentration (p=0.12) for each animal of all samples collected prior to injections. Peak T3 concentrations were greater than the upper bound of the baseline 95% confidence interval for three animals. The peak T3 response occurred 48h post-injection in three animals and 71h in the fourth. Post-injection T4 concentrations did not differ between the baseline sample collected closest to the time of the first TSH injection (p=0.29) or the mean baseline concentration (p=0.23) for each animal. These results indicate that induced physiological alterations to circulating thyroid hormone concentrations can be adequately detected through analyses of fecal T3 concentrations and that the technique may provide a means of non-invasively detecting metabolic changes in Steller sea lions.

Substitute treatment and replacement in chronic kidney disease: peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis and transplant. Chronic dialysis replacement treatments or renal transplants are instituted when the patient's glomerular filtration rate, measured by 24-h urine endogenous creatinine clearance, is <10-15 ml/mm and, as the The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI), European and Canadian guidelines point out, when one or two of the following complications occur: "uremic toxicity" symptoms, significant fluid retention that does not respond to loop diuretics, hyperkalemia, chronic anemia (hemoglobin <8 g), metabolic acidosis or acute pulmonary edema. In all patients for whom transplant is indicated, a selected live donor must be sought or, in the absence of contraindications, the patient should be registered with the national cadaver donation waiting list. While waiting for the transplant, patients will be on a chronic dialysis program. There is no national registry of patients undergoing chronic dialysis; only indirect data from the Mexican Kidney Foundation and the dialysis industry are available. However, it is estimated that 40,000-50,000 people are under this treatment and the numbers grow by 11% every year. Overall, it is thought that for every patient receiving chronic dialysis, there is one more patient who dies without access to therapy. Hemodialysis units must comply with the Official Hemodialysis Standard and the General Health Council Hemodialysis Unit Quality Assessment Form.

[Resistin: a pathogenic factor or a biomarker of metabolic disorders and inflammation?]. Cardiovascular diseases are currently the most frequent cause of death in Poland and their incidence continually rises. This is related to the high incidence of obesity associated with insulin resistance, which is present in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue produces multiple cytokines(TNF-alpha, IL-6, PAI-1, CRP, angiotensinogen, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, apelin, resistin)which decrease insulin sensitivity and induce inflammatory processes, endothelial dysfunction,and atherosclerosis. This article presents the link between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus according to studies conducted in vitro and in animal models. In human studies, the influence of resistin on the development of insulin resistance is controversial. The article underlines the role of resisitin in the development of inflammatory processes and endothelial dysfunction in humans. In clinical studies, resistin was shown to be a predictive factor of coronary artery disease and mortality connected with cardiovascular diseases.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: a complexity of interactions between genes and environment. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a commonly occurring genetic condition, likely to be encountered today in virtually any corner of the globe. Sudden episodes of hemolysis associated with the condition may result in exponential increases in serum total bilirubin concentrations to levels at which bilirubin-induced neurologic damage may occur. The hyperbilirubinemia is the result of complex interactions between genes and environment. Neonatal screening programs coupled with parental and medical caretaker education may be successful in limiting the severity of disease.

Abrogation of microcystin cytotoxicity by MAP kinase inhibitors and N-acetyl cysteine is confounded by OATPIB1 uptake activity inhibition. Solute transporters that are selectively expressed on tumor cell membranes could be targeted with small molecule toxins that are selective substrates for these transporters. HeLa cells transfected to express the solute transporter OATP1B1 are exquisitely sensitive in vitro to microcystin LR (MCLR) and its analogs, and undergo rapid morphologic changes after exposure to MCLR. Immunoblot analyses revealed HSP27 phosphorylation increased prior to the rapid MCLR-induced morphologic changes. However, transfection of OATP1B1-expressing cells with HSP27 dominant negative mutants did not reverse MCLR toxicity. Although the MAP kinase p38 inhibitor SB202190 partially reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, the control molecule, SB202474, had similar effects. Unexpectedly, both SB202190 and SB202474 inhibited OATP1B1 uptake activity, indicating an alternative explanation for cytotoxicity reversal that did not involve p38 MAP kinase. Similarly, although the potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC) inhibitor (dihydro-indenyl)oxyalkanoic acid (DIOA), and the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) both reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, both were also found to be unexpected OATP1B1 transport inhibitors. Therefore, the mechanism of MCLR-induced cytotoxicity is obscured by the inhibition of OATP1B1 uptake activity by MAP kinase inhibitors, DIOA, and NAC. Finally, growth of OATP1B1-expressing HeLa xenografts was inhibited by MCLR, suggesting that MCLR structural analogs selected for a broader therapeutic index could target OATP-expressing tumors.

Time of feeding and the intrinsic circadian clock drive rhythms in hepatic gene expression. In mammals, the circadian oscillator generates approximately 24-h rhythms in feeding behavior, even under constant environmental conditions. Livers of mice held under constant darkness exhibit circadian rhythm in abundance in up to 15% of expressed transcripts. Therefore, oscillations in hepatic transcripts could be driven by rhythmic food intake or sustained by the hepatic circadian oscillator, or a combination of both. To address this question, we used distinct feeding and fasting paradigms on wild-type (WT) and circadian clock-deficient mice. We monitored temporal patterns of feeding and hepatic transcription. Both food availability and the temporal pattern of feeding determined the repertoire, phase, and amplitude of the circadian transcriptome in WT liver. In the absence of feeding, only a small subset of transcripts continued to express circadian patterns. Conversely, temporally restricted feeding restored rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes in oscillator-deficient mouse liver. Our findings show that both temporal pattern of food intake and the circadian clock drive rhythmic transcription, thereby highlighting temporal regulation of hepatic transcription as an emergent property of the circadian system.

Long-term outcome of metachronous rectal cancer following ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis. Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) carries a potential risk of metachronous cancer in the residual rectum. This study evaluated the risk of cancer development in the residual rectum. Ninety-six patients who underwent initial surgery for prevention and cure of FAP were studied, and a clinicopathologic comparison was conducted between 59 patients who underwent IRA and 24 who underwent total proctocolectomy. The 5-year overall survival rates were 94% after IRA and 95% after total proctocolectomy with no significant difference. The incidence of dense-type rectal polyps (4/17, 24%) was significantly higher in patients who developed metachronous rectal cancer following IRA compared to that in patients who did not (1/39, 3%). Moreover, 60% of patients with dense-type colon polyps developed metachronous rectal cancer compared to 24% in patients without and 80% of those with dense type rectal polyps developed metachronous rectal cancer compared to 25% without. Endoscopic surveillance of the eight Tis or T1 patients was performed at intervals of 6 months to 1 year after IRA but was not performed in three T3 patients for more than 2 years. Effective IRA requires selection of patients without invasive rectal cancer and without dense rectal polyps in whom long-term postoperative follow-up of the residual rectum is possible.

Pediatric and adolescent gynecology learned via a Web-based computerized case series. To increase resident knowledge in pediatric and adolescent gynecology via a Web-based self-tutorial. Prospective cohort involving 11 third- and fourth-year residents in a large university program. Residents were asked to complete a Web-based teaching series of cases involving common topics of pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG). A pretest and a posttest were completed to assess knowledge gained. Residents were asked to give feedback regarding improvements to the Web-based series for future case development. University-affiliated residency program in a major metropolitan area. Resident physicians in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Introduction of a Web-based teaching series to enhance resident education. Improvement of resident knowledge in PAG. All residents improved their knowledge in PAG after reviewing the series of cases. The pretest group mean score was 50%. The posttest group score was 69% (P < .05). All (100%) of participants said that this tool was an effective way to improve resident knowledge in PAG. A computer-based self-tutorial in pediatric and adolescent gynecology is a feasible and satisfactory teaching adjunct to PAG.


Inhibition of basophil activation by histamine: a sensitive and reproducible model for the study of the biological activity of high dilutions.

Origin and function of tumor stroma fibroblasts. Tumor development is critically dependent on the formation of a supporting stroma consisting of neovasculature, inflammatory cells and activated fibroblasts. Activated fibroblasts present a heterogeneous cell population not only in regard to the expression of marker molecules but also to their origin and molecular signaling properties. The plasticity of this cell type is pointed out by the multiple transdifferentiation events that lead to the generation of activated fibroblasts which can arise from resting fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells as well as from mesenchymal stem cells. Cellular in vitro and in vivo experiments have changed the perspective of fibroblasts from passive "bystanders" in the tumor microenvironment to that of important drivers of tumor progression. Here, we describe the multiple origins of fibroblast recruitment to the tumor tissue as well as the function of activated fibroblasts during tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and anti-VEGF resistance. The identification of markers present in activated fibroblasts as well as a better understanding how these cells influence other tumor compartments has led to the clinical development of anti-tumor therapies.

Corticotropin releasing factor in the rat colon: expression, localization and upregulation by endotoxin. Little is known about CRF expression and regulation in the rat colon compared to the brain. We investigated CRF gene expression, cellular location, and regulation by endotoxin and corticosterone in the male rat colon at 6h after intraperitoneal (ip) injection. CRF mRNA level, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was 1.3-fold higher in the distal than proximal colon and 3.4-fold higher in the proximal colonic submucosa plus muscle layers than in mucosa. CRF immunoreactivity was located in the epithelia, lamina propria and crypts, and co-localized with tryptophan hydroxylase, a marker for enterochromaffin (EC) cells, and in enteric neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 microg/kg, ip) increased defecation by 2.9-fold and upregulated CRF mRNA by 2.5-fold in the proximal and 1.1-fold in the distal colon while there was no change induced by corticosterone as monitored by quantitative PCR. LPS-induced increased CRF mRNA expression occurred in the submucosa plus muscle layers (1.5-fold) and the mucosa of proximal colon (0.9-fold). LPS increased significantly CRF immunoreactivity in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of proximal and distal colon compared to saline groups. These results indicate that in rats, CRF is expressed in both proximal and distal colon and more prominently in enteric neurons of the submucosa plus muscle layers and subject to upregulation at the gene and protein levels by LPS through corticosteroid independent pathways. These data suggests that colonic CRF may be part of the local effector limb of the CRF(1) receptor mediated colonic alterations induced by acute stress.

Development of health professional associations' organizational capacities in low-income countries: myth or reality in Haiti? Over the last decade, the Société haïtienne d'obstétrique et de gynécologie (SHOG) has positioned itself as a key player in the maternal and neonatal health agenda in the country. This transformation arose from the association's commitment to strengthening its organizational capacities in order to enhance its operations and consolidate its contribution to the national efforts to reduce maternal and infant mortality. The SHOG benefited from the SOGC's technical assistance to reinforce its organizational capacities, support that it received as part of the SOGC Partnership Program from professional associations working in low-income countries. We describe the results of the SHOG's organizational assessments in 2008 (in the middle of the five-year cycle) and in 2006, according to the organizational capacity development approach promoted by the SOGC. A comparison of the 2008 and the 2006 assessment results shows that the SHOG progressed substantially during that period, shifting from "basic-moderate" to "moderate" regarding its organizational capacity, its operational capacities and its relationships with other organizations, including the way it is perceived by interested parties involved in the maternal and neonatal health agenda. The SHOG's experience shows that the SOGC's approach to capacity development can assist professional associations committed to reinforcing their organizational capacities in a tangible way. This will enhance their contribution to the national efforts pertaining to maternal and newborn health in their country.


Technological challenges of addressing new and more complex migrating  products from novel food packaging materials.

Evaluation of optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer in early and advance glaucoma using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography. Recent research has suggested that structural significant damage in the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may precede visual field loss. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become an important tool which has contributed to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of glaucoma over the past decade. RTVue OCT was the first frequency-domain OCT (FD-OCT) device to offer comprehensive glaucoma analysis including an RNFL thickness map and optic disc morphology. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of FD-OCT for the detection of early and advanced glaucoma from normal eyes. This was a cross-sectional study consisting of 63 normal eyes, and 37 with early and 41 with advanced glaucoma. All patients underwent RNFL thickness and ONH parameter measurements on the RTVue OCT. Glaucoma variables obtained from RTVue OCT were compared between the groups. Discriminating power for early glaucoma detection was expressed by using the analyses of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). All RNFL thickness and ONH parameters but disc area showed significant differences between the normal and the glaucoma groups, and the highest AUCs for RNFL thickness was average thickness (AUC = 0.816) and for ONH parameters was cup/disc vertical ratio (AUC = 0.782). They were the best parameters for discriminating normal from early glaucomatous eyes. Frequency-domain OCT (RTVue OCT) may offer comprehensive analysis for RNFL thickness and ONH, which showed good diagnostic ability in distinguishing normal from glaucomatous eyes.

B-Lynch suture, intrauterine balloon, and endouterine hemostatic suture for the management of postpartum hemorrhage due to placenta previa accreta. To report our experience with a new conservative management approach to treat postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to placenta previa accreta. A retrospective study of 9 patients with placenta previa accreta who underwent a conservative management protocol. The protocol consists of preventive radiological catheterization of the descending aorta, cesarean delivery, use of Affronti endouterine square hemostatic sutures, and placement of an intrauterine Bakri balloon in conjunction with B-Lynch suture. In the event of failure of the protocol, subsequent management employs ligation and/or reversible embolization of the uterine arteries followed by hysterectomy if unsuccessful. Conservative management of PPH was successful in all 9 patients evaluated and avoided the need for ligation and/or reversible embolization of the uterine arteries. Management of PPH is dictated by several considerations including hemodynamic status and desire to preserve fertility. The initial results of this conservative protocol for treatment of PPH in high-risk patients with placenta previa accreta are encouraging.

Etiology, epidemiology, and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Historically, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been a major focus of urologic practice and surgery. But a simplistic causal relationship among prostatic enlargement, progressive obstruction, lower urinary tract symptoms, retention, and complications of retention has been challenged by recognition of the incomplete overlap of prostatic enlargement with symptoms and obstruction. The result has been a greater focus on symptoms than prostatic enlargement and a shift from surgery to medical treatment. Therefore, the question can be asked whether BPH per se, the glandular enlargement as it contributes to bladder dysfunction, or hyperplastic enlargement as a biomarker for generalized lower urinary tract dysfunction are concerns. This article addresses these issues.

Infectious disease diagnostic assays. Dogs and cats are commonly exposed to infectious disease agents. The following article is an update on the most common infectious disease assays used in small animal practice. In some situations, results of pathogen-specific molecular diagnostic assays can be used to assist the practicing veterinarian in the management of patients with infectious diseases. However, with some infectious disease agents, the assays are positive in healthy and ill animals and can be falsely negative and so the predictive values of the assays vary.

Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus in Great Britain and The Netherlands. In Europe, rotavirus gastroenteritis peaks in late winter or early spring suggesting a role for weather factors in transmission of the virus. In this study, multivariate regression models adapted for time-series data were used to investigate effects of temperature, humidity and rainfall on reported rotavirus infections and the infection-rate parameter, a derived measure of infection transmission that takes into account population immunity, in England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weather were investigated by introducing lagged weather terms into the model. Meta-regression was used to pool together country-specific estimates. There was a 13 per cent (95% confidence interval (CI), 11-15%) decrease in reported infections per 1 degrees C increase in temperature above a threshold of 5 degrees C and a 4 per cent (95% CI, 3-5%) decrease in the infection-rate parameter per 1 degrees C increase in temperature across the whole temperature range. The effect of temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed by up to four weeks for reported infections. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simple relationship between cold weather and rotavirus transmission in Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more complex and delayed temperature effect on disease incidence is likely to be mediated through the effects of weather on transmission.

[Work related stress: from knowledge to practice]. Work-related stress is a well documented condition, resulting from a distorted interaction between working conditions and individual coping resources, that may have a negative impact on workers' health and well-being, as well as nd on performance efficiency and productivity: hence high costs for workers companies and society. It is a complex multifaceted and multidimensional phenomenon, whose assessment needs a multidisciplinary approach (work management, psychology, physiology, ergonomics, sociology, medicine). That is why risk assessment and management require a careful analysis of work organization (i.e. working time, work load, autonomy, environment, human relations) and individual aspects (i.e. demography, personality, attitudes, motivation, coping strategies). The consequent actions, targeted to the individuals, groups and organizations, should be aimed at preventing or reducing work-related stress, on the one hand, and supporting and protecting the worker, on the other, considering cost/effectiveness and risk/benefit ratios. This can be achieveds to be done with the participation and close collaboration of all the social actors involved (employers, employees, technicians, work organization and occupational health experts), according to the European Framework Agreement on Work-related Stress, signed on October 2004 and included into the Italian Law Decree 81/2008.

Glutamine metabolism is essential for human cytomegalovirus infection. Human fibroblasts infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were more viable than uninfected cells during glucose starvation, suggesting that an alternate carbon source was used. We have determined that infected cells require glutamine for ATP production, whereas uninfected cells do not. This suggested that during infection, glutamine is used to fill the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). In agreement with this, levels of glutamine uptake and ammonia production increased in infected cells, as did the activities of glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, the enzymes needed to convert glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate to enter the TCA cycle. Infected cells starved for glutamine beginning 24 h postinfection failed to produce infectious virions. Both ATP and viral production could be rescued in glutamine-starved cells by the TCA intermediates alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, and pyruvate, confirming that in infected cells, a program allowing glutamine to be used anaplerotically is induced. Thus, HCMV infection activates the mechanisms needed to switch the anaplerotic substrate from glucose to glutamine to accommodate the biosynthetic and energetic needs of the viral infection and to allow glucose to be used biosynthetically.

Acute hyperosmotic stimulus-induced Fos expression in neurons depends on activation of astrocytes in the supraoptic nucleus of rats. Acute hyperosmolarity induced a time-dependent expression of Fos protein in both neurons and astrocytes of the rat supraoptic nucleus, with peak Fos expression occurring at 45 min in astrocytes and at 90 min in neurons after hypertonic stimulation in vivo. To determine whether the two cell types were activated separately or in an integrated manner, animals were pretreated with fluorocitrate, a glial metabolic blocker or carbenoxolone, a gap junction blocker followed by an acute hypertonic stimulation similar to that of the controls. Antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, connexin 43, vasopressin, and oxytocin were used in serial sections to identify the cellular elements of the supraoptic nucleus. It was found that interruption of astrocyte metabolism with fluorocitrate significantly reduced Fos protein expression in both astrocytes and neurons, whereas blockage of gap junctions with carbenoxolone clearly reduced Fos protein expression in neurons, but not in astrocytes. These results indicate that both neurons and astrocytes in the rat supraoptic nucleus are involved in regulating osmolarity. Astrocytes are activated first, whereas connexin 43 functional hemichannels in SON astrocytes are required for the subsequent activation of the neurons.

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: assessment of the hamstring autograft femoral fixation using the EndoButton CL. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of a prospective, continuous series of 105 ACL reconstructions using the STG tendons fixed to the femur by an EndoButton CL, with more than 4 years of follow-up. The subjective and objective clinical results as well as the radiological results (tunnel enlargement) obtained by a cortical, extra-anatomic femoral fixation are at least equivalent to the results obtained with other types of femoral fixation systems. One hundred and five patients aged with a mean 26 years (range, 12-56 years) were operated on for an anterior cruciate ligament rupture using the same technique and by the same operator: four-strand STG fixed to the tibia by a double fixation--BioRCI-HA screw and staple--and on the femur by an EndoButton CL (Smith and Nephew). The results were assessed at 6 months, 1 and 2 years and then at a mean follow-up of 51 months, both clinically (IKDC, Lysholm, KT-1000) and radiologically (Telos laximetry, tunnel position, and morphological analysis). No complications related to the use of the EndoButton were observed. No additional interference screw was necessary. According to the IKDC laxity classification, 91.4% of the patients were classified in category A or B, nine knees (8.6%) were classified C or D. Four failures required revision with a patellar tendon graft. On the final IKDC score, 63 patients (60%) were classified grade A, 37 grade B (35.3%), four grade C (3.8%), and one grade D (0.9%). On the Telos laximetry, 62 patients (59%) had a differential laxity less than or equal to 2 mm. The mean value was 1.8 mm (range, 0-11). Tibial tunnel enlargement was constant; femoral tunnel enlargement was significant (>2 mm) in 27.6% of the knees. No femoral tunnel diameter modification corresponding to the EndoButton passage was observed. The results of this series are comparable to the results of other series. Its reproducibility and the absence of iatrogenic complications for this femoral EndoButton CL fixation make it a top-choice technique, like the corticocancellous graft procedures, but without their disadvantages. No secondary elongation attributable to the EndoButton CL was observed. This femoral fixation procedure appeared necessary and sufficient to providing good mechanical stability for the graft in the femoral tunnel.

Fast, easy ethanolysis of coconut oil for biodiesel production assisted by ultrasonication. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel, consistituting an alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuel. It is non-toxic and biodegradable and has a low emission profile, is better from environmentally sensitive areas. Research study on alternative fuels is essential for increased energy security. Presently, biodiesel is produced mainly is batch reactor. In this process the required energy is given by heating accompanied by mechanical stirring which has several disadvantages because of time consuming high labour cost. Being methanol is a toxic chemical; the objective of this work is to produce coconut oil ethyl ester by using ultrasonic irradiation. The advantages of ethanol are non-toxic domestic all available, having higher carbon atoms which provide higher heat content. The optical conditions for biodiesel production is the molar ratio oil to ethanol 1:6, KOH catalyst 0.75wt.% of oil and 7min reaction time. The reaction time reduced 15-40 times comparing to the conventional batch processes and found >or=98% biodiesel yield.


Altered regulation of glutamate release and decreased functional activity and expression of GLT1 and GLAST glutamate transporters in the hippocampus of adolescent rats perinatally exposed to Delta(9)-THC.

Chromatin states of core pluripotency-associated genes in pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cells. Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 constitute a core of transcription factors controlling pluripotency. Differentiation and reprogramming studies have unraveled a few epigenetic modifications associated in relation to the expression state of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2. There is, however, no comprehensive map of chromatin states on these genes in human primary cells at different stages of differentiation. We report here a profile of DNA methylation and of 10 histone modifications on regulatory regions of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 in embryonal carcinoma cells, mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. Bisulfite sequencing reveals correlation between promoter CpG methylation and repression of OCT4, but not NANOG or SOX2, suggesting distinct repression mechanisms. Whereas none of these genes, even when inactive, harbor repressive trimethylated H3K9, CpG hypomethylated NANOG and SOX2, but not CpG methylated OCT4, are enriched in repressive H3K27me3. H3K79me1 and H3K79me3 tend to parallel each other and are linked to repression. Moreover, we highlight an inverse relationship between H3K27me3 occupancy on promoters and H3K36me3 occupancy on coding regions of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, suggesting a cross-talk between K27 and K36 methylation. Establishment of distinct repression mechanisms for pluripotency-associated genes may constitute a safeguard system to prevent promiscuous reactivation during development or differentiation.


Individual diet modeling translates nutrient recommendations into realistic and individual-specific food choices.

Proteomic analysis of endogenous conjugated linoleic acid biosynthesis in lactating rats and mouse mammary gland epithelia cells (HC11). This study was conducted to investigate the amount of CLA synthesized endogenously by rat mammary tissues in response to TVA (a precursor for cis-9, trans-11 CLA endogenous synthesis) treatment as well as the differences in the protein expression of genes encoding the biosynthesis of CLA in rat mammary tissue and mouse mammary gland epithelia cells (HC11). Treatment with TVA resulted in improved CLA productivity. Furthermore, 2-DE revealed two spots in samples of mammary tissues and one spot in samples of mammary gland epithelia cells (HC11) that were consistently altered in the TVA treatment groups when compared with the control group (non-fatty acid). The mRNA expression patterns of three of the proteins (PDI, PRDX2, LAMR1), as measured by real-time PCR, were similar to the pattern of protein abundance. In addition, the expression of SCD mRNA in the mammary tissue of rats and HC11 cell treated with TVA was higher than in the control group. Our results suggest that the identified proteins may be related to CLA biosynthesis in mammary tissue.

Sex differences in arrhythmias. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the principal sex-related differences in the presentation, clinical course, and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias as well as the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences. The mechanisms behind the sex differences in arrhythmias are not well understood yet. Recent studies in animals have provided some insight to explain the molecular basis by which sex hormones may be responsible for the female predisposition to long QT syndromes as well as the higher male predisposition to lethal arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Recently discovered preferential transmission of long QT syndrome alleles to daughters as compared with sons, as well as sex differences in the activity of membrane transporters and in recently discovered myocardial cytochrome P450 enzymes, may explain the predisposition of women to acquired and drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes. Important sex differences in the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy have also been reported. Women appear to be underrepresented among patients who receive implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices. However, despite higher rates of adverse mechanical events, they seem to benefit at least as much as men from these therapies. Sex-related differences should be taken into account to provide optimal diagnosis and treatment to patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Further studies are needed to explain the mechanisms behind these differences.

Comparison of long-term outcomes following sirolimus-eluting stent vs paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation in patients with long calcified coronary lesions. Although previously reported studies on coronary calcification mainly focused on its presence or absence in discrete focal target lesions, calcified coronary lesions (CCL) angiographically present as diffuse long lesions in some patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) on long CCL. A total of 122 patients with 134 lesions (77 patients with 88 lesions for SES and 45 patients with 46 lesions for PES) were enrolled from 3 centers. Long CCL was defined visually as a culprit lesion with type B or C that was mainly due to coronary calcification with > 20 mm in total length by coronary angiography. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 year and angiographic follow-up at 6 to 9 months after procedure. Major adverse coronary events (MACE) were defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat target-lesion revascularization (TLR). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline, procedural, or angiographic characteristics and in 1-year rates of all-cause death, MI, and TLR between the 2 groups (all P = NS [not significant]). Likewise, the cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year was similar between the 2 groups (7.8% of patients in the SES group vs 4.4% of patients in the PES group, respectively, P = NS). In patients who underwent follow-up angiography, the angiographic binary restenosis rate was 6.2% in the SES group vs 12.1% in the PES group, respectively (P = NS). In patients with long CCL, both SES and PES were comparably effective in either angiographic or clinical long-term outcomes.

Changes in angiotensin type 1 receptor binding and angiotensin-induced pressor responses in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of angiotensinogen knockout mice. ANG II, the main circulating effector hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, is produced by enzymatic cleavage of angiotensinogen. The present study aimed to examine whether targeted deletion of the angiotensinogen gene (Agt) altered brain ANG II receptor density or responsiveness to ANG II. In vitro autoradiography was used to examine the distribution and density of angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) and type 2 receptors. In most brain regions, the distribution and density of angiotensin receptors were similar in brains of Agt knockout mice (Agt(-/-)) and wild-type mice. In Agt(-/-) mice, a small increase in AT(1) receptor binding was observed in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a region that plays a critical role in blood pressure regulation. To examine whether Agt(-/-) mice showed altered responses to ANG II, blood pressure responses to intravenous injection (0.01-0.1 microg/kg) or RVLM microinjection (50 pmol in 50 nl) of ANG II were recorded in anesthetized Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. Intravenous injections of phenylephrine (4 microg/kg and 2 microg/kg) were also made in both groups. The magnitude of the pressor response to intravenous injections of ANG II or phenylephrine was not different between Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. Microinjection of ANG II into the RVLM induced a pressor response, which was significantly smaller in Agt(-/-) compared with wild-type mice (+10 + or - 1 vs. +23 + or - 4 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.004). Microinjection of glutamate into the RVLM (100 pmol in 10 nl) produced a robust pressor response, which was not different between Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. A diminished response to ANG II microinjection in the RVLM of Agt(-/-) mice, despite an increased density of AT(1) receptors suggests that signal transduction pathways may be altered in RVLM neurons of Agt(-/-) mice, resulting in attenuated cellular excitation.

Genetic and environmental contributions to childhood temperament in South Korean twins. Although genetic basis of childhood temperament has been well documented in western populations, little is known about whether genes play an important role in childhood temperament in East Asians. The present study examined mother's ratings of Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability (EAS) in 894 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean twins. The best-fitting model indicated that 34 to 47% of the variances of the EAS were attributable to genetic factors, with the remaining variances being due to the effects of environmental experiences unique to each child. Common family environmental factors were negligible. Genetic variances for Activity and Sociability were primarily nonadditive, whereas those for Emotionality were additive. In spite of well known cultural differences in child rearing practices, social values, and the mean levels of temperament between East Asian and western populations, the pattern of additive vs. nonadditive gene actions and heritability estimates found in the present sample were remarkably similar to those reported in western twin samples. There were no significant age or sex differences in genetic or environmental influences. Overall, these results corroborate cross cultural generality of genetic influences on childhood temperament.

Dental education's role in improving children's oral health and access to care. In 2000, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General identified disparities in oral health and access to care for vulnerable populations, including children. The report identified a declining dental school applicant pool, shortages of dental school faculties, and an overcrowded curriculum as dental education factors affecting disparities. Dental school applications are up, but the dentist/population ratio is projected to decline, and the shortage of dental faculty has worsened-limiting dental students' experiences with children. Current Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standards do not include essential curriculum required to care for children. We recommend that CODA revisions to predoctoral and postdoctoral programs include care of infants, characteristics of children that distinguish them from adults, mandatory service learning experiences, emphasis upon social responsibility for all dentists, and use of objective standardized clinical examinations (OSCEs). Additionally, we recommend prioritization of limited pediatric dental resources to young children with disease and older children with complex dental requirements or special health care needs. Critical dental education goals for children should be developed through a special American Dental Education Association task force. Only the dental education community can assure that the dental workforce is better trained to care for children.

Expression of MDC/CCL22 and its receptor CCR4 in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) involves an abnormal chemokine regulation. The chemokine receptor CCR4 is necessary for T cell migration to the skin. We, therefore, studied if CCR4 and its ligand macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) could participate in spreading the disease between skin and joints by examining RA, PsA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. In synovial fluid from RA and PsA patients we observed a significantly higher MDC/CCL22 level compared to OA patients. Additionally, the MDC/CCL22 protein was found to be elevated in RA and PsA plasma compared to OA and healthy volunteers. Flow cytometry revealed that most CD4(+)CCR4(+) lymphocytes also co-expressed CD45RO. Neither the MDC/CCL22 level nor the expression of CCR4 correlated to CRP. Immunohistochemistry of the RA and OA synovial membrane demonstrated CCR4 to be expressed by mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. Our results show that MDC/CCL22 is present within the synovial membrane of RA and OA patients and in high amount in the synovial fluid of patients with RA and PsA. This will enable migration of CCR4 expressing memory cells supporting that MDC/CCR4 could play a role in attracting skin specific memory T cells to the joints.

Diagnosis-based differences in response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration in children. To determine diagnosis-based differences in the response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration (MUF) using transesophageal echocardiography during congenital heart surgery. The study included 38 children with atrial septal defect (n=10), ventricular septal defect (VSD) (n=8), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (n=9), or a single ventricle (n=11). Arteriovenous MUF was performed for 10-15 min after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The myocardial performance index (MPI) of the systemic ventricles and the % change in MPI before and after MUF were assessed. Impairment of MPI was noted at termination of CPB compared with baseline values in the VSD and TOF groups (P<0.05). MUF resulted in an improvement in MPI in all groups (P<0.01). There was a weak correlation between aortic cross-clamping or CPB time, and the degree of improvement in MPI (r= 0.385, P=0.019; r= 0.348, P=0.037, respectively). MUF improved fractional shortening in all groups (P<0.05) and reversed abnormal relaxation in the VSD and TOF groups. Modified ultrafiltration ameliorated MPI in all groups, indicating improved systemic ventricular function with MUF. The MPI recovery rate differed among the groups. MUF may be particularly useful for restoring the global ventricular performance of patients undergoing longer CPB and may have minimal advantages for simple open-heart surgery. (Circ J 2010; 74: 86 - 92).

The dorsomedial striatum reflects response bias during learning. Previous studies have established that neurons in the dorsomedial striatum track the behavioral significance of external stimuli, are sensitive to contingencies between actions and outcomes, and show rapid flexibility in representing task-related information. Here, we describe how neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum changes during the initial acquisition of a Go/NoGo task and during an initial reversal of stimulus-response contingencies. Rats made nosepoke responses over delay periods and then received one of two acoustic stimuli. Liquid rewards were delivered after one stimulus (S+) if the rats made a Go response (entering a reward port on the opposite wall of the chamber). If a Go response was made to other stimulus (S-), rats experienced a timeout. On 10% of trials, no stimulus was presented. These trials were used to assess response bias, the animals' tendency to collect reward independent of the stimulus. Response bias increased during the reversal, corresponding to the animals' uncertainty about the stimulus-response contingencies. Most task-modulated neurons fired during the response at the end of the delay period. The fraction of response-modulated neurons was correlated with response bias and neural activity was sensitive to the behavioral response made on the previous trial. During initial task acquisition and initial reversal learning, there was a remarkable change in the percentages of neurons that fired in relation to the task events, especially during withdrawal from the nosepoke aperture. These results suggest that changes in task-related activity in the dorsomedial striatum during learning are driven by the animal's bias to collect rewards.


Association of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and sex hormone-binding globulin in non-obese peri- and postmenopausal women.

The role of organ level conditioning on the promotion of engineered heart valve tissue development in-vitro using mesenchymal stem cells. We have previously shown that combined flexure and flow (CFF) augment engineered heart valve tissue formation using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seeded on polyglycolic acid (PGA)/poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) blend nonwoven fibrous scaffolds (Engelmayr, et al., Biomaterials 2006; vol. 27 pp. 6083-95). In the present study, we sought to determine if these phenomena were reproducible at the organ level in a functional tri-leaflet valve. Tissue engineered valve constructs (TEVC) were fabricated using PGA/PLLA nonwoven fibrous scaffolds then seeded with MSCs. Tissue formation rates using both standard and augmented (using basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF] and ascorbic acid-2-phosphate [AA2P]) media to enhance the overall production of collagen were evaluated, along with their relation to the local fluid flow fields. The resulting TEVCs were statically cultured for 3 weeks, followed by a 3 week dynamic culture period using our organ level bioreactor (Hildebrand et al., ABME, Vol. 32, pp. 1039-49, 2004) under approximated pulmonary artery conditions. Results indicated that supplemented media accelerated collagen formation (approximately 185% increase in collagen mass/MSC compared to standard media), as well as increasing collagen mass production from 3.90 to 4.43 pg/cell/week from 3 to 6 weeks. Using augmented media, dynamic conditioning increased collagen mass production rate from 7.23 to 13.65 pg/cell/week (88.8%) during the dynamic culture period, along with greater preservation of net DNA. Moreover, when compared to our previous CFF study, organ level conditioning increased the collagen production rate from 4.76 to 6.42 pg/cell/week (35%). Newly conducted CFD studies of the CFF specimen flow patterns suggested that oscillatory surface shear stresses were surprisingly similar to a tri-leaflet valve. Overall, we found that the use of simulated pulmonary artery conditions resulted in substantially larger collagen mass production levels and rates found in our earlier CFF study. Moreover, given the fact that the scaffolds underwent modest strains (approximately 7% max) during either CFF or physiological conditioning, the oscillatory surface shear stresses estimated in both studies may play a substantial role in eliciting MSC collagen production in the highly dynamic engineered heart valve fluid mechanical environment.

The lipid quality assessment of Schizothorax zarudnyi and Schizocypris altidorsalis by fatty acid analysis. The proximate and fatty acid composition of two locally important freshwater fish, Schizothorax zarudnyi and Schizocypris altidorsalis, from Sistan Province in Iran were investigated for their nutritional value. The protein and lipid content in the S. zarudnyi were 14.67 and 6.36%, respectively. In S. altidorsalis, protein and lipid content were 13.03 and 4.52%. There was quantitative difference between individual fatty acids of these two fish. Totally 18 fatty acids were found. In S. zarudnyi, DHA was the highest among the poly-unsaturated fatty acids with 42.85%, followed by EPA with 29.62% of the total poly-unsaturated fraction. In S. altidorsalis, EPA was the highest among the poly-unsaturated fatty acids with 45.05%, followed by DHA with 27.87% the total poly-unsaturated fraction. The n-6/n-3 ratio was 0.26 and 0.20 for S. zarudnyi and S. altidorsalis, respectively. High n-3 fatty acids content in these fish revealed that they have high nutritional value. Schizothorax zarudnyi showed better nutritional value in comparison to protein and lipid content of S. altidorsalis.

Association between sexual risk behaviors and drug and alcohol use among young people with delinquent behaviors. This study examined the association between sexual risk behaviors and drug and alcohol use among young people in a juvenile classification home. The subjects completed a questionnaire including demographic information, questions on sexual risk behaviors, Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20), Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale (AAIS) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE). Median of the lifetime number of sex partners was 2. The mean age for first engaging in sexual intercourse was 14.81. Non-school-attendance, higher DAST-20 and AAIS scores produced significant odds ratios for having a greater number of sex partners, and higher DAST-20 scores produced a significant association with an earlier sexual debut. This study indicated association between sexual risk behaviors and substance use among young men.

Determinants of early weaning and use of unmodified cow's milk in infants: a systematic review. Introduction of complementary foods (weaning) before 4 to 6 months of age and unmodified cow's milk before age 12 months are associated with several health risks. To develop effective interventions to discourage these practices, evidence of their determinants is needed. This systematic review identified documents from seven electronic databases (database inception 2008) and reference lists, and by contacting authors. Seventy-eight studies in developed countries, published between 1976 and 2008, quantifying the association between either feeding practice and its potential determinants were included. Study quality was systematically assessed in terms of representativeness, sample size, method of outcome ascertainment, and approach to statistical analysis. The distribution of evidence for each determinant was visualized in a harvest plot showing the strength and direction of associations found and the quality of relevant studies. The strength of evidence for each determinant was summarized as strong, moderate, limited, or inconclusive, using an algorithm based on the consistency of the results of studies of the highest available quality. Strong evidence denoted that the determinant was examined in three or more high-quality studies and >/=75% of results were consistent. Strong evidence was found for six determinants of early weaning (ie, young maternal age, low maternal education, low socioeconomic status, absence or short duration of breastfeeding, maternal smoking, and lack of information or advice from health care providers) and for two determinants of early introduction of unmodified cow's milk (ie, low maternal education and low socioeconomic status). Of these determinants, improving advice given by health care providers appears the most tractable area for intervention in the short term.

Clinical and radiographic poland syndrome classification: a proposal. Many chest wall deformities have a characteristic radiologic appearance that can be the basis for a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, imaging techniques have fundamental roles in the detection, location, and characterization of these disorders. The authors propose a clinical and radiographic Poland syndrome (CRPS) classification system and possible treatment algorithm for the thoracic manifestations of Poland syndrome (PS) in women, based on both clinical examinations and imaging studies. A retrospective study was conducted of 28 female patients evaluated over 17 years in the 28th Infirmary, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division of the Hospital Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After clinical examination, all patients underwent radiographic examination with chest radiographs, conventional computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging and, in some cases, additional imaging studies. All clinical and radiologic variables were compiled in a database and used in the classification system, which included three levels of disease severity. Based on the CRPS classification of the 28 female patients, 10 patients had first-degree PS, 14 patients had second-degree PS, and four patients had third-degree PS. Eighteen patients underwent surgical correction; a total of 39 surgical procedures were performed using the CRPS algorithm. Identification of the severity of PS using the proposed classification system provided an accurate study of each patient and enabled better planning for the surgical correction of functional and aesthetic deformities.

Employment change and the role of the medical home for married and single-mother families with children with special health care needs. One in five U.S. households with children has at least one child with a special health care need (USDHHS, 2004). Like most parents, those with children with special health care needs struggle to balance child-rearing responsibilities with employment demands. This research examines factors affecting married parents' and single-mother's employment change decisions focusing specifically on whether having a medical home influences these decisions. This study includes 38,569 children with special health care needs from birth through age 17 surveyed in the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. The employment model is estimated using multinomial logistic regression with the choice of a parent to maintain their current level of employment, reduce work hours, or stop working as the dependent variable. Independent variables are those characterizing the needs of the child, the resources of the family, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the family. Components of the medical home variable include: 1) having a usual source of care; 2) care provided is "family centered"; 3) receipt of care coordination services; and 4) receipt of needed referrals. Half of the children in our sample met criteria in all four facets. If the child has a medical home, the relative risk of a parent choosing to cut hours rather than not change hours decreases by 51%. The relative risk of choosing to stop working rather than not change hours decreases by an estimated 64%. Care coordination services significantly reduce the odds of changing employment status. Our results suggest that the medical home is a moderating factor in parental decisions concerning change in employment status.

Effect of rosemary, echinacea, green tea extracts and ascorbic acid on broiler meat quality. This study evaluated the effect of addition some plant extracts and ascorbic acid in presence of distilled water as the control on the broiler thigh meat color, subsequent lipid oxidation (TBARS) and rancidity development during frozen storage of chicken thigh meat. All the extracts were used in the density of 1000 ppm. The results showed that all the antioxidants had significant effect on lipid oxidation as measured by TBARS value during frozen storage at -20 degrees C for 120 days. However, lipid oxidation only occurred to a limited extent and was insufficient to cause rancid flavor development. The results also demonstrated that rosemary and green tea were the most effective antioxidants in stabilization of a* value. Echinacea, green tea and rosemary extracts were effective antioxidants and strongly inhibited oxidation. Present findings show that these plants extracts exhibit greater antioxidant efficiency compared to ascorbic acid.

Evidence for multiple independent origins of trans-splicing in Metazoa. In contrast to conventional splicing, which joins exons from a single primary transcript, trans-splicing links stretches of RNA from separate transcripts, derived from distinct regions of the genome. Spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing is particularly well known in trypanosomes, nematodes, and flatworms, where it provides messenger RNAs with a leader sequence and cap that allow them to be translated efficiently. One of the largest puzzles regarding SL trans-splicing is its evolutionary origin. Until now SL trans-splicing has been found in a small and disparate set of organisms (including trypanosomes, dinoflagellates, cnidarians, rotifers, nematodes, flatworms, and urochordates) but not in most other eukaryotic lineages, including well-studied groups such as fungi, plants, arthropods, and vertebrates. This patchy distribution could either suggest that trans-splicing was present in early eukaryotes/metazoans and subsequently lost in multiple lineages or that it evolved several times independently. Starting from the serendipitous discovery of SL trans-splicing in an arthropod, we undertook a comprehensive survey of this process in the animal kingdom. By surveying expressed sequence tag data from more than 70 metazoan species, we show that SL trans-splicing also occurs in at least two groups of arthropods (amphipod and copepod crustaceans), in ctenophores, and in hexactinellid sponges. However, we find no evidence for SL trans-splicing in other groups of arthropods and sponges or in 15 other phyla that we have surveyed. Although the presence of SL trans-splicing in hydrozoan cnidarians, hexactinellid sponges, and ctenophores might suggest that it was present at the base of the Metazoa, the patchy distribution that is evident at higher resolution suggests that SL trans-splicing has evolved repeatedly among metazoan lineages. In agreement with this scenario, we discuss evidence that SL precursor RNAs can readily evolve from ubiquitous small nuclear RNAs that are used for conventional splicing.

Epidemiology of herpes simplex virus types 2 and 1 amongst men who have sex with men attending sexual health clinics in England and Wales: implications for HIV prevention and management. The objective was to investigate herpes simplex virus (HSV) epidemiology amongst HIV-positive and HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) in England and Wales. Unlinked anonymous sera from 3,968 MSM attending 12 sexual health clinics in 2003 were tested for HIV, HSV-2 and HSV-1 antibodies. Fifty-five percent of HIV-positive MSM were HSV-2-seropositive, compared to 17% of HIV-negative MSM (Adj RR: 2.14 [CI: 1.92-2.37]). Amongst HIV-positive individuals, there was no significant difference in HSV-2 seroprevalence by knowledge of HIV status or whether the HIV infection was recently acquired (determined through STARHS). HIV infection was also independently associated with HSV-1 serostatus (Adj RR 1.19 [CI: 1.14-1.24)]). Four of the twelve attendees who received a diagnosis of recurrent anogenital herpes at the clinic visit were HSV-1-seropositive but not HSV-2-seropositive at the time, although no cultures or PCR results were available to type the cause of the ano-genital presenting disease. It is of concern that one in two HIV-positive MSM and one in six HIV-negative MSM may be infected with HSV-2, given increasing evidence of its impact on HIV progression, onward transmission and acquisition. To date results have been disappointing from trials aimed at reducing HIV onward transmission and HIV acquisition using HSV antiviral medication. However, recent research in an African context demonstrates the efficacy of HSV antivirals in delaying HIV progression. The high prevalence of HSV-2 amongst HIV-positive MSM suggests that an increased focus on HSV control in the management of HIV amongst MSM in the United Kingdom may be warranted. Given this and existing research on the high prevalence of genitally acquired HSV-1 amongst MSM in the UK, further research is also warranted into the role of HSV-1 in the HIV epidemic in this context.

Differentiation of two distinct clusters among currently circulating influenza A(H1N1)v viruses, March-September 2009. Analysis of all complete genome sequences of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v virus available as of 10 September 2009 revealed that two closely related but distinct clusters were circulating in most of the affected countries at the same time. The characteristic differences are located in genes encoding the two surface proteins - haemagglutinin and neuraminidase - and four internal proteins - the polymerase PB2 subunit, nucleoprotein, matrix protein M1 and the non-structural protein NS1. Phylogenetic inference was demonstrated by neighbour joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees analyses of the involved genes and by tree construction of concatenated sequences.

[Anti-alcoholic and anti-narcotic action of Methylobacteriim extorquens UCM B-3368]. The paper deals with action efficiency of microbial biomass on characteristic indicators at alcohol and morphine organism intoxication. The investigated microbial biomass affects the regulatory biochemical and physiological systems in experimental animals, normalizes activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehide dehydrogenase, as well as the content of dophamine, disturbed under the effect of alcohol and morphine. Thus, the organism intoxication decreases. Except for the specific action, the above microbial biomass can be a source of protein, aminoacids, vitamins, microelements. So, the microbial preparation, made on its basis, can be used for the treatment of alcohol and morphine dependence in a form of biologically active dope. Thus the microbial drug intended for treatment of alcohol and opium dependence has been developed. One of its action mechanisms is based on the microorganisms capacity to transform alcohols and aldehides, owing to availability of alcohol and aldehide dehydrogenase, other its action mechanisms are at the stage of investigation.

Neuroprotection by biodegradable PAMAM ester (e-PAM-R)-mediated HMGB1 siRNA delivery in primary cortical cultures and in the postischemic brain. Although RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing provides a powerful strategy for modulating specific gene functions, difficulties associated with siRNA delivery have impeded the development of efficient therapeutic applications. In particular, the efficacy of siRNA delivery into neurons has been limited by extremely low transfection efficiencies. e-PAM-R is a biodegradable arginine ester of PAMAM dendrimer, which is readily degradable under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of siRNA delivery by e-PAM-R in primary cortical cultures and in rat brain. e-PAM-R/siRNA complexes showed high transfection efficiencies and low cytotoxicities in primary cortical cultures. Localization of fluorescence-tagged siRNA revealed that siRNA was delivered not only into the nucleus and cytoplasm, but also along the processes of the neuron. e-PAM-R/siRNA complex-mediated target gene reduction was observed in over 40% of cells and it was persistent for over 48 h. The potential use of e-PAM-R was demonstrated by gene knockdown after transfecting High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1, a novel cytokine-like molecule) siRNA into H(2)O(2)- or NMDA-treated primary cortical cultures. In these cells, HMGB1 siRNA delivery successfully reduced both basal and H(2)O(2)- or NMDA-induced HMGB1 levels, and as a result of that, neuronal cell death was significantly suppressed in both cases. Furthermore, we showed that e-PAM-R successfully delivered HMGB1 siRNA into the rat brain, wherein HMGB1 expression was depleted in over 40% of neurons and astrocytes of the normal brain. Moreover, e-PAM-R-mediated HMGB1 siRNA delivery notably reduced infarct volume in the postischemic rat brain, which is generated by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 60 min. These results indicate that e-PAM-R, a novel biodegradable nonviral gene carrier, offers an efficient means of transfecting siRNA into primary neuronal cells and in the brain and of performing siRNA-mediated gene knockdown.

Spatial and temporal genetic variation of green mussel, Perna viridis in the Gulf of Thailand and implication for aquaculture. The culture of green mussel (Perna viridis) in the Gulf of Thailand depends on natural spat which are believed to come from spawning grounds adjacent to major river mouths. In the present paper, genetic diversity of spatial and temporal populations of green mussel in the Gulf of Thailand was investigated using five microsatellite loci. The results showed moderate genetic variation of all 11 populations (averaged number of alleles per locus, A = 10.4-12.2; effective number of alleles per locus, A(e) = 5.36-6.59; mean allelic richness, A(r) = 10.23-12.06; observed heterozygosity, H(o) = 0.52-0.63, and expected heterozygosity, H(e) = 0.66-0.73) without significant differences among populations. No sign of bottleneck or genetic disequilibrium was observed. Genetic differentiation among spatial populations was low (F (ST) = 0.0046, CI(0.95) = 0.0020-0.0083 for the samples collected in January, 2007, and F (ST) = 0.0088, CI(0.95) = 0.0010-0.0162 for the samples collected in July, 2007) while temporal variation was significant as revealed by the analysis of molecular variance. Multidimensional scaling separated temporal population groups with minor exception. The assignment test revealed that most of the recruits were from other populations.

Silk nanospheres and microspheres from silk/pva blend films for drug delivery. Silk fibroin protein-based micro- and nanospheres provide new options for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and their tunable drug loading and release properties. In the present study, we report a new aqueous-based preparation method for silk spheres with controllable sphere size and shape. The preparation was based on phase separation between silk fibroin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) at a weight ratio of 1/1 and 1/4. Water-insoluble silk spheres were easily obtained from the blend in a three step process: (1) air-drying the blend solution into a film, (2) film dissolution in water and (3) removal of residual PVA by subsequent centrifugation. In both cases, the spheres had approximately 30% beta-sheet content and less than 5% residual PVA. Spindle-shaped silk particles, as opposed to the spherical particles formed above, were obtained by stretching the blend films before dissolving in water. Compared to the 1/1 ratio sample, the silk spheres prepared from the 1/4 ratio sample showed a more homogeneous size distribution ranging from 300 nm up to 20 microm. Further studies showed that sphere size and polydispersity could be controlled either by changing the concentration of silk and PVA or by applying ultrasonication on the blend solution. Drug loading was achieved by mixing model drugs in the original silk solution. The distribution and loading efficiency of the drug molecules in silk spheres depended on their hydrophobicity and charge, resulting in different drug release profiles. The entire fabrication procedure could be completed within one day. The only chemical used in the preparation except water was PVA, an FDA-approved ingredient in drug formulations. Silk micro- and nanospheres reported have potential as drug delivery carriers in a variety of biomedical applications.

Self-focused attention reduces self-injurious behavior in alcohol-intoxicated men. Both chronic alcohol use and acute intoxication are risk factors for self-aggression (i.e., intentional self-injury) across the spectrum of lethality. Studies designed to identify a cause-and-effect relation between alcohol intoxication and self-aggression, or the factors that facilitate or mitigate this effect, are rare due to the inherent difficulty of studying self-injurious behavior experimentally. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that alcohol intoxication leads to heightened self-injurious behavior, and that enhanced self-focused attention (self-awareness) attenuates this effect. Specifically, 40 men consumed either alcohol (mean Blood Alcohol Concentration [BAC] = .10) or a veridical control drink, and then completed a laboratory task designed to assess self-injurious behavior. Self-focused attention was experimentally enhanced in half the participants in each drink condition. Results support the notion that prevention and intervention programs designed to reduce intentional self-injurious behaviors should include components that address alcohol misuse and self-awareness.

Tissue gadolinium deposition and fibrosis mimicking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)-subclinical nephrogenic systemic fibrosis? Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a condition with significant and often debilitating cutaneous manifestations. Recent research on this disease has delineated an association between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and exposure to magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with ongoing renal failure. This metal has been detected in cutaneous biopsy specimens taken from lesional skin suggesting that gadolinium provides an impetus for the deposition of circulating fibrocytes in the skin and subsequent fibrosis. We describe a hemodialysis-dependent liver transplant recipient who received a gadolinium-based contrast agent and demonstrated insoluble gadolinium deposition in a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous septum using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. He has yet to manifest symptoms and signs of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 3 years after his magnetic resonance imaging study.

Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers. This Series has examined the health implications of policies aimed at tackling climate change. Assessments of mitigation strategies in four domains-household energy, transport, food and agriculture, and electricity generation-suggest an important message: that actions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions often, although not always, entail net benefits for health. In some cases, the potential benefits seem to be substantial. This evidence provides an additional and immediate rationale for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions beyond that of climate change mitigation alone. Climate change is an increasing and evolving threat to the health of populations worldwide. At the same time, major public health burdens remain in many regions. Climate change therefore adds further urgency to the task of addressing international health priorities, such as the UN Millennium Development Goals. Recognition that mitigation strategies can have substantial benefits for both health and climate protection offers the possibility of policy choices that are potentially both more cost effective and socially attractive than are those that address these priorities independently.

An extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of the organ of Zuckerkandl: report of a case.

Effects of aerobic conditioning on salivary IgA and plasma IgA, IgG and IgM in older men and women. As people age, they experience a decline in immune responses. Unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise could increase the risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) whereas regular moderate physical activity may reduce URTI symptomatology. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether an aerobic exercise program would promote chronic adaptations in plasma IgA, IgG and IgM, and salivary IgA (Sal-IgA) in both elderly women and men. Forty-three independently living men and women, aged between 65 and 96 years, were randomly assigned to an aerobic exercising or a control group. Each participant underwent three evaluations (pre, post at 16 weeks and follow-up at 32 weeks). The aerobic exercise group increased resting plasma IgA concentration from 1.08 g. L (-1)+/-0.50 g. L (-1) to 2.29 g. L (-1)+/-0.93 g. L (-1), whereas salivary IgA concentration was unchanged. The control group maintained the plasma IgA values but experienced a decrease in Sal-IgA. The IgG and IgM plasma concentrations increased in both groups, however, only the exercise group maintained higher values in the final follow-up evaluation. Regular aerobic exercise may be effective in promoting IgA immunity and protecting against the deterioration in Sal-IgA values observed in the control group. No gender differences in the immunoglobulin responses to aerobic training were observed.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in the intradural extramedullary space of the lumbar spine with spondylolisthesis: case report and review of the literature. An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare disease entity reported to arise in various organs but still thought to be a neoplastic or reactive inflammatory condition controversially. The author reports an extremely rare case of intradural extramedullary IMT of lumbar spine which was presenting radiculopathy and neurogenic intermittent claudication due to concomitant spondylolisthesis.

Mass spectrometric characterization of the Campylobacter jejuni adherence factor CadF reveals post-translational processing that removes immunogenicity while retaining fibronectin binding. Campylobacter jejuni is a major gastrointestinal pathogen that colonizes host mucosa via interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn). Fn-binding is mediated by a 37 kDa outer membrane protein termed Campylobacter adherence Factor (CadF). The outer membrane protein profile of a recent gastrointestinal C. jejuni clinical isolate (JHH1) was analysed using 2-DE and MS. Several spots were identified as products of the cadF gene. These included mass and pI variants of 34 and 30 kDa, as well as 24 kDa (CadF(24)) and 22 kDa (CadF(22)) mass variants. CadF variants were fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-MS/MS. These data confirmed that CadF forms re-folding variants resulting in spots with lower mass and varying pI that are identical at the amino acid sequence level and are not modified post-translationally. CadF(22) and CadF(24), however, were characterized as N-terminal, membrane-associated polypeptides resulting from cleavage between serine(195) and leucine(196), and glycine(201) and phenylalanine(202), respectively. These variants were more abundant in the virulent (O) isolate of C. jejuni NCTC11168 when compared with the avirulent (genome sequenced) isolate. Hexahistidine fusion constructs of full-length CadF (34 kDa), CadF(24), and the deleted C-terminal OmpA domain (14 kDa; CadF(14)) were created in Escherichia coli. Recombinant CadF variants were probed against patient sera and revealed that only full-length CadF retained reactivity. Binding assays showed that CadF(24) retained Fn-binding capability, while CadF(14) did not bind Fn. These data suggest that the immunogenic epitope of CadF is cleaved to generate smaller Fn-binding polypeptides, which are not recognized by the host humoral response. CadF cleavage therefore may be associated with virulence in C. jejuni.

Oral health policy development since the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. This assessment of the nature and impact of oral health policy development since issuance of the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health (SGROH) in 2000 includes the following: an examination of the intent and content of the SGROH with respect to policy development; a general overview of ensuing oral health policy development in 3 principal domains: public policy, organizational policies, and professional policies; an assessment of indicators of the aggregate impact of oral health policy development after the SGROH and possible reasons for the somewhat limited progress; and a summary that includes conclusions and recommendations for advancing future oral health policy development. Evidence suggests that accomplishments in the area of oral health policy development have been modest but positive, but a significant amount of work remains to be done to address oral health disparities. Success is likely to be proportionate to the extent to which factors that have impeded substantial progress to date, including fragmentation of efforts and disparate priorities, can be effectively addressed.

Emerging applications of fluorescence spectroscopy in medical microbiology field. There are many diagnostic techniques and methods available for diagnosis of medically important microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. But, almost all these techniques and methods have some limitations or inconvenience. Most of these techniques are laborious, time consuming and with chances of false positive or false negative results. It warrants the need of a diagnostic technique which can overcome these limitations and problems. At present, there is emerging trend to use Fluorescence spectroscopy as a diagnostic as well as research tool in many fields of medical sciences. Here, we will critically discuss research studies which propose that Fluorescence spectroscopy may be an excellent diagnostic as well as excellent research tool in medical microbiology field with high sensitivity and specificity.

Spontaneous intrahepatic gas gangrene and fatal septic shock. Gas gangrene of the liver is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a high rate of mortality. It is mostly associated with malignancy and immunosuppression. We report on a male patient who presented at the department of emergency medicine with high fever but no localised complaints. CT scan revealed a cavitary lesion filled with air in the liver. Clostridium perfringens was proved to be present in the hepatic lesion and the blood, and clostridium perfringens sepsis with gas gangrene of the liver was diagnosed. Despite early diagnosis and treatment the patient died. The importance of "an aggressive treatment policy" in this kind of life-threatening disease is emphasised.

Seizures, enhanced excitation, and increased vesicle number in Lis1 mutant mice. In humans, abnormal neuronal migration and severe neuronal disorganization resulting from Lis1 (lissencephaly) haploinsufficiency contributes to cognitive impairment and seizures early in life. In Lis1 heterozygotic mice, severe hippocampal disorganization and cognitive impairment have also been reported. Using this mouse model, we examined the functional impact of LIS1 deficiency with particular focus on excitatory glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission. We used visualized patch-clamp recordings in acute hippocampal slices. We recorded spontaneous, miniature and stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Additional mice were processed for immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy (EM), or video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Video-EEG confirmed the presence of spontaneous electrographic seizures in Lis1 mutant mice. In disorganized hippocampal slices from Lis1(+/-) mice, we noted a nearly two-fold significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSC; no significant change in amplitude or decay was noted. Synaptic function assessed using brief repetitive or paired-pulse stimulation protocols, also revealed significant enhancement of glutamate-mediated excitation. Low concentrations of cadmium, a nonspecific blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels mediating vesicle release, effectively restored paired-pulse facilitation deficits back to control levels. Analysis of synapse ultrastructure at the EM level identified a large increase in synaptic vesicle number. Seizure activity, possibly associated with increased glutamate-mediated excitation and an increased pool of vesicles at the presynaptic site, was demonstrated in a mouse model of type I lissencephaly.

Critical involvement of Rho GTPase activity in the efficient transplantation of neural stem cells into the injured spinal cord.

Retropancreatic approach in the treatment of pancreatic suppurations. The authors present an additional retropancreatic access path used in the treatment of suppurations that are subsequent to severe acute pancreatitis. The approach utilized by them, namely the submesocolic one, involves the performance of the decollement and reclining to the right of Treitz's angle, thus granting full access to the pancreatic compartment situated to the left of the superior mesenteric vascular pedicle. The indication for the use of this retropancreatic approach is determined on CT scan criteria, after receiving the data offered by the oral and intravenous contrast media. The ratio between the collections and Treitz's angle can be evaluated accurately. The usage of this access path is not isolated, classical approaches being concomitanlty used as a rule through the omental bursa and the retroduodenopancreatic approach. The method presented is meant to complete the range of already accepted approaches and offer some guarantee with regard to the decrease of retropancreatic suppurative processes, with the purpose of reducing either planned or selective reinterventions. The experience of the authors is still limited (12 cases), and their presentation must be appreciated as a preliminary note which impels to reflection upon a complete debridement of suppurated necroses. It offers a short and direct path to the retropancreatic space, which is often impossible to reach through the wide access path of the omental bursa.

DNA damage in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from the Chernobyl region detected by use of the comet assay. We investigated levels of DNA damage in blood cells of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) inhabiting the Chernobyl region to evaluate whether chronic exposure to low-level radioactive contamination continues to induce genetic damage in free-living populations of animals. Blood samples were obtained from barn swallows collected at sites with different background levels of radiation, including a relatively uncontaminated area. The extent of DNA damage was evaluated using the alkaline (pH=12.1) comet assay, a robust and sensitive electrophoresis-based technique widely employed in research ranging from biomonitoring to clinical studies. We found that levels of DNA damage, as indexed by the extent of DNA migration, were increased in barn swallows living in areas surrounding Chernobyl when compared to swallows sampled at low-level sites. The results we obtained are consistent with previous findings on this same species, which showed that swallows breeding in areas heavily contaminated with radionuclides have increased mutation rates, higher oxidative stress and incidence of morphological aberrations and tumors. Overall, these results indicate that chronic exposure to radioactive contaminants, even 20years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, continues to induce DNA damage in cells of free-living animals.

Role of MR imaging in prenatal diagnosis of pregnancies at risk for Joubert syndrome and related cerebellar disorders. JSRD are rare autosomal recessive brain malformations. We hypothesized that MR imaging can assess fetuses at risk for JSRD and might influence their diagnoses. We prospectively performed cranial MR imaging for 12 fetuses (mean GA, 23 weeks; SD, 3.7) at 25% recurrence risk for JSRD. We correlated prenatal MR imaging findings with postnatal MR imaging and clinical outcome. Retrospectively, we compared posterior fossa measurements of the cases with those of 24 age-matched fetuses with proved normal brain MR imaging. Institutional review board approval and consents were obtained. Statistical methods included a t test and ANCOVA tests. Fetal MR imaging correctly diagnosed 3 cases at 22, 28, and 29 weeks of gestation as JSRD, and 9 cases as normal. In JSRD-affected fetuses, prenatal MR imaging detected narrow pontomesencephalic junction (isthmus) with deepening of the interpeduncular fossa and thick horizontally placed superior cerebellar peduncles (MTS), deformed anteriorly convex floor of the fourth ventricle, and midline cerebellar cleft in place of the hypoplastic vermis. Measurements on axial fetal MR imaging at pontomesencephalic junction, ratio of AP diameters of interpeduncular fossa to midbrain/isthmus, and ratio of the AP to transverse diameters of the fourth ventricle were significantly higher in JSRD-affected fetuses than in nonaffected cases and the control group. MR imaging can diagnose JSRD in at-risk pregnancies by detecting posterior fossa signs. Measurements at the pontomesencephalic junction may enhance fetal MR imaging accuracy in diagnosing JSRD.

Economic contribution and viability of dairy goats: implications for a breeding programme. To augment the incomes of smallholder farmers in Kenya and consequently improve their nutrition and income, many development organisations and policy makers are increasingly promoting dairy goat farming. Among the key organisations supporting the initiative is Heifer Project International-Kenya (HPIK). However, the economic contribution and viability of dairy goats under the HPIK project have not been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of dairy goats to household income and the performance of the dairy goat enterprise using gross and net margins from dairy goat farming as an indicator of economic viability. A survey covering 71 farmers was carried out in the Coast, Nyanza, and the Rift Valley provinces of Kenya using a set of pre-tested structured and semi-structured questionnaires. Results showed that, on average, the dairy goat enterprise contributed, correspondingly, about 15.2% and 4.8% to the total livestock and overall household income and was viable. Differences in gross and net margins across agroecological zones were attributed to milk prices. Despite the existence of non-viable enterprises in two of the provinces, the few present suggest the possibility of obtaining reliable incomes from the enterprise. Redoubling of effort or re-orientation of production to match the local and external requirements would, however, be necessary. Costs and revenues were similar across the agroecological zones. Farmers with positive gross margins had better milk and stock sales and vice versa. The success of a dairy goat enterprise is attributed to location and good management. Besides, farmers' awareness of the market demands within and outside the community is important in establishing production goals and may be crucial to achieving a positive gross margin.

Thawing boar semen in the presence of seminal plasma: Effects on sperm quality and fertility. Causes of poor fertility after insemination of frozen-thawed (FT) sperm include reduced sperm viability at thawing and a shorter longevity of surviving sperm in the female genital tract due to sub-lethal damage. The present studies examined the effect of incubating thawed boar sperm in seminal plasma (SP) on sperm membrane integrity (viability), and motility in vitro (experiment 1), and fertility in vivo (experiment 2). For experiment 1, FT sperm from five individual boars and a sperm pool from these boars were thawed and incubated for 4 h in media containing 0%, 10%, or 50% autologous seminal plasma (individual boars) or pooled seminal plasma (sperm pool). At approximately 10 min (0 h) and again at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, sperm populations were examined for percentage sperm viability and percent sperm motility. Each variable progressively decreased during the incubation period. Incubation in 50% SP increased percentages of live sperm (P < 0.0001) and percent sperm motility (P < 0.01) at all time points compared to incubation in either 0% or 10% SP. For experiment 2, multiparous Large white x Landrace sows (n = 82) each received 900 IU eCG at weaning and 750 IU hCG 80 h later to control time of ovulation. Sows were assigned on the basis of parity to be inseminated with pooled semen with or without SP from the boars used in experiment 1. Sows received 3 x 10(9) live fresh-extended sperm (n = 30) or FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS extender (n = 26) or 3 x 10(9) live FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS containing 50% SP (FT-SP; n = 26). Sows were inseminated at 36 h, and 42 h after hCG injection. Compared to sows receiving fresh semen, the pregnancy rate of FT inseminated sows tended (P = 0.06) to be lower with the FT-SP group being intermediate. Farrowing rates were not different (83.3%, 69.2%, and 65.4% for fresh, FT, and FT-SP, respectively). Inseminations with FT sperm were associated with a reduction in litter size (P < 0.05), which was not evident in the FT-SP group. Taken together, these data confirm an adverse effect of inseminating FT sperm on sperm quality and sow fertility but suggest that thawing FT sperm in 50% SP may partially alleviate these adverse effects.

[Experimental study on cytochrome P450 enzymes after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus]. To study the effect of ferment powder caterpillar fungus on cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. The methods of Cocktail probe drugs were used. The rats were randomly divided into two groups. One group were given ferment powder caterpillar fungus once daily orally for ten days. Another group received orally normal saline one daily as the blank control. After ten days of treatment, the rats were given probe drugs of coffine, dapsone and chlorzoxazone and the blood was taken out by femoral catheterization. The plasma concentration of probe drugs were determined by HPLC. Data of plasma drug level-time were disposed with DAS Ver 2.0. The metabolism of caffeine and dapsone speeded up after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus, but the metabolism of chlorzoxazone was hardly changed. It suggested that ferment powder caterpillar fungus tended to be the inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. But the CYP2E1 was hardly affected.

[Intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry]. Critical intersectorial problems of co-operation are revealed through an organizational psychological analysis focusing on intergroup dynamics. The aim of the paper is to examine and improve the intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry and present a new trio-interview design that includes patients as well as staff. Results from a follow-up study investigating the co-operation between Psychiatric Center Amager (PCA) and socialpsychiatric institutions (SPI) in Copenhagen is presented and analysed. The study was based on data gathered via structured interviews with patients and staff from both sectors (n = 60 in 2005, n = 87 in 2007), employing quantitative as well as qualitative methods. The newly developed trio-interview design with informant-triads for studies of the quality of intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry was applied to the study. Quantitative data from the patients showed that the co-operation was generally considered to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. SPI satisfaction estimates concerning the latest hospitalization period were higher in 2007 than in 2005. Staff from both sectors estimated that co-operation was significantly higher during 2007 than during 2005. Qualitative data showed that in 2007, staff was the decisive factor. The co-operation was estimated to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. Measures to strengthen intersectorial co-operation were implemented in 2006, but had limited effect.

[Isolated lymph node metastasis in pericardial fat flap after bronchial stump coverage]. The occurrence of bronchopleural fistulas is a serious complication after pneumonectomy because of lung cancer and additional bronchial stump coverage within right-sided and left-sided pneumonectomy therefore constitutes the operative standard. This is a case report on the early diagnosis of a lymph node metastasis within the pedicled pericardial fat flap used for bronchial stump coverage. Primary resection of the left lung was carried out 8 months previously because of cancer. Early diagnosis was possible using FDG-PET/CT in the post-operative treatment. The recurrence was successfully treated by en bloc resection and adjuvant radiation.

Interpretive bias in acupuncture research?: A case study. Acupuncture is one of the most widely used and broadly researched of the complementary and alternative therapies, but high-quality trials generally show no benefit over sham acupuncture. Many would view this result as evidence of ineffectiveness for this intervention. This discussion article focuses on the report of a large multicenter randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for chronic low-back pain (CLBP) in the lay and academic press, the ensuing discussion, and its impact on both clinical practice and service provision. The authors suggest that interpretive bias has affected reporting, leading to questionable conclusions and advocacy in favor of this form of care that may exceed the evidence. They also suggest that a lack of understanding of research into the placebo effect may have contributed to confusion in the interpretation of these trials.

RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex. Compelling evidence indicates that the CRISPR-Cas system protects prokaryotes from viruses and other potential genome invaders. This adaptive prokaryotic immune system arises from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) found in prokaryotic genomes, which harbor short invader-derived sequences, and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-coding genes. Here, we have identified a CRISPR-Cas effector complex that is comprised of small invader-targeting RNAs from the CRISPR loci (termed prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs) and the RAMP module (or Cmr) Cas proteins. The psiRNA-Cmr protein complexes cleave complementary target RNAs at a fixed distance from the 3' end of the integral psiRNAs. In Pyrococcus furiosus, psiRNAs occur in two size forms that share a common 5' sequence tag but have distinct 3' ends that direct cleavage of a given target RNA at two distinct sites. Our results indicate that prokaryotes possess a unique RNA silencing system that functions by homology-dependent cleavage of invader RNAs.

[The electronic use of the NANDA-, NOC- and NIC- classifications and implications for nursing practice]. The data model developed on behalf of the Nursing Service Commission of the Canton of Zurich (Pflegedienstkommission des Kantons Zürich) is based on the NANDA nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Outcome Classification, and the Nursing Intervention Classification (NNN Classifications). It also includes integrated functions for cost-centered accounting, service recording, and the Swiss Nursing Minimum Data Set. The data model uses the NNN classifications to map a possible form of the nursing process in the electronic patient health record, where the nurse can choose nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions relevant to the patient situation. The nurses' choice is guided both by the different classifications and their linkages, and the use of specific text components pre-defined for each classification and accessible through the respective linkages. This article describes the developed data model and illustrates its clinical application in a specific patient's situation. Preparatory work required for the implementation of NNN classifications in practical nursing such as content filtering and the creation of linkages between the NNN classifications are described. Against the background of documentation of the nursing process based on the DAPEP(1) data model, possible changes and requirements are deduced. The article provides a contribution to the discussion of a change in documentation of the nursing process by implementing nursing classifications in electronic patient records.

Clinical and molecular genetic aspects of hereditary multiple cutaneous leiomyomatosis. Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome (MCUL; OMIM 150800) is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor predisposition disorder, characterized by leiomyomas of the skin and uterus. When associated with kidney cancer, this syndrome is known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC; OMIM 605839). All disease variants result from heterozygous mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene. Cutaneous leiomyoma can easily be recognized and confirmed by histological examination. Recognition of these benign skin tumors can lead to the diagnosis of MCUL or HLRCC. Timely diagnosis is crucial for offering affected individuals and families potentially life-saving regular prophylactic screening examinations for renal tumors. Here we provide an overview of clinical and genetic features of this complex tumor syndrome and discuss patient management and current therapeutic strategies.

Selenium enrichment of broccoli sprout extract increases chemosensitivity and apoptosis of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Broccoli is a Brassica vegetable that is believed to possess chemopreventive properties. Selenium also shows promise as an anticancer agent. Thus, selenium enrichment of broccoli has the potential to enhance the anticancer properties of broccoli sprouts. Selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts were prepared using a sodium selenite solution. Their anticancer properties were evaluated in human prostate cancer cell lines and compared with those of a control broccoli sprout extract. Selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts were superior to normal broccoli sprouts in inhibiting cell proliferation, decreasing prostate-specific antigen secretion, and inducing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts but, not normal broccoli sprouts, induced a downregulation of the survival Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results suggest that selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts could potentially be used as an alternative selenium source for prostate cancer prevention and therapy.

The prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 in the general population is unknown. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 prevalence estimates are usually based on serological screening of blood donors, pregnant women, and other selected population groups. Previously, data on the global epidemiology of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection have been summarized unsystematically and without a focus on general populations. To assess the implications of the virus for healthcare systems it is essential to know its past and present prevalence. The widely cited estimate that 10-20 million people are infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 worldwide was calculated from data that are now 25 years old. This estimate may therefore no longer reflect the global epidemiology. The objective of this study was to collate published data that are truly representative of the general population through a systematic review of the literature. Fifty-nine relevant studies were identified and the 17 that met the inclusion criteria were all cross-sectional designs; none reported incidence. The prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was highest in the two studies of Japanese islands (36.4%; 95% CI: 29.9-42.8) and lowest in studies from Mongolia, Malaysia and India. In Haiti the prevalence was 3.8% (95% CI: 1.78-5.86); in Africa between 6.6% (95% CI: 4.0-9.9) and 8.5% (95% CI: 6.99-10.10) in Gabon, and 1.05% (95% CI: 0.63-1.47) in Guinea. Only three studies were from West Africa and none were from the South; the only study from India was from the north of the country. We conclude that there is a paucity of general population data from countries in which human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is endemic, and that new studies are required to reevaluate the global burden of infection.

Synthesis of a monophosphoryl derivative of Escherichia coli lipid A and its efficient coupling to a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. Monophosphoryl lipid A is a safe and potent immunostimulant and vaccine adjuvant, which is potentially useful for the development of effective carbohydrate-based conjugate vaccines. This paper presents a convergent and efficient synthesis of a monophosphoryl derivative of E. coli lipid A that has an alkyne functionality at the reducing end, which is suitable for coupling with various molecules. The coupling of this derivative to an N-modified analogue of tumor-associated antigen GM3 through click chemistry is also presented.


Systemic and cerebral hemodynamics during the transitional period after premature birth.

Susceptibility of Trypanosoma evansi to human blood and plasma in infected mice. Around 1900 Laveran and Mesnil discovered that African trypanosomes do not survive in the blood of some primates and humans. The nature of the trypanolytic factor present in these sera has been the focus of a long-standing debate between different groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of T. evansi isolates to therapy using human blood and plasma in experimentally infected mice. Forty-eight 2-month-old female mice (Mus musculus) were divided into six groups of eight animals per group (A, B, C, D, E and F). Plasma was obtained after blood collection in order to perform therapy. Animals from group A (positive control) were inoculated with T. evansi and treated with 0.2mL of saline solution. Animals from groups B and C were infected with the flagellate and received a curative treatment with 0.2mL of human blood (group B) and 0.2mL of human plasma (group C), 24h after infection. Animals from groups D and E received a prophylactic treatment with 0.2mL of human blood and 0.2mL of human plasma, respectively, 24h prior to the infection. Animals from group F (negative control) were not infected and received 0.2mL of saline solution. The four treatments (B, C, D and E) increased animals longevity when compared to group A. Prepatency period was longer in groups D (15 days) and E (37.7 days) under prophylactic immunotherapy. Moreover, no parasites were found in most of the animals 60 days post-inoculation (PI). Besides the longer longevity, treatments were capable of curing 50% of mice of group B, 37.5% of group C, 37.5% of group D and 25% of the animals from group E.


Diagnosis-based differences in response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration in children.

Science, dullness and truth: a rejoinder. In a recent series of polemical editorials in this journal, a scathing and much needed criticism is made of many aspects of current scientific mores, detecting some worrying dysfunctions which threaten the integrity of the whole scientific enterprise. Although the tone is a bit hyperbolic, many important issues are addressed, such as honesty in research, the centrality of truth in science, the role of creativity, just to cite a few. Though agreeing with the overall diagnosis, the discussion still suffers from a lack of a clear and systemic view of science, from which a more precise analysis could be carried out. The presentation is also predicated on a too strong adherence to some popular notions of scientific progress and a somewhat romantic notion of genius. In this paper we address these shortcomings with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of this timely discussion. Though conceding that major structural, historical and cultural shifts might have caused irreversible changes on the way science now evolves, we make some suggestions to counter this trend. These include, among others, the need for an honest and careful dealing with the media and public, to prize and abide by the ethos of science and its underlying values, to cultivate an exact philosophy and to insist that disinterested curiosity and the desire to understand the world are the vital motivations of science.

Intranasal vaccination with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector enhances transgene-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. Helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vectors were developed primarily for genetic disease therapy by deleting all coding regions for attenuating the host cellular immune response to adenovirus (Ad) and long-lasting gene expression. Recently Harui et al. reported that HDAd vaccine could stimulate superior transgene-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses via the intraperitoneal route, compared to first-generation adenoviral (FGAd) vaccine. This prompted us to explore the potential of HDAd as a vaccine vector administrated intranasally. In this study, we prepared HDAd and FGAd vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), respectively, and compared their efficacy in mice. Mice were immunized intranasally with 5x10(9) vp HDAd or FGAd vector particles. Despite stimulating similar anti-Ad antibody responses with FGAd vaccine in the prime/boost strategy, HDAd vector expressing EGFP displayed superior transgene-specific serum IgG, mucosal IgA and cellular immune response, with the characterization of balanced or mixed Th1/Th2 CD4+ T-cell responses. Meanwhile, a single dose of intranasal (i.n.) vaccine of HDAd-EGFP induced a serum IgG response with more efficacy than FGAd-EGFP. In addition, i.n. boost immunization enhanced transgene-specific humoral and cellular responses, compared to single i.n. HDAd-EGFP immunization. Our results suggest that HDAd has potential for a mucosal vaccine vector via i.n. route, which will be useful for the development of vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus.

The pentose-phosphate pathway in neuronal survival against nitrosative stress. Neurons are thought to be particularly vulnerable cells against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) damage (nitrosative stress), due in part to their weak antioxidant defense and low ability to compensate energy homeostasis. Intriguingly, nitrosative stress efficiently stimulates the rate of the antioxidant pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates NADPH a necessary cofactor for the reduction of glutathione disulfide. In fact, inhibition of PPP sensitizes cultured neurons to glutathione oxidation and apoptotic death, whereas its stimulation confers resistance to nitrosative stress. Furthermore, we recently described that neurons can preferentially use glucose through the PPP by inhibiting glycolysis, which is achieved by continuously degrading the glycolytic positive-effector protein, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3) by the action of the E3 ubiquitine ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)(Cdh1). These results suggest that the antioxidant fragility of neurons may be compensated by the PPP at the expense of inhibiting bioenergetic glycolysis.

On the notion of home and the goals of palliative care. The notion of home is well known from our everyday experience, and plays a crucial role in all kinds of narratives about human life, but is hardly ever systematically dealt with in the philosophy of medicine and health care. This paper is based upon the intuitively positive connotation of the term "home." By metaphorically describing the goal of palliative care as "the patient's coming home," it wants to contribute to a medical humanities approach of medicine. It is argued that this metaphor can enrich our understanding of the goals of palliative care and its proper objectives. Four interpretations of "home" and "coming home" are explored: (1) one's own house or homelike environment, (2) one's own body, (3) the psychosocial environment, and (4) the spiritual dimension, in particular, the origin of human existence. Thinking in terms of coming home implies a normative point of view. It represents central human values and refers not only to the medical-technical and care aspects of health care, but also to the moral context.

Does health affect portfolio choice? A number of recent studies find that poor health is empirically associated with a safer portfolio allocation. It is difficult to say, however, whether this relationship is truly causal. Both health status and portfolio choice are influenced by unobserved characteristics such as risk attitudes, impatience, information, and motivation, and these unobserved factors, if not adequately controlled for, can induce significant bias in the estimates of asset demand equations. Using the 1992-2006 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we investigate how much of the connection between health and portfolio choice is causal and how much is due to the effects of unobserved heterogeneity. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity with fixed effects and correlated random effects models, we find that health does not appear to significantly affect portfolio choice among single households. For married households, we find a small effect (about 2-3 percentage points) from being in the lowest of five self-reported health categories.

Atrial enlargement in symptomatic heart block patients with preserved left ventricular function: possibly related to atrioventricular dyssynchrony.

Integration of acupuncture for outpatients and inpatients in a general hospital in Brazil. Acupuncture and related techniques have increasingly been offered in conventional medical settings in Western societies. In Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil, acupuncture has been integrated into the care pathways since October 2005. Since then, medical acupuncture has been offered for both inpatients and outpatients. Acupuncture has become an integrated therapeutic modality both for outpatients in the clinic setting and for inpatients in the wards. It has been observed that acupuncture performed in a hospital differs in specific characteristics when compared with acupuncture performed in an outpatient setting. The main differences found between inpatients and outpatients treatment are summarised and attitudes and cautionary measures to be taken into account during application of acupuncture in inpatients are suggested. Future plans for the service include offering acupuncture in the emergency ward and surgical centre. The description of this experience could encourage other hospitals to develop an acupuncture service.

Should patients undergoing cardiac surgery with atrial fibrillation have left atrial appendage exclusion? A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'Should patients undergoing cardiac surgery with atrial fibrillation (AF) have left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion?' Altogether 310 papers were found using the reported search, of which 12 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that despite finding five clinical trials including one randomised controlled trial, that studied around 1400 patients who underwent LAA occlusion, the results of these studies do not clearly show a benefit for appendage occlusion. Indeed of the five studies, only one showed a statistical benefit for LAA occlusion, with three giving neutral results and in fact one demonstrating a significantly increased risk. One reason for this may be the inability to achieve acceptably high rates of successful occlusion on echocardiography when attempting to perform this procedure. The highest success rate was only 93% but most studies reported only a 55-66% successful occlusion rate when attempting closure in a variety of methods including stapling, ligation and amputation. Currently, the evidence is insufficient to support LAA occlusion and may indeed cause harm especially if incomplete exclusion occurs.

Indications and clinical outcomes for below knee endovascular therapy: review article. Chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) still represents the most common cause for amputation and frequently the possibility for peripheral revascularization, particularly in below knee (BK) arteries, is not adequately evaluated before amputation. This may also be due to the fact that even today, there's some confusion about results of the endovascular treatment in this territory. Diabetics, representing the population most frequently affected by CLI, have specific clinical characteristics, the so called diabetic foot syndrome, which cannot be compared with the situation in nondiabetic patients with ischemic ulcers. Measuring the success of BK endovascular therapy can be a difficult issue, considering that it is often the work of a multidisciplinary team. The clinical benefit of BK endovascular therapy often shows a large discrepancy from the primary patency. While ulcer healing, limb salvage, and reintervention rates are usually low after BK endovascular therapy, rates of restenosis remain excessively high. Nevertheless, the positive impact of revascularization on mortality, which mainly depends on the major amputation rate reduction, is also evident. This review article summarizes indications and clinical outcomes after BK endovascular therapy with special attention to the role of diabetes mellitus in patients with CLI.

The differential effects of pathway- versus target-derived glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on peripheral nerve regeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potent survival effects on central and peripheral nerve populations. The authors examined the differential effects of GDNF following either a sciatic nerve crush injury in mice that overexpressed GDNF in the central or peripheral nervous systems (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-GDNF) or in the muscle target (Myo-GDNF). Adult mice (GFAP-GDNF, Myo-GDNF, or wild-type [WT] animals) underwent sciatic nerve crush and were evaluated using histomorphometry and muscle force and power testing. Uninjured WT animals served as controls. In the sciatic nerve crush, the Myo-GDNF mice demonstrated a higher number of nerve fibers, fiber density, and nerve percentage (p < 0.05) at 2 weeks. The early regenerative response did not result in superlative functional recovery. At 3 weeks, GFAP-GDNF animals exhibit fewer nerve fibers, decreased fiber width, and decreased nerve percentage compared with WT and Myo-GDNF mice (p < 0.05). By 6 weeks, there were no significant differences between groups. Peripheral delivery of GDNF resulted in earlier regeneration following sciatic nerve crush injuries than that with central GDNF delivery. Treatment with neurotrophic factors such as GDNF may offer new possibilities for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.

Increased atrial contribution to left ventricular filling compensates for impaired early filling during exercise in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The role of left atrial (LA) function on exercise remains poorly understood in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HfpEF) despite its key role in optimizing left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. We used resting and exercise radionuclide ventriculography to investigate the role of LA function in the pathophysiology of HfpEF. A total of 25 patients with HfpEF and 15 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. All subjects underwent resting echocardiogram, metabolic exercise testing to peak effort, and radionuclide ventriculography (at rest and exercise [to 35% of heart rate reserve]). At rest LA and LV function were similar in patients and controls. During exercise, HfpEF patients had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (69 +/- 9% vs. 73 +/- 10%, P < .05) and lower peak early filling rate (387 +/- 109 end-diastolic count/sec vs. 561 +/- 156 end-diastolic count/sec, P < .001). During exercise, the atrial contribution to LV filling was significantly higher in patients than controls (46 +/- 11% vs. 30 +/- 9%, P < .001). Atrial contribution to LV filling correlated negatively with peak early filling rate during exercise (r = -0.6, P < .001). Peak early filling rate correlated positively with peak oxygen consumption (r = 0.485, P = .004) and negatively with minute/carbon dioxide production (r = -0.423, P = .013). Patients with HfpEF have increased atrial contribution to LV filling as a compensatory response to impaired early LV filling during cycle exercise.

The importance of histopathologic aspects in the diagnosis of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp or dissecting folliculitis also known as "perifoliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens" (PCAS), is a rare, severe and distinct dermatological disease. It most probably occurs because of follicular occlusion via hyperkeratosis, having the same mechanism of acnea conglobata and hidradenitis suppurativa. These dermatoses may be associated or may have an isolated evolution. PCAS is one of the primitive cicatricial alopecia of neutrophilic type (with pustules). What is characteristic for the histopathologic picture of the disease is the deep inflammatory infiltrate, placed at the reticular derm or hypoderm level. The initial perifolliculitis evolves towards forming profound abscesses and the destruction of polysebaceous follicles because of granuloma, usually lymphoplasmocitary and with gigantic cells. Here is the case of a 24-year-old male with records of acne conglobata and cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, with relapsed inflammatory nodular lesions on the surface of the alopecic plaques and follicular pustules on their margin. The patient had followed before hospitalizing a systemic treatment with antibiotics (azithromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, in therapeutic schemes that the patient cannot mention, but anyway of short time) and after that a treatment with retinoids (isotretinoin, 20-30 mg/day, in two successive therapies of one month each). The evolution of the disease under these treatments was with outbreaks and short times of remission of the acne lesions and nodular lesions of the scalp. The clinical diagnosis of PCAS is difficult, especially in the initial stage of the disease, as it was the case of the patient presented here. We underline the importance of a correct history of the disease, of the complete clinical exams and the need of paraclinical investigations (histopathologic exam from the lesional biopsy - microscopy and immunohistochemistry) in order to come with a positive diagnosis of PCAS and a differential one.

Genetic diversity of Saccharum officinarum accessions in Pakistan as revealed by random amplified polymorphic DNA. Genetic diversity of 20 sugarcane accessions in Pakistan was studied using 21 random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The mean genetic distance between the cultivars was 39.03%, demonstrating that a large part of the genome is similar among the accessions. This probably arises from a lack of parental diversity, with few clones, which are themselves related, contributing to the parentage of these varieties. Among the varieties, none was found to be totally distinct and divergent from the others. We conclude that the current Pakistan commercial varieties have a limited genetic base and that there is a need to diversify commercial sugarcane lines in Pakistan by introducing new germplasm sources.

Angiogenesis inhibition by a lichen compound olivetoric acid. Lichens have been used in folk medicine for centuries and are symbiotic organisms of fungi and algae that produce unique secondary metabolites. Olivetoric acid is one of these secondary metabolites. In the present study, the effect of olivetoric acid isolated from acetone extract of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. ceratea) on angiogenesis was evaluated. It displayed potent anti-angiogenic activities in vitro: inhibited proliferation of rat adipose tissue endothelial cells (RATECs) and disrupted endothelial tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, dose-dependent depolymerization effects of olivetoric acid on F-actin stress fibers were observed. Decrease in the tube formation of RATECs by olivetoric acid might be explained by a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings suggest that olivetoric acid is a new anti-angiogenic agent and can be developed as a new therapeutic agent for angiogenesis-related diseases.

Paliperidone palmitate, a potential long-acting treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the investigational long-acting injectable antipsychotic agent paliperidone palmitate (PP) in the treatment of schizophrenia. Patients were randomized to receive gluteal injections of placebo or PP (50 or 100 mg eq., fixed doses), without oral supplementation, on days 1, 8, and 36 (9-wk, double-blind phase) in this phase 2b study. Patients (n=197, intent-to-treat analysis set) were 62% men, mean (s.d.) age 39 (10) yr, with a baseline mean (s.d.) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 87.0 (12.5). Mean (s.d.) PANSS total scores showed significant improvement at endpoint (primary measure) for both the PP 50 mg eq. [-5.2 (21.5)] and PP 100 mg eq. [-7.8 (19.4)] groups, vs. placebo [6.2 (18.3)] (p0.001, each dose vs. placebo). This improvement was detected by day 8 and maintained to endpoint (p0.011) for both doses. In the safety analysis set (n=247), fewer PP-treated patients (2%) discontinued for treatment-emergent adverse events vs. placebo-treated (10%). Rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome-related adverse events were comparable between active treatment and placebo, with the exception of parkinsonism-related disorders (50 mg eq. 5%, 100 mg eq. 8%, placebo 1%). Results of other safety measures suggest PP to be generally well-tolerated. Throughout the study, investigators rated injection-site pain as absent (56-71%), mild (24-39%), moderate (2-12%), or severe (0-2%). PP (50 and 100 mg eq. doses) administered as a gluteal intramuscular injection was efficacious and generally tolerated in these patients with acute symptomatic schizophrenia.

The application of laser scanning confocal microscopy to the examination of hairs and textile fibers: an initial investigation. An initial investigation of the application of laser scanning confocal microscopy to the examination of hairs and fibers has been conducted. This technique allows the production of virtual transverse and longitudinal cross-sectional images of a wide range of hairs and fibers. Special mounting techniques are not required; specimens that have been mounted for conventional microscopy require no further treatment. Unlike physical cross-sectioning, in which it is difficult to produce multiple cross-sections from a single hair or fiber and the process is destructive, confocal microscopy allows the examiner to image the cross-section at any point in the field of view along the hair or fiber and it is non-destructive. Confocal microscopy is a fluorescence-based technique. The images described in this article were collected using only the autofluorescence exhibited by the specimen (i.e. fluorescence staining was not necessary). Colorless fibers generally and hairs required excitation at 405 nm in order to stimulate useful autofluorescence; longer wavelength excitation was suitable for dyed fibers. Although confocal microscopy was found to be generally applicable to the generation virtual transverse cross-sections from a wide range of hairs and fibers, on some occasions the autofluorescence signal was attenuated by heavy pigmentation or the presence of an opaque medulla in hairs, and by heavy delustering or the presence of air-filled voids in the case of fibers. In these situations only partial cross-sections were obtained.

Neuronal subtype specification within a lineage by opposing temporal feed-forward loops. Neural progenitors generate distinct cell types at different stages, but the mechanisms controlling these temporal transitions are poorly understood. In the Drosophila CNS, a cascade of transcription factors, the "temporal gene cascade," has been identified that acts to alter progenitor competence over time. However, many CNS lineages display broad temporal windows, and it is unclear how broad windows progress into subwindows that generate unique cell types. We have addressed this issue in an identifiable Drosophila CNS lineage and find that a broad castor temporal window is subdivided by two different feed-forward loops, both of which are triggered by castor itself. The first loop acts to specify a unique cell fate, whereas the second loop suppresses the first loop, thereby allowing for the generation of alternate cell fates. This mechanism of temporal and "subtemporal" genes acting in opposing feed-forward loops may be used by many stem cell lineages to generate diversity.

Increased meal frequency does not promote greater weight loss in subjects who were prescribed an 8-week equi-energetic energy-restricted diet. There have been reports of an inverse relationship between meal frequency (MF) and adiposity. It has been postulated that this may be explained by favourable effects of increased MF on appetite control and possibly on gut peptides as well. The main goal of the present study was to investigate whether using a high MF could lead to a greater weight loss than that obtained with a low MF under conditions of similar energy restriction. Subjects were randomised into two treatment arms (high MF = 3 meals+3 snacks/d or low MF = 3 meals/d) and subjected to the same dietary energy restriction of - 2931 kJ/d for 8 weeks. Sixteen obese adults (n 8 women and 8 men; age 34.6 (sd 9.5); BMI 37.1 (sd 4.5) kg/m2) completed the study. Overall, there was a 4.7 % decrease in body weight (P < 0.01); similarly, significant decreases were noted in fat mass ( - 3.1 (sd 2.9) kg; P < 0.01), lean body mass ( - 2.0 (sd 3.1) kg; P < 0.05) and BMI ( - 1.7 (sd 0.8) kg/m2; P < 0.01). However, there were NS differences between the low- and high-MF groups for adiposity indices, appetite measurements or gut peptides (peptide YY and ghrelin) either before or after the intervention. We conclude that increasing MF does not promote greater body weight loss under the conditions described in the present study.

Effect of episodic hypoxia on the susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnea during NREM sleep. We hypothesized that episodic hypoxia (EH) leads to alterations in chemoreflex characteristics that might promote the development of central apnea in sleeping humans. We used nasal noninvasive positive pressure mechanical ventilation to induce hypocapnic central apnea in 11 healthy participants during stable nonrapid eye movement sleep before and after an exposure to EH, which consisted of fifteen 1-min episodes of isocapnic hypoxia (mean O(2) saturation/episode: 87.0 +/- 0.5%). The apneic threshold (AT) was defined as the absolute measured end-tidal PCO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) demarcating the central apnea. The difference between the AT and baseline Pet(CO(2)) measured immediately before the onset of mechanical ventilation was defined as the CO(2) reserve. The change in minute ventilation (V(I)) for a change in Pet(CO(2)) (DeltaV(I)/ DeltaPet(CO(2))) was defined as the hypocapnic ventilatory response. We studied the eupneic Pet(CO(2)), AT Pet(CO(2)), CO(2) reserve, and hypocapnic ventilatory response before and after the exposure to EH. We also measured the hypoxic ventilatory response, defined as the change in V(I) for a corresponding change in arterial O(2) saturation (DeltaV(I)/DeltaSa(O(2))) during the EH trials. V(I) increased from 6.2 +/- 0.4 l/min during the pre-EH control to 7.9 +/- 0.5 l/min during EH and remained elevated at 6.7 +/- 0.4 l/min the during post-EH recovery period (P < 0.05), indicative of long-term facilitation. The AT was unchanged after EH, but the CO(2) reserve declined significantly from -3.1 +/- 0.5 mmHg pre-EH to -2.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg post-EH (P < 0.001). In the post-EH recovery period, DeltaV(I)/DeltaPet(CO(2)) was higher compared with the baseline (3.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1), P < 0.001), indicative of an increased hypocapnic ventilatory response. However, there was no significant change in the hypoxic ventilatory response (DeltaV(I)/DeltaSa(O(2))) during the EH period itself. In conclusion, despite the presence of ventilatory long-term facilitation, the increase in the hypocapnic ventilatory response after the exposure to EH induced a significant decrease in the CO(2) reserve. This form of respiratory plasticity may destabilize breathing and promote central apneas.

Effects of ear-canal pressurization on middle-ear bone- and air-conduction responses. In extremely loud noise environments, it is important to not only protect one's hearing against noise transmitted through the air-conduction (AC) pathway, but also through the bone-conduction (BC) pathways. Much of the energy transmitted through the BC pathways is concentrated in the mid-frequency range around 1.5-2 kHz, which is likely due to the structural resonance of the middle ear. One potential approach for mitigating this mid-frequency BC noise transmission is to introduce a positive or negative static pressure in the ear canal, which is known to reduce BC as well as AC hearing sensitivity. In the present study, middle-ear ossicular velocities at the umbo and stapes were measured using human cadaver temporal bones in response to both BC and AC excitations, while static air pressures of +/-400 mm H(2)O were applied in the ear canal. For the maximum negative pressure of -400 mm H(2)O, mean BC stapes-velocity reductions of about 5-8 dB were observed in the frequency range from 0.8 to 2.5 kHz, with a peak reduction of 8.6(+/-4.7)dB at 1.6 kHz. Finite-element analysis indicates that the peak BC-response reduction tends to be in the mid-frequency range because the middle-ear BC resonance, which is typically around 1.5-2 kHz, is suppressed by the pressure-induced stiffening of the middle-ear structure. The measured data also show that the BC responses are reduced more for negative static pressures than for positive static pressures. This may be attributable to a difference in the distribution of the stiffening among the middle-ear components depending on the polarity of the static pressure. The characteristics of the BC-response reductions are found to be largely consistent with the available psychoacoustic data, and are therefore indicative of the relative importance of the middle-ear mechanism in BC hearing.

Natural history of growth and body composition in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), growth impairment and altered body composition, including disturbed skeletal development, are well-known long-term complications. Data on longitudinal growth in patients with systemic and polyarticular JIA reveal growth impairment in the active phases of the disease. With reduction in disease activity and lower glucocorticoid (GC) doses, some patients experience 'catch-up' growth; however, many have only a slight improvement in height standard deviation during puberty or after cessation of GC treatment. The consequence is a final height below the 3rd percentile and below the genetic height potential. Although few studies have specifically addressed body composition in children with JIA, studies on the development of bone mass have described notable deficits in both GC-treated and GC-naïve children. In recent years, the deficits in bone mass have been related, in part, to the deficits in muscle mass, which are prevalent in these patients. The major goal for physicians caring for patients with JIA is optimal disease control while maintaining normal growth. Early recognition of patients who develop prolonged growth disturbances and altered body composition is important as these abnormalities contribute to long-term morbidity and need to be addressed both diagnostically and therapeutically when treating children with JIA.

The endometrial-endometriotic stromal cells were isolated from ectopic (group I) and eutopic (group II) endometrium by established methods, cultured, and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL), followed by atorvastatin treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner to investigate the effects of LPS on proliferation (Ki-67) and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), extracellular newly identified RAGE binding protein (EN-RAGE), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), and liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) genes in endometrial-endometriotic stromal cells and on levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and 17β-E(2) in endometrial-endometriotic stromal cell culture supernatant. Significant inhibition of Ki-67 and LPS-induced expression of inflammatory and angiogenic genes (COX-2, VEGF, RAGE, and EN-RAGE) was observed in atorvastatin-treated endometrial-endometriotic stromal cells. In contrast, a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in expression of anti-inflammatory genes (PPAR-γ and LXR-α) and levels of IGFBP-1 was observed after atorvastatin treatment in both the groups. However, atorvastatin treatment had no effect on 17β-E(2) levels in endometrial/endometriotic stromal cell culture supernatant. The data of the present study provide new insights for the implication of atorvastatin treatment for endometriosis in humans.

Cortisol release and heart rate variability in horses during road transport. Based on plasma cortisol concentrations it is widely accepted that transport is stressful to horses. So far, cortisol release during transport has not been evaluated in depth by non-invasive techniques such as analysis of salivary cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites. Transport also causes changes in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, salivary cortisol, faecal cortisol metabolites, heart rate and HRV in horses transported by road for short (one and 3.5 h) and medium duration (8 h) were determined. With the onset of transport, salivary cortisol increased immediately but highest concentrations were measured towards the end of transport (4.1+/-1.6, 4.5+/-2.6, 6.5+/-1.8 ng/ml in horses transported for one, 3.5 and 8 h, respectively). Faecal cortisol metabolite concentrations did not change during transport, but 1 day after transport for 3.5 and 8 h had increased significantly (p<0.01), reflecting intestinal passage time. Compared to salivary cortisol, changes in faecal cortisol metabolites were less pronounced. Heart rate increased and beat-to-beat (RR) interval decreased (p<0.05) with the onset of transport. Standard deviation of heart rate increased while root mean square of successive RR differences (RMSSD) decreased in horses transported for 3.5 (from 74+/-5 to 45+/-6 ms) and 8 h (from 89.7+/-7 to 59+/-7 ms), indicating a reduction in vagal tone. In conclusion, transport of horses over short and medium distances leads to increased cortisol release and changes in heart rate and HRV indicative of stress. The degree of these changes is related to the duration of transport. Salivary cortisol is a sensitive parameter to detect transient changes in cortisol release.

Confirmatory analysis of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and glucuronide metabolites in plasma by LCMSMS. Application to umbilical cord plasma from buprenorphine-maintained pregnant women. An LCMSMS method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous quantification of buprenorphine (BUP), norbuprenorphine (NBUP), buprenorphine-glucuronide (BUP-Gluc), and norbuprenorphine-glucuronide (NBUP-Gluc) in 0.5mL plasma, fulfilling confirmation criteria with two transitions for each compound with acceptable relative ion intensities. Transitions monitored were 468.3>396.2 and 468.3>414.3 for BUP, 414.3>340.1 and 414.3>326.0 for NBUP, 644.3>468.1 and 644.3>396.3 for BUP-Gluc, and 590.3>414.3 and 590.3>396.2 for NBUP-Gluc. Linearity was 0.1-50ng/mL for BUP and BUP-Gluc, and 0.5-50ng/mL for NBUP and NBUP-Gluc. Intra-day, inter-day, and total assay imprecision (%RSD) were <16.8%, and analytical recoveries were 88.6-108.7%. Extraction efficiencies ranged from 71.1 to 87.1%, and process efficiencies 48.7 to 127.7%. All compounds showed ion enhancement, except BUP-Gluc that demonstrated ion suppression: variation between 10 different blank plasma specimens was <9.1%. In six umbilical cord plasma specimens from opioid-dependent pregnant women receiving 14-24mg/day BUP, NBUP-Gluc was the predominant metabolite (29.8+/-7.6ng/mL), with BUP-Gluc (4.6+/-4.8ng/mL), NBUP (1.5+/-0.8ng/mL) and BUP (0.4+/-0.2ng/mL). Although BUP biomarkers can be quantified in umbilical cord plasma in low ng/mL concentrations, the significance of these data as predictors of neonatal outcomes is currently unknown.

Adipose tissue derived stem cells secretome: soluble factors and their roles in regenerative medicine. Stem cells have been long looked at as possible therapeutic vehicles for different health related problems. Among the different existing stem cell populations, Adipose- derived Stem Cells (ASCs) have been gathering attention in the last 10 years. When compared to other stem cells populations and sources, ASCs can be easily isolated while providing simultaneously higher yields upon the processing of adipose tissue. Similar to other stem cell populations, it was initially thought that the main potential of ASCs for regenerative medicine approaches was intimately related to their differentiation capability. Although this is true, there has been an increasing body of literature describing the trophic effects of ASCs on the protection, survival and differentiation of variety of endogenous cells/tissues. Moreover, they have also shown to possess an immunomodulatory character. This effect is closely related to the ASCs' secretome and the soluble factors found within it. Molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factors, interleukins (ILs) 6, 7, 8 and 11, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), adipokines and others have been identified within the ASCs' secretome. Due to its importance regarding future applications for the field of regenerative medicine, we aim, in the present review, to make a comprehensive analysis of the literature relating to the ASCs' secretome and its relevance to the immune and central nervous system, vascularization and cardiac regeneration. The concluding section will highlight some of the major challenges that remain before ASCs can be used for future clinical applications.

[Susceptibility of the parasitoid Phymastichus coffea LaSalle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) to Beauveria bassiana under laboratory conditions]. The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the most important coffee pest worldwide. Beauveria bassiana is a generalist entomopathogenic fungus widely used by coffee farmers to control this pest and Phymastichus coffea LaSalle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is an African endoparasitoid of H. hampei adults, recently imported to several Latin American and Caribbean countries to aid in the coffee berry borer control. The objective of this study was to determine if B. bassiana is detrimental to P. coffea. The susceptibility of the parasitoid was evaluated in terms of adult survivorship, mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), reproduction and immature mortality. The main effect of the fungus resulted in reduction of adult longevity and mortality of 100% for immature stages of this parasitoid. The LC50 for adults was 0.11% equivalent to 9.53 x 10(7) conidia/ml of B. bassiana and a LT50 of 29.4h, equivalent to reduction of 22% of its normal longevity as an adult. P. coffea was capable of disseminating spores of B. bassiana to non-infected H. hampei adults, which could indirectly cause the death of its own progeny. These results could be valuable when considering the use of both organisms in the field, especially in an integrated pest management program.

The effect of combined treatment with morphine sulphate and low-dose ketamine in a prehospital setting. Pain is a common condition among prehospital patients. The present study is designed to determine whether adding low-dose ketamine as additional analgesia improves the pain/nausea scores and hemodynamic parameters compared to morphine sulphate alone among patients with bone fractures. Prospective, prehospital clinical cohort study. Twenty-seven patients were included with acute pain. Eleven patients received morphine sulphate 0.2 mg/kg (M-group) and 16 patients received morphine sulphate 0.1 mg/kg combined with 0.2 mg/kg ketamine (MK-group). Scores for pain, nausea, sedation (AVPU) and the haemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressures (BP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at rescue scene before the start of analgesia and subsequently to admission at hospital. Mean treatment time 46 +/- 17 minutes in the M-group and 56 +/- 11 minutes in the MK-group, respectively (ns). Mean doses of morphine sulphate in the M-group were 13.5 +/- 3.2 mg versus 7.0 +/- 1.5 mg in the MK-group. The mean additional doses of ketamine in the MK-group were 27.9 +/- 11.4 mg. There were significantly differences between the M- and the MK-group according to NRS scores for pain (5.4 +/- 1.9 versus 3.1 +/- 1.4) and BP (134 +/- 21 mmHg versus 167 +/- 32 mmHg) at admission at hospital, respectively (P < 0.05). All patients were Alert or respond to Voice and the results were similar between the groups. One patient versus 4 patients reported nausea in the M- and MK-group, respectively, and 3 patients vomited in the Mk-group (ns). We conclude that morphine sulphate with addition of small doses of ketamine provide adequate pain relief in patients with bone fractures, with an increase in systolic blood pressure, but without significant side effects.

Managing dyspepsia in primary care. NICE recommends immediate referral for patients with dyspepsia and significant acute GI bleeding and urgent specialist referral for investigation if any of the following alarm symptoms are present: progressive difficulty swallowing; chronic GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss; persistent vomiting; abdominal mass; iron deficiency anaemia; suspicious findings on barium meal. Patients aged > 55 with unexplained and persistent dyspepsia, despite H. pylori testing and acid suppression therapy, should also be considered for endoscopy, as should those with previous gastric ulcer or surgery, continuing need for NSAIDs or raised risk of gastric cancer. Patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia should be managed by empirical treatment with a PPI or testing for and treating H. pylori if present. Testing by urea breath test, stool antigen test, or locally validated lab-based serology is suggested. H. pylori eradication is usually given as triple therapy, for seven days, involving a PPI, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or metronidazole. It is important to take a thorough history and to enquire about any medication the patient is taking. Drugs that are common culprits for dyspepsia include: NSAIDs; calcium antagonists; bisphosphonates; steroids; theophyllines; nitrates. NSAIDs can also cause GI bleeding. Absence of dyspepsia in patients taking NSAIDs does not indicate a reduced risk of bleeding. Peptic ulcers fall into three categories: H. pylori associated ulcers; drug-induced ulcers (particularly NSAIDs); and ulcers in H. pylori-negative patients not taking causative medication. H. pylori is associated with both gastric and duodenal ulcer disease but it is in the duodenum where the closest relationship exists. In any 6-12 month period, 20-40% of healthy people, more commonly men, will experience symptoms of heartburn. Oesophageal reflux can progress to more serious disease such as erosive oesophagitis, stricture or Barrett's oesophagus.

Computational characterization of Plasmodium falciparum proteomic data for screening of potential vaccine candidates. Advancement in the field of proteomics and bioinformatics offers tremendous opportunities for the development of novel epitope-based effective vaccine against human malaria. In this study, we have characterized 25 antigens as a vaccine candidate and screened the potential T-lymphocyte epitopes presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -DR molecules based on the proteomic data of Plasmodium falciparum. Of the 25 proteins, 22 were predicted as probable antigens and two were predicted as adhesions. In addition, seven proteins were predicted to contain signal peptide for secretary pathway and six proteins were found similar to the human and mouse reference proteins, whereas none of the proteins were predicted as allergen. A total of 14,841 peptides were predicted as epitope, presented by HLA class I and II supertypes that covered a broad human population (approximately 95%). Our results suggest that HLA-based multistage and multiepitope malaria vaccine would likely be needed to induce broader CD8(+) as well as CD4(+) T-cell responses. The predicted epitopes may be served as a useful diagnostic reagent for evaluating T-cell responses in the context of natural infection and/or vaccine trials.

Influence of mass-transfer limitations on carbon isotope fractionation during microbial dechlorination of trichloroethene. Mass transfer of organic contaminants from nonaqueous phase liquids to the aqueous phase can significantly modulate the observable carbon isotope fractionation behavior associated with contaminant transformation. We evaluated the effects of kinetic interphase mass transfer between tetradecane and water on the observable (13)C enrichment factor, epsilon(obs), pertinent to the reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) by Sulfurospirillum sp. in laboratory batch model systems containing organic, aqueous and gaseous phases. We propose a conceptual model, which includes the kinetics of tetradecane-water and gas-water mass transfer, microbial growth, and isotope-sensitive parameters describing dehalorespiration, for quantifying variable (13)C enrichment factors. While the C isotope fractionation of TCE reduction to cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) in the absence of phase-transfer effects can be characterized by a constant epsilon-value of -18.8 +/- 0.6 per thousand, mass-transfer limitations impede describing this process with a constant enrichment factor typically used in Rayleigh equations. Owing to the masking of kinetic isotope effects by the transfer of TCE from tetradecane to the aqueous phase, (obs)-values gradually changed from -18.4 per thousand to -5.9 per thousand. Such variations may complicate the interpretation of compound-specific isotope analysis in the assessment of chloroethene biodegradation in field applications.

A conserved gene regulatory network subcircuit drives different developmental fates in the vegetal pole of highly divergent echinoderm embryos. Comparisons of orthologous developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from different organisms explain how transcriptional regulation can, or cannot, change over time to cause morphological evolution and stasis. Here, we examine a subset of the GRN connections in the central vegetal pole mesoderm of the late sea star blastula and compare them to the GRN for the same embryonic territory of sea urchins. In modern sea urchins, this territory gives rise to skeletogenic mesoderm; in sea stars, it develops into other mesodermal derivatives. Orthologs of many transcription factors that function in the sea urchin skeletogenic mesoderm are co-expressed in the sea star vegetal pole, although this territory does not form a larval skeleton. Systematic perturbation of erg, hex, tbr, and tgif gene function was used to construct a snapshot of the sea star mesoderm GRN. A comparison of this network to the sea urchin skeletogenic mesoderm GRN revealed a conserved, recursively wired subcircuit operating in both organisms. We propose that, while these territories have evolved different functions in sea urchins and sea stars, this subcircuit is part of an ancestral GRN governing echinoderm vegetal pole mesoderm development. The positive regulatory feedback between these transcription factors may explain the conservation of this subcircuit.

Axillary and intramammary lymphadenopathy caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease mimicking malignant lymphoma. We describe a rare case of intramammary and axillary lymphadenopathy caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). A 30-year-old woman presented with enlarged axillary lymph nodes and a right breast mass with tenderness. Computed tomography, ultrasonography, F-2-deoxy-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography and fine-needle aspiration cytology were performed, and malignant lymphoma (ML) was suspected. Histological diagnosis of a needle biopsy and surgical specimen showed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. It is important to differentiate KFD from ML because of differences in treatment choice and clinical outcome.

[Alcohol drinking patterns and sleep quality of Japanese civil servants]. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether alcohol drinking patterns were associated with sleep quality. A cross-sectional survey was carried out by self-administered questionnaire in 2008 among 2,118 employees aged 18 to 65 years working in local government in Toyama. After excluding those without relevant data for this study, 661 men and 618 women represented the study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether alcohol drinking patterns (as measured by the frequency, the amount of alcohol per day and the timing of alcohol drinking) were associated with poor sleep quality (as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), after adjustment for potential confounding factors: age, family structure, work characteristics (as measured by the job-demand-control-support model, shift work and occupational class), chronic disease, body mass index, smoking status and physical activity. In comparison with men who did not drink, the adjusted odds ratio for poor sleep quality was 0.52 (95%confidence interval: 0.32-0.85) for those who drank alcohol once a week or more, 0.32 (0.13-0.84) for those who drank 1-3 glasses daily, 0.30 (0.13-0.70) for those who drank 7-14 glasses per week, 0.37 (0.17-0.77) for those who drank only at meals. In women, the drinking patterns were not significantly associated with sleep quality. The results of this study suggest that some alcohol drinking patterns may affect sleep quality among men who do not use sleeping medicine.

Congenital absence of the cecal appendix. Case report. Agenesis of the vermiform appendix is very rare and was first described by Morgagni in 1718. The estimated incidence is 1/100,000 laparotomies performed for suspected appendicitis. This case is reported with the aim of attracting the attention of surgeons who may be in a similar situation during laparotomy. A 48-year-old male was admitted through the emergency room with the complaint of vague abdominal pain most marked in the epigastrium and mesogastrium which, 4 h after it began, was located in the right iliac fossa and was accompanied by hyporexia, nausea, vomiting and fever. During physical examination, the patient was febrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic, with decreased peristalsis, abdomen painful to palpation and percussion in the right iliac fossa. There were positive appendicular signs. Blood panel showed leukocytosis (14,000), neutrophilia (89.60%) and lymphopenia (5.33%). X-rays of the abdomen showed no abnormalities. We made a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the patient underwent celioscopy where surgical findings were reported as type IV Collins appendiceal agenesis and concomitant mesenteric adenitis. Several criteria must be determined before the surgeon can conclude that the appendix is congenitally absent. Diagnosis should not be confirmed until the ileo- and retrocecal regions have been explored.

"The healthy me appears": palliative cancer patients' experiences of participation in a physical group exercise program. Tentative results from a pilot study showed that patients with advanced cancer were willing and able to take part in a group exercise intervention. Limited knowledge exists, though, about the meaning and significance of such programs. The purpose of the present study was to understand the meaning of such an intervention for the individual participant and thereby to provide knowledge for shaping future clinical practice. Thirty-four palliative cancer patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year completed a 6-week group exercise program. Five randomly selected individuals were interviewed 7 months after completion. Results from a self-report evaluation questionnaire identified relevant themes that formed the basis of an interview guide. These were addressed in a semistructured interview. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed with a phenomenological-hermeneutical approach. Two main themes emerged from the interviews: (1) perceptions of the group and (2) a secure and caring setting for the group. Themes identified regarding perception of the group were a sense of belonging and commitment. Themes identified regarding a secure and caring setting for the group were a life-empowering group as a setting for enhancing coping, the qualifications of those who led the group, and a public gym as an unsuitable setting. Our study indicates that an individually adjusted group exercise program, with competent leaders, can provide a setting to enhance psychological well-being in cancer patients with life expectancy below 1 year. Small sample size, however, limits the possibility to generalize the findings.

Investigations on the leaching behaviour of irrigated construction elements.

Newborns' cord blood plasma cotinine concentrations are similar to that of their delivering smoking mothers. In utero exposure to constituents of tobacco smoke has perinatal and postnatal health consequences. Umbilical cord plasma cotinine levels have been shown to correlate with self-reported daily number of cigarettes at the end of pregnancy, but the exact relationship between maternal and newborn plasma cotinine (and nicotine) is unknown. Concentrations of cotinine, nicotine's main metabolite, were determined in venous blood of delivering mothers and in arterial umbilical cord blood of their newborns at birth. Data from eighteen mother-newborn dyads were analyzed. The mothers smoked 95.1 (SD=96, range 10-420) cigarettes the week preceding delivery. Their mean plasma cotinine concentration at delivery was 106 ng/mL (SD=53, range 17-245) and the newborns' mean umbilical cord plasma cotinine was 88.2 ng/mL (SD=53, range 10-198, p<0.001). The difference can be explained by the elimination time of around 6h which occurred between sampling in mothers and in umbilical cord blood. Arterial umbilical cord blood plasma cotinine was highly associated with that of the smoking mothers: y=0.79x+0.97, Rsq=0.95, p<0.001. Maternal and newborn plasma cotinine concentrations are strongly associated. There is probably no placental barrier for plasma cotinine between pregnant mothers and their newborns. Lack of a placental barrier for cotinine (and probably nicotine) can partially explain smoking related perinatal disorders.

Idling time of swimming bacteria near particulate surfaces contributes to apparent adsorption coefficients at the macroscopic scale under static conditions. Static capillary assays were performed to observe the distribution of Escherichia coli and several mutant strains at the interface between an aqueous solution and a Gelrite particulate suspension, used as a model porous medium. Motile smooth-swimming mutant bacteria (E. coli HCB437) accumulated at the interface, but did not penetrate very far into the Gelrite suspension. Motile wild-type bacteria (E. coli HCB1) penetrated much further than the smooth-swimming mutant, but did not accumulate to the same extent at the interface. Nonmotile tumbly mutant bacteria (E. coli HCB359) did not accumulate or penetrate to a significant degree. Computer simulations using a Monte Carlo algorithm, with input parameters based on bacterial swimming properties in static bulk aqueous systems, appeared to underestimate the bacterial idling time associated with solid surfaces. To account for physicochemical, biological and geometrical influences, an additional component of the bacterial idling time was included. The third component of the idling time was further analyzed semiquantitatively with a 1-D population-scale transport model with first-order association (k(on)) and dissociation (k(off)) adsorption-like kinetics. Computer simulation results suggested that this additional bacterial idling time not only increased the magnitudes of k(on) and k(off), but also enhanced the ratio of k(on) to k(off). This further implies that motile bacteria may tend to accumulate at the boundaries of low-permeable regions in groundwater systems, which is beneficial for bioremediation of residual contamination that may not be accessible by conventional remediation approaches.

Weight management, psychological distress and binge eating in obesity. A reappraisal of the problem.

Reconciling disparate models of the involvement of vinyl radicals in cobalamin-mediated dechlorination reactions. Inner-sphere (nonradical) and outer-sphere (radical-based) mechanisms have been suggested for cobalamin-mediated dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). In this study, the role of free vinyl radicals was investigated using deuterated radical traps: d(8)-isopropanol and d(8)-tetrahydrofuran. For both substrates, addition of trap resulted in production of deuterated dechlorination products, and higher concentrations of trap resulted in increased amounts of deuterated products. However, only a finite proportion of the products were trappable: 8% of the PCE-derived products and 86% of the TCE-derived products result from free radicals. The data show that the reaction does not proceed solely by either an inner-sphere or an outer-sphere mechanism and led to the hypothesis that caged radical intermediates were involved in the mechanism. The untrappable fraction of products are hypothesized to result from in-cage reactions. This hypothesis was investigated using d(5)-glycerol as a radical trap and viscogen. Although increased viscosity resulted in decreased formation of free-radical-derived products, consistent with the cage hypothesis, these data were inconclusive. The role of d(8)-isopropanol in enhancing the production of radicals in this system via an acetone ketyl radical chain mechanism was also investigated, and no evidence for such an effect was found.

Adolescent eating disorders: treatment and response in a naturalistic study. This naturalistic study investigated the treatment and outcome of adolescents with eating disorders (EDs) in the community. Clinicians from a practice-research network provided data on ED symptoms, global functioning, comorbidity, treatment, and outcome for 120 adolescents with EDs. ED "not otherwise specified" was the most common ED diagnosed. After an average of 8 months of treatment, about one third of patients had recovered, with patients with anorexia nervosa showing the most improvement. Clinicians utilized a range of psychotherapy interventions and two thirds of the patients had received adjunct psychoactive medication. Although CBT showed the strongest association with outcome in a subsample characterized by poor relational/personality functioning, dynamic therapy was associated with better global outcome in the overall sample.

Thioredoxin system modulation by plant and fungal secondary metabolites. Thioredoxin (Trx) is the major cellular protein disulfide reductase in a broad range of organisms, including humans. Trx, together with glutaredoxin (Grx), plays critical roles in the regulation of cellular protein redox homeostasis. Reduced thioredoxin transfers reducing equivalents to disulphides in target proteins, leading to reversible oxidation of its active centre dithiol to a disulphide. The resulting disulphide bridge is, in turn, reduced to a dithiol by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Increasing attention has been paid to the role of Trx, as it has been shown to be a signalling intermediate beyond its intrinsic antioxidant activity. Indeed, this protein acts as a growth factor, activates a number of transcription factors regulating cell growth and survival, acts as cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, and promotes angiogenesis. In addition, Trx have been demonstrated to cooperatively inhibit programmed cell death. Because of the multiple roles of Trx system in tumorigenesis, this protein represents an emerging target for anti-cancer drugs. Several Trx system modulators have been identified: a semi-synthetic Trx inhibitor, PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide), has been placed in a clinical trial. However, there is a growing interest in finding new selective ones. Natural products continue to provide structurally complex, but highly original lead structures for drug discovery programs: polyphenols, quinones, and terpenoids showed to affect the Trx/TrxR system at different levels. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the plant and fungal secondary metabolites interfering with Trx and TrxR activities, paying particularly attention on their mechanism of action. Among polyphenols, curcumin and some flavonoids such as myricetin and quercetin, have been identified as potential anticancer agents with a mechanism of action that may be mediated by the Trx system.

Isolation of multipotent stem cells in human periodontal ligament using stage-specific embryonic antigen-4. The periodontal ligament (PDL) comprises adult stem cells, which are responsible for periodontal tissue regeneration. In the present study, we investigated the specific profile of the stem cells in the human PDL. Microscopic analysis demonstrated that PDL cells showed a fibroblastic appearance, forming flat and loose aggregates. PDL cells expressed embryonic stem cell-associated antigens (SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and REX1, and alkaline phosphatase activity), as well as conventional mesenchymal stem cell markers. When PDL cells were cultured in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid, the numbers of SSEA-3+ and SSEA-4+ PDL cells were significantly decreased, while that of SSEA-1+ was increased. SSEA-4+ PDL cells showed a greater telomere length and growth rate. SSEA-4+ PDL cells exhibited the potential to generate specialized cells derived from three embryonic germ layers: mesodermal (adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes), ectodermal (neurons), and endodermal (hepatocytes) lineages. Our findings demonstrated that SSEA-4, a major antigen to distinguish human embryonic stem cells, could also be used to identify multipotent stem cells in the PDL. Hence, SSEA-4+ human PDL cells appear to be a promising source of stem cells for regenerative medicine.

High heritability of antimycobacterial immunity in an area of hyperendemicity for tuberculosis disease. Human antimycobacterial immunity is a critical component of tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis that is often used to infer the presence of TB infection. We report high heritability (>50%) for in vitro secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and the frequency of antigen-specific IFN-gamma(+)CD4(+) and IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) cells in the response of whole blood to mycobacterial challenge. In principal component analysis, the first 3 components explain 78% of the overall variance consistent with the effect of pleiotropic regulatory genes of human antimycobacterial immunity. These results directly demonstrate the pivotal role played by host genetics in quantitative measures of antimycobacterial immunity underlying immune diagnosis of TB infection.

In silico prediction of human oral absorption based on QSAR analyses of PAMPA permeability. The parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) was developed as a model for the prediction of transcellular permeation in the process of drug absorption. Our research group has measured the PAMPA permeability of peptide-related compounds, diverse drugs, and agrochemicals. This work led to a classical quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) equation for PAMPA permeability coefficients of structurally diverse compounds based on simple physicochemical parameters such as lipophilicity at a particular pH (log P(oct) and |pKa-pH|), H-bond acceptor ability (SA(HA)), and H-bond donor ability (SA(HD)). Since the PAMPA permeability of lipophilic compounds decreased with their apparent lipophilicity due to the unstirred water layer (UWL) barrier on membrane surfaces and to membrane retention, a bilinear QSAR model was introduced to explain the permeability of a broader set of compounds using the same physicochemical parameters as those used for the linear model. We also compared PAMPA and Caco-2 cell permeability coefficients of compounds transported by various absorption mechanisms. The compounds were classified according to their absorption pathway (passively transported compounds, actively transported compounds, and compounds excreted by efflux systems) in the plot of Caco-2 vs. PAMPA permeability. Finally, based on the QSAR analyses of PAMPA permeability, an in silico prediction model of human oral absorption for possibly transported compounds was proposed, and the usefulness of the model was examined.


Impact of dietary genistein and aging on executive function in rats.

[Surgical management of urinary tract endometriosis: 12 cases]. Our study aimed at evaluating, retrospectively, the outcome of the surgical management of urinary tract endometriosis. Twelve women with a mean age of 36,4 were recruited between 1994 and 2007. They all had a histologically-proven and surgically-treated endometriosis of the urinary tract. Seven of them had a unilateral ureteric localization, two had a bilateral ureteric localization and three had a vesical localization. One patient with bladder nodules underwent a partial cystectomy and the two other patients with bladder localization underwent a transurethral resection. Out of the nine patients who had a ureteric localization of endometriosis, seven had a ureterectomy and re-implantation with bladder psoas hitching and had no recurrence. Our experience showed that ureterectomy and re-implantation with bladder psoas hitching is probably the best way of preventing recurrences in the case of urethral endometriosis. In the case of bladder endometriosis, transurethral resection did not appear as the most effective treatment although it remains an acceptable alternative, especially as far as premenopausal women or young women wishing to conceive are concerned.

What can isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments tell us about the self-organization of surfactants into micelles? The aim of the present review is to give a concise analysis of the thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) experiments for the characterization of the self-organization of surfactants into micelles. This review is also focused on works describing some methods allowing to overcome ITC limitation and to extract accurate thermodynamic values from ITC data.

Subclinical myopathy in patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease: evidence from skeletal muscle biopsies. To evaluate skeletal muscle biopsy from asymptomatic patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and to identify pathological features which may be indicative of tumor-associated muscle disorders, potentially leading to cachexia. Patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease underwent biopsy of the rectus abdominis muscle during elective laparoscopic tumor resection, before chemotherapeutic treatment. Morphometric analyses, ATPase histochemistry and immunohistochemical studies using antibodies directed to N-CAM and to MHC-emb, two sound makers of muscle denervation and injury-induced muscle regeneration, were performed on intraoperative muscle biopsies from ten patients. Muscle biopsies from rectus abdominis of seven subjects affected with non-neoplastic condition, which underwent laparoscopic surgery, were used as controls. In patients' biopsies, we observed a surprisingly high percentage of myofibers with internalized or central nuclei compared to controls (9.15 +/- 8.9 versus 0.6 +/- 0.9, p<0.0003). In addition, in the 30% of patients, small myofibers expressing the MHC-emb have been identified (0.4 +/- 0.5 positive fibers/mm(2)), while in 50% of patients, larger fibers positive for N-CAM have also been detected (0.7 +/- 1.1 positive fibers/mm(2)), suggesting that investigated muscle biopsies exhibit other evidence of muscle fiber injury/regeneration and/or denervation. Among the 10,000 analysed myofibers in control biopsies, no MHC-emb and N-CAM-positive muscle fibers have been detected. Thus, patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease display early signs of a subclinical myopathy. Factors and mechanisms of this cancer-associated myopathy are yet unknown. The facts that the great majority of the abnormally nucleated myofibers are of the fast type and that regenerating myofibers are present, suggest a myogenic response to the colorectal cancer and not to the laparoscopic modalities of the biopsy harvesting. Follow-up of the patients will elucidate the clinical relevance of our observation, and further studies investigating the molecular mechanism underlying this early cancer-associated myopathy will hopefully provide some pathogenetic clues leading to the identification of potential specific targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor cachexia.

Telavancin and hydroxy propyl-beta-cyclodextrin clearance during continuous renal replacement therapy: an in vitro study. Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial agent which has been approved in Europe and has been recently FDA approved in the United States. Telavancin's parenteral solution contains hydroxy propyl-beta -cyclodextrin (HP-beta -CD) to enhance its solubility. The disposition of telavancin and HP-beta -CD during continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT ) has not been previously reported. The transmembrane clearances (CLtm ) of telavancin and HP-beta -CD during continuous hemofiltration and hemodialysis were assessed using an in vitro bovine blood model with AN69 and polysulfone hemodiafilters at varying ultrafiltrate and dialysate flow rates (1, 2, 3, & 6 l/hr). The mean telavancin sieving coefficient ranged from 0.25 to 0.31 during continuous hemofiltration. At all ultrafiltration rates, no differences were observed in telavancin CLtm between the two hemodiafilter types. For continuous hemodialysis, mean telavancin saturation coefficients ranged from 0.10 to 0.43 and CLtm tended to be higher for the polysulfone hemodiafilter than the AN69 hemodiafilter, especially at higher flow rates. Mean HP-beta -CD sieving coefficients ranged from 0.63 to 1.03 and saturation coefficients from 0.63 to 1.38, resulting in a CLtm that was similar to ultrafiltrate and dialysate flow rates. Telavancin CLtm is dependent on hemodiafilter type, dialysate and ultrafiltration rates. CRRT with high ultrafiltrate or dialysate rates may result in sufficient telavancin clearance to alter telavancin dosing. HP-beta -CD clearance by continuous hemodialysis or continuous hemofiltration is substantial and may be sufficient to prevent HP-beta -CD accumulation in subjects receiving CRRT . Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients receiving CRRT and telavancin are needed to confirm these in vitro findings.

[Effect of volemic status on brain oxygenation and metabolism in patients with intracranial hemorrhages]. The paper analyzes the impact of the volemic status and its correction on systemic hemodynamic parameters (transpulmonary thermodilution PiCCO plus technique), the value of intracranial pressure and the biochemical composition of brain interstitial fluid (tissue microdialysis) in the affected and conditionally intact hemisphere in 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhages and a reduced awakening level up to 4-8 scores by the Glasgow coma scale. It has been shown that in patients with significant metabolic disturbance in the involved hemisphere, hypovolemia correction using hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 is accompanied by activated oxidative phosphorylation and a lower lactate/pyruvate ratio, without changing the of blood pressure and increasing pulmonary extravascular water.

Hard tissue-forming potential of stem/progenitor cells in human dental follicle and dental papilla. The existence of stem/progenitor cells in dental tissue has been suggested but their characterization in the human tooth germ remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to investigate these cells in human dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage and compare their potential for hard tissue formation. We used dental follicle cells (DFCs) and dental papilla cells (DPCs) derived from dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage and compared their proliferative capacity, cell surface antigens and ability to form hard tissue in vitro and in vivo. Both DFCs and DPCs had extensive proliferation ability, expressed similar cell surface antigens and were capable of forming hard tissue in vivo as well as in vitro. However, there were two differences between DFCs and DPCs. First, DPCs had a significantly higher calcium accumulation than that in DFCs. Second, DFCs expressed a cementoblast marker, whereas DPCs expressed an odontoblast marker. We propose that dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage contain different types of stem/progenitor cells and may have hard tissue-forming ability in a possibly origin-specific lineage direction.

Rehabilitation of the spine following sports injury. The spine plays an essential role in the contribution toward athletic performance. As the central pillar of the body, the structures of the spine are susceptible to injury related with sports participation. This article identifies many of the most commonly seen sports-related injuries to the spine, and discusses practical rehabilitative interventions to manage such injuries. Anatomic considerations, biomechanical movements, and tissue properties are explained to better understand the clinical expectations associated with each of the injuries described.

Bone regeneration and repair. In the face of mounting clinical demand, and armed with reconstructive techniques that are technically challenging and frequently result in suboptimal patient outcomes, increasing focus is being placed on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as a potential source of novel skeletal reconstructive approaches. Specifically, evidence is accumulating that highlights the promise of osteoprogenitor cell-based reconstructive strategies to meet the needs of an expanding patient population. Historically, the study of cell and molecular biology guiding physiologic and pathologic skeletal development, as well as endogenous bone regeneration following injury, has provided a wealth of information that lends insight toward potential parallel processes that may regulate the osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells. Multiple progenitor cell populations are now known to possess a capacity to undergo robust osteogenic differentiation in the presence of appropriate environmental cues (hESC, BMSC, ASC, etc.) Recent investigations have put forth multiple advantages of ASC relative to BMSC. Of note, ASC exist in relative abundance, lack the need for in vitro expansion prior to utilization, and can be harvested with relative ease and reduced donor morbidity. Collectively, these factors, paired with promising in vitro and in vivo observations that speak toward the substantial osteogenic potential of ASC, have spurred enthusiasm to pursue the application of ASC in the maturation of skeletal tissue engineering applications. Yet, elucidating what structural and functional properties of scaffolds designed for ASC-mediated skeletal tissue engineering applications (porosity, pore size, composition, mechanical stability, degradation kinetics, etc.), as well as evolving our understanding and capacity to deliver spatiotemporally specific pro-osteogenic targeted molecular manipulation to progenitor cells, remain important hurdles to clear. The scope of this review encompasses the current state of ongoing investigations along these fronts, as well as what future direction will be critical to the transition of cell-based skeletal tissue engineering strategies to the bedside.

[Do we have disease-specific standardization of training?]. As a consequence of the new Danish Municipal Reform introduced in 2007, most of the former hospital training service has been transferred to the municipalities. This study investigates if Denmark had a disease-specific standardization of training before the reform. All Danish hospitals and municipalities were invited to answer a questionnaire about professional guidelines and the use of tests in connection with training of mobility disabled people. Among the 68 hospitals and 270 municipalities included, the total response rates were 69% and 84%, respectively. In all, 116 training units were identified in the hospitals: 24 neurologic; 34 orthopaedic; 22 rheumatologic; 19 geriatric; and 17 "general". The geriatric and neurologic specialities had more professional guidelines and used tests more frequently than the orthopaedic and rheumatologic specialities. The use of standardized test in the municipalities and within the geriatric speciality was similar. Differences in standardization between clinical specialities reflect differences in the working conditions regarding specific disease patterns. Before the introduction of the Municipal Reform, hospital training programs were standardized using speciality-specific guidelines and tests. Future investigations may show how this disease- and speciality-specific perspective on training is implemented under the new guidelines.


Prospects for new plague vaccines.

A new method for interval estimation of the mean of the Gamma distribution. The two parameter Gamma distribution is widely used for modeling lifetime distributions in reliability theory. There is much literature on the inference on the individual parameters of the Gamma distribution, namely the shape parameter k and the scale parameter theta when the other parameter is known. However, usually the reliability professionals have a major interest in making statistical inference about the mean lifetime mu, which equals the product thetak for the Gamma distribution. The problem of inference on the mean mu when both parameters theta and k are unknown has been less attended in the literature for the Gamma distribution. In this paper we review the existing methods for interval estimation of mu. A comparative study in this paper indicates that the existing methods are either too approximate and yield less reliable confidence intervals or are computationally quite complicated and need advanced computing facilities. We propose a new simple method for interval estimation of the Gamma mean and compare its performance with the existing methods. The comparative study showed that the newly proposed computationally simple optimum power normal approximation method works best even for small sample sizes.

Roscovitine increases intracellular calcium release and capacitative calcium entry in PC12 cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is activated by the non-cyclin regulator p35 or p39, is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that is implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Here, we studied calcium signaling using the fluorescent cytosolic calcium indicator, Fura-4, in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells treated with roscovitine, a Cdk5 inhibitor. As compared to the control cells, the roscovitine-treated cells significantly potentiated intracellular calcium release by membrane depolarization (high K(+)) or through thapsigargin. In addition, roscovitine increased the magnitude of capacitative calcium entry (CCE), i.e., a calcium influx mechanism triggered by the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Notably, roscovitine markedly slowed the rate of Ca(2+) removal from the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Cdk5 regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis and that the dysregulation of Cdk5 may contribute to disease pathogenesis by perturbing cellular Ca(2+) signaling.

Evolutionary demography and the population history of the European early Neolithic. In this paper I propose that evolutionary demography and associated theory from human behavioral ecology provide a strong basis for explaining the available evidence for the patterns observed in the first agricultural settlement of Europe in the 7th-5th millennium cal. BC, linking together a variety of what have previously been disconnected observations and casting doubt on some long-standing existing models. An outline of relevant aspects of life history theory, which provides the foundation for understanding demography, is followed by a review of large-scale demographic patterns in the early Neolithic, which point to rapid population increase and a process of demic diffusion. More localized socioeconomic and demographic patterns suggesting rapid expansion to local carrying capacities and an associated growth of inequality in the earliest farming communities of central Europe (the Linear Pottery Culture, or LBK) are then outlined and shown to correspond to predictions of spatial population ecology and reproductive skew theory. Existing models of why it took so long for farming to spread to northern and northwest Europe, which explain the spread in terms of the gradual disruption of hunter-gatherer ways of life, are then questioned in light of evidence for population collapse at the end of the LBK. Finally, some broader implications of the study are presented, including the suggestion that the pattern of an initial agricultural boom followed by a bust may be relevant in other parts of the world.

Perceived gender role that shape youth sexual behaviour: Evidence from rural Orissa, India. The study attempts to understand the association of perceived gender role with youth sexual behavior using qualitative data such as focus group discussions (N=8), in-depth interviews (N=42), and free listing (N=50) of rural married youths from Orissa, India. Data collection was conducted during July 2006-April 2007. Atlas. ti and ANTHROPAC packages have been used for the analysis. Youths in general are expected to adhere to the roles ascribed for them based on their biological construct and any deviation is not warranted for, more so for young women. Moreover, for many young men perceived gender role coupled with poor self risk perception result into unsafe sexual activities, putting them as well as their partners at the risk of STI/HIV and unintended parenthood.

Cocaine self-administration alters the expression of chromatin-remodelling proteins; modulation by histone deacetylase inhibition. Injection of the histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin A to rats has been shown to decrease the reinforcing properties of cocaine. In the present study, we investigated alterations in gene expression patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens of rats self-administering cocaine and treated with trichostatin A. As recent studies highlighted the importance of chromatin remodelling in the regulation of gene transcription in neurons, we studied the expression of Mecp2 and of several histone deacetylases. Cocaine self-administration was accompanied by an increased synthesis of Mecp2, HDAC2 and HDAC11 and by a decreased nuclear localization of HDAC5 and of the phospho-form of HDAC5, suggesting a nuclear export of this protein in response to the drug. The latter mechanism was further addressed by the demonstration of an enhanced expression of MEF2C transcription factor. Among the genes we examined, treatment with trichostatin A before each cocaine self-administration session was found to mostly affect Mecp2 and HDAC11 expression. A correlation was found between the modification of Mecp2 and MEF2C gene expression and the reinforcing property of cocaine. The two factors known to regulate gene transcription are likely to play a role in the neurobiological mechanism underlying a decrease in the reinforcing properties of cocaine.

Development of a haemolysin gene-based multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. To develop a haemolysin (hly) gene-based species-specific multiplex PCR for simple and rapid detection of Vibrio campbellii, V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus. The complete hly genes of three V. campbellii strains isolated from diseased shrimps were sequenced and species-specific PCR primers were designed based on these sequences and the registered hly gene sequences of Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR was validated with 27 V. campbellii, 16 V. harveyi, and 69 V. parahaemolyticus, 18 other Vibrio species, one Photobacterium damselae and nine other bacterial species. The detection limits of all the three target species were in between 10 and 100 cells per PCR tube. Specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR is 100% each and sufficient to be considered as an effective tool in a prediction system to prevent potential disease outbreak by these Vibrio species. Because there is lack of simple, rapid and cost-effective method to differentiate these closely related V. campbellii, V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus species, the multiplex PCR developed in this study will be very effective in epidemiological, ecological and economical points of view.

Cytoplasmic streaming enables the distribution of molecules and vesicles in large plant cells. Recent studies of aquatic and land plants show that similar phenomena determine intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. This suggests that aspects of cell signaling involved in development and response to external stimuli are conserved across species. The movement of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments directly or indirectly entrains the fluid cytosol, driving cyclosis (i.e., cytoplasmic streaming) and affecting gradients of molecular species within the cell, with potentially important metabolic implications as a driving force for cell expansion. Research has shown that myosin XI functions in organelle movement driving cytoplasmic streaming in aquatic and land plants. Despite the conserved cytoskeletal machinery propelling organelle movement among aquatic and land plants, the velocities of cyclosis in plant cells varies according to cell types, developmental stage of the cell, and plant species. Here, we synthesize recent insights into cytoplasmic streaming, molecular gradients, cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics, and expand current cellular models to identify important gaps in current research.

Clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen versus laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. To compare the efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) plus tamoxifen with that of laparoscopic ovarian drilling in clomiphene-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We randomly allocated 150 women with CC-resistant PCOS to a combined medication group (group 1) or a laparoscopic surgery group (group 2). The primary outcome was the live birth rate in each group; secondary outcomes were the rates of ovulation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding rates of ovulation (81.3% vs 85.3%), pregnancy (53.3% vs 50.7%), or live births (49.3% vs 44.0%), but the mean endometrium thickness was significantly greater on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration in group 1 (P<0.001). Clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen was as effective as laparoscopic ovarian drilling in promoting ovulation and pregnancy.

Parental occupational exposure to potential endocrine disrupting chemicals and risk of hypospadias in infants. Hypospadias is a urogenital birth defect affecting infant boys. Periconceptual parental occupational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with oestrogenic or anti-androgenic properties may adversely affect male genital development in utero. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between both maternal and paternal occupational exposures to EDCs and hypospadias. This registry-based case-control study considered 1202 cases of hypospadias in children born in Western Australia between 1980 and 2000 and 2583 male controls randomly selected from birth records for whom information regarding parental occupation was available from the Western Australian Maternal and Child Health Research Database. Occupational exposures to seven groups of potential EDCs were independently coded by two researchers according to a validated job-exposure matrix. Multivariable analysis showed a strong association with potential maternal occupational exposure to heavy metals with an over twofold increased risk of hypospadias (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.2), and women exposed to phthalates were more likely to have an affected son (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.7). Compared with mild or isolated cases, the risks of moderate-severe hypospadias or multiple defects were increased up to two- and fivefold, respectively, with maternal exposure to most types of EDCs. Paternal occupational exposures to polychlorinated organic (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.8) and bi-phenolic (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6) compounds were also possible risk factors. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an association between exposure to EDCs with oestrogenic or anti-androgenic properties and increased risk of hypospadias.

Structure and vascular tissue expression of duplicated TERMINAL EAR1-like paralogues in poplar. TERMINAL EAR1-like (TEL) genes encode putative RNA-binding proteins only found in land plants. Previous studies suggested that they may regulate tissue and organ initiation in Poaceae. Two TEL genes were identified in both Populus trichocarpa and the hybrid aspen Populus tremula x P. alba, named, respectively, PoptrTEL1-2 and PtaTEL1-2. The analysis of the organisation around the PoptrTEL genes in the P. trichocarpa genome and the estimation of the synonymous substitution rate for PtaTEL1-2 genes indicate that the paralogous link between these two Populus TEL genes probably results from the Salicoid large-scale gene-duplication event. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed their orthology link with the other TEL genes. The expression pattern of both PtaTEL genes appeared to be restricted to the mother cells of the plant body: leaf founder cells, leaf primordia, axillary buds and root differentiating tissues, as well as to mother cells of vascular tissues. Most interestingly, PtaTEL1-2 transcripts were found in differentiating cells of secondary xylem and phloem, but probably not in the cambium itself. Taken together, these results indicate specific expression of the TEL genes in differentiating cells controlling tissue and organ development in Populus (and other Angiosperm species).


Brush-evoked allodynia predicts outcome of spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome type 1.

Selection of patients with severe pelvic fracture for early angiography remains controversial. Patients with severe pelvic fractures represent about 3% of all skeletal fractures. Hemodynamic compromise in unstable pelvic fractures is associated with arterial hemorrhage in less than 20% of patients. Angiography is an important tool in the management of severe pelvic injury, but indications and timing for its performance remain controversial. Patients with major pelvic fractures [Pelvic Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) >or= 3] admitted to two high volume Trauma Centers from January 2000 to June 2005 were identified and divided into two groups: Group I patients did not undergo angiography, Group II patients underwent angiography with/without embolization. Demographics, hemodynamic status on admission, concomitant injuries, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), pelvic AIS, blood requirement before and after angiography, arterial blood gases and mortality were evaluated. Patients with an additional reason for hemodynamic instability were excluded. Charts of 106 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty nine patients (27.4%) underwent angiography. Bleeding vessel embolization was performed in 20 (18.9%) patients. Patients who underwent angiography had a significantly higher pelvic AIS and a lower Base Excess level on admission. A blood transfusion rate of greater than 0.5 unit/hour was found to be a reliable indicator for early angiography. A high pelvic AIS, amount of blood transfusions and decreased BE level should be considered as an indicators for early angiography in patients with severe pelvic injury.

[Implant placement on restricted mesiodistal space with simulation software and guiding system: a case report]. A surgical guiding system with simulation software has recently been used for safe implant treatment. We report a clinical case in which we successfully used this system for implant treatment of a congenital tooth missing region with severely restricted mesiodistal space. The patient was a 19-year-old female whose mandibular right deciduous canine was wobbling without a successional permanent tooth and who desired implant treatment. CT images showed that this site was narrow buccal-lingually and only five millimeters in mesiodistal width. The implant position was planned using simulation software (SimPlant : Materialise Dental) based on CT data and a surgical guide template (SurgiGuide : Materialise Dental) was fabricated prior to the implant surgery. During the implant surgery, the deciduous canine was extracted under local anesthesia. The implant bed was prepared with the surgical guide template and an implant was installed. One month after surgery, the position of the implant was examined with a cone-beam CT, which demonstrated that the implant position was exactly the same as planned. At 5 months, a provisional prosthesis was delivered and optimal soft-tissue condition was formed by modifying the provisional prosthesis. Then, the final impression was taken and a ceramo-metal implant-supported crown was delivered. In this case of a congenital tooth missing region with narrow space, implant treatment with simulation software and the surgical guide system provided excellent clinical results.

Acupuncture and reflexology for insomnia: a feasibility study. To assess the feasibility of patient recruitment and retention, logistics of intervention and outcome measure sensitivity for a study designed to investigate the use of acupuncture and reflexology for the management of insomnia. Feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial. University of Ulster Clinic. Thirteen participants with sleep disturbances. Participants were randomised to receive one of three treatments, either: acupuncture (n = 5), reflexology (n = 4) or music therapy (n = 4). These treatments were administered six times over a 3-week period. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2) were recorded at baseline, post-treatment and follow-up. Each participant also completed a Sleep Diary. Ten participants completed treatment. In the acupuncture and reflexology groups, a clinically relevant improvement in two out of three participants was observed on the PSQI following treatment. Music therapy produced no clinically important improvements. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of conducting an RCT on the effect of acupuncture and reflexology in primary insomnia using PSQI as the primary outcome measure. Modifications for a more rigorous study design have been discussed. Results from such a study would address the lack of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of such therapies.

Multiple electrode aggregometry predicts stent thrombosis better than the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay. The prognostic value of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) for thrombotic adverse events has been shown in independent studies. As no direct comparison between the two methods has been made so far, we investigated which laboratory approach has a better predictive value for stent thrombosis. The VASP phosphorylation assay and MEA were performed in 416 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The rate of stent thrombosis was recorded during a 6-month follow-up. Definite stent thrombosis occurred in three patients (0.7%) and probable stent thrombosis in four (1%). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that MEA distinguishes between patients with or without subsequent stent thrombosis better than the VASP phosphorylation assay: the area under the ROC curve was higher for MEA (0.92; P=0.012) than for the VASP phosphorylation assay (0.60; P=0.55). At equal levels of sensitivity (100%), the specificity was greater for MEA than for the VASP phosphorylation assay (86% vs. 37%). Stent thrombosis occurred in 9% of patients with platelet hyperreactivity in MEA, who were simultaneously clopidogrel non-responders in the VASP phosphorylation assay. Interestingly, clopidogrel non-responders in the VASP phosphorylation assay without platelet hyperreactivity in MEA did not suffer from stent thrombosis. Platelet hyperreactivity in MEA might be a better risk predictor for stent thrombosis than the assessment of the specific clopidogrel effect with the VASP phosphorylation assay.

Daily consumption of milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduces cell adhesion molecules in healthy children. Several studies have suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals have beneficial effects on lipid profile and systemic inflammation in adults. We examined the effects of a daily intake of milk enriched with longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) for 5 months, on several cardiovascular (CVD) risk biomarkers in healthy children aged 8-14 years. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a total of 107 children of both genders were assigned to two study groups: 1) a supplemented group (SG, n=53) who consumed 0.6 L/day of an enriched dairy product, and 2) a control group (CG, n=54) who consumed 0.6 L/day of standard whole milk. Both groups consumed the dairy drinks for 5 months, in addition to their usual diet. Serum levels of adhesion molecules as indices of vascular endothelial cell activation were assessed in both groups at 0 and 5 months as well as white blood cell counts, lipid profile, serum proteins, total serum calcium, 25-OH vitamin D, glucose, insulin and adiponectin. In the enriched dairy drink supplemented group, adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 as well as lymphocyte levels decreased while plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and serum calcium concentrations increased. In the control group, serum total protein, transferrin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations decreased. The consumption of a milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduced indices of endothelial cell activation in the studied group of healthy children.

Gene disruption and characterization of a class V chitin synthase in Botrytis cinerea. Cell-wall chitin biosynthesis in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea involves 7 classes of chitin synthases. In this study, we disrupted a gene encoding a chitin synthase with a myosin-like motor domain (BcchsV) through Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. The resulting mutant was not significantly affected in either growth characteristics or pathogenicity on tomato leaves. Surprisingly, the BcchsV mutant exhibited a 31% (m/m) increase in its chitin content compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, the BcchsV mutant showed increased sensitivity to Calcofluor White and slightly enhanced tolerance to cell-wall disturbing substances and osmosis regulators, including SDS, sorbitol, and NaCl. These results suggest that Bcchs does not play an essential role in the synthesis of cell-wall chitin in B. cinerea. However, disruption of this gene provoked a compensatory mechanism regulating the cellular response to cell-wall damage.

MHC haplotype and susceptibility to experimental infections (Salmonella Enteritidis, Pasteurella multocida or Ascaridia galli) in a commercial and an indigenous chicken breed. In three independent experimental infection studies, the susceptibility and course of infection of three pathogens considered of importance in most poultry production systems, Ascaridia galli, Salmonella Enteritidis and Pasteurella multocida were compared in two chicken breeds, the indigenous Vietnamese Ri and the commercial Luong Phuong. Furthermore, the association of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with disease-related parameters was evaluated, using alleles of the LEI0258 microsatellite as markers for MHC haplotypes. The Ri chickens were found to be more resistant to A. galli and S. Enteritidis than commercial Luong Phuong chickens. In contrast, the Ri chickens were more susceptible to P. multocida, although production parameters were more affected in the Luong Phuong chickens. Furthermore, it was shown that the individual variations observed in response to the infections were influenced by the MHC. Using marker alleles of the microsatellite LEI0258, which is located within the MHC region, several MHC haplotypes were identified as being associated with infection intensity of A. galli. An association of the MHC with the specific antibody response to S. Enteritidis was also found where four MHC haplotypes were shown to be associated with high specific antibody response. Finally, one MHC haplotype was identified as being associated with pathological lesions and mortality in the P. multocida experiment. Although not statistically significant, our analysis suggested that this haplotype might be associated with resistance. These results demonstrate the presence of local genetic resources in Vietnamese chickens, which could be utilized in breeding programmes aiming at improving disease resistance.

Scope of super-resolution in central vision. The term super-resolution refers to computational enhancement of detail in sets of similar images, particularly undersampled images. Undersampling is a key feature of visual disorders associated with neuroretinal matrix damage. It is conceivable that a neurophysiological equivalent of super-resolution might be recruited in these settings. The need for sets of similar images might be satisfied by augmenting retinal image movements. Monocular letter acuity thresholds were measured by computer graphics in normal subjects, with and without controlled test target movements. Various degrees of neuroretinal matrix defects were simulated by superposing stationary masks on the test targets. Static acuity thresholds increased monotonically with increased mask densities. The addition of target movement partially counteracted the threshold increment. The effect was barely measurable at small mask densities and increased monotonically to a gain of approximately two lines on a decimal acuity scale with masks simulating loss of 90% of neural matrix elements. Similar results were obtained from a patient with an acquired neuroretinal matrix defect, attesting to the validity of the mask experiments. Super-normal retinal image movements have subtle effects on visual resolution in normal eyes, whereas eyes with neuroretinal matrix defects may improve markedly. This finding may have implications for the development of aids for the visually handicapped.

Optimizing potential for fertility: fertility preservation considerations for the pediatric endocrinologist. Whether for the prepubertal or pubertal child, the goal of fertility preservation is to obtain cells or tissues to be used to produce future children. For the prepubertal child, preservation efforts involve germ cells, earlier forms of sperm, and immature follicles, rather than mature spermatozoa or follicles. Options for prepubertal children include for boys freezing testicular tissue and extracting testicular sperm or for girls obtaining ovarian cortical or follicular tissue for storage. These procedures involve extraction and storage of immature gametes for subsequent in vitro maturation, although attempts for sperm currently involve only animal studies. For adolescent subjects who have sufficient gonadal development and reserve, sperm, oocytes, and ovarian cortex can be retrieved as among adults.


A cytogenetic abnormality and rare coding variants identify ABCA13 as a candidate gene in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.

An analysis of efficacy data from four phase III studies of botulinum neurotoxin type A-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. A new formulation of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA-ABO; Dysport [abobotulinumtoxinA], Medicis Aesthetics, Scottsdale, AZ) has recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. We describe the results of four phase III studies of BoNTA-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. Of the four studies reported here, three were double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-label extension study. A second phase III, open-label extension study is ongoing. Studies enrolled ethnically diverse, healthy adults with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Patients were followed for up to 180 days after treatment. The fixed-dose, single treatment study randomized 158 patients to receive placebo or a single 50-unit BoNTA-ABO dose. The fixed-dose, repeat treatment study enrolled 311 patients to assess treatment following repeat BoNTA-ABO treatment of 50 units. A variable-dose study randomized 816 patients to receive placebo or a single variable dose (50 to 80 units, based on gender and muscle mass assessment). The fourth phase III study was open-label to evaluate repeat dosing (50 units). Clinical evaluations were performed on days 14 and 30, and monthly thereafter. Primary efficacy endpoints were based on the investigators' and patients' assessment of glabellar line severity at day 30 using wrinkle severity rating scales. Responders were defined as patients who had a composite 2+ grade improvement in wrinkle severity, meaning that a patient had a baseline Glabellar Line Severity Scale (GLSS) score of 2 (moderate glabellar lines) and a day 30 GLSS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none), or a baseline GLSS score of 3 (severe glabellar lines) and a day 30 GLSS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none) or 1 (mild glabellar lines), for both the blinded investigator's and patient's assessments. Patients (1116 total; 720 BoNTA-ABO, 396 placebo) treated with BoNTA-ABO received 50 to 80 units. The median duration of response was 85 days for fixed dosing and 109 days for variable dosing. Similar efficacy occurred at doses adjusted for gender and muscle mass, although male patients required higher doses than female patients in the variable-dose study. Responses appeared as early as 24 hours, with a median time to onset of three days. The open-label extension study evaluated 1200 patients for 13 months. Maintenance of efficacy was seen after multiple treatment cycles, indicating that patients did not develop a tolerance. A second open-label study is ongoing and is not included in this report. BoNTA-ABO significantly improved moderate to severe glabellar lines compared with placebo, with onset of effect seen as soon as 24 hours after treatment and a median duration of effect of 85 and 109 days for fixed and variable dosing, respectively.

Treatment options for threatened miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage, as demonstrated by vaginal bleeding with or without abdominal cramps, is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs in about 20% of recognised pregnancies. Risk of miscarriage is increased in older women and those with a history of miscarriage. Low serum levels of progesterone or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) are a risk factor for miscarriage. Other risk factors include heavy bleeding, early gestational age and an empty gestational sac of >15-17 mm diameter. Clinical history and examination, maternal serum biochemistry and ultrasound findings provide valuable information about the prognosis and are important to establish in order to determine potential treatment options. Although bed rest is the most common choice of treatment, there is little evidence of its value. Other options include luteal support with progesterone, dydrogesterone or hCG. There is some evidence from clinical studies indicating that progesterone or dydrogesterone may reduce the rate of miscarriage, although further data from double-blind, randomised-controlled trials are necessary to confirm efficacy.


The consequence of encouraging girls to be active for weight loss.

Association of HIV transmission categories with sociodemographic, viroimmunological and clinical parameters of HIV-infected patients. To analyse sociodemographic, viroimmunological and clinical parameters in different HIV-transmission categories at baseline and during treatment, 3039 patients were followed up for 12 months after the initiation of a nelfinavir-based regimen. Multiple baseline parameters were significantly different in the diverse categories, including CD4 counts (P<0.0001) and viral load (P=0.02). There were differences in the groups regarding the CD4 response (P=0.01), but not the virological response (P=0.4), to therapy over time. Multivariate analyses revealed that transmission categories were significantly related to baseline CD4 counts (P=0.01), viral load at 12 months (P=0.0006), poorer adherence to therapy of injecting drug users (IDUs) vs. each of the other groups (P<0.001) and failure to complete the 12-month evaluation of IDU vs. heterosexual (P=0.003) and men who have sex with men (MSM) groups (P=0.02). We conclude that transmission categories had a significant influence on several baseline parameters and viroimmunological outcomes following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), as well as on adherence to therapy and to medical appointments.

Decreased susceptibility to zinc chloride is associated with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus CC398 in Danish swine. A total of 31 MRSA and 60 MSSA isolated from different swine farms in Denmark were examined for their susceptibility to zinc chloride, erythromycin, penicillin and tetracycline, as well as their spa-type. mecA positive isolates were examined for their SCCmec type. The isolates were assigned to a CC-type based on their spa-type and supportive multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). No difference in susceptibility to erythromycin, penicillin or tetracycline could be observed between methicillin resistant and susceptible isolates of CC398. Twenty-three (74%) of the MRSA CC398 isolates had reduced susceptibility to ZnCl(2) (MIC 4-12 mM), whereas all MSSA had MICs from 0.5 to 2 mM. Thirty MRSA, including all 23 zinc resistant isolates harboured SCCmec type V. This provides biological evidence to suggest that the use of zinc compounds may be partly implicated in the emergence of some MRSA clones among swine in Denmark.


Neuromyelitis optica: pathogenicity of patient immunoglobulin in vivo.

Signs and symptoms of heart failure: are you asking the right questions? Patients may not verbalize common and atypical signs and symptoms of heart failure and may not understand their association with worsening disease and treatments. To examine prevalence of signs and symptoms relative to demographics, care setting, and functional class. A convenience sample of 276 patients (164 ambulatory, 112 hospitalized) with systolic heart failure completed a 1-page checklist of signs and symptoms experienced in the preceding 7 days (ambulatory) or in the 7 days before hospitalization. Demographic and medical history data were collected. Mean age was 61.6 (SD, 14.8) years, 65% were male, 58% were white, and 45% had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hospitalized patients reported more sudden weight gain, weight loss, severe cough, low/orthostatic blood pressure, profound fatigue, decreased exercise, restlessness/confusion, irregular pulse, and palpitations (all P < .05). Patients in functional class IV reported more atypical signs and symptoms of heart failure (severe cough, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or loss of appetite, and restlessness, confusion, or fainting, all P <or= .001). Sudden weight gain increased from 5% in functional class I to 37.5% in functional class IV (P < .001). Dyspnea occurred in all functional classes (98%-100%) and both settings (92%-100%). Profound fatigue was associated with worsening functional class (P < .001) and hospital setting (P = .001); paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea was associated with functional class IV (P = .02) and hospital setting (P < .001). Profound fatigue is more reliable than dyspnea as an indicator of functional class. Nurses must recognize atypical signs and symptoms of worsening functional class to determine clinical status and facilitate patient care decisions.

[Care for the patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration]. In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which primarily involves the front of the brain, characteristic psychiatric symptoms and disordered behaviors, such as disinhibition and stereotypical behaviors, often appear in the foreground at the initial stages of the disease. It is therefore an extremely difficult disease to treat. However, unlike diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which involve general dementia, there is a clear dissociation between the conserved and disordered functions; therefore, it is possible to enhance the conserved functions and simultaneously modify the disordered functions into adaptive behaviors in order to provide care and increase the quality of life (QOL). In this paper, we report the use of routinizing therapy, which is an occupational therapeutic approach, involving speech therapy for semantic dementia (SD), drug therapy for stereotypic behaviors and psychiatric symptoms of FTLD, family education, etc.

MRI of brain disease in veterinary patients part 2: Acquired brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized brain imaging in veterinary medicine, making possible improved characterization of intracranial pathologic processes. This article focuses on MRI features of acquired brain disorders, including infectious inflammatory, noninfectious inflammatory, cerebrovascular, metabolic, nutritional, toxic, degenerative, traumatic, and neoplastic causes. Congenital intracranial disorders are covered in a companion article.

Minimally invasive versus conventional mitral valve surgery: a propensity-matched comparison. Less invasive approaches to mitral valve surgery are increasingly used for improved cosmesis; however, few studies have investigated their effect on outcome. We sought to compare these minimally invasive approaches fairly with conventional full sternotomy by using propensity-matching methods. From January 1995 to January 2004, 2124 patients underwent isolated mitral valve surgery through a minimally invasive approach, and 1047 underwent isolated mitral valve surgery through a conventional sternotomy. Because there were important differences in patient characteristics, a propensity score based on 42 factors was used to obtain 590 well-matched patient pairs (56% of cases). In-hospital mortality was similar for propensity-matched patients: 0.17% (1/590) for those undergoing minimally invasive surgery and 0.85% (5/590) for those undergoing conventional surgery (P = .2). Occurrences of stroke (P = .8), renal failure (P > .9), myocardial infarction (P = .7), and infection (P = .8) were also similar. However, 24-hour mediastinal drainage was less after minimally invasive surgery (median, 250 vs 350 mL; P < .0001), and fewer patients received transfusions (30% vs 37%, P = .01). More patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery were extubated in the operating room (18% vs 5.7%, P < .0001), and postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second was higher. Early after operation, pain scores were lower (P < .0001) after minimally invasive surgery. Within that portion of the spectrum of mitral valve surgery in which propensity matching was possible, minimally invasive mitral valve surgery had cosmetic, blood product use, respiratory, and pain advantages over conventional surgery, and no apparent detriments. Mortality and morbidity for robotic and percutaneous procedures should be compared with these minimally invasive outcomes.

In vivo modulation of gene expression by lentiviral transduction in "human immune system" Rag2-/- gamma c -/- mice. Over the last two decades, several humanized mouse models have been used to experimentally analyze the function and development of the human immune system. Recent advances have lead to the establishment of new murine-human chimeric models with improved characteristics, both in terms of human engraftment efficiency and in situ multilineage human hematopoietic development. We describe here the use of newborn BALB/c Rag2(-/-)gamma(c) (-/-) mice as recipients of human hematopoietic progenitor cells to produce "human immune system" (HIS) (BALB-Rag/gamma) mice, using human fetal liver progenitors. The two major subsets of the human dendritic cell lineage, namely, BDCA2(+)CD11c(-) plasmacytoid dendritic cells and BDCA2(-)CD11c(+) conventional dendritic cells, can be found in HIS (BALB-Rag/gamma) mice. In order to manipulate the expression of genes of interest, the human hematopoietic progenitor cells can be genetically engineered ex vivo by lentiviral transduction before performing xenograft transplantation. Using this mouse model, the human immune system can be assessed for both fundamental and pre-clinical purposes.

Expression of TGF-beta signaling factors in invasive breast cancers: relationships with age at diagnosis and tumor characteristics.

Hyaluronic acid inhibits the glial scar formation after brain damage with tissue loss in rats. Brain tissue scarring (gliosis) was believed to be the major cause of epileptic focus after brain injury, and prevention of scarring could reduce the incidence of seizure. We tried the HA coating onto the cortical brain defect of Spraque-Dawley rats to reduce the marginal glial scarring. A 4 x 2 x 2 mm(3) cortical defect was created in the brain of Spraque-Dawley rats. Three percent HA gel was coated onto the lesion for the experimental groups and normal saline solutions for the control groups. The brain was retrieved 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. The brains were then sectioned and processed for H&E and GFAP staining, and the thickness of the scarring and the number of GFAP+ cells were analyzed. The thickness of cutting marginal gliosis was significantly decreased in the HA groups. The 12-week HA group showed the smallest thickness of gliosis, whereas the 12-week control group exhibited the largest thickness of gliosis. The significant difference in the thickness of gliosis was also noted between the HA and the control groups 8 weeks after treatment. The number of GFAP+ cells was also significantly decreased in the HA groups when compared to the respective control group 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the surgery. The results support the hypothesis that HA inhibits glial scarring not only by decreasing the thickness of gliosis but also by reducing the number of the glial cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that HA might be used to reduce glial scar formation in central nervous system surgery, which subsequently prevents the post-operation or posttraumatic seizure incidence.

Copper transfer from Cu-Abeta to human serum albumin inhibits aggregation, radical production and reduces Abeta toxicity. Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and the protein human serum albumin (HSA) interact in vivo. They are both localised in the blood plasma and in the cerebrospinal fluid. Among other functions, HSA is involved in the transport of the essential metal copper. Complexes between Abeta and copper ions have been proposed to be an aberrant interaction implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease, where Cu is involved in Abeta aggregation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present work, we studied copper-exchange reaction between Abeta and HSA or the tetrapeptide DAHK (N-terminal Cu-binding domain of HSA) and the consequence of this exchange on Abeta-induced ROS production and cell toxicity. The following results were obtained: 1) HSA and DAHK removed Cu(II) from Abeta rapidly and stoichiometrically, 2) HSA and DAHK were able to decrease Cu-induced aggregation of Abeta, 3) HSA and DAHK suppressed the catalytic HO(.) production in vitro and ROS production in neuroblastoma cells generated by Cu-Abeta and ascorbate, 4) HSA and DAHK were able to rescue these cells from the toxicity of Cu-Abeta with ascorbate, 5) DAHK was more potent in ROS suppression and restoration of neuroblastoma cell viability than HSA, in correlation with an easier reduction of Cu(II)-HSA than Cu-DAHK by ascorbate, in vitro. Our data suggest that HSA is able to decrease aberrant Cu(II)-Abeta interaction. The repercussion of the competition between HSA and Abeta to bind Cu in the blood and brain and its relation to Alzheimer's disease are discussed.

Immune reconstitution syndrome and the thyroid. Reconstitution Graves' disease occurs in three settings. First, bone marrow transplantation from a donor with Graves' disease may cause this disease to appear in the recipient, as a result of adoptive immunity, although disordered immunoregulation secondary to graft-versus-host disease may also play a role. Second, alemtuzumab treatment for multiple sclerosis leads to the development of Graves' disease in up to a third of patients during the phase of naive T-cell expansion, which follows therapeutic lymphocyte depletion. Other reconstitution autoimmune phenomena, including immune thrombocytopaenic purpura, are also recognised after alemtuzumab administration. Finally, reconstitution Graves' disease may occur during a similar phase of CD4(+) T-cell expansion, which follows highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Again, this complication is part of a broader spectrum of immunoregulatory disturbances, which can arise after immune reconstitution. The mechanisms responsible for reconstitution Graves' disease are at present unclear, but may include a relative bias towards a Th2-mediated immune response and reduced competition for autoreactive lymphocytes to expand during the time when recovery from lymphopenia commences.


[Role of calcium-dependent mechanisms in the development of atrophy in postural muscle deprived of gravitational loading].

Rapid detection of Acanthamoeba cysts in frozen sections of corneal scrapings with Fungiflora Y. To evaluate the usefulness of serial frozen sections of corneal scrapings stained with Fungiflora Y (FFY) to diagnose Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). Eight patients with suspected AK were studied. Serial frozen sections were made from part of the corneal epithelial scrapings and stained with FFY. The remaining corneal epithelial scrapings were submitted for laboratory culture. The FFY stained frozen sections were completed within an hour, and Acanthamoeba cysts were detected under a fluorescence microscope in all eight patients. The same sections were examined with a light microscope, and Acanthamoeba cysts were confirmed to be present from their morphological characteristics. Five of the eight patients had positive laboratory cultures for Acanthamoeba. FFY staining of frozen sections of corneal scrapings is a rapid and reliable technique which can be used to make an early diagnosis of AK.

Rhizomes of Gastrodia elata B(L) possess antidepressant-like effect via monoamine modulation in subchronic animal model. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders that affects over 10% of individuals. However there is no desirable therapeutic approach nowadays. Thus, looking for an alternative treatment is important. The objectives of this study are to investigate the antidepressant effects of the rhizomes of Gastradia elata B(L), a traditional Chinese medicine, in the animal model forced-swimming test (FST), and to analyze the monoamine content in the rats' brain regions in order to better understand the possible mechanisms of the water extract of the rhizomes of Gastrodia elata B(L) (WGE). Subchronic administration of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg bw WGE by gavage for 21 consecutive days significantly reduced the immobility duration of rats in the test session of FST as compared to the control group (p < 0.05), with the equivalent effects as the antidepressant drug fluoxetine. The concentration of serotonin (5-HT) in the frontal cortex and dopamine (DA) in striatum were significantly increased after WGE administration (p < 0.05). The ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT and (DOPAC + HVA)/DA, i.e. the turnover of 5-HT and DA respectively, were also significantly lowered in WGE groups (p < 0.05). In summary, the present study showed that the WGE possesses antidepressant-like effect on rats in the animal model FST, and the possible mechanism may be via regulating both the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

[Differential diagnosis of child sexual abuse]. The evaluation of a child presenting with an anogenital complaint or lesion can be challenging for both the clinician and the patient. The doctor met the real possibility that a diagnosis of a condition caused by sexual abuse will affect significantly the child and the family. A misdiagnosis of abuse or failure to recognize a treatable condition can also have detrimental consequences. Most primary care physicians are not trained to recognize the variety of systemic and dermatologic problems that affect the anogenital area. Dermatologists and other specialists often do not appreciate the possibility of sexual abuse. In this article we present a systematic approach to the child with anogenital complaints which may mimic sexual abuse.


Removal of rhodamine B (a basic dye) and thoron (an acidic dye) from dilute aqueous solutions and wastewater simulants by ion flotation.

Use of the acellular dermal matrix in revisionary aesthetic breast surgery. Revisionary augmentation and revision of augmentation mastopexy are of considerable interest to plastic surgeons who perform breast surgery because of the procedures' complexity. In these cases, surgeons are faced with either thinned breast tissues resulting from large breast implants with tissue stretch or encapsulation caused by excessive scarring. To our knowledge, there are currently no large-series studies describing the use of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) in cosmetic breast surgery. The authors describe the use of the ADM in revisionary breast surgery to establish the aesthetic breast form. A retrospective chart review was conducted of 78 consecutive patients who underwent revisionary breast augmentation and augmentation mastopexies with ADM during a period of just over two years (October 2005 to January 2008). Data collected included patient characteristics, complications, outcomes, and reoperation rates. Seventy-eight procedures were performed with ADM during the two-year period, with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. There were two complications requiring reoperations for a hematoma and implant malposition, respectively. There were no Baker III or IV capsular contractures at one year postprocedure. Revisionary augmentation and revision of augmentation mastopexy are commonly performed procedures and they have a significantly higher complication rate than primary procedures. This series shows that the ADM can be used both safely and effectively in revisionary cases, resulting in decreased rates of capsular contracture and implant cushioning/stabilization.

Dusty discos and dangerous desires: community perceptions of adolescent sexual and reproductive health risks and vulnerability and the potential role of parents in rural Mwanza, Tanzania. This paper presents villagers' assessments of young people's sexual and reproductive health vulnerability and of community-based interventions that may reduce both vulnerability and risk in rural Mwanza, Tanzania. The primary methods used were 28 group discussions and 18 in-depth interviews with representatives of various social groups in four villages. The majority of participants attributed young people's sexual and reproductive health risks to a combination of modernisation (and its impact on family and community life), socioeconomic conditions, social norms in rural/lakeshore communities and the difficulties parents and other adults face in raising adolescents in contemporary Tanzania. Community life has limited opportunities for positive development but contains many risky situations. Young and old agreed that parents have a strong influence on young people's health but are failing in their parental responsibility. Parents acknowledged the multiple influences on sexual risk behaviour. They expressed a need for knowledge and skills related to parenting so that they can address these influences both through family- and community-based strategies.

Oxidative stress in acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is one of the common dermatological diseases and its pathogenesis is multifactorial. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of oxidative stress in acne vulgaris. The study involved 32 patients with acne vulgaris in the patient group and 34 healthy adults in the control group. The parameters of oxidative stress such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), xanthine oxidase (XO), nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the venous blood of patients were measured spectrophotometrically. The values were compared with those of the control group. The serum levels of MDA and XO activity in the patients with acne vulgaris were significantly higher than those of the controls. A significantly lower SOD and CAT activity was found in the patient group than in the control group. Although the patient group had higher serum levels of NO than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that oxidative damage may play a role in the pathogenesis of acne; therefore, significant alterations may occur in the antioxidant defence system.

Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture. Agricultural food production and agriculturally-related change in land use substantially contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide. Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector. Although livestock products are a source of some essential nutrients, they provide large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We considered potential strategies for the agricultural sector to meet the target recommended by the UK Committee on Climate Change to reduce UK emissions from the concentrations recorded in 1990 by 80% by 2050, which would require a 50% reduction by 2030. With use of the UK as a case study, we identified that a combination of agricultural technological improvements and a 30% reduction in livestock production would be needed to meet this target; in the absence of good emissions data from Brazil, we assumed for illustrative purposes that the required reductions would be the same for our second case study in São Paulo city. We then used these data to model the potential benefits of reduced consumption of livestock products on the burden of ischaemic heart disease: disease burden would decrease by about 15% in the UK (equivalent to 2850 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] per million population in 1 year) and 16% in São Paulo city (equivalent to 2180 DALYs per million population in 1 year). Although likely to yield benefits to health, such a strategy will probably encounter cultural, political, and commercial resistance, and face technical challenges. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed across agricultural, nutritional, public health, and climate change communities worldwide to provide affordable, healthy, low-emission diets for all societies.

Mechanism of NSF: New evidence challenging the prevailing theory. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been associated with the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with severely impaired renal function (SIRF), endstage renal disease (ESRD), or acute renal failure (ARF). Since the vast majority of these patients do not get NSF, it is highly likely that patient factors play a role in its development. Although "free" or dechelated gadolinium is thought by some to be the only trigger of NSF, recent evidence suggests that chelated gadolinium may be important. Chelated gadolinium such as Omniscan (gadodiamide) and Magnevist (gadopentetate) can directly stimulate macrophages and monocytes in vitro to release profibrotic cytokines and growth factors capable of initiating and supporting the tissue fibrosis that is characteristic of NSF. In addition, an effect of chelated gadolinium on fibroblasts has also been demonstrated. Chelated gadolinium in the form of Omniscan, Magnevist, MultiHance, and ProHance increased proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts. Indeed, increased numbers of macrophages, together with activated fibroblasts and fibrocytes, are essential cells in the fibrotic process and are present in NSF skin. Accordingly, it is important that chelated gadolinium, in combination with patient cofactors, is considered in the etiology of NSF associated with enhanced scans. J. Magn. Reson.

[Selective vitamin D receptor activation: effect on renal physiopathology]. The wide distribution of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) suggests that its activators (VDRAs) are involved in diverse organ functions including the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. These actions are likely to be independent of PTH and calcium/phosphorus levels. Earlier studies had shown that calcitriol was able to favorably influence experimental nephritis, remnant kidney glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis, mediated through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Recently, VDRAs were shown to inhibit the reninangiotensin system (RAS), acting directly on the renin gene promoter. This action is independent of the systemic RAS blockade. VDRAs also inhibit other important gene promoters including NF-kB and p65, which are known to foster inflammation and fibrogenesis. These multiple actions result in a decrease in macrophage infiltration, fibroblast activation, and endothelial mesenchymal transition in the kidney. These findings represent the rationale for the use of VDRAs, in association with RAS blocking agents, to counteract the progression of renal injury characterized by inflammation and neofibrogenesis. However, despite promising preliminary results, the human studies available to date do not allow to draw definitive conclusions on this matter.

Neurogenetics of dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity in activation of brain reward circuitry and relapse: proposing "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). It is well known that after prolonged abstinence, individuals who use their drug of choice experience a powerful euphoria that often precipitates relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed "supersensitivity" might be tied to genetic dopaminergic polymorphisms. Another therapeutic conundrum relates to the paradoxical finding that the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine induces stronger activation of brain reward circuitry in individuals who carry the DRD2 A1 allele compared with DRD2 A2 allele carriers. Because carriers of the A1 allele relative to the A2 allele of the DRD2 gene have significantly lower D2 receptor density, a reduced sensitivity to dopamine agonist activity would be expected in the former. Thus, it is perplexing that with low D2 density there is an increase in reward sensitivity with the dopamine D2 agonist bromocriptine. Moreover, under chronic or long-term therapy with D2 agonists, such as bromocriptine, it has been shown in vitro that there is a proliferation of D2 receptors. One explanation for this relates to the demonstration that the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with increased striatal activity of L-amino acid decarboxylase, the final step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. This appears to be a protective mechanism against low receptor density and would favor the utilization of an amino acid neurotransmitter precursor like L-tyrosine for preferential synthesis of dopamine. This seems to lead to receptor proliferation to normal levels and results in significantly better treatment compliance only in A1 carriers. We propose that low D2 receptor density and polymorphisms of the D2 gene are associated with risk for relapse of substance abuse, including alcohol dependence, heroin craving, cocaine dependence, methamphetamine abuse, nicotine sensitization, and glucose craving. With this in mind, we suggest a putative physiological mechanism that may help to explain the enhanced sensitivity following intense acute dopaminergic D2 receptor activation: "denervation supersensitivity." Rats with unilateral depletions of neostriatal dopamine display increased sensitivity to dopamine agonists estimated to be 30 to 100 x in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rotational model. Given that mild striatal dopamine D2 receptor proliferation occurs (20%-40%), it is difficult to explain the extent of behavioral supersensitivity by a simple increase in receptor density. Thus, the administration of dopamine D2 agonists would target D2 sensitization and attenuate relapse, especially in D2 receptor A1 allele carriers. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by clinical trials utilizing amino acid neurotransmitter precursors, enkephalinase, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme inhibition, which have resulted in attenuated relapse rates in reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) probands. If future translational research reveals that dopamine agonist therapy reduces relapse in RDS, it would support the proposed concept, which we term "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). This term couples the mechanism for relapse, which is "deprivation-amplification," especially in DRD2 A1 allele carriers with natural D2 agonist therapy utilizing amino acid precursors and COMT and enkepalinase inhibition therapy.

The impact of maternal celiac disease on birthweight and preterm birth: a Danish population-based cohort study. Adverse pregnancy outcomes have been associated with maternal celiac disease (CD). In this study, we investigate the effect of treated and untreated maternal CD on infant birthweight and preterm birth. A population-based cohort study consisted of all singleton live births in Denmark between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 2004 was used. A total of 1,504,342 babies were born to 836,241 mothers during the study period. Of those, 1105 babies were born to women with diagnosed CD and 346 were born to women with undiagnosed CD. Women with diagnosed CD were considered as treated with a gluten free diet while women with undiagnosed CD were considered as untreated. The outcome measures were: birthweight, small for gestational age (SGA: birthweight <10th centile), very small for gestational age (VSGA: birthweight <5th centile) and preterm birth. We compared these measures in treated and untreated women with those of a reference group (no history of CD). Women with untreated CD delivered smaller babies [difference = -98 g (95% CI: -130, -67)], with a higher risk of SGA infants [OR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.63)], VSGA infants [OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.17, 2.03)] and preterm birth [OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.72)] compared with women without CD. Women with treated CD had no increased risk of reduced mean birthweight, risk of delivering SGA and VSGA infants or preterm birth compared with women without CD. Untreated maternal CD increases the risk of reduced birthweight, the risk of delivering SGA and VSGA infants and preterm birth. Diagnosis and presumed treatment of maternal CD with a gluten-free diet appeared to result in a birthweight and preterm birth rate similar to those in women without CD.

KTP/LBO laser vaporization of the prostate. Laser-based treatments have emerged in the past 15 years as an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Increasing demand for a minimally invasive procedure to alleviate lower urinary tract symptoms with greater efficacy and fewer side effects has led to the introduction of various lasers. The excellent clinical outcomes, low morbidity, technical simplicity, and cost-effectiveness of GreenLight laser photoselective vaporization have made this technology a valid and efficacious clinical alternative to TURP.

Internal proton transfer in the external pyridoxal 5'-phosphate Schiff base in dopa decarboxylase. Combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of dopa decarboxylase have been carried out to elucidate the factors that contribute to the tautomeric equilibrium of the intramolecular proton transfer in the external PLP-L-dopa Schiff base. The presence of a carboxylate anion on the alpha-carbon of the Schiff base stabilizes the zwitterions and shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oxoenamine tautomer (protonated Schiff base). Moreover, protonation of the PLP pyridine nitrogen further drives the equilibrium toward the oxoenamine direction. On the other hand, solvent effects favor the hydroxyimine configuration, although the equilibrium favors the oxoenamine isomer with a methyl group as the substituent on the imino nitrogen. In dopa decarboxylase, the hydroxyimine form of the PLP(H+)-L-dopa Schiff base is predicted to be the major isomer with a relative free energy of -1.3 kcal/mol over that of the oxoenamine isomer. Both Asp271 and Lys303 stabilize the hydroxyimine configuration through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the pyridine nitrogen of the PLP and the imino nitrogen of the Schiff base, respectively. Interestingly, Thr246 plays a double role in the intramolecular proton transfer process, in which it initially donates a hydrogen bond to the phenolate oxygen in the oxoenamine configuration and then switches to a hydrogen bond acceptor from the phenolic hydroxyl group in the hydroxyimine tautomer.

Ureteral motility. The pyeloureteral function is to transport urine from the kidneys into the ureter toward the urinary bladder for storage until micturition. A set of mechanisms collaborates to achieve this purpose: the basic process regulating ureteral peristalsis is myogenic, initiated by active pacemaker cells located in the renal pelvis. Great emphasis has been given to hydrodynamic factors, such as urine flow rate in determining the size and pattern of urine boluses which, in turn, affect the mechanical aspects of peristaltic rhythm, rate, amplitude, and baseline pressure. Neurogenic contribution is thought to be limited to play a modulatory role in ureteral peristalsis. The myogenic theory of ureteral peristalsis can be traced back to Engelmann (1) who was able to localize the peristaltic pressure wave's origin in the renal pelvis and suggested that the ureteral contraction impulse passes from one ureteral cell to another, the whole ureter working as a functional syncitium. Recent studies of ureteral biomechanics, smooth muscle cell electrophysiology, membrane ionic currents, cytoskeletal components and pharmacophysiology much improved our understanding of the mechanism of how the urine bolus is propelled, how this process is disturbed in pathological states, and what could be done to improve it.

Evolution of malaria mortality and morbidity after the emergence of chloroquine resistance in Niakhar, Senegal. Recently, it has been assumed that resistance of Plasmodium to chloroquine increased malaria mortality. The study aimed to assess the impact of chemoresistance on mortality attributable to malaria in a rural area of Senegal, since the emergence of resistance in 1992, whilst chloroquine was used as first-line treatment of malaria, until the change in national anti-malarial policy in 2003. The retrospective study took place in the demographic surveillance site (DSS) of Niakhar. Data about malaria morbidity were obtained from health records of three health care facilities, where diagnosis of malaria was based on clinical signs. Source of data concerning malaria mortality were verbal autopsies performed by trained fieldworkers and examined by physicians who identified the probable cause of death. From 1992 to 2004, clinical malaria morbidity represented 39% of total morbidity in health centres. Mean malaria mortality was 2.4 per thousand and 10.4 per thousand among total population and children younger than five years, respectively, and was highest in the 1992-1995 period. It tended to decline from 1992 to 2003 (Trend test, total population p = 0.03, children 0-4 years p = 0.12 - children 1-4 years p = 0.04- children 5-9 years p = 0.01). Contrary to what has been observed until 1995, mortality attributable to malaria did not continue to increase dramatically in spite of the growing resistance to chloroquine and its use as first-line treatment until 2003. Malaria morbidity and mortality followed parallel trends and rather fluctuated accordingly to rainfall.

A galaxy of folds. Many protein classification systems capture homologous relationships by grouping domains into families and superfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity. Superfamilies with similar 3D structures are further grouped into folds. In the absence of discernable sequence similarity, these structural similarities were long thought to have originated independently, by convergent evolution. However, the growth of databases and advances in sequence comparison methods have led to the discovery of many distant evolutionary relationships that transcend the boundaries of superfamilies and folds. To investigate the contributions of convergent versus divergent evolution in the origin of protein folds, we clustered representative domains of known structure by their sequence similarity, treating them as point masses in a virtual 2D space which attract or repel each other depending on their pairwise sequence similarities. As expected, families in the same superfamily form tight clusters. But often, superfamilies of the same fold are linked with each other, suggesting that the entire fold evolved from an ancient prototype. Strikingly, some links connect superfamilies with different folds. They arise from modular peptide fragments of between 20 and 40 residues that co-occur in the connected folds in disparate structural contexts. These may be descendants of an ancestral pool of peptide modules that evolved as cofactors in the RNA world and from which the first folded proteins arose by amplification and recombination. Our galaxy of folds summarizes, in a single image, most known and many yet undescribed homologous relationships between protein superfamilies, providing new insights into the evolution of protein domains.

Separation of astaxanthin from cells of Phaffia rhodozyma using colloidal gas aphrons in a flotation column. The aim of this study is to investigate the separation of astaxanthin from the cells of Phaffia rhodozyma using colloidal gas aphrons (CGA), which are surfactant stabilized microbubbles, in a flotation column. It was reported in previous studies that optimum recoveries are achieved at conditions that favor electrostatic interactions. Therefore, in this study, CGA generated from the cationic surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were applied to suspensions of cells pretreated with NaOH. The different operation modes (batch or continuous) and the effect of volumetric ratio of CGA to feed, initial concentration of feed, operating height, and flow rate of CGA on the separation of astaxanthin were investigated. The volumetric ratio was found to have a significant effect on the separation of astaxanthin for both batch and continuous experiments. Additionally, the effect of homogenization of the cells on the purity of the recovered fractions was investigated, showing that the homogenization resulted in increased purity. Moreover, different concentrations of surfactant were used for the generation of CGA for the recovery of astaxanthin on batch mode; it was found that recoveries up to 98% could be achieved using CGA generated from a CTAB solution 0.8 mM, which is below the CTAB critical micellar concentration (CMC). These results offer important information for the scale-up of the separation of astaxanthin from the cells of P. rhodozyma using CGA.

The apical plasma membrane of Drosophila embryonic epithelia. The apical plasma membrane of epithelia presents the interface between organs and the external environment. It has biochemical activities distinct from those of the basal and lateral plasma membranes, as it accommodates the production and assembly of ordered apical matrices involved in organ protection and physiology and determines the microenvironment in the apical extracellular milieu. Here, we emphasise the importance of the apical plasma membrane in tissue differentiation, by mainly focussing on the embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and discuss the principal organisation of the apical plasma membrane into repetitive subdomains of specific topologies and activities essential for epithelial function.

Isolation, characterization, and production of red pigment from Cercospora piaropi a biocontrol agent for waterhyacinth. A red pigment produced by a Mexican isolate of Cercospora piaropi (waterhyacinth pathogen) has been isolated and identified as cercosporin. The kinetic of cercosporin production in culture media during dark/light regimes was evaluated. When C. piaropi was cultivated in continuous light and potato dextrose broth culture, a maximum of cercosporin production was observed (72.59 mg/l). Despite other reports, C piaropi Mexican isolate produce cercosporin in dark conditions (25.70 mg/l). The results suggest that production of cercosporin in C. piaropi-waterhyacinth pathogenesis is an important factor to take into account in biocontrol strategies.

Stereochemical mechanisms of tRNA methyltransferases. Methylation of tRNA on the four canonical bases adds structural complexity to the molecule, and improves decoding specificity and efficiency. While many tRNA methylases are known, detailed insight into the catalytic mechanism is only available in a few cases. Of interest among all tRNA methylases is the structural basis for nucleotide selection, by which the specificity is limited to a single site, or broadened to multiple sites. General themes in catalysis include the basis for rate acceleration at highly diverse nucleophilic centers for methyl transfer, using S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor. Studies of tRNA methylases have also yielded insights into molecular evolution, particularly in the case of enzymes that recognize distinct structures to perform identical reactions at the same target nucleotide.

MCI patients declining and not-declining at mid-term follow-up: FDG-PET findings. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) not converted to dementia at one to three years follow-up represent a heterogeneous group across studies, by including 'late converters' but also patients without any neurodegenerative disease. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of memory and brain metabolic assessment could identify subgroups of memory decliners (MCI/Decl) and non-decliners (MCI/noDecl) before a long follow-up time is available. From twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) at baseline, three groups were identified at follow-up: 10 patients who converted to AD (MCI/AD); 10 patients either showing episodic memory worsening or reaching the floor effect on memory and declining in other key tests (MCI/Decl) and 9 patients showing no memory worsening or even improvement (MCI/noDecl). They were compared with a group of fourteen elderly controls (CTR) by means of basal FDG-PET voxel-based analysis (SPM2). Two hypometabolic clusters were found in MCI/AD versus CTR, including the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, the left parietal precuneus and the left fusiform gyrus. MCI/AD showed also a large hypometabolic region, mainly including the left medium and superior temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, when compared to MCI/noDecl. The MCI/Decl showed a hypometabolic region in the left medial temporal lobe versus both CTR (hippocampus) and MCI/noDecl (parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus). No significant difference was found in the comparison between CTR and MCI/noDecl, neither in the comparison between MCI/Decl and MCI/AD. Thus, non converter MCI patients comprised a sub-group of 'decliners' with AD-like metabolic and cognitive patterns, likely including 'late converters', and a sub-group lacking this pattern, with stable or improving memory function and a brain metabolic picture similar to that in healthy controls. Combining neuropsychological and FDG-PET information could be used for prognostic purposes in aMCI patients at medium-term follow-up.

The hydroxyl-functionalized magnetic particles for purification of glycan-binding proteins. Glycan-protein interactions play important biological roles in biological processes. Although there are some methods such as glycan arrays that may elucidate recognition events between carbohydrates and protein as well as screen the important glycan-binding proteins, there is a lack of simple effectively separate method to purify them from complex samples. In proteomics studies, fractionation of samples can help to reduce their complexity and to enrich specific classes of proteins for subsequent downstream analyses. Herein, a rapid simple method for purification of glycan-binding proteins from proteomic samples was developed using hydroxyl-coated magnetic particles coupled with underivatized carbohydrate. Firstly, the epoxy-coated magnetic particles were further hydroxyl functionalized with 4-hydroxybenzhydrazide, then the carbohydrates were efficiently immobilized on hydroxyl functionalized surface of magnetic particles by formation of glycosidic bond with the hemiacetal group at the reducing end of the suitable carbohydrates via condensation. All conditions of this method were optimized. The magnetic particle-carbohydrate conjugates were used to purify the glycan-binding proteins from human serum. The fractionated glycan-binding protein population was displayed by SDS-PAGE. The result showed that the amount of 1 mg magnetic particles coupled with mannose in acetate buffer (pH 5.4) was 10 micromol. The fractionated glycan-binding protein population in human serum could be eluted from the magnetic particle-mannose conjugates by 0.1% SDS. The methodology could work together with the glycan microarrays for screening and purification of the important GBPs from complex protein samples.

Systemic candesartan reduces brain angiotensin II via downregulation of brain renin-angiotensin system. The renin-angiotensin system has an important function in the regulation of blood pressure as well as in pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. We examined the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) on brain angiotensin II levels in angiotensin II-infused hypertensive rats. Angiotensin II or vehicle was infused subcutaneously for 14 days in Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin II infusion resulted in increased blood pressure, an effect that was blocked by candesartan treatment. There was no effect of the angiotensin II infusion on Angiotensin II levels in the brain or on blood-brain barrier permeability. Brain tissue angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme mRNA levels were not changed by angiotensin II infusion but were decreased by candesartan treatment. At 2 weeks of treatment, CV11974, an active form of candesartan, was detectable in the plasma but was not detectable in brain tissue. These data suggest that treatment with candesartan decreases brain angiotensin II by decreasing brain angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme gene expression.

Influenza A virus receptors in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of pigeons. To understand the basis of the resistance of pigeons to Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1, we examined the presence of influenza virus receptors, sialic acids linked to galactose by an alpha-2,3 linkage (SAalpha2,3Gal) or by an alpha-2,6 linkage (SAalpha2,6Gal), in respiratory and intestinal tracts of pigeons and compared the distributions of N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids in the trachea and intestines of pigeons and chickens. Results suggested that the epithelial surfaces of the larynx, trachea, bronchus, and bronchiole of pigeons contained abundant SAalpha2,6Gal with little or no SAalpha2,3Gal. In contrast, the epithelial surfaces of the pharynx, trachea, bronchus, and bronchiole of chickens contained mainly SAalpha2,3Gal, a well-recognized receptor for avian influenza viruses including H5N1 HPAIV. A similar distribution pattern of N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids in the trachea and intestines of pigeons and chickens was observed. Overall, the results suggest that SAalpha2,6Gal is the major receptor in the pigeon airway, which may partly contribute to the resistance of pigeons to Asian lineage HPAIV subtype H5N1.

Dynamic expression and heterogeneous intracellular location of En-1 during late mouse embryonic development. Engrailed-1 (En-1) is a transcription factor involved in the development of the midbrain/hindbrain during mouse early embryogenesis. Although En-1 is expressed from embryogenesis to adulthood, there has been no detailed description of its expression during late mouse embryonic development. Here we report the expression pattern of En-1 in the mouse embryo from E10.5 to the neonatal state. With immunohistochemistry we found that En-1 was expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) from E10.5 to the neonatal state, mostly restricted to the midbrain/hindbrain junction. Outside the CNS, En-1 is dynamically expressed in several neural crest-associated structures including the cranial mesenchyme, the mandibular arches, the vagus nerve, the dorsal root ganglia, the sympathetic ganglia, the somites, the heart and the cloaca. Additionally, we found that in the CNS, most of the En-1 was located in the nuclei, while outside the CNS, En-1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. These findings provided additional evidence that En-1 may be involved in the development of neural crest cells.

Structural features of fusogenic model transmembrane domains that differentially regulate inner and outer leaflet mixing in membrane fusion. The transmembrane domains of fusion proteins are known to be important for their fusogenic activity. In an effort to systematically investigate the structure/function relationships of transmembrane domains we had previously designed LV-peptides that mimic natural fusion protein TMDs in their ability to drive fusion after incorporation into liposomal membranes. Here, we investigate the impact of different structural features of LV-peptide TMDs on inner and outer leaflet mixing. We find that fusion driven by the helical peptides involves a hemifusion intermediate as previously seen for natural fusion proteins. Helix backbone dynamics enhances fusion by selectively promoting outer leaflet mixing. Furthermore, the hydrophobic length of the peptides as well as covalent attachment of long acyl chains affects outer and inner leaflet mixing to different extents. Different structural features of transmembrane domains thus appear to differentially influence the rearrangements of lipids in fusion initiation and the hemifusion-to-fusion transition. The relevance of these findings in respect to the function of natural fusion proteins is discussed.

Determination of a dosage regimen of colistin by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic integration and modeling for treatment of G.I.T. disease in pigs. Colistin is an antimicrobial drug of the polymyxin group and COLIVET SOLUTION is an aqueous solution containing colistin sulphate (2 x 10(6) IU/mL), formulated for oral administration. The target species is the pig, particularly the suckling and post weaning animal. This investigation was undertaken to provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on which to base the selection of dosage rate and interval of the solution for the treatment of porcine colibacillosis. Colistin absorption from the gastrointestinal tract of young pigs, when administered at dosage rates of 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 IU/kg, was slight or absent. The drug was therefore restricted almost entirely to the required site of action. The colistin concentration-time profile within the jejunum and ileum was established, and this enabled determination of the pharmacokinetic variables, maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under curve (AUC) and derivation of the surrogate indices of antibacterial activity, C(max)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and AUC/MIC through integration of in vivo data with the results of in vitro potency studies for four strains of Escherichia coli. In the in vitro bacterial growth inhibition studies colistin acted by a concentration-dependent killing mechanism. Numerical values for the surrogate parameter AUC/MIC producing bactericidal and eradication effects of colistin against four strains of E. coli were established by PK-PD modeling based on the sigmoidal E(max) equation. These data were used to predict a daily dosage regimen for colistin.

Keeping psychotherapy notes separate from the patient record. Doctoral level psychologists (N = 464) who were members of the American Psychological Association and who identified themselves as clinical practitioners were surveyed about their knowledge and utilization of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule that allows practitioners to keep their psychotherapy notes separate from their patients' records if they involve electronic submissions. Although 79% of those surveyed said they were aware of the HIPAA privacy rule allowing for a separate set of notes, slightly less than half (46%) reported currently using such notes even though half (49%) felt that patients benefit most from the use of a separate set of psychotherapy notes. Surprisingly, 21% said they had never heard of the HIPAA provision allowing for a separate set of notes. Considering that when this provision was introduced it was heralded as a major benefit for mental health practitioners, its low utilization is surprising. Perhaps clinical practitioners would benefit from continuing education about the benefits of such notes.


The role of olfaction throughout juvenile development: functional adaptations in elasmobranchs.

[Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in CKD-MBD]. Evidence has been accumulating in recent years that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disease associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in patients with CKD, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality is 10-30-fold higher in dialysis patients than in age-, gender- and race-matched controls. On the basis of this evidence it has been suggested that the cardiovascular risk profile of CKD patients is different from that of the general population, resulting from a complex and peculiar interaction of risk factors. In fact, traditional risk factors such as hypertension, aging, smoking, diabetes, and lipid disorders do not fully explain the high frequency of cardiovascular disease in CKD, so other factors must be involved in the high mortality rate in uremic patients. In this article we will provide an overview of the epidemiology of the cardiovascular risk factors in CKD. Among the non-traditional risk factors we have focused particularly on those related to mineral metabolism, which contribute the high rates of cardiovascular events observed in CKD.

Attenuation of canonical transient receptor potential-like channel 6 expression specifically reduces the diacylglycerol-mediated increase in intracellular calcium in human myometrial cells. An increase in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) as a result of release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores or influx of extracellular Ca(2+) contributes to the regulation of smooth muscle contractile activity. Human uterine smooth muscle cells exhibit receptor-, store-, and diacylglycerol (OAG)-mediated extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent increases in [Ca(2+)](i) (SRCE) and express canonical transient receptor potential-like channels (TRPC) mRNAs (predominantly TRPC1, -4, and -6) that have been implicated in SRCE. To determine the role of TRPC6 in human myometrial SRCE, short hairpin RNA constructs were designed that effectively targeted a TRPC6 mRNA reporter for degradation. One sequence was used to produce an adenovirus construct (TC6sh1). TC6sh1 reduced TRPC6 mRNA but not TRPC1, -3, -4, -5, or -7 mRNAs in PHM1-41 myometrial cells. Compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with empty vector, the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to OAG was specifically inhibited by TC6sh1, whereas SRCE responses elicited by either oxytocin or thapsigargin were not changed. Similar findings were observed in primary pregnant human myometrial cells. When PHM1-41 cells were activated by OAG in the absence of extracellular Na(+), the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was partially reduced. Furthermore, pretreatment with nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, also partially reduced the OAG-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase. Similar effects were observed in primary human myometrial cells. These findings suggest that OAG activates channels containing TRPC6 in myometrial cells and that these channels act via both enhanced Na(+) entry coupled to activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry channels and a nifedipine-independent Ca(2+) entry mechanism to promote elevation of intracellular Ca(2+).

Treatment comprised nine months' antibiotherapy and bone curettage to prevent intra-articular extension. At 42 months' follow-up, functional results were good, without recurrence of infection.


Hepsin cooperates with MYC in the progression of adenocarcinoma in a prostate cancer mouse model.

Roles for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and the novel endoplasmic reticulum stress response gene Derlin-3 in the ischemic heart. Stresses, such as ischemia, impair folding of nascent proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating the unfolded protein response, which restores efficient ER protein folding, thus leading to protection from stress. In part, the unfolded protein response alleviates ER stress and cell death by increasing the degradation of terminally misfolded ER proteins via ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD is increased by the ER stress modulator, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, which can induce genes that encode components of the ERAD machinery. Recently, it was shown that the mouse heart is protected from ischemic damage by ATF6; however, ERAD has not been studied in the cardiac context. A recent microarray study showed that the Derlin-3 (Derl3) gene, which encodes an important component of the ERAD machinery, is robustly induced by ATF6 in the mouse heart. In the present study, activated ATF6 induced Derl3 in cultured cardiomyocytes, and in the heart, in vivo. Simulated ischemia (sI), which activates ER stress, induced Derl3 in cultured myocytes, and in an in vivo mouse model of myocardial infarction, Derl3 was also induced. Derl3 overexpression enhanced ERAD and protected cardiomyocytes from simulated ischemia-induced cell death, whereas dominant-negative Derl3 decreased ERAD and increased simulated ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death. This study describes a potentially protective role for Derl3 in the heart, and is the first to investigate the functional consequences of enhancing ERAD in the cardiac context.

Equine chorionic gonadotropin improves the efficacy of a progestin-based fixed-time artificial insemination protocol in Nelore (Bos indicus) heifers. A total of 177 Nelore heifers were examined by ultrasonography to determine the presence or absence of a corpus luteum (CL) and received a 3mg norgestomet ear implant plus 2mg of estradiol benzoate i.m. On Day 8, implants were removed and 150 microg of d-cloprostenol i.m. was administered. At the time of norgestomet implant removal, heifers with or without CL at the time of initiating treatment were assigned equally and by replicate to be treated with 0IU (n=87) or 400IU (n=90) eCG i.m. All heifers received 1mg of EB i.m. on Day 9 and were submitted to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) 30-34h later. The addition of eCG increased the diameter of the largest follicle (LF) at FTAI (10.6+/-0.2mm vs. 9.5+/-0.2mm; P=0.003; mean+/-SEM), the final growth rate of the LF (1.14+/-0.1mm/day vs. 0.64+/-0.1mm/day; P=0.0009), ovulation rate [94.4% (85/90) vs. 73.6% (64/87); P=0.0006], the diameter of the CL at Day 15 (15.5+/-0.3mm vs. 13.8+/-0.3mm; P=0.0002), serum concentrations of progesterone 5 days after FTAI (6.6+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 3.6+/-0.7ng/ml; P=0.0009), and pregnancy per AI [P/AI; 50.0% (45/90) vs. 36.8% (32/87); P=0.04]. The absence of a CL at the beginning of the treatment negatively influenced the P/AI [30.2% (16/53) vs. 49.2% (61/124); P=0.01]. Therefore, the presence of a CL (and/or onset of puberty) must be considered in setting up FTAI programs in heifers. In addition, eCG may be an important tool for the enhancement of follicular growth, ovulation, size and function of the subsequent CL, and pregnancy rates in progestin-based FTAI protocols in Bos indicus heifers.

Evaluation of three Pakistani sheep breeds for their natural resistance to artificial infection of Haemonchus contortus. This study was carried out to evaluate three Pakistani sheep breeds (Kachhi, Lohi and Thalli) for their natural resistance against artificial infection of Haemonchus contortus. Lambs were weaned at 3 months of age, housed in separate pens and treated with Avermectin to eliminate gastrointestinal nematode infection. Each lamb was infected orally with approximately 10,000 third stage larvae of H. contortus. Selected breeds were compared on the basis of parasitological, haematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters over a period of 9 weeks. Faecal egg counts were measured weekly while packed cell volume, total serum protein, serum albumin and live weight were determined fortnightly. At 9th-week post-infection, 10 animals of each breed were randomly selected and slaughtered for worm, eosinophil and mast cell counts from the abomasum of each animal. Faecal egg counts and worm burden were significantly lower (P<0.05) in Lohi sheep than Kachhi and Thalli breeds. Furthermore, the Lohi breed also exhibited the highest levels of packed cell volume, total serum protein, albumin as well as eosinophils and mast cell counts. Breed x week interaction also remained significant (P<0.05) in most of the parameters for Lohi breed. The results suggested that Lohi breed expressed a significant innate resistance to artificial infection of H. contortus.

A sensitive cardiac troponin T assay in stable coronary artery disease. In most patients with stable coronary artery disease, plasma cardiac troponin T levels are below the limit of detection for the conventional assay. The distribution and determinants of very low circulating troponin T levels, as well as their association with cardiovascular events, in such patients are unknown. We used a new, high-sensitivity assay to determine the concentration of cardiac troponin T in plasma samples from 3679 patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function. Results of the assay were analyzed in relation to the incidence of cardiovascular events during a median follow-up period of 5.2 years. With the highly sensitive assay, concentrations of cardiac troponin T were at or above the limit of detection (0.001 microg per liter) in 3593 patients (97.7%) and at or above the 99th percentile for apparently healthy subjects (0.0133 microg per liter) in 407 patients (11.1%). After adjustment for other independent prognostic indicators, there was a strong and graded increase in the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in the natural logarithm of the troponin T level, 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.74; P<0.001) and of heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.66 to 2.90; P<0.001) in this study group. Increased risk associated with higher levels of troponin T was evident well below the limit of detection of conventional cardiac troponin T assays and below the 99th percentile of values in a healthy population. There was no association between troponin T levels as measured with the highly sensitive assay and the incidence of myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.40; P=0.11). After adjustment for other independent prognostic indicators, cardiac troponin T concentrations as measured with a highly sensitive assay were significantly associated with the incidence of cardiovascular death and heart failure but not with myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

Role of MR imaging in prenatal diagnosis of pregnancies at risk for Joubert syndrome and related cerebellar disorders.

[Streptomyces globisporus 1912 mutants highly sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, their antibiotic activity and reparation ability]. Twenty five mutants defective in biosynthesis of antitumor antibiotic landomycin E and 22 mutants with higher level biosynthesis of this antibiotic were obtained after nitrosoguanidine mutagenic treatment of wild strain of Streptomyces globisporus 1912 spores. Six of them (5 mutants of LndE and 1 mutant of LndE+) were found to carry uvs-mutation responsible for high level UV-sensitivity. Uvs-mutants 1912-11 and 1912-16 were highly sensitive to the action of nitrous acid, hydrogen peroxide and methyl-methane-sulfonate.

Quantitative ultrasonic elastography for gel dosimetry. Advanced radiation techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for complex geometries in which targets are close to organs at risk have been introduced in radiation therapy, creating a need for procedures that allow easy three-dimensional (3-D) measurement of dose for verification purposes. Polymer gels that change their material properties when irradiated have been suggested for such use. For example, the change in their magnetic properties has been thoroughly investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, we have previously shown that the mechanical stiffness, i.e., Young's modulus, of these gels changes with dose. This finding prompted us to assess whether we can image a radiation-induced stiffness distribution with quantitative ultrasound elastography and whether the stiffness distribution is correlated with the dose distribution. A methacrylic-acid-based gel was loaded with scatterers to create an ultrasound echoic signal. It was irradiated to create a rod-like region of increased stiffness with a 10 x 10 mm(2) cross-section. The gel block was compressed in a frame that restricted the movement of the gel to planes orthogonal to the long axis of the irradiated region and ultrasonic echo data were acquired in the central plane during compression. This simplified irradiation pattern and experimental set-up were designed to approximate plane-strain conditions and was chosen for proof of concept. The movement of the gel was tracked from ultrasound images of a different compressional state using cross-correlation, enabling a displacement map to be created. The shear modulus was reconstructed using an inverse algorithm. The role of the magnitude of the regularization parameter in the inverse problem and the boundary conditions in influencing the spatial distribution of stiffness and, thus, final dose contrast was investigated through parametric studies. These parameters were adjusted using prior knowledge about the stiffness in parts of the material, e.g., the background was not irradiated and therefore its stiffness was homogeneous. It was observed that a suitable choice for these reconstruction parameters was essential for a quantitative application of stiffness measurement such as dosimetry. The dose contrast and distribution found with the optimal parameters were close to those obtained with MRI. Initial results reported in this article are encouraging and indicate that with ongoing refinement of ultrasound elastography techniques and accompanying inverse algorithms, this approach could play an important role in gel dosimetry.

Lightweight composites from long wheat straw and polypropylene web. Whole and split wheat straws (WS) with length up to 10 cm have been used with polypropylene (PP) webs to make lightweight composites with properties superior to jute-PP composites with the same density. The effect of WS concentration, WS length, and split configuration (half, quarter, and mechanically split) on flexural and tensile properties of the composites has been investigated. The sound absorption properties of composites from whole straw and split straw have been studied. Compared with whole WS-PP composites, mechanically split WS-PP composites have 69% higher flexural strength, 39% higher modulus of elasticity, 18% higher impact resistance properties, 69% higher tensile strength and 26% higher Young's modulus. Compared with jute-PP composites, mechanically split WS-PP composites have 114% higher flexural strength, 38% higher modulus of elasticity, 10% higher tensile strength, 140% higher Young's modulus, better sound absorption properties and 50% lower impact resistance.

Greenhouse gas emissions from boreal reservoirs in Manitoba and Quebec, Canada, measured with automated systems. Growing concern over the contribution of freshwater reservoirs to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and the relevance of long-term continuous measurements has led Fisheries and Oceans Canada, in conjunction with Manitoba Hydro, to develop continuous GHG monitors. Continuous water pCO(2), pCH(4), and pO(2) measurements were gathered to estimate gas fluxes in one temperate reservoir (Riviere-des-Prairies) and two boreal reservoirs (Eastmain-1 and Robert-Bourassa) in Quebec, and in four boreal reservoirs (Grand Rapids, Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur Falls) in Manitoba, Canada. Mean daily CO(2) fluxes ranged between 7 and 14 mmolCO(2)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Manitoba and between 15 and 55 mmolCO(2)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Quebec. Summertime episodes of water undersaturation in CO(2) were observed at Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur, suggesting higher productivities of these systems compared to the other systems studied. Mean daily CH(4) fluxes ranged between 0 and 69 micromolCH(4)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Manitoba and between 9 and 48 micromolCH(4)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Quebec. Comparisons of results obtained in the Eastmain-1 area using automated monitors, floating chambers or dissolved gas analyses over multiple-station field campaigns demonstrated that a continuous GHG monitor at a single sampling station provided representative and robust results.

Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: cross-sectional imaging and pathologic correlation. This study aimed to evaluate the cross-sectional imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPTP) with pathologic correlation. Imaging features of 29 cases with SPTP proven by histopathologic examinations, including 26 women and 3 men with a mean age of 27 years, were retrospectively investigated and correlated to their pathologic findings. According to the largest diameter, all cases were divided into 23 large tumors (>3.0 cm) and 6 small ones (< or =3.0 cm). Large tumors commonly displayed the typical imaging features: a large well-encapsulated mass with varying solid-cystic and hemorrhagic areas and early peripheral heterogeneous enhancement with progressive fill-in on dynamic contrast-enhanced examination, which agreed with their pathologic findings: a large fibrous pseudocapsule-surrounded mass with variegated and variable combinations of solid, hemorrhagic, or cystic-necrotic areas in cut surface. The computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging features of small tumors were atypical: a small rarely encapsulated mass without observed hemorrhagic areas and cystic changes with gradual enhancement less than normal pancreatic parenchyma on dynamic contrast-enhanced images. Imaging appearances were different between large and small SPTPs. Compared with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging was more powerful to identify the capsule, solid-cystic portions, and hemorrhagic areas of SPTP and to avoid misdiagnosis.

Functional cloning and predictive structural modeling of a novel esterase from Bacillus subtilis strain, RRL 1789. We have recently reported the purification and characterization of a novel esterase from the Bacillus subtilis strain. In the present study we report the genomic DNA cloning and predictive structural modeling of this novel esterase. Tributyrin- and Rhodamine B-based functional screen of a Bacillus subtilis genomic library led to the identification of a potential lipolytic gene. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned gene showed that it encodes a protein of 489 amino acid residues. Sequence homology search and multiple sequence alignment showed that the protein was highly homologous to known esterases. Secondary structure-driven multiple sequence alignment with the homologous esterase of known three-dimensional structures was performed and a 3D structure model of this enzyme was constructed. Based on the topological organization of the secondary structures, this protein belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. Moreover, the presence of serine in the context of amino acid sequence G/A-X-S-X-G (with X an arbitrary amino acid residue) in the protein indicates that it belong to the class of serine hydrolases of this superfamily.

Risk factors related to omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are recognized as congenital malformations with a high mortality. Only 60% of children with such malformations survive until the end of the first year of age. It has been suggested that omphalocele and gastroschisis are associated with other congenital malformations, concerning the bones, the heart and the kidney. The aim of the present study is to determine the risk factors in 12 omphalocele and four gastroschisis cases diagnosed and surveyed in the last four years (November 2003-November 2007) at the Emergency County Hospital of Constanta. In 10 of the 16 cases of the studied group, the subjects resulted from spontaneous premature births. None of the cases in the studied group received the maximum APGAR score, values varying between 6 and 9. The average birth weight in the studied group is 2100 g, with values between 950 g and 2900 g. Maternal age is between 15-21-year-old. Average maternal age in cases of second-degree gastroschisis is 6.5 years younger than the witness population and in case of first degree is 5.8 years younger. 87.5% of children's mothers in studied group are first time pregnant, first time gestant. The mother's socio-economic status may be a risk factor on the occurrence of omphalocele and gastroschisis. 81.25% of children's mother in the studied group have no own income and half are single (mono-parental families). None of the studied cases had a history of congenitally malformed siblings, but half of the cases in the studied group associate congenital malformations of gastro-intestinal tract, locomotor system, kidneys and/or heart. The abdominal wall defect existing in gastroschisis is accompanied by the delay of the intestinal loops differentiation. In all cases of gastroschisis in the studied group, the thin intestine caliber is higher or equal to the one of the thick intestine, the intestinal loops remained outside the abdominal cavity have an aspect characteristic to the fifth month of fetal life.

Effect of exercise on gene expression profile in unfractionated peripheral blood leukocytes. A 4-h bout of exercise induces immunomodulatory effects. Peripheral blood was withdrawn before, and at 4, 8 and 24h after the start of exercise. RNA from the unfractionated white blood cells was analyzed using Agilent human 44K microarray. The expression profiles were sorted into seven clusters based on their unique time-dependent kinetics. In a separate experiment, cell-specific markers were collected and compared among the members in each cluster. Two clusters were assigned as representing neutrophils, one as NK cells, and another mostly as T cells. Three clusters seemed to be mixtures of several cell types. Extension of this approach to other systems is discussed.

JANE: efficient mapping of prokaryotic ESTs and variable length sequence reads on related template genomes. ESTs or variable sequence reads can be available in prokaryotic studies well before a complete genome is known. Use cases include (i) transcriptome studies or (ii) single cell sequencing of bacteria. Without suitable software their further analysis and mapping would have to await finalization of the corresponding genome. The tool JANE rapidly maps ESTs or variable sequence reads in prokaryotic sequencing and transcriptome efforts to related template genomes. It provides an easy-to-use graphics interface for information retrieval and a toolkit for EST or nucleotide sequence function prediction. Furthermore, we developed for rapid mapping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided from the BLAST algorithm. Rapid assembly on and replacement of the template genome by sequence reads or mapped ESTs is achieved. This is illustrated (i) by data from Staphylococci as well as from a Blattabacteria sequencing effort, (ii) mapping single cell sequencing reads is shown for poribacteria to sister phylum representative Rhodopirellula Baltica SH1. The algorithm has been implemented in a web-server accessible at http://jane.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. Rapid prokaryotic EST mapping or mapping of sequence reads is achieved applying JANE even without knowing the cognate genome sequence.

Effects of p-Aminosalicylic acid on the neurotoxicity of manganese on the dopaminergic innervation of the cilia of the lateral cells of the gill of the bivalve mollusc, Crassostrea virginica. The lateral cilia of the gill of Crassostrea virginica are controlled by a dopaminergic-serotonergic innervation. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter causing cilio-inhibition. High levels of manganese are neurotoxic to people, causing Manganism, a Parkinson-like disease. Clinical interventions for Manganism have not been very successful. Recently, p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was reported as an effective treatment of severe Manganism in humans; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Previously, we reported that manganese treatments caused disruption of the dopaminergic innervation of gill of C. virginica. Here we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of PAS, EDTA or Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and examined whether co-treating animals with PAS could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. Beating rates of the lateral cilia of the gill were measured by stroboscopic microscopy. Pre-treating gill preparations with PAS or EDTA blocked the neurotoxic effects of manganese, while ASA did not. In other experiments, animals exposed to three day treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of the dopaminergic, cilio-inhibitory system, which was decreased by co-treatment with PAS. The study shows that PAS protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of action of PAS in alleviating Manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities than its anti-inflammatory actions.

Radiofrequency endothelial ablation prevents recanalization after endovascular coil occlusion: in vitro and in vivo assessment. Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms may be followed by recurrences. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the endothelium may prevent recanalization after coil embolization. The authors performed in vitro experiments in chicken meat and egg white models to investigate the thermal distribution and geometry of lesions created with RF applied through standard coils alone or by using a prototype RF electrode inserted in a coil or a mass of coils. A mathematic model was designed to predict perianeurysmal isotherm lesions by using the bio-heat equation. In an in vivo coil arterial occlusion model (six dogs), the authors compared angiographic and pathologic results of coil embolization (n = 8) with those of coil embolization preceded by RF ablation (n = 7) by using a cardiac electrode at 1 month. Current coils offer high impedance (400 Omega) at high current frequencies and are damaged by RF transmission. A dedicated electrode generated reproducible lesions, but contact with coils interferes with lesion reproducibility. When the coil mass was used, a uniform RF lesion that conformed to the coil mass shape was produced. The mathematic model predicted a uniform heat distribution within 1 mm from the coil mass periphery. Arterial coil embolization led to occlusion followed by recanalization (n = 8), whereas RF ablation (20-30 W for 60 seconds) prevented recanalization in all coil-occluded arteries (P < .001, chi(2) test). Pathologic findings helped confirm complete arterial occlusion with RF ablation. One animal developed brachial plexus injury with excessive levels of RF ablation. RF ablation can prevent recanalization after coil occlusion-at least in the arterial model. Modifications of coils, dedicated neurovascular electrodes, and technique optimization remain necessary before considering a clinical application.

Resistance gene patterns of tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli of human and porcine origin. Resistance transfer from animals to humans (and vice versa) is a frequently discussed topic in human and veterinary medicine, albeit relevant studies focus mainly on phenotypic antibiotic resistance. In order to get a comparative insight regarding the distribution of selected resistance genes [tet(A/B/C/D/M/K/L/O/S/W/Z), sulI, II, III, str(A/B), aad(A)] in Escherichia coli of different origins, phenotypically tetracycline resistant isolates of porcine and human origin (n=137 and 152) were investigated using PCR. The most common gene was tet(A) in porcine, but tet(B) in human isolates (>55%). Tet(C/M/D) were rare (1-7%); tet(K/L/O/S/W/Z) were not detected. Co-occurrence of tet(A) and tet(B) was more frequent in human strains (11% vs. 2%). 88% of the porcine isolates had one, and 9% had two tet-genes. By contrast, only 69% of the human strains had one tet-gene, whereas 17% were carriers of two tet-determinants. The most common sulfonamide resistance gene was represented by sulII (40% in porcine, 62% in human isolates), followed by sulI. SulIII was present in eight isolates. Streptomycin resistance was mostly mediated by str(A)/str(B) in porcine, and by str(A)/str(B)/aad(A) in human strains (35% each). In one E. coli of human origin, 7 resistance genes were simultaneously detected. Co-occurrence of 5 or 6 resistance genes was more present in human strains, whereas porcine isolates carried more often only 1-4 genes. The huge diversities between gene patterns of bacteria of human and porcine origin indicate that genetic transfers between microorganisms from different sources are less frequent than transfers within populations of the same source.

Multilevel regression analyses to investigate the relationship between two variables over time: examining the longitudinal association between intrusion and avoidance.

A highly sensitive nonenzymatic glucose sensor based on CuO nanoparticles-modified carbon nanotube electrode. In this report, a novel type of cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) array electrode for sensitive nonenzymatic glucose detection has been fabricated. The morphology of the nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical performance of the CuO/MWCNTs electrode for detection of glucose was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode showed much higher electrocatalytic activity and lower overvoltage than the bare MWCNTs electrode towards oxidation of glucose. At an applied potential of +0.40 V, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode presented a high sensitivity of 2596 microA mM(-1) cm(-2) to glucose. In addition, linear range was obtained over a concentration up to 1.2 mM with a detection limit of 0.2 microM (signal/noise=3). The response time is about 1s with addition of 0.10 mM glucose. More importantly, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode is also highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion, and the interference from the oxidation of common interfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and carbohydrate compounds is effectively avoided. In addition, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode was also used to analyze glucose concentration in human serum samples. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic property, low working potential, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability, and fast amperometric sensing towards oxidation of glucose, thus is promising for the future development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.

Sequence-dependent DNA helical rise and nucleosome stability. Nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin and play a key role in regulation of gene expression. After resolution of the nucleosome structure, the bipartite nature of this particle has revealed itself and has disclosed the presence, on the histone surface, of a symmetric distribution of positive charges, able to interact with their negative DNA phosphate counterpart. We analyzed helical steps in known nucleosomal DNA sequences, observing a significant relationship between their symmetric distribution and nucleosome stability. Synthetic DNA sequences able to form stable nucleosomes were used to compare distances on the left and on the right side of the nucleosomal dyad axis, where DNA phosphates and charged residues of the (H3H4)2-tetramer interact. We observed a linear relationship between coincidence of distances and nucleosome stability, i. e., the more symmetric these distances the more stable the nucleosome. Curves related to this symmetric distribution along the DNA sequence identify preferential sites for positioning of the dyad axis, which we termed palinstases. The comparison of our data with known nucleosome positions in archaeal and eukaryotic sequences shows many coincidences of location. Sequences that impair nucleosome formation and DNase I hypersensitive sites yield curves with a lower degree of symmetry. Analysis performed on DNA tracts of promoters close to the transcription start and termination sites identified peculiar patterns: in particular low affinity for nucleosome binding at the transcription start site and a high affinity exactly at the transcription termination site, suggesting a major role of nucleosomes in the termination of transcription.


Palliative family caregivers' accounts of health care experiences: the importance of "security".

Pain perception during esophageal warming due to radiofrequency catheter ablation in the left atrium. We investigated the relationship among esophageal warming, pain perception, and the site of radiofrequency (RF) delivery in the left atrium (LA) during the course of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Such a procedure in awake patients is often linked to the development of visceral pain and esophageal warming. As a consequence, potentially dangerous complications have been described. Twenty patients undergoing RF ablation in the LA were studied. An esophageal probe (EP) capable of measuring endoesophageal temperature (ET) was positioned before starting the procedure. The relative position of the EP and the tip of the ablator were evaluated through fluoroscopy imaging before starting each RF delivery, during which the highest value of the temperature was collected. After RF withdrawal, the patients were asked to define the intensity of the experienced pain by using a score index ranging from 0 (no pain) to 4 (pain requiring immediate RF interruption). The mean ET value during ablation was 39.59 +/- 4.71 degrees C. The EP proximity to the ablator's tip showed a high correlation with the development of the highest ET values (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.49, confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.41). Moreover, the highest values of pain intensity were reported when the RF was delivered to the atrial zones close to the EP projection (r = 0.50, CI 0.55-0.42) and when the highest ET levels were reached (r = 0.38, CI 0.30-0.45). Pain perception in LA ablation is significantly related to esophageal warming and is higher when the RF is delivered near the esophagus. It seems advisable to perform ET monitoring in sedated patients to avoid short- and long-term jeopardizing of the esophageal wall.

Renoprotective effects of paricalcitol on gentamicin-induced kidney injury in rats. Vitamin D is thought to exert a protective effect on renal disease progression, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We investigated whether paricalcitol ameliorates tubular dysfunction and fibrosis in gentamicin (GM)-induced renal injury. Two groups of rats were treated with GM (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), one of which was cotreated with paricalcitol (0.3 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 14 days and the other was not. The control group was treated with vehicle only. HK-2 cells were cultured with GM in the absence or presence of paricalcitol. Paricalcitol restored impaired renal function and the downregulated renal sodium transporters and aquaporin-1 expression caused by GM. ED-1-expressing monocyte/macrophage accumulation induced by GM was attenuated by paricalcitol treatment. Paricalcitol prevented upregulated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, INF-gamma) and adhesion molecules (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) induced by GM. In addition, paricalcitol effectively reversed TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and extracellular matrix accumulation in GM-induced nephropathy. Increased collagen deposition and fibrosis in GM-treated kidney were ameliorated by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol also attenuated the upregulated NF-kappaB and phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression in HK-2 cells cultured with GM. In conclusion, paricalcitol prevents GM-induced renal injury by inhibiting renal inflammation and fibrosis, the mechanism of which is the interruption of NF-kappaB/ERK signaling pathway and preservation of tubular epithelial integrity via inhibiting EMT process.

Human sperm anatomy: ultrastructural localization of the cannabinoid1 receptor and a potential role of anandamide in sperm survival and acrosome reaction. Recently, the endocannabinoid (EC) system and the presence of CB1 receptor (CB1-R), have been identified in human sperm. However, the effects of EC receptor ligands such as anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and the role of EC system in male fertility is still largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the ultrastructural compartmentalization of CB1-R and analyzed the effects of its stimulation by using a stable analog of anandamide, 2-methylarachidonyl-2'-fluoro-ethylamide (MET-F-AEA). We focused particularly on sperm survival and acrosin activity. The study of human sperm anatomy by transmission electron microscopy with immunogold analysis revealed the location of the CB1-R prevalently in the sperm membranes of the head and interestingly on the mitochondria. The effect of different concentrations of MET-F-AEA from 100 nM to 1 microM evidenced a significant decrease of sperm survival. Interestingly, we analyzed this negative effect at molecular level, testing the EC action on different known sperm survival targets. MET-F-AEA-treatment decreased both pBCL2 and pAkt, two prosurvival proteins, and increased pPTEN expression which is the main regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, a biphasic effect was observed with increasing MET-F-AEA concentrations on the acrosin activity. The blockage of the CB1-R by using its selective antagonist SR141716 (rimonabant) induced an opposite action on sperm survival supporting a role for this receptor in the biology of the male gamete.

Differential correlates to self-report and parent-report of callous-unemotional traits in a sample of juvenile sexual offenders. The association of callous-unemotional (CU) traits with violence and severe antisocial behavior has led to a recent focus on the association between CU traits and sexual offending behavior. When assessing juveniles with sexual offenses, practice standards recommend that multiple sources of data are considered. However, the differential correlates of parent-report versus self-report of CU traits in juvenile sex offenders have not been investigated. A sample of 94 detained male youth (mean age = 15.22, SD = 1.48) was administered both youth and parent versions of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), a general delinquency risk assessment tool (YLS), and a sexual offending risk assessment tool (J-SOAP-II) to investigate concordance between self-report and parent-report of CU traits as well as association with general and sex-specific risk factors. Both parent-report and self-report of CU traits were significantly related to higher general delinquency risk scores, with parent-report showing stronger correlations than self-report. Both parent-report and self-report were related to sex-specific risk factors. However, only parent-report significantly predicted static sexual risk, while self-report significantly predicted dynamic sexual risk scores. Evidence supports the importance of including both parent- and self-report of CU traits in the comprehensive assessment of sexually offending youth.

Intracellular IFNgamma production in CD3 negative cells exposed to allo-antigens is an indicator of prior sensitization. Sensitization to HLA antigens (Ags) is a significant obstacle to kidney transplantation and risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Current screening methods to assess HLA Ag exposure include various antibody assays. However, tools to accurately measure cell-mediated immunity to allo-Ags in a clinical setting are lacking. Here we report on an intracellular cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assay that detects intracellular gamma-interferon (IFNgamma) production in non-T cell populations (CD3-) that appears to assess sensitization from previous allo-Ag exposure. Blood from 106 highly-HLA sensitized (HS) patients (pre-, post-IVIG-treatment [Rx] and/or post-transplant) and 14 3(rd) party normal controls (3(rd)N) were incubated with donor or 3(rd)N peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and IFNgamma+/CD3- cells were enumerated. The percentage of IFNgamma+ cells in CD3- cells without stimulation in pre-IVIG-Rx HS patients was similar to normals, but significantly increased with incubation with donor and/or 3(rd)N PBMCs. Reactivity in normals was minimal. Reactivity was higher in HS females than HS males. Normal females with previous pregnancy (PG) showed significantly higher response than females without PG or non-sensitized normal males. Donor-specific reactivity in the CFC assay better correlated with donor-specific B cell crossmatch than total anti-HLA antibody levels or PRA. HS patients who developed AMR post-transplant showed significantly higher reactivity than those without AMR. The CFC assay measures IFNgamma production in CD3- cells that may indicate a memory response to allo-Ags. This response is limited to HS patients and normal females with previous PG. Patients undergoing AMR show significantly higher reactivity. This assay may represent a novel approach to measurement of allo-sensitization with clinical utility in predicting those at risk for AMR.

Introduction to atomic force microscopy (AFM) in biology. The atomic force microscope (AFM) has the unique capability of imaging biological samples with molecular resolution in buffer solution. In addition to providing topographical images of surfaces with nanometer- to angstrom-scale resolution, forces between single molecules and mechanical properties of biological samples can be investigated from the nanoscale to the microscale. Importantly, the measurements are made in buffer solutions, allowing biological samples to "stay alive" within a physiological-like environment while temporal changes in structure are measured-e.g., before and after addition of chemical reagents. These qualities distinguish AFM from conventional imaging techniques of comparable resolution, e.g., electron microscopy (EM). This unit provides an introduction to AFM on biological systems and describes specific examples of AFM on proteins, cells, and tissues. The physical principles of the technique and methodological aspects of its practical use and applications are also described.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of three terpenes (citral, linalool and beta-pinene), in combination with a mild heat treatment (55 degrees C, 15 min). The study has been carried out on an orange based soft drink inoculated using a wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results, expressed as growth/no-growth data, were analyzed with the logistic regression. A model comprising only of significant individual parameters (p < or = 0.05) and describing the relationships between terpene concentrations and the probability of having stable beverages was obtained. When citral and beta-pinene were combined, the citral concentration required to achieve a 50% probability of having stable bottles (P=0.5) dropped from 100.9 microL/L in the absence of beta-pinene to 49.3 microL/L in the presence of 20 microL/L of beta-pinene. The mixture of citral and linalool was less effective, in fact, the same probability (P=0.5) was obtained combining 60 microL/L of linalool with 35.1 microL/L of citral. The addition of 20 microL/L of linalool and beta-pinene reinforced citral bioactivity and the concentration of citral needed to reach P=0.5 fell from 100.9 microL/L in the presence of citral alone to 42.0 microL/L. The presence of both linalool and beta-pinene at a concentration of 40 or 60 microL/L in the absence of citral led to a lower spoilage probability (P=0.58 and P=0.93, respectively). It can be concluded that the antimicrobial potential of the three terpenes alone can be strengthened combining appropriate concentrations of each of them. This study confirmed also the potentiating effect of a mild temperature treatment on the antimicrobial efficacy of the molecules. Neither the thermal treatment alone nor the presence of the terpenes at their maximum concentrations (without thermal treatment) were able to guarantee the microbial stability of the beverages.

Effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting partial and complete distal biceps tendon rupture. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the elbow is often obtained to confirm the clinical suspicion of a distal biceps tendon rupture. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of MRI in diagnosing partial and complete distal biceps tendon ruptures as determined at the time of surgery. We identified 22 partial and 24 complete distal biceps tendon ruptures operated on by a single surgeon. The preoperative MRIs of these patients were obtained, along with MRIs of the elbow in 10 asymptomatic individuals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists read each MRI without knowledge of the diagnosis or the surgical findings. Their interpretations were compared with the intraoperative findings and the results were statistically analyzed. The overall sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 92.4% and 100%, respectively, in detecting distal biceps tendon ruptures. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for complete tears were 100% and 82.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for partial tears were 59.1% and 100%, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging is an effective tool for diagnosing distal biceps tendon ruptures. Although MRI is extremely sensitive in diagnosing complete tears, it is substantially less sensitive in diagnosing partial tears. Diagnostic II.

Identifying and quantifying orphan protein sequences in fungi. For large regions of many proteins, and even entire proteins, no homology to known domains or proteins can be detected. These sequences are often referred to as orphans. Surprisingly, it has been reported that the large number of orphans is sustained in spite of a rapid increase of available genomic sequences. However, it is believed that de novo creation of coding sequences is rare in comparison to mechanisms such as domain shuffling and gene duplication; hence, most sequences should have homologs in other genomes. To investigate this, the sequences of 19 complete fungi genomes were compared. By using the phylogenetic relationship between these genomes, we could identify potentially de novo created orphans in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that only a small fraction, <2%, of the S. cerevisiae proteome is orphan, which confirms that de novo creation of coding sequences is indeed rare. Furthermore, we found it necessary to compare the most closely related species to distinguish between de novo created sequences and rapidly evolving sequences where homologs are present but cannot be detected. Next, the orphan proteins (OPs) and orphan domains (ODs) were characterized. First, it was observed that both OPs and ODs are short. In addition, at least some of the OPs have been shown to be functional in experimental assays, showing that they are not pseudogenes. Furthermore, in contrast to what has been reported before and what is seen for older orphans, S. cerevisiae specific ODs and proteins are not more disordered than other proteins. This might indicate that many of the older, and earlier classified, orphans indeed are fast-evolving sequences. Finally, >90% of the detected ODs are located at the protein termini, which suggests that these orphans could have been created by mutations that have affected the start or stop codons.

[Influenza vaccination in pregnant women. Coverage, practices and knowledge among obstetricians]. Women who are pregnant during influenza season have an increased risk of infection and severe clinical disease. Several national and international organizations currently recommend vaccination for pregnant women. We intended to estimate the influenza vaccination rate in a population of postpartum women attended in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Moreover, we assessed the knowledge and practice of obstetricians about influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Two cross-sectional surveys were performed. Postpartum women who delivered from December 2007 to February 2008 were included. The sample of obstetricians was constituted by those who were working in hospital or primary care reference areas. Influenza vaccination rate was 4.1%. Healthy women represented 80.5% of our population. The vaccination rate in the group with comorbidities was 3.3%. The providers who recommended the vaccine more frequently were the midwife in 28.9% and the nurse in 18.4%. Among the obstetricians, 20.9% responded that the influenza vaccine was recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy and 65.1% said that it was recommended in the second or third trimester. In relation to practice, only 7% offered the vaccine in the first trimester and 20,9% in the second or third trimester. The influenza vaccination rate in pregnant women in our study is very low. Obstetricians showed a low level of knowledge about the current influenza vaccination recommendations, mainly in the case of first trimester of pregnancy and only few offered the vaccine in their practice.

Temporal proteomic analysis reveals continuous impairment of intestinal development in neonatal piglets with intrauterine growth restriction. Efficiency of nutrient utilization is reduced in neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared with those with a normal birth weight (NBW). However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we applied temporal proteomic approach, coupled with histological and biochemical analyses, to study dynamic changes of the proteome in the small intestinal mucosa of IUGR piglets during the nursing period (Days 1, 7 and 21). We identified 56 differentially expressed protein spots between IUGR and NBW piglets. These proteins participate in key biological processes, including (1) absorption, digestion and transport of nutrients; (2) cell structure and motility; (3) glucose and energy metabolism; (4) lipid metabolism; (5) amino acid metabolism; (6) mineral and vitamin metabolism; (7) cellular redox homeostasis; (8) stress response; and (9) apoptosis. The results of our temporal proteomics analysis reveal continuous impairment of intestinal development in neonatal piglets with IUGR. The findings have important implications for understanding metabolic defects in the small intestine of IUGR neonates and are expected to provide new strategies to improve their survival and growth.

Exertional desaturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oxygen prescription guidelines utilize a threshold arterial oxygen tension <or=55 mmHg or an oxygen saturation <or=88%, a range of oxygen levels and relative declines have been used in investigations of exertional desaturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is no uniform definition of exertional hypoxemia or standardized exercise protocol to elicit decreases in oxygen levels in individuals with COPD. The causes for exertional desaturation in patients with COPD are multifactorial with ventilation-perfusion mismatching, diffusion-type limitation, shunting and reduced oxygen content of mixed venous blood all contributing to some degree. Neither resting oxygen saturation nor pulmonary function studies can reliably predict which patients with COPD will develop exertional desaturation. However, preserved pulmonary function, especially diffusing capacity, reliably predicts which patients with COPD will sustain oxygenation during exercise. Although exertional desaturation in patients with COPD appears to portend a poor prognosis, there is no evidence that maintenance of normoxemia during exercise improves the survival of these patients. Studies of the effect of supplemental oxygen on exercise performance in individuals with COPD who desaturate with exertion have yielded conflicting results. The use of short-term or "burst" oxygen either prior to or after exertion may not have significant clinical benefit. Differences in the definition of desaturation, mode of exercise, and characteristics of the patient population make it difficult to compare studies of exertional desaturation and its treatment and to determine their applicability to clinical practice.

Echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of elite Hungarian female water polo players. In the authors' earlier study the relative aerobic power of Hungarian top-level male water polo players was found to be smaller than that of other top-level athletes, while their echocardiographic parameters proved to be the most characteristic of the athlete's heart. In the present investigation echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of female top-level water polo players were compared to those of other female elite athletes and of healthy, non-athletic subjects. Relative aerobic power in the water polo players was lower than in endurance athletes. Mean resting heart rates were the slowest in the water polo players and endurance athletes. Morphologic indicators of the heart (body size related left ventricular wall thickness and muscle mass) were the highest in the water polo players, endurance and power athletes. In respect of diastolic functions (diastolic early and late peak transmitral flow velocities) no difference was seen between the respective groups.These results indicate that, similarly to the males, top-level water polo training is associated with the dimensional parameters of the heart rather than with relative aerobic power. For checking the physical condition of female water polo players spiroergometric tests seem to be less appropriate than swim-tests with heart rate recovery studies such as the ones used in the males.

Hypothalamic orexin stimulates feeding-associated glucose utilization in skeletal muscle via sympathetic nervous system. Hypothalamic neurons containing orexin (hypocretin) are activated during motivated behaviors and active waking. We show that injection of orexin-A into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of mice or rats increased glucose uptake and promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, but not in white adipose tissue, by activating the sympathetic nervous system. These effects of orexin were blunted in mice lacking beta-adrenergic receptors but were restored by forced expression of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in both myocytes and nonmyocyte cells of skeletal muscle. Orexin neurons are activated by conditioned sweet tasting and directly excite VMH neurons, thereby increasing muscle glucose metabolism and its insulin sensitivity. Orexin and its receptor in VMH thus play a key role in the regulation of muscle glucose metabolism associated with highly motivated behavior by activating muscle sympathetic nerves and beta(2)-adrenergic signaling.

The effect of traumatic bereavement on tsunami-exposed survivors. Fourteen months after the 2004 tsunami, mental health outcome was assessed in 187 bereaved relatives, 308 bereaved friends, and in 3,020 nonbereaved Swedish survivors. Of the bereaved relatives, 41% reported posttraumatic stress reactions and 62% reported impaired general mental health. Having been caught or chased by the tsunami in combination with bereavement was associated with increased posttraumatic stress reactions. Complicated grief reactions among relatives were almost as frequent as posttraumatic stress reactions. The highest levels of psychological distress were found among those who had lost children. Traumatic bereavement, in combination with exposure to life danger, is probably a risk factor for mental health sequelae after a natural disaster.

Impact of comorbidities on clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer patients who are elderly and/or have poor performance status. We evaluated the effect of comorbidities on clinical outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have poor performance status (PS 2/3) and/or are elderly (≥70 years old). SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION: The impact of age (<70 versus >70), PS, and comorbidity score - Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) on treatment response, toxicities, QOL and overall survival (OS) was analyzed using data from a completed phase II trial that randomly assigned patients with advanced NSCLC who had PS 2/3 and/or were aged ≥70 to receive gemcitabine (GEM), vinorelbine (VIN) or docetaxel (DOC). Data from records of 134 patients accrued during the trial were available for analysis. Eighty-eight patients (66%) were aged ≥70 years. 59 patients (67%) had PS of ECOG 0-2 and 29 patients (33%) had ECOG 3. In those aged ≥70, 53 (60%) had at least one comorbidity rated CIRS-G category 3/4 while those aged <70, 12 (26%) had at least one CIRS-G 3/4 comorbidity. Age, PS, and comorbidity scores had no significant association with PFS and QOL scores changes, although PS had marginal influence on OS (0.05<p<0.10). There was significantly greater hematological toxicities and fatigue in patients who had comorbidities of a severe nature. The presence of comorbidity rated CIRS-G category 4 was significantly associated with lower dose intensity of drugs received with no overall impact on response nor survival. In the multivariate analysis, only older patients retained significance with favorable hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 for overall survival. Presence of comorbidities alone should not deter the oncologist from treating elderly cancer patients with cytotoxics. Patients with severe comorbidities may experience more toxicity and receive less cycles of chemotherapy and early medical intervention to control these comorbidities may mitigate risk of treatment using cytotoxics.

Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of Stephanitis pyrioides (Heteroptera, Tingidae): a novel role for the pseudospermathecae. At mating, female insects generally receive and store sperm in specific organs of their reproductive tract called spermathecae. Some Heteroptera, such as Cimicomorpha, lack a true spermatheca; some have receptacles of novel formation where sperm cells can transit or be stored. In Tingidae, there are two sac-like diverticula, the "pseudospermathecae," each at the base of a lateral oviduct, which previously were considered to function as spermathecae. However, this role has never been documented, either by ultrastructural studies or by observations of sperm transit in the female reproductive tract. In this article, we investigate the morphology and the ultrastructure of the female reproductive apparatus in the economically important tingid species Stephanitis pyrioides, focusing our attention on the functional role of the pseudospermathecae in an evolutionary perspective. Each ovary consists of seven telotrophic meroistic ovarioles, the long pedicels of which enlarge into a bulb-like structure near the terminal oocyte. The ovarioles flow into two long lateral oviducts, which join to form a very short common oviduct. Basally, each lateral oviduct is connected through a short duct to one of two pseudospermathecae. The ultrastructure of the ectodermal epithelium of the pseudospermathecae is dramatically different in sexually immature or mated females. In virgin females, cells delimit a very irregular lumen, filled with a moderately electron-dense granular material. The large nucleus adapts to their irregular shape, which can have long projections in some regions and be flattened in others. After mating, epithelial cells generally elongate and display an apical layer of microvilli extending beneath the cuticle, often containing mitochondria. In the lumen of the pseudospermathecae there is a dense brownish secretion. No sperm cells were ever found inside this organ. After mating, sperm move upward along the lateral oviducts and the ovarioles, accumulating in the bulb-like structure of the pedicels, and proceeding into the distal region between the follicle cells surrounding the oocyte and the ovariole wall. The egg, most likely fertilized in the bulb-like region of the ovariole, moves through the lateral oviduct, entirely enters the pseudospermatheca and is smeared with its secretion just before oviposition. We exclude a function of sperm storage for the pseudospermathecae, and instead suggest a novel role for these organs as reproductive accessory glands.

Common pathogenic features of atherosclerosis and calcific aortic stenosis: role of transforming growth factor-beta.

Dietary trans-fat combined with monosodium glutamate induces dyslipidemia and impairs spatial memory. Recent evidence suggests that intake of excessive dietary fat, particularly saturated fat and trans-hydrogenated oils (trans-fatty acids: TFA) can impair learning and memory. Central obesity, which can be induced by neonatal injections of monosodium Glutamate (MSG), also impairs learning and memory. To further clarify the effects of dietary fat and MSG, we treated C57BL/6J mice with either a TFA-enriched diet, dietary MSG, or a combination of both and examined serum lipid profile and spatial memory compared to mice fed standard chow. Spatial learning was assessed at 6, 16 and 32 weeks of age in a Morris Water Maze (MWM). The subjects were given four days of training to find a hidden platform and a fifth day of reversal learning, in which the platform was moved to a new location. The TFA+MSG combination caused a central adiposity that was accompanied by impairment in locating the hidden platform in the MWM. Females in the TFA+MSG group showed a greater impairment compared to the other diet groups, and also showed elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C and T-CHOL:HDL-C ratio, together with the lowest levels of HDL-C. Similarly, males in the TFA+MSG diet group were less successful than control mice at locating the hidden platform and had the highest level of abdominal adiposity and elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C. Dietary trans-fat combined with MSG increased central adiposity, promoted dyslipidemia and impaired spatial learning.

Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nerves and is characterized predominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abducens nerves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of function in the muscles they supply. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficulties, oral incompetence, problems with eating and drinking, including pocketing of food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe drooling. In this study, we report on pediatric patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 to September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction for restoration of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the motor nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and the gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived transfer, and no flap was lost. We observed a significant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a high degree of patient satisfaction. The gracilis muscle free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes.

Early induction of hypothermia during cardiac arrest improves neurological outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who undergo emergency cardiopulmonary bypass and percutaneous coronary intervention. Therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has demonstrated neurological benefits. Although early cooling during cardiac arrest enhances efficacy in animal studies, few clinical studies are available. The 171 patients who failed to respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation were studied prospectively. Patients underwent emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) plus intra-aortic balloon pumping, with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if needed. Mild hypothermia (34 degrees C for 3 days) was induced during cardiac arrest or after return of spontaneous circulation. Of the 171 patients, 21 (12.3%) had a favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge. An unadjusted rate of favorable outcome decreased in a stepwise fashion for increasing quartiles of collapse-to-34 degrees C interval (P=0.016). An adjusted odds ratio for favorable outcome after collapse-to-CPB interval was 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.97) and after CPB-to-34 degrees C interval, 0.99 (95%CI 0.98-0.99) when collapse-to-34 degrees C interval was divided into 2 components. Favorable neurological accuracy of a collapse-to-CPB interval at a cutoff of 55.5 min and CPB-to-34 degrees C interval at a cutoff of 21.5 min was 85.4% and 89.5%, respectively. Early attainment of a core temperature had neurological benefits for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent CPB and PCI. (Circ J 2010; 74: 77 - 85).

Genome wide profiling of altered gene expression in the neocortex of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a complex neurodegenerative process affecting multiple genes and proteins in the neocortex, many of which have not been well-studied. In this study, we investigated genome-wide gene alterations in the temporal cortex of a well-characterized cohort of AD patients using a recently developed microarray platform, and compared some of the transcript changes with immunoblotting. Of the 5485 genes found to be significantly altered in AD, there were consistent patterns of changes which show that the AD transcriptome in neocortex is characterized by changes indicative of synaptic dysfunction, perturbed neurotransmission and activation of neuroinflammation. We also highlighted several genes of potential pathogenic significance which have not been well studied in AD. The current study aims to add to the growing body of knowledge relating to gene changes in AD and provide further insights into pathogenic mechanisms and potential targets of pharmacotherapy.

Risk factors for the initial symptomatic giardia infection in a cohort of young Arab-Bedouin children. Giardiasis is a common protozoan infection with clinical manifestations in children ranging from asymptomatic carriage to persistent diarrhoea with malabsorption. It can lead to growth and developmental retardation. The study evaluated risk factors for the initial symptomatic giardiasis (SG) episode among Arab-Bedouin children in Israel. A community-based, prospective cohort study was conducted in Rahat, a Bedouin township in southern Israel. Infants (n=238) were followed by weekly visits from birth to age 18 months. Giardia infection was identified by antigen detection in faecal specimens. Approximately 26% of children experienced one or more SG episode. Mean (SD) age for first SG episode was 12.3 (3.3) months, with 95% of episodes occurring in children >6 months of age. Risk for the first SG in children >6 months of age was associated with it being spring or summer [odds ratio (OR) 6.16, p<0.001], exposure to livestock (OR 4.89, p=0.002) and prior infection with entero-aggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) (OR 1.12 for each additional percentage in stool prevalence, p=0.02). Weight-for-age Z-scores at age 6 months were inversely related to SG risk (OR 0.62 for each unit increase in Z-score, p=0.029). Giardiasis is an important cause of diarrhoea in Bedouin children. Increased risk of SG in spring/summer might be linked to environmental conditions or seasonal dietary practices which increase virulence or transmission. SG in those exposed to livestock suggests that there are zoonotic risk factors or that hygiene is a causal factor. The association between EAEC infection and SG warrants further investigation.

Differences in gene expression of human xylosyltransferases and determination of acceptor specificities for various proteoglycans. The xylosyltransferase (XT) isoforms XT-I and XT-II initiate the posttranslational glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. Here, we determined the relative expression of both isoforms in 33 human cell lines. The majority of tested cell lines showed dominant XYLT2 gene expression, while only in 23132/87, JAR, NCI-H510A and THP-1 was the XT-I mRNA expression higher. Nearly equal expression levels were detected in six cell lines. Additionally, to shed light on putative differences in acceptor specificities the acceptor properties of potential acceptor sequences were determined. Peptides were expressed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing putative or known GAG attachment sites of in vivo proteoglycans. Kinetic analysis showed that K(m) and V(max) values for XT-I mediated xylosylation were slightly higher than those for XT-II, and that XT-I showed a lesser stringency concerning the acceptor sequence. Mutagenesis of the bikunin peptide sequence in the G-S-G attachment site and flanking regions generated potential acceptor molecules. Here, mutations on the N-terminal side and the attachment site were found to be more susceptible to a loss of acceptor function than mutations in the C-terminus. Altogether the known consensus sequence a-a-a-a-G-S-G-a-a/G-a ('a' representing Asp or Glu) for XT-I mediated xylosylation could be approved and additionally extended to apply to XT-II as well.


Decreased BDNF levels in CSF of drug-naive first-episode psychotic subjects: correlation with plasma BDNF and psychopathology.

Skeletal morbidity in lung cancer patients with bone metastases: demonstrating the need for early diagnosis and treatment with bisphosphonates. The skeleton is one of the most frequent sites for metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and skeletal-related events (SREs) can decrease quality of life (QOL). However, limited guidance exists regarding the diagnosis and treatment of bone metastases in patients with NSCLC. Data on the burden of skeletal morbidity and the diagnosis and treatment of bone metastases in patients with NSCLC were obtained from reviewing the published literature (PubMed) and presentations and abstracts from recent oncology congresses. Bone metastases are common but underdiagnosed in patients with NSCLC. Most NSCLC patients with bone metastases develop > or =1 SRE during their lifetimes. As survival improves with new treatment modalities, the prevalence of SREs is likely to increase. Direct costs of SREs and their subsequent supportive care are approximately $28,000 per patient. Although bone metastases often are not diagnosed until after the onset of symptoms, early treatment can delay the onset of potentially debilitating SREs. In patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors (n=773), zoledronic acid (ZOL; 4 mg via 15-min infusion every 3 weeks) delayed the median time to first on-study SRE by >80 days compared with placebo (p=0.009). Moreover, ZOL significantly reduced the ongoing risk of SREs by 32% versus placebo (p=0.016). Skeletal morbidity is an important concern in patients with NSCLC. The incidence of SREs is expected to increase as survival improves in this setting. Prevention of SREs with therapies such as ZOL may preserve patients' QOL and possibly reduce healthcare costs.

Managing sales of beverages in schools to preserve profits and improve children's nutrition intake in 15 Mississippi schools. School environments that provide consistent and reliable nutrition information promote the development of healthful eating in children. High-energy, nutrient-poor beverages offered for sale to children during the school day compete with healthful choices. The primary objective of this prospective, quasiexperimental study was to encourage children to choose more healthful beverages during the school day without adversely affecting the profits realized from vending sales. Fifteen of 18 schools completed voluntary changes to beverage sales practices during the school day between August 2005 and May 2006. Twelve of 15 schools reported increased profits from the previous year (2004-2005) while offering more healthful beverage choices at discounted prices. Units of carbonated soft drinks sold declined when sports drinks, 100% fruit juice, and water were made available in their place. Passive marketing in the form of vending machine fronts, attractive pricing with a nominal 10% to 25% discount, and changing the types and proportions of beverages offered encouraged children to make more healthful choices. Local school administrators were receptive to making changes to beverage sales when local needs were incorporated into the study design. Profit information from this study informed state legislators and the Mississippi State Board of Education in the development and adoption of statewide snack and beverage vending guidelines. Registered dietitians serve as advocates to foster these collaborative efforts, inform key decision makers, and work in their local communities to develop and promote healthful practices in K-12 school settings.

A mathematical model of brain glucose homeostasis. The physiological fact that a stable level of brain glucose is more important than that of blood glucose suggests that the ultimate goal of the glucose-insulin-glucagon (GIG) regulatory system may be homeostasis of glucose concentration in the brain rather than in the circulation. In order to demonstrate the relationship between brain glucose homeostasis and blood hyperglycemia in diabetes, a brain-oriented mathematical model was developed by considering the brain as the controlled object while the remaining body as the actuator. After approximating the body compartmentally, the concentration dynamics of glucose, as well as those of insulin and glucagon, are described in each compartment. The brain-endocrine crosstalk, which regulates blood glucose level for brain glucose homeostasis together with the peripheral interactions among glucose, insulin and glucagon, is modeled as a proportional feedback control of brain glucose. Correlated to the brain, long-term effects of psychological stress and effects of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) adaptation to dysglycemia on the generation of hyperglycemia are also taken into account in the model. It is shown that simulation profiles obtained from the model are qualitatively or partially quantitatively consistent with clinical data, concerning the GIG regulatory system responses to bolus glucose, stepwise and continuous glucose infusion. Simulations also revealed that both stress and BBB adaptation contribute to the generation of hyperglycemia. Simulations of the model of a healthy person under long-term severe stress demonstrated that feedback control of brain glucose concentration results in elevation of blood glucose level. In this paper, we try to suggest that hyperglycemia in diabetes may be a normal outcome of brain glucose homeostasis.

alpha5 Subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate a slowly decaying inhibitory synaptic current in CA1 pyramidal neurons following Schaffer collateral activation. GABA(A) receptors that contain the alpha5 subunit (alpha5GABA(A)Rs) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, and have been implicated in learning and memory processes. They generate a tonic form of inhibition that regulates neuronal excitability. Recently it was shown that alpha5GABA(A)Rs also contribute to slow phasic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons following local stimulation in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. However, it is unknown whether alpha5GABA(A)Rs can also be recruited indirectly by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Here, we studied GABAergic currents evoked by stimulation in the stratum radiatum of CA1 in the presence and absence of CNQX to block AMPA receptor-mediated excitation. We tested their sensitivity to gabazine and two drugs acting at the benzodiazepine site of alpha1/alpha2/alpha3 or alpha5GABA(A)Rs (400 nM zolpidem and 20 nM L-655,708, respectively). IPSCs evoked by stimulation in the stratum radiatum in the presence of CNQX were potentiated by zolpidem, blocked by 1 muM gabazine and were relatively insensitive to L-655,708 consistent with the lack of alpha5GABA(A)Rs. In contrast, IPSCs evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals had a significant gabazine-insensitive component. This component was attenuated by L-655,708 and enhanced by burst stimulation. Furthermore, the L-655,708-sensitive current was absent in recordings from mice lacking alpha5GABA(A)Rs (gabra5(-/-) mice). These results show that alpha5GABA(A)R-mediated phasic inhibition is activated by the Schaffer collateral pathway and provide evidence for activity pattern-dependent participation of alpha5GABA(A)Rs in inhibition.

Effects of tyrosine/phenylalanine depletion on electrophysiological correlates of memory in healthy volunteers. Dopamine is well known for involvement in reinforcement, motor control and frontal lobe functions, such as attention and memory. Tyrosine/phenylalanine depletion (TPD) lowers dopamine synthesis and can therefore be used as a model to study the effects of low dopamine levels. This is the first study to assess the effect of TPD on memory performance and its electrophysiological correlates. In a double blind placebo (PLA)-controlled crossover design, 17 healthy volunteers (six males, 11 females) aged between 18 and 25 were tested after TPD and PLA. Working memory was assessed using a Sternberg memory scanning task (SMS) and episodic memory using the Visual Verbal Learning Test (VVLT). Simultaneously, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured. The tyrosine and phenylalanine ratio was significantly reduced after TPD and increased after PLA. Working memory performance was not affected by TPD. However, ERP measures were affected by the treatment, indicating that TPD impaired stimulus processing during working memory performance. Episodic memory was not impaired after TPD. Again, alterations in ERP measures suggested adverse effects of TPD on memory-related processing. These results suggest that dopamine is involved in both working memory and episodic memory-related processing, although the effects are too small to be detected by performance measures.

Antioxidant and scavenging capacity of Anacamptis pyrimidalis L.--pyrimidal orchid from Vojvodina. In the present study we investigated the antioxidative properties of flowers and aboveground part of Anacamptis pyrimidalis L. from Vojvodina. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase), quantities of malonyldialdehyde, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and reduced glutathione and also the contents of chlorophylls a and b, carotenoids and soluble proteins were determined. Lipofuscin 'plant age pigments', total antioxidant capacity and scavenging activity were also determined. Our results indicated that the aboveground part of the plant exhibited higher antioxidant activity due to low MDA and lipofuscin pigment accumulation (2.82 nmol/mg protein; 92.90%), higher scavenging activity (54.16%) and antioxidant capacity (432.00 micromol Fe(2+)/dm(3)).

Taking a unified approach to teaching and implementing quality improvements across multiple residency programs: the Atlantic Health experience. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recently emphasized the importance of systems-based practice and systems-based learning; however, successful models of collaborative quality improvement (QI) initiatives in residency training curricula are not widely available. Atlantic Health successfully conceptualized and implemented a QI collaborative focused on medication safety across eight residency training programs representing 219 residents. During a six-month period, key faculty and resident leaders from 8 (of 10) Atlantic Health residency training programs participated in three half-day collaborative learning sessions focused on improving medication reconciliation. Each session included didactic presentations from a multidisciplinary team of clinical experts as well as the application of principles that identified challenges, barriers, and solutions to QI initiatives. The learning sessions emphasized the fundamental principles of medication reconciliation, its critical importance as a vital part of patient handoff in all health care settings, and the challenges of achieving successful medication reconciliation improvement in light of work hours restrictions and patient loads. Each residency program developed a detailed implementation and measurement plan for individual "action learning" projects, using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method of improvement. Each program then implemented its QI project, and expert faculty (e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, QI staff) provided mentoring between learning sessions. Several projects resulted in permanent changes in medication reconciliation processes, which were then adopted by other programs. The structure, process, and outcomes of this effort are described in detail.

Molecular recognition of RNA: challenges for modelling interactions and plasticity. There is growing interest in molecular recognition processes of RNA because of RNA's widespread involvement in biological processes. Computational approaches are increasingly used for analysing and predicting binding to RNA, fuelled by encouraging progress in developing simulation, free energy and docking methods for nucleic acids. These developments take into account challenges regarding the energetics of RNA-ligand binding, RNA plasticity, and the presence of water molecules and ions in the binding interface. Accordingly, we will detail advances in force field and scoring function development for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy computations and docking calculations of nucleic acid complexes. Furthermore, we present methods that can detect moving parts within RNA structures based on graph-theoretical approaches or normal mode analysis (NMA). As an example of the successful use of these developments, we will discuss recent structure-based drug design approaches that focus on the bacterial ribosomal A-site RNA as a drug target.

The overgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes by other Listeria spp. in food samples undergoing enrichment cultivation has a nutritional basis. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes from food is carried out using a double enrichment. In cases where multiple Listeria species are present within the original sample, L. monocytogenes can be overgrown during enrichment by other species of listeria present in the original sample. From a practical perspective, this can result in a false negative or complicate the ability of public health investigators to match food and clinical isolates. We have further investigated this phenomenon by analysing the growth kinetics of single species and pairs of different species over the ISO 11290-1 enrichment process. The overgrowth of a strain of L. monocytogenes by a strain of Listeria innocua resulted primarily from interactions which occurred in late exponential phase, where it was observed that growth of both strains stopped when the dominant strain reached stationary phase. In a second mixed culture, the dominant L. monocytogenes strain suppressed the exponential growth rate of the second Listeria welshimeri strain. Both findings suggest that the overgrowth could partially be explained in terms of a nutritional competition. Multi-factor analysis of Fraser broth constituents and growth temperatures using both stressed and non-stressed inoculants failed to identify any single factor in the ISO 11290-1 methodology which would contribute to the overgrowth phenomenon in our model system. Furthermore, species was not a significant factor in observed differences in growth parameters among a wider array of strains which had been stressed or not stressed prior to grown in Fraser broths, even though some strains had significantly faster growth rates than others. Limiting diffusion in Fraser broth through the addition of agar significantly reduced the extent of the overgrowth in experiments using mixtures of strains originally isolated from foods where overgrowth had been previously observed. Taken together, these findings support that the overgrowth phenomenon in most instances has a nutritional basis.

MAPK signal transduction underlying brain inflammation and gliosis as therapeutic target. A majority, if not all, acute and progressive neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by local microglia-mediated inflammation, astrogliosis, infiltration of immune cells, and activation of the adaptive immunity. These processes progress by the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteases, and other inflammation mediators. In response to brain injury or infection, intracellular signaling pathways are activated in microglia, which turn on inflammatory and antigen-presenting cell functions. Different extrinsic signals shape microglial activation toward neuroprotective or neurotoxic phenotype under pathological conditions. This review discusses recent advances regarding molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signal transduction in neurological disorders and in in vitro models of inflammation/gliosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases responsible for most cellular responses to cytokines and external stress signals and crucial for regulation of the production of inflammation mediators. Increased activity of MAPKs in activated microglia and astrocytes, and their regulatory role in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines mediators, make them potential targets for novel therapeutics. MAPK inhibitors emerge as attractive anti-inflammatory drugs, because they are capable of reducing both the synthesis of inflammation mediators at multiple levels and are effective in blocking inflammatory cytokine signaling. Small molecule inhibitors targeting of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways have been developed and offer a great potential as potent modulators of brain inflammation and gliosis in neurological disorders, where cytokine overproduction contributes to disease progression. Many of the pharmacological MAPK inhibitors can be administered orally and initial results show therapeutic benefits in preclinical animal models.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 beta regulates integrin alpha IIb beta 3 avidity and the cellular transmission of contractile forces. Phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling processes play an important role in regulating the adhesive function of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3), necessary for platelet spreading and sustained platelet aggregation. PI3K inhibitors are effective at reducing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivo and as a consequence are currently being evaluated as novel antithrombotic agents. PI3K regulation of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation (affinity modulation) primarily occurs downstream of G(i)-coupled and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors linked to the activation of Rap1b, AKT, and phospholipase C. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the avidity (strength of adhesion) of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonds, necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. Using knock-out mouse models and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Type Ia p110 beta isoform plays a major role in regulating thrombin-stimulated fibrin clot retraction in vitro. Reduced clot retraction induced by PI3K inhibitors was not associated with defects in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation, actin polymerization, or actomyosin contractility but was associated with a defect in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) association with the contractile cytoskeleton. Analysis of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhesion contacts using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the stability of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonds. These studies demonstrate an important role for PI3K p110 beta in regulating the avidity of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptors, necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. These findings may provide new insight into the potential antithrombotic properties of PI3K p110 beta inhibitors.

Internal open brain injury or cranial burst fracture: report of 8 cases. We report a special type of skull fracture in children - internal open brain injury (IOBI). We summarize its clinical characteristics and propose a treatment strategy based on our experience. Eight patients between 2 and 5 years old were identified to have IOBI. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed in each case and magnetic resonance imaging was conducted when available. All patients were treated surgically. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and each patient underwent follow-up CT scanning. IOBI has no special clinical manifestations other than scalp swelling, linear skull fracture and local brain contusion. Acute cerebral extrusion outside the calvaria and lacerated dura mater were seen during operation in each patient. Each patient's neurological status generally improved after surgery. No patient developed posttraumatic epilepsy during the 4- to 20-month follow-up period. IOBI is a type of head trauma in which dura mater is lacerated and the cerebrum is extruded outside the calvaria but the scalp remains intact. Craniotomy with evacuation of devitalized brain tissue and dural repair should be performed.

Eco-, geno- and human toxicology of bio-active nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Gene delivery has become an increasingly important strategy for treating a variety of human diseases, including infections, genetic disorders and tumours. To avoid the difficulties of using viral carriers, more and more non-viral gene delivery nanoparticles are developed. Among these new approaches polyethylene imine (PEI) is currently considered as one of the most effective polymer based method solution and considered as the gold standard. The toxicity of nanoparticles is a major concern when used for medical application. In this study we chose two nanoparticles for an in depth toxicological and ecotoxicological evaluation, one well characterized, PEI, and another novel polymer, poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). In the present study we have assessed the toxicity of these cation nanoparticles as such and of the polyplexes - nanoparticles covered with DNA. As these nanoparticles are also frequently used in high volumes in various industries and as such may enter in the environment, we also made an initial assessment of ecotoxicological effects assessment. The following nanoparticles related aspects have been studied during the project: development and characterization, ecotoxicity, general toxicity and specific toxicity. To this end a battery of different tests was used. The conclusion of these tests is that toxicity is varying between different nanoparticles and between different DNA covering ratios. In general, in the different systems tested, the PEI polymer is more toxic than the PDMAEMA polymer. The same difference is seen for the polyplexes and the higher the charge ratio, the more toxic are the polyplexes. Our study also clearly shows the need for a broad spectrum of toxicity assays for a comprehensive risk assessment. Our study has performed such a comprehensive analysis of two biomedical nanoparticles.

Sleep, hormones, and memory. Nocturnal sleep is characterized by a unique pattern of endocrine activity, which comprises reciprocal influences on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the somatotropic system. During early sleep, when slow wave sleep (SWS) prevails, HPA secretory activity is suppressed whereas growth hormone (GH) release reaches a maximum; this pattern is reversed during late sleep when rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predominates. SWS benefits the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories, whereas REM sleep improves amygdala-dependent emotional memories and procedural skill memories involving striato-cortical circuitry. Manipulation of plasma cortisol and GH concentration during sleep revealed a primary role of HPA activity for memory consolidation. Pituitary-adrenal inhibition during SWS sleep represents a prerequisite for efficient consolidation of declarative memory; increased cortisol during late REM sleep seems to protect from an overshooting consolidation of emotional memories.

Mercury concentrations in surface water and harvested waterfowl from the prairie pothole region of Saskatchewan. Mercury cycling in prairie ecosystems is poorly understood. We examined methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in whole water from 49 diverse prairie wetlands and lakes in Saskatchewan. We also determined total Hg (THg) concentrations in waterfowl harvested by hunters for consumption. Average whole water MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.02 to over 4 ng L(-1) and were higher in water from wetland ponds compared to those in lakes. High MeHg concentrations in prairie wetlands present the possibility of increased Hg concentrations in biota inhabiting these and other similar systems. We therefore measured THg in 72 birds representing 13 species of waterfowl that commonly use prairie aquatic habitats. A large range in THg concentrations was observed among individual birds, with values ranging from below the detection limit to over 435 ng g(-1). When waterfowl were classified according to diet, we observed clear evidence of THg biomagnification with increasing proportion of animal prey consumed. THg concentrations in waterfowl collected by hunters did not exceed consumption guidelines of 0.5 mg kg(-1) developed for fish. This is the first study that has reported MeHg concentrations in water from the prairie pothole region of southern Saskatchewan.

Plasma osteopontin concentrations in preeclampsia - is there an association with endothelial injury? Abstract Background: It has been previously reported that plasma osteopontin (OPN) concentrations are increased in cardiovascular disorders. The goal of the present study was to determine plasma OPN concentrations in healthy pregnant women and preeclamptic patients, and to investigate their relationship to the clinical characteristics of the study subjects and to markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP)], endothelial activation [von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag)] or endothelial injury (fibronectin), oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and trophoblast debris (cell-free fetal DNA). Forty-four patients with preeclampsia and 44 healthy pregnant women matched for age and gestational age were involved in this case-control study. Plasma OPN concentrations were measured with ELISA. Serum CRP concentrations were determined with an autoanalyzer using the manufacturer's reagents. Plasma VWF:Ag was quantified by ELISA, while plasma fibronectin concentrations were measured by nephelometry. Plasma MDA concentrations were estimated by the thiobarbituric acid-based colorimetric assay. The amount of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma was determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene. For statistical analyses, non-parametric methods were applied. Serum levels of CRP, as well as plasma concentrations of VWF:Ag, fibronectin, MDA and cell-free fetal DNA were significantly higher in preeclamptic patients than in healthy pregnant women. There was no significant difference in plasma OPN concentrations between controls and the preeclamptic group. However, preeclamptic patients with plasma fibronectin concentrations in the upper quartile had significantly higher plasma OPN concentrations than those below the 75th percentile, as well as healthy pregnant women [median (interquartile range): 9.38 (8.10-11.99) vs. 7.54 (6.31-9.40) and 7.40 (6.51-8.80) ng/mL, respectively, p<0.05 for both]. Furthermore, in preeclamptic patients, plasma OPN concentrations showed a significant positive linear association with plasma fibronectin (Spearman R=0.38, standardized regression coefficient (beta)=0.41, p<0.05 for both). Plasma OPN concentrations are increased in preeclamptic patients with extensive endothelial injury. However, further studies are warranted to explore the relationship between OPN and endothelial damage. Clin Chem Lab Med 2010;48:181-7.

Information content analysis in automated microscopy imaging using an adaptive autofocus algorithm for multimodal functions. We present a new algorithm to analyse information content in images acquired using automated fluorescence microscopy. The algorithm belongs to the group of autofocusing methods, but differs from its predecessors in that it can handle thick specimens and operate also in confocal mode. It measures the information content in images using a 'content function', which is essentially the same concept as a focus function. Unlike previously presented algorithms, this algorithm tries to find all significant axial positions in cases where the content function applied to real data is not unimodal, which is often the case. This requirement precludes using algorithms that rely on unimodality. Moreover, choosing a content function requires careful consideration, because some functions suppress local maxima. First, we test 19 content functions and evaluate their ability to show local maxima clearly. The results show that only six content functions succeed. To save time, the acquisition procedure needs to vary the step size adaptively, because a wide range of possible axial positions has to be passed so as not to miss a local maximum. The algorithm therefore has to assess the steepness of the content function online so that it can decide to use a bigger or smaller step size to acquire the next image. Therefore, the algorithm needs to know about typical behaviour of content functions. We show that for normalized variance, one of the most promising content functions, this knowledge can be obtained after normalizing with respect to the theoretical maximum of this function, and using hierarchical clustering. The resulting algorithm is more reliable and efficient than a simple procedure with constant steps.


Analysis of a post-translational steroid induction system for GIGANTEA in Arabidopsis.

Trypanosoma cruzi: A kinetoplast-associated protein of the photolyase/cryptochrome family. A photolyase-like protein gene found in the Trypanosoma cruzi genome database was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. Antibodies against this protein were used to determine expression of the protein in the different forms of the parasite. It was visualized in the epimastigote form but not in amastigote or trypomastigote forms obtained from culture in Vero cells. In epimastigotes, this protein is located at the level of the mitochondrion associated to both sides of the kinetoplast. Sequence analyses indicated that this protein, as well as other photolyases from Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma brucei are related to single-stranded photolyases or cryptochromes DASH.

Racial and ethnic differences in the mental health needs and access to care of older adults in california. Little is known about the unmet mental health needs of minority older adults. Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence rates of psychological distress and reported need and use of mental health services were examined in a population-based sample of older adults using the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. The sample comprised 16,974 people aged 55 and older, with 13,974 non-Hispanic whites, 719 African Americans, 1,215 Asians, and 1,066 Latinos. Respondents were compared in terms of prevalence of symptoms of mental distress and serious mental illness, reported need for help, and access to mental health services. African Americans, Asians, and Latinos were more likely to have mental distress than whites (21.2-24.2% vs 14.4%, P<.001) and a higher prevalence of serious mental illness (4.1-7.7% vs 2.5%, P<.001). After adjustment for age, sex, birthplace, marital status, education, limited English proficiency, chronic health conditions, and insurance status, older African-American (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.81) and Asian (aOR=1.50, CI=1.13-2.00) adults still had greater odds of mental distress than whites. Furthermore, all three groups had worse access to mental health services than whites (African American aOR=0.64, 95% CI=0.43-0.96; Asian aOR=0.32, CI=0.16-0.63; Latino aOR=0.35, CI=0.17-0.70). Clinicians caring for older individuals should be aware of their high risk for mental health needs. Given that minorities' access to mental health services is worse than whites', even after adjusting for health insurance status, providing insurance alone will not eliminate this disparity. Innovative clinical and systemic strategies are needed to better identify individuals at risk and to provide needed services.


Mapping analyses to estimate health utilities based on responses to the OM8-30 Otitis Media Questionnaire.

Heat-stable measles vaccine produced by spray drying. A combination of unique stabilizers and mild spray drying process conditions was employed to produce heat-stable measles vaccine powder. Live attenuated measles vaccine from Serum Institute of India was formulated with pharmaceutically approved stabilizers, including sugars, proteins, amino acids, polymers, surfactants, and plasticizers, as well as charged ions. In addition, the effects of buffer salt and pH on the storage stability of measles virus were examined. The potency of the dried vaccine stored at several temperatures was quantified by TCID(50) assay on Vero cells. As a comparison to other process methods, lead formulations were also subjected to freeze drying and foam drying. The optimized measles vaccine formulation tested at 37 degrees C was stable for approximately 8 weeks (i.e. time for 1 log TCID(50) loss). The measles titer decreased in a bi-phasic manner, with initial rapid loss within the first week but relative stability thereafter. Key stabilizers identified during the formulation screening processes were L-arginine, human serum albumin, and a combination of divalent cations. Spray drying was identified as the optimal processing method for the preparation of dried vaccine, as it generally resulted in negligible process loss and comparable, if not better storage stability, with respect to the other processes. Processing methods and formulation components were developed that produced a measles vaccine stable for up to 8 weeks at 37 degrees C, which surpassed the WHO requirement for heat stability of 1 week at that temperature.

Synaptic activity induces dramatic changes in the geometry of the cell nucleus: interplay between nuclear structure, histone H3 phosphorylation, and nuclear calcium signaling. Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic NMDA receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the ERK-MAP kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic NMDA receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.

[Effect of dachaihutang on expression of carnitine patmitoryl transferase-1 in vascular smooth muscle layer of atherosclerotic rabbits]. To investigate the therapeutic effect of Dachaihutang on the development of atherosclerosis (AS) in rabbits and its possible mechanism by detecting the expression level of carnitine patmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) in vascular smooth muscle layer of atherosclerotic rabbits, and search the new way and evidence for AS cures. Thirty six male New Zealand white rabbits were divided randomly into control group, model control group, simvastatin group and Chinese traditional medicine dachaihutang group. After 9 weeks and 20 weeks of treatment, serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were examined. At the end of 25 th weeks, histological changes in ascending aorta were studied by HE staining and histomorphometric analysis. The gene expression of CPT-1 in vascular smooth muscle layer of thoracic aorta was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with model control group, in dachaihutang group serum TC and TG and LDL levels attenuated. Pathomorphology indicated that intima and media (I + M) became thinned, and the ratios of the thickness of intima to media(I/M) and the area of intima to media (SI/SM) were decreased (P < 0.05). Aortic intimal proliferation in Dachaihutang group was associated with a marked increase in CPT-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle layer of thoracic aorta. Compared to simvastatin group, except TG value, other values were higher in Dachaihutang group, however, there were no significant differences between the two groups. These findings suggest that early treatment with Dachaihutang not only induces a significant regression of arterial lesions of high cholesterol diet rabbits, but also has a crucial inhibited genesis and development of atherosclerosis effect by up-regulating CPT-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle layer.

Body image and eating disorders amongst Japanese adolescents. A review of the literature. This review describes the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating behaviors as well as factors influencing body image disturbance amongst Japanese adolescents and compares the prevalence and trends with those of Westernized countries. Although eating disorders have been previously regarded as peculiar to Western society, they are now a more global issue with reports of non-Western countries including Japan having increasing rates of eating disorders. As the aetiology of eating disorders is related to societal norms, culture and ethnicity, their study requires an understanding of body image disturbance within different cultural contexts. Although considered less prevalent than in the West, Japan has an early history of eating disorder research and trends outlined in this review suggest that, as in Western countries the interest in, and study of eating disorders in Japan has increased during the 1980s. The prevalence of eating disorders in Japan based on available reviews, epidemiological studies and clinical reports ranges from 0.025% to 0.2% for AN and from 1.9% to 2.9% for BN. Studies suggest that the prevalence of eating disorders has increased significantly during the past two decades but the prevalence is still quite low compared to those in Western countries. Strategies for culturally appropriate prevention are discussed.

Multiple nuclear receptors may regulate hepatitis B virus biosynthesis during development. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates by the reverse transcription of the viral 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA. Therefore the level of expression of this transcript in the liver is a primary determinant of HBV biosynthesis. In vivo neonatal transcription of the HBV 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA is developmental regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). In addition, viral biosynthesis in non-hepatoma cells can be supported directly by this nuclear receptor. However HBV transcription and replication can be supported by additional nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptor α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (RXRα/PPARα), retinoid X receptor α/farnesoid X receptor α (RXRα/FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) and estrogen-related receptors (ERR) in non-hepatoma cells. Therefore during neonatal liver development, HNF4α may progressively activate viral transcription and replication by binding directly to the proximal HNF4α recognition sequence within the nucleocapsid promoter. Alternatively, HNF4α may support viral biosynthesis in vivo indirectly by activating a network of liver-enriched nuclear receptors that, in combination, direct HBV 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA transcription and replication.

The DHR96 nuclear receptor controls triacylglycerol homeostasis in Drosophila. Triacylglycerol (TAG) homeostasis is an integral part of normal physiology and essential for proper energy metabolism. Here we show that the single Drosophila ortholog of the PXR and CAR nuclear receptors, DHR96, plays an essential role in TAG homeostasis. DHR96 mutants are sensitive to starvation, have reduced levels of TAG in the fat body and midgut, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity, while DHR96 overexpression leads to starvation resistance and increased TAG levels. We show that DHR96 function is required in the midgut for the breakdown of dietary fat and that it exerts this effect through the CG5932 gastric lipase, which is essential for TAG homeostasis. This study provides insights into the regulation of dietary fat metabolism in Drosophila and demonstrates that the regulation of lipid metabolism is an ancestral function of the PXR/CAR/DHR96 nuclear receptor subfamily.

[Program optimization for bovine somatic cells nuclear transfer]. To optimize program of bovine somatic nuclear transfer, we used two different enucleation procedures (by Spindle-view system & Hoechst 33342 staining), two different procedures to introduce donor nuclei (by ooplasm microinjection & electrofusion), and three different group electrofusion parameters (group 1: 1.9 kV/cm, 10 micros, two; group 2: 1.5 kV/cm, 25 micros, two; group 3: 0.6 kV/cm, 100 micros, one) to reconstruct bovine cloned embryos. The cleavation rates and blastocyst development rates of cloned embryos were used to assess the efficiency of different operational procedure. Finally, the best combination of operational procedure, that the spindle-viewer system was used for oocytes enucleating, and donor cell was electrofused into ooplasm by electrical pulse (1.9 kV/cm, 10 micros, two) to reconstruct bovine cloned embryos. Then the excellent blastocysts were transferred to fosters for producing cloned cattle 80 high-quality cloned blastocysts were transferred into 33 fosters, two cloned calves were produced. According to the results, the optimized program could be used to produce cloned cattle.

Do schistosomes grow old? A confocal laser scanning microscopy study. Infected hosts progressively decrease egg output during the chronic phase of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Ageing may be a factor that results in a progressive decrease in the ability to reproduce. This study was performed to gain insight into the effects of ageing on adult schistosomes, using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Adult worms were recovered from experimentally infected Nectomys squamipes (water rat). Viable eggs were voided in the faeces for 65 weeks and, thereafter, only unviable eggs were eliminated. The rat died after 70 weeks in captivity. Recovered worms (six males and one female) were prepared for confocal microscopy and images were obtained with an LSM 510-ZETA laser confocal microscope. The overall morphology of the adult worms (suckers and tegument) and reproductive organs were the focus of this work. The suckers, ovary, vitellaria and oocytes appeared to be apparently normal. The ootype was formed by flattened cells and unclear nuclei, suggesting that the mechanism for eggshell production by the ootype during organogenesis might have been impaired. Testicular lobes showed empty areas around the germinative cells. Male adult worms showed flaccid musculature of the dorsal surface. Taken together, the present results provided several indications of infertility in older male and female schistosomes.

Toll-like receptor 9 is not important for host defense against Haemophilus influenzae. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common Gram-negative respiratory pathogen. We demonstrated previously that myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) is of utmost importance in host defense against NTHi. All TLRs except for TLR3 depend on MyD88 for signaling. TLR9, the TLR for detecting pathogen DNA depends on MyD88 signaling. Here, we investigate the role of TLR9 during NTHi pneumonia. Alveolar macrophages (AM) from normal wild-type (WT) and TLR9 knock-out (KO) mice were harvested and stimulated with growth-arrested NTHi or CPG DNA. WT and TLR9 KO mice were infected intranasally with NTHi: cytokine and chemokine responses were measured 16h later. Despite significant reduced TNF production by TLR9 KO AM in response to CPG DNA, no difference was detected in TNF production after NTHi stimulation by isolated alveolar macrophages from WT and TLR9 KO mice. Moreover, we found similar pulmonary bacterial loads, similar cytokine and chemokine levels in WT and TLR9 KO mice, and no differences in histopathology. In conclusion, we were not able to demonstrate a role for TLR9 in the recognition of and host defense against NTHi.

Association of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and sex hormone-binding globulin in non-obese peri- and postmenopausal women. The relationships between N-terminal fragment proBNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) (NT-proBNP) and sex steroid hormones have not been fully elucidated. We examined these associations in pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women without known cardiovascular disease. We also examined the change in circulating NT-proBNP caused by a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist in order to clarify the effect of acute hormone deficiency on NT-proBNP. Forty-nine premenopausal women, 101 perimenopausal women and 108 postmenopausal women were enrolled in one study. Forty-four premenopausal women with leiomyoma were recruited for another study, and 22 of those women were treated with a GnRH agonist. Serum levels of NT-proBNP, estradiol, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. NT-proBNP concentrations showed significant inverse correlations with body mass index (BMI) in peri- and postmenopausal women. Serum NTproBNP concentrations showed significant positive correlations with SHBG in peri- and postmenopausal women. These significant correlations remained after adjustment for age and BMI. Serum NT-proBNP concentration was significantly decreased after GnRH agonist administration, while NT-proBNP concentration in the control group did not change significantly. Serum SHBG level was also significantly decreased after GnRH agonist administration. Circulating NT-proBNP levels are positively associated with SHBG levels in non-obese peri- and postmenopausal women, and this relationship was found under the condition of acute hormone deficiency induced by GnRH agonist treatment.

An investigation of teaching staff members' and parents' views on the current state of adaptive seating technology and provision. It is recognized that for children with poor postural control, a comfortable adaptive seating system which provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential for raising their overall level of well being. The purpose of this study was to investigate the views of teaching staff members at special needs schools and of the parents of children who attended these schools on the provision and current technology of seating systems. Two similar questionnaires intended to elicit the views of teaching staff and the parents of children attending these schools were designed and distributed to these groups. Dissatisfaction exists with reliability of these systems and the time it takes for replacement systems to be issued. The perceived importance of adaptive seating role in the user being accepted by peers was found to be statistically different between the two groups. Time spent per day transferring the child to and from seating systems was found to be greater than 1 h for both groups. Scope remains for improvements to be made in adaptive seating provision and technology. Although mainly descriptive, these results could be of use when developing newer systems and improving services.

Treatment of psoriasis with anti-TNF drugs during pregnancy: case report and review of the literature. Published experiences of TNF-alpha inhibition during pregnancy consist of a limited number of case reports, series and ongoing registry data in patients with arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. A 28-year-old woman - with psoriasis vulgaris since she was 8 years of age and generalized pustular psoriasis during her first pregnancy (partially controlled with ciclosporin, oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids, when lupus anticoagulant was detected at another hospital) - presented 4 months after delivery with severe psoriasis (PASI = 15.4) that did not respond to ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day). Ten days after the first infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg), when the patient became aware that she was pregnant again, there was PASI75 response, and the patient wished to continue this treatment after being fully informed. Complete blanching was achieved by week 6 of treatment, and was maintained thereafter until the moment of writing (19 months after the start of treatment). She gave birth by caesarean delivery to a healthy female baby, who was breastfed for 1 month and has developed normally. The current report extends the available evidence on successful infliximab treatment in pregnant women, with the first case of a patient with psoriasis who presented impetigo herpetiformis during her previous pregnancy. No detectable adverse effects were detected in the neonate, despite potential exposure to infliximab throughout gestation and breastfeeding. Even though absolute safety is difficult to prove, available data suggest that women who become pregnant while taking infliximab or other anti-TNFalpha agents can be reassured regarding the continuation of pregnancy.


The impact of nurse empowerment on job satisfaction.

Medical pluralism of the Chinese in London: an exploratory study. This study was designed to examine the extent of medical pluralism among the Chinese in London. Members of the London Chinese community were recruited through Chinese organizations in London and participated in six focus groups. A total of 48 Chinese men and women aged 24-74 years were asked to talk about their health behaviour and health utilization patterns. Transcripts of the focus group discussions underwent thematic analysis to explore and describe the utilization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine (WM) of informants and factors that impacted on utilization. Findings focus on participants' evaluation of TCM and WM as two systems of health provision, how informants used these two health systems, and the reasons associated with use of these two systems. Utilization of TCM and WM varied. Concurrent use of TCM and WM was common. The National Health Service was generally perceived as difficult to use, with concerns over the language barrier, and communicating with and being able to trust health providers. The UK TCM trade was perceived as being aimed at the non-Chinese market and there were issues of trust related to the regulation of UK TCM. Although none of these issues are unique to the Chinese in the UK, previous experience with different approaches to health care, particularly TCM, may make the experience of such barriers more extreme.

A comprehensive model of the process of telephone nursing. This paper is a report of a study conducted to develop a theoretical model of the process nurses use to deliver care over the telephone. Telephone nursing is practised internationally in diverse settings, and research has shown it to be an effective service. Although studies have identified important variables that influence the practice, the telephone nursing process in its entirety has not been described. In this grounded theory study, data were collected from ten experienced telephone nurses from four different sites using semi-structured interviews. Concurrent data collection and analysis took place in 2005. A cumulative process of theoretical sampling and constant comparison was used to identify initial concepts, and then expand, validate, and clarify them until the concepts and relationships were fully developed. The findings were validated through peer and participant review. Telephone nursing is a dynamic and goal-oriented process consisting of three phases: gathering information, cognitive processing, and output. While generally sequential, the phases can be simultaneous or recurring in response to caller needs. Interpreting takes place throughout the call; that is, the nurse translates data from the caller into healthcare information and healthcare information into caller language. Factors shaping the process are call prioritization and level of complexity, resource availability, and the nurse's need for validation. Telephone nursing training and practice should emphasize gathering information, using implicit and explicit information to identify client needs, and translating healthcare information back into language comprehensible to clients.

Injury data needs and opportunities in Europe. Targeted injury prevention needs information, and the basis is data. The EU Council Recommendation on injury prevention of 2007 recommends that Member States make better use of the existing data, and that they implement additional injury surveillance, when appropriate, in order to obtain comparable information. In almost all Member States, some data on injuries are available: on deaths, hospital discharges, external causes of injuries, traffic accidents and workplace accidents. It is examined how far these data meet the information needs of key stakeholders in injury prevention. General information about the health burden of injury, based on mortality and hospital discharges, is available and sufficient for identifying injury as a priority for health policy. Health indicators like lost life years, rates of hospitalisation, estimated rates of disabilities or health care costs could be derived, but are not widely available yet. Information about external circumstances (causes) of injuries is indispensible for targeted prevention, but only 12 countries have a harmonised surveillance system on external causes in place (European Injury Database IDB 2009). It is recommended that the harmonised collection of data on fatalities, hospital discharges and external causes of injuries should become compulsory within the new European health information system. The provision of harmonised injury indicators should be promoted. The surveillance system on external causes (IDB) should be implemented in countries without such system. National injury data administrators ('clearing houses') should be established for the provision of comprehensive injury reports and for serving the needs of key stakeholders in injury prevention.

Effect of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. leaf and MAPK signal transduction pathway on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in alveolar macrophage of chronic bronchitis rats. The goal of this study was to investigate the possible therapy mechanism of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. Leaf (TAL) in alveolar macrophage (AM) of chronic bronchitis (CB) rats. CB model was established by injection of bacillus calmette guein (BCG) plus lipopolisacharide (LPS) in rats. TAL significantly inhibited the increased NO concentration, iNOS expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in alveolar macrophages (AMs) of CB rats. Using in vivo test, we found that SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, (10 muM) significantly inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression in AM. This data indicate that TAL highly decreases excessive iNOS expression and NO induction, and p38 MAPK signal transduction participates in iNOS expression and NO induction in AM of CB rats. The effect of TAL on iNOS expression in AM may be related to its inhibition of p38 MAPK signal transduction.

In view of spontaneous resolution, diagnostic or therapeutic pleural tap is not warranted.

Eukaryotic release factor 1-2 affects Arabidopsis responses to glucose and phytohormones during germination and early seedling development. Germination and early seedling development are coordinately regulated by glucose and phytohormones such as ABA, GA, and ethylene. However, the molecules that affect plant responses to glucose and phytohormones remain to be fully elucidated. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) is responsible for the recognition of the stop codons in mRNAs during protein synthesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that eRF1 functions in other processes in addition to translation termination. The physiological role of eRF1-2, a member of the eRF1 family, in Arabidopsis was examined here. The eRF1-2 gene was found to be specifically induced by glucose. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing eRF1-2 were hypersensitive to glucose during germination and early seedling development. Such hypersensitivity to glucose was accompanied by a dramatic reduction of the expression of glucose-regulated genes, chlorophyll a/b binding protein and plastocyanin. The hypersensitive response was not due to the enhanced accumulation of ABA. In addition, the eRF1-2 overexpressing plants showed increased sensitivity to paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, and exogenous GA restored their normal growth. By contrast, the loss-of-function erf1-2 mutant exhibited resistance to paclobutrazol, suggesting that eRF1-2 may exert a negative effect on the GA signalling pathway. Collectively, these data provide evidence in support of a novel role of eRF1-2 in affecting glucose and phytohormone responses in modulating plant growth and development.

Connexin-26 mutations in deafness and skin disease. Gap junctions allow the exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells through intercellular channels formed by connexin proteins, which can also form functional hemichannels in nonjunctional membranes. Mutations in connexin genes cause a variety of human diseases. For example, mutations in GJB2, the gene encoding connexin-26 (Cx26), are not only a major cause of nonsyndromic deafness, but also cause syndromic deafness associated with skin disorders such as palmoplantar keratoderma, keratitis-ichthyosis deafness syndrome, Vohwinkel syndrome, hystrix-ichthyosis deafness syndrome and Bart-Pumphrey syndrome. The most common mutation in the Cx26 gene linked to nonsyndromic deafness is 35DeltaG, a frameshift mutation leading to an early stop codon. The large number of deaf individuals homozygous for 35DeltaG do not develop skin disease. Similarly, there is abundant experimental evidence to suggest that other Cx26 loss-of-function mutations cause deafness, but not skin disease. By contrast, Cx26 mutations that cause both skin diseases and deafness are all single amino acid changes. Since nonsyndromic deafness is predominantly a loss-of-function disorder, it follows that the syndromic mutants must show an alteration, or gain, of function to cause skin disease. Here, we summarise the functional consequences and clinical phenotypes resulting from Cx26 mutations that cause deafness and skin disease.

Hepatoprotective effect of shidagonglao on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride. This study investigates the hepatoprotective activity of ethanol extract from Shidagonglao roots (SDGL(EtOH)). The hepatoprotective effect of SDGL(EtOH) (20, 100 and 500 mg/kg) was analyzed on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute liver injury. Rats pretreated orally with SDGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) and silymarin (200 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days prior to the administration of a single dose of 50% CCl(4) (0.10 ml/100 g of bw, ip) significantly prevented the increases in the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in CCl(4)-treated rats. Histological analysis also showed that SDGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) and silymarin reduced the incidence of liver lesions including vacuole formation, neutrophil infiltration and necrosis of hepatocytes induced by CCl(4) in rats. Moreover, the SDGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) increased the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in liver, as compared to those in the CCl(4)-treated group. Furthermore, SDGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) and silymarin attenuated the increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum and nitric oxide (NO) in liver as compared to the CCl(4)-treated group. The hepatoprotective mechanisms of SDGL(EtOH) are likely related to inhibition of TNF-alpha, MDA and NO productions via increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx and GRd). These experimental results suggest that SDGL(EtOH) can attenuate CCl(4)-induced acute liver injury in rats.

Racial discrimination and physical activity among low-income-housing residents. Although discrimination has been identified as a potential determinant of existing racial/ethnic health disparities, no studies have investigated whether racial discrimination contributes to disparities in physical activity. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the association between interpersonal racial discrimination and physical activity. Baseline data were collected during 2004-2005 among a predominately black and Hispanic sample of adult residents living in 12 low-income-housing sites in Boston MA (n=1055). Residents reported experiences of lifetime racial discrimination during interviewer-administered surveys and wore a pedometer for 5 days to measure physical activity. For analyses, performed in 2009, linear regression models with a cluster design were conducted to predict physical activity, measured as steps per day. Nearly 48% of participants reported ever experiencing racial discrimination, and discrimination was most commonly experienced on the street or in a public setting. No association was found between discrimination and physical activity, when examined in bivariate, multivariable, or race-stratified models. The current results indicate that self-reported racial discrimination is not a key determinant of physical activity among residents living in low-income housing. However, additional research is warranted to address current limitations of this study.

The efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone for luteal phase supplementation in gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist cycles: a prospective clinical trial. We compared the efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel (PVG) with intramuscular progesterone (IMP) supplementation for luteal phase support after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles. The treatment outcomes were similar for PVG and IMP for luteal support in GnRH-antagonist protocols. With its ease of use, high tolerability by patients, and fewer side effects, PVG can be a successful alternative to IMP.

Gastric cancer with cervical lymph node metastasis as the first presentation: report of a case. A 62-year-old man presented with a painful left lateral neck mass. Aspiration cytology revealed lymph node metastasis of undifferentiated carcinoma. A Borrmann type 3 tumor was detected in the body of the stomach on endoscopic examination. No visceral metastasis was found. Distal gastrectomy and radical neck dissection were performed. Pathological examination revealed that the histological features of the gastric lesion were identical to those of the cervical lymph node lesion. Regional lymph nodes of the stomach and Virchow's lymph nodes were not involved. Irradiation to the left supraclavicular and cervical region and an oral tegafur anticancer agent (TS-1) were started. Left axillary and right supraclavicular lymphadenopathies were detected 4 and 5 months after surgery, respectively. Rapid progression of hoarseness was observed, and weekly docetaxcel was started. However, he died of airway obstruction 8 months after surgery.

Identification of bacterial populations in drinking water using 16S rRNA-based sequence analyses. Intracellular RNA is rapidly degraded in stressed cells and is more unstable outside of the cell than DNA. As a result, RNA-based methods have been suggested to study the active microbial fraction in environmental matrices. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial populations in drinking water by analyzing 16S rRNA-based clone libraries. Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration was used to concentrate bacterial communities from 40l of tap water collected at 12 different times during three different summer months from a single point-of-use. Total RNA was extracted from the microbial concentrates and used to develop 16S rRNA-based clone libraries. Phylogenetic analyses of 1231 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that difficult-to-classify bacterial sequences were the most predominant clones, representing 57.6% of the sequences analyzed. Within these unclassified clades, most sequences were closely related to sequences retrieved from previous DNA- and RNA-based drinking water studies. Other bacterial groups represented in this study included Proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Overall, the results suggest that these bacterial groups are amongst potentially active bacteria in drinking water. Diversity analyses of clones generated show that while overall diversity is similar amongst the different months, membership changes with respect to time. The results from this study further improve our understanding of the molecular diversity and bacterial population dynamics of drinking water microbial communities. Moreover, these results provide the sequence foundation for the development of molecular assays that target active drinking water bacteria.


Genetic influences on the cognitive biases associated with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents.

The use of viral vectors in introducing genes into agricultural animal species. The use of viral vectors is a method for introducing foreign genes into various animal species. Vectors based on retro-, adeno-, flavi-, and parvoviruses have been used for research in animal species of agricultural importance, such as chickens, quail, swine, cows, goats, sheep, fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Viral vectors allow for efficient transgenic integration into host genome or for transient expression of the transgenic construct in somatic tissues. Because of that, viral vectors are important tools for research and potentially other biotechnology applications such as improving animal production qualities and introducing disease resistance, thus improving food quality and safety. Other uses may include generating animal models of human diseases and using animals as bioreactors for production of therapeutic proteins. Each vector type provides a unique set of advantages and limitations, which are in some cases specific to an animal species or a method of introduction. This article discusses viral vector characteristics and potential applications in agriculturally important animal species. It discusses advantages and disadvantages of using viral vectors in genetic engineering of agricultural animals.

Delayed reopening of a hemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale after left lung transplantation: emergency management. We report the case of a man who underwent a left-lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis and who developed deterioration of his respiratory condition at Day 16 post-operatively, with marked hypoxemia not explained by the usual early respiratory complications of lung transplantation. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography identified a patent foramen ovale with massive spontaneous right-to-left shunting. As for the pathogenesis of this right-to-left shunting, we found no evidence supporting an elevation of right-side pressures, with the redirection of the inferior vena cava flow toward the patent foramen ovale being the suspected mechanism. We conclude that delayed reopening of the patent foramen ovale leading to massive right-to-left shunting is a possible complication after lung transplantation.

Endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for re-staging rectal cancer after radiotherapy. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of two imaging techniques, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. And we compared EUS and MRI data with histological findings from surgical specimens. Thirty-nine consecutive patients (51.3% Male; mean age: 68.2 +/- 8.9 years) with histologically confirmed distal rectal cancer were examined for staging. All patients underwent EUS and MRI imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. After neoadjuvant chemoradiation, EUS and MRI correctly classified 46% (18/39) and 44% (17/39) of patients, respectively, in line with their histological T stage (P > 0.05). These proportions were higher for both techniques when nodal involvement was considered: 69% (27/39) and 62% (24/39). When patients were sorted into T and N subgroups, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS was better than MRI for patients with T0-T2 (44% vs 33%, P > 0.05) and N0 disease (87% vs 52%, P = 0.013). However, MRI was more accurate than EUS in T and N staging for patients with more advanced disease after radiotherapy, though these differences did not reach statistical significance. EUS and MRI are accurate imaging techniques for staging rectal cancer. However, after neoadjuvant RT-CT, the role of both methods in the assessment of residual rectal tumors remains uncertain.

Genomics of heart failure. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in men and women, and heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Most common forms of HF are non-mendelian and the evidence for heritability is modest. Study of the genetic susceptibility to HF has been limited to patients with rare familial forms of HF and candidate gene association studies in patients with distinct subtypes of HF. However, with the completion of the human genome project and the development of the HapMap template, new large-scale genome-wide association studies are possible. This article reviews the status of these and other important developments in genomics, in particular genome-wide sequencing, and other "omics".

Role of telomere length in subtelomeric gene expression and its possible relation to cellular senescence.

Cinnamon extract regulates plasma levels of adipose-derived factors and expression of multiple genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenesis in adipose tissue of fructose-fed rats. We reported earlier that dietary cinnamon extract (CE) improves systemic insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia by enhancing insulin signaling. In the present study, we have examined the effects of CE on several biomarkers including plasma levels of adipose-derived adipokines, and the potential molecular mechanisms of CE in epididymal adipose tissue (EAT). In Wistar rats fed a high-fructose diet (HFD) to induce insulin resistance, supplementation with a CE (Cinnulin PF, 50 mg/kg daily) for 8 weeks reduced blood glucose, plasma insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, chylomicron-apoB48, VLDL-apoB100, and soluble CD36. CE also inhibited plasma retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) levels. CE-induced increases in plasma adiponectin were not significant. CE did not affect food intake, bodyweight, and EAT weight. In EAT, there were increases in the insulin receptor ( IR) and IR substrate 2 ( IRS2) mRNA, but CE-induced increases in mRNA expression of IRS1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, AKT1, glucose transporters 1 and 4 , and glycogen synthase 1 expression and decreased trends in mRNA expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta were not statistically significant. CE also enhanced the mRNA levels of ADIPOQ, and inhibited sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA levels. mRNA and protein levels of fatty acid synthase and FABP4 were inhibited by CE and RBP4, and CD36 protein levels were also decreased by CE. These results suggest that CE effectively ameliorates circulating levels of adipokines partially mediated via regulation of the expression of multiple genes involved in insulin sensitivity and lipogenesis in the EAT.


Daily consumption of milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduces cell adhesion molecules in healthy children.

Enhanced algal CO(2) sequestration through calcite deposition by Chlorella sp. and Spirulina platensis in a mini-raceway pond. Biological CO(2) sequestration using algal reactors is one of the most promising and environmentally benign technologies to sequester CO(2). This research study was taken up to alleviate certain limitations associated with the technology such as low CO(2) sequestration efficiency and low biomass yields. The study demonstrates an increase in CO(2) sequestration efficiency by maneuvering chemically aided biological sequestration of CO(2). Chlorella sp. and Spirulina platensis showed 46% and 39% mean fixation efficiency, respectively, at input CO(2) concentration of 10%. The effect of acetazolamide, a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, on CO(2) sequestration efficiency was studied to demonstrate the role of carbonic anhydrase in calcite deposition. Calcite formed by both species was characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled electron dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The overall scheme of calcite deposition coupled CO(2) fixation with commercially utilizable biomass as a product seems a viable option in the efforts to sequester increasing CO(2) emissions.

Cross immunity of DNA vaccine pVAX1-cSZ2-IL-2 to Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix and E. maxima. The study describes cross protection experiments with chimeric DNA vaccine pVAX1-cSZ2-IL-2 to determine its efficacy against four important Eimeria species. Seven-day-old chickens were randomly divided into nine groups; group 1 negative control, groups 2, 3, 4, 5 positive controls; and groups 6, 7, 8 and 9 experimental groups. On days 7 and 14, groups 1-5 were injected with TE buffer, and groups 6-9 with the vaccine. At 21 days of age, all chickens were inoculated with 5 x 10(4) sporulated oocysts except for the negative control. Groups 2 and 6 were inoculated with Eimeria tenella, groups 3 and 7 with Eimerianecatrix, groups 4 and 8 with Eimeria acervulina and groups 5 and 9 with Eimeria maxima. Seven days later, all chickens were weighed and slaughtered to obtain intestinal samples. Efficacy of immunization was evaluated on the basis of oocyst decrease ratio, lesion score, body-weight gain and anti-coccidial index. The results indicated that the recombinant plasmid can induce host immune responses by alleviating intestinal lesions, body weight loss and oocyst ratio and imparting good protection against E. tenella and E.acervulina, medium protection against E. necatrix but little effect against E. maxima. It is concluded that the conserved antigen can provide cross protection and should be explored further.

Protective effects of beta-carotene against the genotoxicity of doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster.

Effectiveness of five insecticides for the control of adults and young stages of Cacopsylla melanoneura (Förster) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in a semi-field trial. Cacopsylla melanoneura (Förster) is a vector of Candidatus Phytoplasma mali, the causal agent of one of the most serious diseases in European apple orchards, apple proliferation (AP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of five insecticides from different chemical groups (carbamates, chitin inhibitors, insect growth regulators, organophosphates and pyrethroids) towards overwintered adults and young stages of C. melanoneura under semi-field conditions. The organophosphate chlorpyrifos and the pyrethroid etofenprox caused higher mortality of overwintered adults than diflubenzuron, fenoxycarb and abamectin, with mortality values exceeding 90%. All the pesticides tested reduced the number of progeny per female and, except for abamectin, were highly effective against young stages, with a long-lasting effect. An integrated management of the vector is currently required to prevent the spread of AP. The reference insecticides, chlorpyrifos and etofenprox, have a strong toxicity and persistence against all stages of the vector. In apple orchard IPM programmes, the chitin inhibitors and the insect growth regulators could be part of an alternative and more sustainable strategy for the control of C. melanoneura owing to their effectiveness against immature stages.

Evidence for thyroid endocrine disruption in wild fish in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Relationships to contaminant exposures. It is well documented that many coastal and estuarine environments adjacent to developed and industrialized urban centers, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, are significantly contaminated by anthropogenic chemicals. However, it is not well understood to what extent existing contaminants, many with continuing inflows into the environment, may impact exposed wildlife. This study provided an initial characterization of thyroid endocrine-related effects and their relationship to accumulated contaminants in two indigenous fish species sampled from different San Franicsco Bay Area study sites. Plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4) were significantly reduced in fish sampled from highly impacted locations such as Oakland Inner Harbor and San Leandro Bay as compared with fish from other locations representing relatively lower human impact, including Bodega Bay, Redwood City and a remote site on Santa Catalina Island. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels also varied significantly by location, with differing T3/T4 ratios in fish from some locations suggestive of altered peripheral deiodinase activity. The changes in thyroid endocrine parameters were significantly correlated with hepatic concentrations of certain environmental contaminants. A large number of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, both co-planar (dioxin-like) and non-co-planar, exhibited significant inverse correlations with T4 levels in the fish, while in contrast, T3 and T3/T4 ratio were positively correlated with PCB exposures. The positive correlation between T3/T4 ratio and PCBs supports the hypothesis that environmental PCBs may alter T4 deiodination or turnover, actions of PCBs reported in laboratory experiments. Some relationships between chlorinated pesticides including DDT and chlordanes, but fewer relationships with PAHs, were also observed. Together, these findings indicate that the thyroid endocrine system is exhibiting alterations associated with different aquatic environments in the San Francisco Bay Area, which are significantly related to current-day exposures of the fish to contaminant chemicals such as PCBs.


Impact of an extension tube on operator radiation exposure during coronary procedures performed through the radial approach.

Manual response preparation disrupts spatial attention: an electrophysiological investigation of links between action and attention. Previous behavioural and neuroscience studies have shown that the systems involved in the control of attention and action are functionally and anatomically linked. We used behavioural and event-related brain potential measures to investigate whether such links are mandatory or merely optional. Cues presented at the start of each trial instructed participants to shift attention to the left or right side and to simultaneously prepare to a finger movement with their left or right hand. In different trials, cues were followed by a central Go signal, requiring execution of the prepared manual response (motor task), or by a peripheral visual stimulus, which required a target-non-target discrimination only when presented on the cued side (attention task). Lateralised ERP components indicative of covert attention shifts were found when attention and action were directed to the same side (same side condition), but not when attention and action were directed to opposite sides (opposite sides condition). Likewise, effects of spatial attention on the processing of peripheral visual stimuli were present only when attention and action were directed to the same side, but not in the opposite sides condition. These results demonstrate that preparing a manual response on one side severely disrupts the attentional selection of visual stimuli on the other side, and suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously direct attention and action to different locations in space. They support the hypothesis that the control of spatial attention and action are implemented by shared brain circuits, and are therefore linked in a mandatory fashion.

Adsorption behavior of EE2 (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol) onto the inactivated sewage sludge: kinetics, thermodynamics and influence factors. The adsorption behavior of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) onto inactivated sludge was investigated to assess the function of adsorption on EE(2) removal in activated sludge system. The adsorption equilibrium of EE(2) can be achieved in 5.0 h at the research temperature and the adsorption process could be well described by pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium data at different temperatures were fitted by a linear regression. The thermodynamics analysis revealed that EE(2) adsorption onto inactivated sludge was spontaneous (Delta G=-15.18 to -16.35 kJ/mol), enthalpy-driven (Delta H=-27.2 kJ/mol), entropy-retarded (DeltaS=-39.18 J/(mol K)), and mainly physical adsorption. Effects of pH, ionic strength and coexisting organic matters (methanol and bisphenol A) on EE(2) adsorption onto inactivated sludge were also examined. The amounts of EE(2) equilibrium adsorption ability were unchanged as the pH values increasing from 2.0 to 6.0, but decreased from 2.14 to 1.43 mg/g MLSS when the initial EE(2) concentration was 5.0mg/L as pH above 6.0. The adsorption capacities were first increased from 2.19 to 2.50mg/g MLSS, then sharply decreased and stabilized at 1.12 mg/g MLSS during the ionic strength was adjusted from 0 to 1 mol/L. Methanol (0.4-5%, v/v) and bisphenol A (0-200mg/L) in the mixed liquor can decrease the adsorption capacity of EE(2) from 2.19 to 1.39 and 0.75 mg/g MLSS, respectively.

Comparative deacetylase activity of wild type and mutants of SIRT1. SIRT1, human ortholog of yeast SIR2 protein, deacetylates histones and several other transcription factors. Recently, SIRT1 has emerged as a drug target for treating age related diseases, type II diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammation and cancer. Here, we have optimized production of functionally active wild type full-length SIRT1 protein and its N-terminal deleted mutants. In a comparative study, we found that the region containing 192-208 amino acids towards the N-terminus is critical for right conformational folding of the protein to retain its deacetylase activity. The EC(50) and IC(50) values obtained with standard modulators showed that the SRT(748) & SRT(556) can deacetylate substrate and are activated by resveratrol, whereas, deacetylase activity of all the other deletion mutants (SRT(540), SRT(532), SRT(507) and SRT(503)) was lost. We further report that the peptide substrate K(m) for SRT(748) (70+/-5.2 microM) was comparable to SRT(556) (93+/-5.4 microM). The K(m) for NAD(+) substrate was 176 & 274 microM for SRT(748) and SRT(556), respectively. Similar substrate affinity studies demonstrate that either of the protein (SRT(748) or SRT(556)) can be utilized for screening SIRT1 modulators. We have also examined critical regions in SIRT1 required for deacetylase activity as well as kinetic analyses of SIRT1 proteins.

A primer for nurses on advancing health reform policy. Health care reform is a high priority on the federal policy agenda. The authors present insights from their experiences as Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows working in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and on the House Committee on Ways and Means. Nursing has many opportunities at this juncture to engage in policy discussions and advance solutions for issues related to increasing quality and access while dampening the escalating cost of care. Strategies where nursing's voice can inform reform conversations include chronic disease management, prevention and health promotion, community-based care, nurse-managed care, interdisciplinary education, safety and quality, use of health information technology, and testing the comparative effectiveness of interventions and delivery systems.

Laminin gamma2 fragments are increased in the circulation of patients with early phase acute lung injury. Laminin-5, a cell adhesive molecule expressed solely by epithelium, is known to enhance epithelial cell migration and repair of injured epithelium, after its essential component gamma2-chain is processed proteolytically. Our previous study revealed circulating levels of amino-terminal fragment of laminin gamma2-chain (G2F) reflect epithelial tumor invasiveness in carcinoma patients, but its physiological role in alveolar epithelial injury remains unknown. Sampling of epithelial lining fluids or pulmonary edema fluids from patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or related diseases was performed. Plasma samples were obtained from them at the time of disease onset or later. G2F concentrations were determined by immunoassay constructed by ourselves. We found a significantly higher amount of G2F in pulmonary edema and epithelial lining fluids of patients with ALI, as compared with those with the other respiratory diseases. Their plasma levels were also elevated significantly early at the onset of ALI (mean +/- SD; 147 +/- 82 ng/ml in non-surviving and 90 +/- 56 in surviving patients) as compared with those in the patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (59 +/- 36) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (37 +/- 17), indicating alveolar epithelium rapidly secrete laminin-5 in ALI. At 5 days after onset, non-surviving patients maintained higher plasma concentrations (152 +/- 84), but in contrast, the levels in surviving patients declined (71 +/- 35), suggesting secretion of laminin-5 was suppressed, associated with recovery from ALI. Circulating G2F may be a biomarker for alveolar laminin-5 secreted early at disease onset in ALI, potentially regulating alveolar re-epithelialization.

Airway responsiveness and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid profiling in individual rats: effects of different ovalbumin exposures. We studied repeatedly the development of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in rats undergoing different modes of ovalbumin exposures. Treatment was two intraperitoneal injections of ovalbumin in Groups 1-3, followed by one ovalbumin aerosolization in Groups 2 and 3, while rats in Group 4 received repeated ovalbumin aerosols after one single intraperitoneal injection. BHR was assessed longitudinally on day 0 (before treatment) and on day 14 (Groups 1 and 2) or 20 (Groups 3 and 4) and cellular influx was estimated from BALF. No BHR or change in BALF cellular profile was detected in Groups 1-3. However, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, associated with BHR (PC(100) 8.9+/-1.3 microg/kg vs. 4.2+/-1.1 microg/kg), was observed in Group 4. The BHR was always associated with increased number of eosinophils in the BALF. The substantial interindividual variability confirmed the need for a technique that permits follow-up of lung responsiveness and BALF profile. This approach evidenced strong associations between the severity of BHR and the eosinophilia.

Choroidal vitiligo masquerading as large choroidal nevus: a report of four cases. To describe 4 patients with choroidal vitiligo masquerading as large choroidal nevus. Retrospective chart review. Observational case series of 4 patients. Retrospective chart review. Clinical features. Four patients referred with the diagnosis of large choroidal nevus were found to have unilateral (n = 1) or bilateral (n = 3) extensive patchy choroidal depigmentation classified as choroidal vitiligo. There was no evidence of choroidal nevus, and the pigmented "lesion" proved to be normal choroidal pigment surrounded by a region of pigment absence (vitiligo). There was no evidence of ocular inflammation or related retinal or retinal pigment epithelial changes. The choroidal vitiligo was clinically flat and measured 12 to 24 mm diameter, involving the post-equatorial fundus in all cases. There were no related anterior segment abnormalities. Cutaneous vitiligo was present in all cases. There was no documented progression of the choroidal or cutaneous vitiligo over a maximum 2-year follow-up. Choroidal vitiligo is an idiopathic benign process that can involve large segments of the posterior choroid, leaving only patches of residual choroidal pigment, simulating, in reverse, a large choroidal nevus. The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

Management of left ventricular free wall rupture under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. This is a case report of a patient with left ventricular free wall rupture after acute myocardial infarction that was managed successfully with the use of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit for resuscitation, surgical repair and postoperative circulatory support. Conversion to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass for surgical repair was avoided. Decompression of the left ventricle during the postoperative period promotes myocardial recovery and leads to improved fixation of surgical repair.

Pulmonary rehabilitation: an historical perspective. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a standard of care for patients with chronic lung disease. Through appropriate patient selection and assessment, exercise training, educational and psychosocial intervention, nutritional counseling, and breathing retraining, many benefits (e.g., reduction in level of dyspnea, improvement in exercise tolerance, improvement in health-related quality of life, and reduction in health care resource utilization) are gained by patients who have undergone rehabilitation. From the initial finding of improved patient's capabilities, to times of extreme skepticism and doubt, to the state of being a standard of care, pulmonary rehabilitation has undergone many periods of transformation over the last several decades. This review expands upon previous reviews of the history behind modern-day pulmonary rehabilitation.

[Determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phosphorus in seafoods by ion chromatography]. A method for the determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phosphorus in seafoods by ion chromatography (IC) was developed. The samples for the determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate were extracted by 100 mmol/L NaOH solution at room temperature; the samples for the determination of total phosphorus were digested by incineration at high temperature; and then solid phase extraction (SPE) column was used to eliminate the interferences. The separation was carried out on an IonPac AS11-HC analytical column (250 mm x 4 mm) and an IonPac AG11-HC guard column (50 mm x 4 mm) using 30 - 80 mmol/L KOH gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 35 degrees C, coupled with a suppressor-type conductivity detector. Under optimum conditions, the measurement could be completed within 20 min. The effects of pH value, organic solvent and coexisted ions were investigated. The linear range was 0.3 -60 mg/L, the detection limits were from 2.1 mg/kg to 2.3 mg/kg, and the relative standard deviations were from 1.6% to 2.6%. The method was applied to the determination of anions in fish and shrimps with the recoveries of 81.8% - 100.0%. The method offered high selectivity, sensitivity, and gave a satisfactory results for real sample analysis.

The possible evidence for an epidemiological transition hypothesis for elderly suicides. An epidemiological transition hypothesis has been developed to explain simultaneously wide cross-national variations in elderly suicide rates, trends over time for elderly suicide rates and age-associated trends in suicides rates. This speculative hypothesis suggests that there is a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) relationship between elderly suicide rates and socioeconomic status fitting the quadratic equation y = a + bx - cx2 (where y is the suicide rate, x is the socioeconomic status, and a, b and c are constants). The predicted curvilinear relationship between elderly suicide rates and gross national domestic product (GDP), a measure of socioeconomic status, fitting the above quadratic equation was examined with a curve estimation regression model using data from the World Health Organization. The relationship between suicide rates in both sexes in the age-bands 65-74 and 75+ years and the GDP was curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) and fitted the above quadratic equation, and was statistically significant (at least p<0.05) in all four groups. Caution should be exercised in accepting this model of the epidemiological transition hypothesis for elderly suicide rates because it is generated from cross-sectional data using an ecological design. Ideally, this model requires rigorous testing by following selected countries of low socioeconomic status over time as they develop socioeconomically.

Periodontitis associated with tobacco smoking among rural Khon Kaen Thai males: analysis of two data sets. Periodontitis is a common disease-related reason for tooth extraction. Although several studies have related tobacco smoking to periodontitis among other populations, not many investigations concerning the relationship between tobacco smoking and periodontitis among rural northeastern Thai people have been conducted although tobacco smoking is a common practice among these Thai people. The present study used two existing data sets to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking and periodontitis among rural Khon Kaen Thai males. Cross-sectional analytic study. The study populations for phase I and phase II comprised a total of 625 males, aged 30-89 years, residing in five districts of Khon Kaen province, Thailand during 1990-91 and 1,218 males, aged 33-86 years, residing in Chonnabot district, Khon Kaen province, Thailand during 1992-94, respectively. The data were obtained through oral examination and interview. The analyses employed descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression. Findings from final multivariable logistic regression models identified tobacco smoking as a risk indicator for periodontitis in the presence of several factors in the final models including age, gingival bleeding, debris deposits, and missing teeth. It is evident that tobacco smoking is a risk indicator for periodontitis and that tobacco smoking, which is directly associated with periodontitis among these populations, could enhance the possibility of increasing periodontitis and tooth extraction. Therefore, targeted interventions aimed at encouraging people to quit smoking tobacco would help in maintain favorable oral health.

Neuronal network pharmacodynamics of GABAergic modulation in the human cortex determined using pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. Neuronal network oscillations are a unifying phenomenon in neuroscience research, with comparable measurements across scales and species. Cortical oscillations are of central importance in the characterization of neuronal network function in health and disease and are influential in effective drug development. Whilst animal in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology is able to characterize pharmacologically induced modulations in neuronal activity, present human counterparts have spatial and temporal limitations. Consequently, the potential applications for a human equivalent are extensive. Here, we demonstrate a novel implementation of contemporary neuroimaging methods called pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. This approach determines the spatial profile of neuronal network oscillatory power change across the cortex following drug administration and reconstructs the time course of these modulations at focal regions of interest. As a proof of concept, we characterize the nonspecific GABAergic modulator diazepam, which has a broad range of therapeutic applications. We demonstrate that diazepam variously modulates theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-14 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency oscillations in specific regions of the cortex, with a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with that of drug uptake. We examine the relevance of these results with regard to the spatial and temporal observations from other modalities and the various therapeutic consequences of diazepam and discuss the potential applications of such an approach in terms of drug development and translational neuroscience.

Content validity and satisfaction with a stroke caregiver intervention program. Establishing evidence of content validity and satisfaction is an integral part of intervention research. The purpose of this article is to describe content validity and satisfaction relative to the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK), an 8-week follow-up program based on individualized assessment of stroke caregiver needs. The TASK intervention enables caregivers to develop skills based on assessment of their own needs. During the development of the TASK program, 10 experts rated the validity of the TASK intervention components for accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, and problem relevance. After incorporating feedback from the experts, a randomized controlled clinical trial was instituted using a convenience sample of 40 stroke caregivers to determine satisfaction (usefulness, ease of use, and acceptability) with the TASK intervention (n=21) compared with an attention control group (n=19). Data collection occurred between March 2005 and June 2006. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t tests, and content analysis. Expert ratings on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being strongly agree, provided evidence of content validity (accuracy 4.71, feasibility 4.46, acceptability 4.40, problem relevance 4.67). Caregivers in the TASK group scored significantly higher than the attention control group on all satisfaction measures (usefulness p=.02; ease of use p=.02; acceptability p=.05). Qualitative comments from caregivers provided further evidence of satisfaction. Evidence of content validity and user satisfaction for the TASK intervention relative to an attention control group was found. The TASK program may be a viable telephone-based program that can be implemented by nurses to support family caregivers during the first few months after stroke survivors are discharged home.

The effect of topography of polymer surfaces on platelet adhesion. In this study, the effect of surface topography on fibrinogen and platelet adsorption was investigated. High aspect ratio surface features, in the submicron to nanometer range, were constructed on the poly- (lactic-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA) films. The topographic surfaces were fabricated by solvent-mediated polymer casting on a master template. Fibrinogen adsorption and platelets adhesion on these topographic surfaces were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay respectively, while the activation of platelets was quantified by flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) tagging. The lowest fibrinogen adsorption amount and platelet activity was observed on surfaces with specific topographical features in the submicron range with a significant reduction in adhesion when compared to the pristine PLGA films. The topographical parameters found to induce low levels of fibrinogen adsorption and platelet response were high aspect ratio structures (>3:1) with reduced interspacing (<200 nm) or high density. The results signify that topographical manipulation of thrombogenic surfaces of biodegradable polymers is a feasible approach for reducing their thrombogenicity.

Protective effects of [Gly14]-Humanin on beta-amyloid-induced PC12 cell death by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is considered as an early event in AD pathology. Humanin (HN) and its derivative, [Gly14]-Humanin (HNG), are known for their ability to suppress neuronal death induced by AD-related insults in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of HNG on Abeta(25-35)-induced toxicity and its potential mechanisms in PC12 cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to 25 microM Abeta(25-35) caused significant viability loss and cell apoptosis. In addition, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cytochrome c releases from mitochondria were also observed after Abeta(25-35) exposure. All these effects induced by Abeta(25-35) were markedly reversed by HNG. Pretreatment with 100 nM HNG 6h prior to Abeta(25-35) exposure significantly elevated cell viability, reduced Abeta(25-35)-induced cell apoptosis, stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, HNG also ameliorated the Abeta(25-35)-induced Bcl-2/Bax ratio reduction and decreased caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells. These results demonstrate that HNG could attenuate Abeta(25-35)-induced PC12 cell injury and apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the protective effect of HNG against Abeta(25-35).

Transnasal transesophageal echocardiography in the detection of left atrial thrombus. The widespread use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is limited by disadvantages, including patient intolerance and increased medical costs. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of transnasal TEE in the detection of possible embolic sources in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or stroke, using an ultrathin TEE probe. Sixty-two patients with AF and/or stroke underwent transnasal TEE without conscious sedation. The presence or the absence of the following parameters was evaluated: left atrial (LA) thrombus; LA spontaneous echocardiographic contrast; intraatrial shunts; and aortic plaque. The insertion of a TEE probe was successful in 52 (84%) patients. TEE found LA thrombus in 10 (19%) patients and other embolic sources in 4 (8%) patients. Two (4%) patients had mild epistaxis. This study demonstrated that the use of transnasal TEE was feasible and safe in the detection of LA thrombus in patients with AF and/or stroke.

Incidence and predictors of silent embolic cerebral infarction following diagnostic coronary angiography. Coronary angiography (CAG) is an invasive diagnostic procedure, which could lead to procedure related complications. One of the well known post-procedural complications is cerebral embolic infarction with or without symptoms. Silent embolic cerebral infarction (SECI) has clinical significance because it can progress to a decline in cognitive function and increase the risk of dementia in the long term. The aim of this study was to detect the incidence and predictors of SECI after diagnostic CAG using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). A total of 197 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent DW-MRI for evaluation of intracranial vasculopathy before coronary artery bypass graft surgery were retrospectively enrolled in the present study. DW-MRI was performed within 48 h after diagnostic CAG. SECI was diagnosed as presence of focal bright high signal intensity in DW-MRI. Patients were divided into groups according to presence/absence of SECI (+ SECI vs. - SECI, respectively). The clinical and angiographic characteristics were analyzed and independent predictors were evaluated. Of the 197 patients, SECI occurred in 20 patients (10.2%) after diagnostic CAG. Age, female gender, frequency of underlying atrial fibrillation, extent of coronary disease, and fluoroscopic time during diagnostic CAG were not different between the + SECI and - SECI groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in the + SECI group than in the - SECI group (45.9 ± 8.5% vs. 51.4 ± 13.1%, p=0.014) and performance rate of internal mammary artery (IMA) angiography was significantly higher in the + SECI group compared with the - SECI group (85% vs. 37.2%, p<0.001). By multivariate analysis, performing IMA angiography was the only predictor of SECI (OR=14.642; 95% CI=3.201 to 66.980, p=0.001). The incidence of SECI after diagnostic CAG was not infrequent. Diagnostic CAG with IMA angiography may increase the risk of SECI.

Dysregulation of corticosterone secretion in streptozotocin-diabetic rats: modulatory role of the adrenocortical nitrergic system. An increased activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in exaggerated glucocorticoid secretion has been repeatedly described in patients with diabetes mellitus and in animal models of this disease. However, it has been pointed out that experimental diabetes is accompanied by a decreased glucocorticoid response to ACTH stimulation. Because previous studies from our laboratory demonstrate the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the modulation of corticosterone production, present investigations were designed to evaluate 1) the impact of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on the adrenocortical nitrergic system and 2) the role of NO in the modulation of adrenal steroidogenesis in STZ-diabetic rats. Four weeks after STZ injection, increased activity and expression levels of proteins involved in L-arginine transport and in NO synthesis were detected, and increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, carbonyl adducts, and nitrotyrosine-modified proteins were measured in the adrenocortical tissue of hyperglycemic rats. An impaired corticosterone response to ACTH was evident both in vivo and in adrenocortical cells isolated from STZ-treated animals. Inhibition of NO synthase activity resulted in higher corticosterone generation in adrenal tissue from STZ-treated rats. Moreover, a stronger inhibition of steroid output from adrenal cells by a NO donor was observed in adrenocortical Y1 cells previously subjected to high glucose (30 mM) treatment. In summary, results presented herein indicate an inhibitory effect of endogenously generated NO on steroid production, probably potentiated by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, in the adrenal cortex of STZ-treated rats.

Membrane permeability in the gastrointestinal tract: the interplay between microclimate pH and transporters. Some examples of pH- and transporter-dependent permeability, determined in side-by-side diffusion cells, are summarized. We investigated the polarized transport in the mucosal-to-serosal direction of monocarboxylic acid-type drugs through the excised rat jejunal tissue and an artificial membrane. We established that, in vitro, these substances are most probably not transported by monocarboxylate transporter 1, but by passive pH-dependent transport. We also studied various influences on the permeability of fluorescein, a low permeability marker, through isolated rat intestinal segments, Caco-2 cell monolayers, and an artificial membrane. Polarized transport of fluorescein in the serosal-to-mucosal direction through the rat jejunum by multidrug resistance-associated protein was triggered by the addition of D-glucose to the mucosal side, while the pH-dependent increase of fluorescein influx is presumably the consequence of a monocarboxylate transporter and a member of the organic-anion transporting polypeptide family. With permeability experiments through the excised segments of rat small intestine, we ascertained that ciprofloxacin is a low-permeability drug and has higher and pH-dependent transport in the mucosal-to-serosal direction than in the opposite direction. We also established that neither the permeability of fluoroquinolones nor their solubility in different buffers was influenced by the interactions with metal cations.

Protease and helicase activities of hepatitis C virus genotype 4, 5, and 6 NS3-NS4A proteins. The bifunctional NS3 protease-helicase of hepatitis C virus (HCV), together with its cofactor protein NS4A, is an important target for antiviral drugs which can cure HCV infections. HCV strains are divided into six major genotypes based on sequence diversity, and the great majority of reports on NS3 have focused exclusively on genotype 1 proteins. Here we report the cloning, expression, and preliminary characterization of NS3-NS4A gene products from HCV genotypes 4, 5, and 6. This work complements our earlier characterization of genotype 2 and 3 proteins [17]. We compare NS3-NS4A protease and helicase activities of genotypes 4a, 5a, and 6a to those of common reference strains Con1 (genotype 1b) and JFH1 (genotype 2a). The specific activities of the proteases of the newly isolated proteins were similar to those of the reference proteins. Furthermore, the reference inhibitor BILN 2061 had similar activity against all of the proteins except for that of JFH1, which had an apparent K(i) that was 11-fold higher relative to Con1. RNA and DNA unwinding activities were also similar for genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 proteins, but significantly higher for genotype 2 JFH1. With the availability of these proteins, inhibitors developed based on their activity against genotype 1 can be tested against all the other major genotypes, providing a path to improved treatment for all HCV patients.

The effects of stress on play and home cage behaviors in adolescent male rats. One prominent feature of adolescence is the high frequency of social behaviors, such as play. Engaging in these behaviors appears necessary for proper socio-emotional development as social isolation during adolescence typically leads to behavioral dysfunctions in adulthood. The present experiments examined the effects of stress on social and nonsocial behaviors in group housed adolescent male rats. We found that acute restraint stress led to a complete inhibition of play (e.g., nape contacts and pins) and reduced social investigations in pre- (28 days), mid- (35 days), and late-adolescent (42 and 49 days) animals. A follow-up study, however, found that restraint-induced suppression of play and social investigations was transient such that experimental animals engage in these behaviors at levels similar to those of controls 1 hr after termination of the stressor. We also found that exposure to repeated restraint stress throughout adolescence led to a decrease in social investigations, while leaving play largely unaffected. Interestingly, in all of the experiments, nonsocial behaviors (e.g., eating, drinking, grooming) were unaffected by restraint, suggesting these effects of stress are specific to social behaviors. Together, these data indicate that both acute and repeated stress significantly affect social behaviors during adolescence.

The postischemic environment differentially impacts teratoma or tumor formation after transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors. Risk of tumorigenesis is a major obstacle to human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy. Likely linked to the stage of differentiation of the cells at the time of implantation, formation of teratoma/tumors can also be influenced by factors released by the host tissue. We have analyzed the relative effects of the stage of differentiation and the postischemic environment on the formation of adverse structures by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors. Four differentiation stages were identified on the basis of quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression of pluripotency, proliferation, and differentiation markers. Neural progenitors were transplanted at these 4 stages into rats with no, small, or large middle cerebral artery occlusion lesions. The fate of each transplant was compared with their pretransplantation status 1 to 4 months posttransplantation. The influence of the postischemic environment was limited to graft survival and occurrence of nonneuroectodermal structures after transplantation of very immature neural progenitors. Both effects were lost with differentiation. We identified a particular stage of differentiation characterized in vitro by a rebound of proliferative activity that produced highly proliferative grafts susceptible to threaten surrounding host tissues. The effects of the ischemic environment on the formation of teratoma by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors are limited to early differentiation stages that will likely not be used for stem cell therapy. In contrast, hyperproliferation observed at later stages of differentiation corresponds to an intrinsic activity that should be monitored to avoid tumorigenesis.

Protection of human corneal epithelial cells from hypoxia-induced disruption of barrier function by hepatocyte growth factor. The barrier function of the corneal epithelium maintains corneal homeostasis and is mediated by tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). It is also susceptible to disruption by hypoxia. We have now examined the effects of hypoxia on TJs and AJs as well as on barrier function in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Moreover, we investigated whether such effects of hypoxia might be modulated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The subcellular distribution of the TJ proteins ZO-1 and occludin, the AJ proteins E-cadherin and beta-catenin, and actin filaments was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The abundance of junctional proteins as well as of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was determined by immunoblot analysis. Barrier function was evaluated by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Hypoxia-induced both the disappearance of ZO-1 from the borders of neighboring HCE cells as well as the down-regulation of ZO-1 expression without affecting the distribution or abundance of occludin, E-cadherin, or beta-catenin. It also induced the formation of actin stress fibers, the up-regulation of MLCK expression, and a reduction in the TER of HCE cells. All these effects of hypoxia were inhibited by HGF. Neither hypoxia nor HGF exhibited a mitogenic or cytotoxic effect on HCE cells. HGF thus protects HCE cells from hypoxia-induced disruption of barrier function by maintaining the expression and distribution of ZO-1. Inhibition of the effects of hypoxia on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton might also contribute to this protective action of HGF.

As maternal vaccination is becoming increasingly common, the potential risk of vaccine formulation using ODN adjuvants should be warranted. A recent study performed in mice suggests that exposure to CpG motifs during pregnancy could result (although at very high doses as compared to the ones proposed for human vaccination) in fetal loss and morphological defects. PyNTTTTGT ODNs are immunostimulatory ODNs not bearing CpG motifs, which are very efficient vaccine adjuvants. In this report, we analyzed the potential teratogenic effect of its prototype IMT504 in rats. This animal model was chosen because PyNTTTTGT ODNs are barely active in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of IMT504 at a dose of 20 mg/kg (more than 1000 times higher than the one proposed for a vaccine dose in humans) at day 6 of pregnancy did not produce a significant decrease in the mean number of implanted fetuses or in the number of live pups delivered. Neither the fetuses nor the offspring presented malformations.


Gray matter density in limbic and paralimbic cortices is associated with trauma load and EMDR outcome in PTSD patients.

[Prenatal diagnosis of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome--case report]. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a hereditary, autosomal recessive abnormality of cholesterol metabolism, leading to malformations of multiple organs. It is probably one of the most frequent metabolic disorders but variable clinical presentation makes the diagnosis of the syndrome difficult. The authors of the following work present a case report of prenatal diagnosis of SLOS in fetus with malformations of multiple organs and negative family history.

Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) affects event-related potential measures of novelty processing in autism. In our previous study on individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Sokhadze et al., Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 34:37-51, 2009a) we reported abnormalities in the attention-orienting frontal event-related potentials (ERP) and the sustained-attention centro-parietal ERPs in a visual oddball experiment. These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successful differentiation of target and novel stimuli. In the present study we examine the effects of low-frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on novelty processing as well as behavior and social functioning in 13 individuals with ASD. Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAergic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early and late ERP components. The results of our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTMS as a modulatory tool that altered the disrupted ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in autism. After rTMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli and increased responses to relevant stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses lead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses as was made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that rTMS may prove to be an important research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersensitivity characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.


Long-term cyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and histopathological alterations in Wistar rats.

Qualitative comparison of the cranio-dental osteology of the extant elephants, Elephas Maximus (Asian elephant) and Loxodonta africana (African elephant). Few osteological descriptions of the extant elephants and no detailed morphological comparison of the two genera, Elephas and Loxodonta, have been done in recent years. In this study, 786 specimens of extant elephants (crania, mandibles, and molars) were examined for characters unique to each species. Differences between sexes in each species were described, as well as differences between subspecies of each species. Striking differences in morphology were noted between sexes of both elephants and between subspecies, which may complement current genetic studies, the focus of which is to determine division at the subspecies or species level, particularly differences between the savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis). In addition, examination of the two living elephants provides an excellent dataset for identifying phylogenetic characters for use in examining evolutionary relationships within and between fossil lineages of elephantids.

John Browne (1642-1702): anatomist and plagiarist. In contrast to many other physicians of his age, John Browne (1642-1702), an English anatomist and surgeon, managed to strike a balance in his career that spanned relative obscurity, prestige, and notoriety. Among his more prestigious credits, Browne was Surgeon in Ordinary to King Charles II and William III. He also had numerous publications to his name, some of which are credited as great innovations. His career, however, was tempered by his most important book, which has been critiqued by his contemporaries as well as modern historians as plagiarism. Although Browne undeniably copied the works of others and published them under his name, he was not alone in this practice. Various forms of intellectual thievery were common in Browne's day, and there were many perpetrators. The life of this overlooked figure in the history of anatomy and the stigma attached to him will be examined.

Use of a virtual 3D software for planning of tibial plateau fracture reconstruction. Anatomical reconstruction of tibial plateau fractures is necessary to prevent pain, axial malalignment, knee join instability and posttraumatic arthritis. Computed tomography (CT) with 3D reconstruction is helpful in the accurate preoperative evaluation and reduction planning of the fracture site. The aim of this study was to describe the application of a virtual 3D reconstruction and segmentation software in the preoperative planning of tibial plateau fractures. CT scans of five tibial plateau fractures were preoperatively evaluated using the 3D planning software. Manual colour-coded segmentation was performed. The amount of time required for each planning session was recorded. Successful 3D reconstruction and segmentation was achieved in all cases. The mean time required for 3D virtual planning was 174.8 min (range 69-124 min). The mean time required for 3D virtual planning of B-type fractures was 96.5 min (range 69-124 min; SD=38.891 min; CI=349.421). The mean time required for planning of C-type fractures was 227 min (range 167-294 min; SD=63.789 min; CI=158.460) (Table 1). Successful segmentation was achieved in all cases. The 3D planning capabilities of this software may be a valuable tool for surgeons in learning about the nature of the injury in tibial plateau fracture cases and in formulating an appropriate surgical plan. However, the time requirement for the 3D reconstruction and segmentation analysis may be a current deterrent for its use in the clinical setting.

Understanding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Current intakes of very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are low in most individuals living in Western countries. A good natural source of these fatty acids is seafood, especially oily fish. Fish oil capsules contain these fatty acids also. Very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are readily incorporated from capsules into transport (blood lipids), functional (cell and tissue), and storage (adipose) pools. This incorporation is dose-dependent and follows a kinetic pattern that is characteristic for each pool. At sufficient levels of incorporation, EPA and DHA influence the physical nature of cell membranes and membrane protein-mediated responses, lipid-mediator generation, cell signaling, and gene expression in many different cell types. Through these mechanisms, EPA and DHA influence cell and tissue physiology and the way cells and tissues respond to external signals. In most cases the effects seen are compatible with improvements in disease biomarker profiles or health-related outcomes. As a result, very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids play a role in achieving optimal health and in protection against disease. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids not only protect against cardiovascular morbidity but also against mortality. In some conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis, they may be beneficial as therapeutic agents. On the basis of the recognized health improvements brought about by long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, recommendations have been made to increase their intake. The plant omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), can be converted to EPA, but conversion to DHA appears to be poor in humans. Effects of ALA on human health-related outcomes appear to be due to conversion to EPA, and since this is limited, moderately increased consumption of ALA may be of little benefit in improving health outcomes compared with increased intake of preformed EPA + DHA.

Utilization of rice husk ash as silica source for the synthesis of mesoporous silicas and their application to CO2 adsorption through TREN/TEPA grafting. Mesoporous MCM-41, MCM-48 and SBA-15 were synthesized using Rice husk ash (RHA) as the silica source and their defective Si-OH sites were functionalized by 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTMS) which was subsequently grafted with amine compounds, Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) and Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and BET results of the parent mesoporous silica suggested their closeness of structural properties to those obtained from conventional silica sources. CO(2) adsorption of branched amine TREN and straight chain amine TEPA at 25, 50 and 75 degrees C was obtained by Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA) at atmospheric pressure. TREN grafted mesoporous silica showed 7% of CO(2) adsorption while TEPA grafted mesoporous silicas showed less CO(2) adsorption, which is due to the presence of isolated amine groups in TREN. TREN grafted mesoporous silicas were also observed to be selective towards CO(2), thermally stable and recyclable. The order of CO(2) adsorption with respect to amount of amine grafting was observed to be MCM-48/TREN>MCM-41/TREN>SBA-15/TREN.


Neuroimmune mechanisms of cytokine-induced depression: current theories and novel treatment strategies.

An interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 further delineates the critical region for postaxial polydactyly type A2. Postaxial polydactyly type A2 (PAP-A2; OMIM 602085) is a common feature seen in patients with a partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 13. Dose dependency has been shown for digital malformations in this region, deletions resulting in oligodactyly and duplications in polydactyly. We aimed to narrow down the critical region for PAP-A2 in order to identify candidate genes. We performed chromosomal analysis, FISH and array-CGH in a patient with an interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 and a mild phenotype including postaxial polydactyly. The duplicated region spanned 5.59 Mb (89.67-95.25 Mb) and contained eleven known genes, including GPC5 and GPC6. GPC5 and GPC6 show homology with GPC3 and GPC4, genes involved in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome in which also polydactyly can occur. Mouse studies have shown expression of both GPC5 and GPC6 in developing limbs. Therefore, we propose that GPC5 and GPC6 are the most likely candidate genes for PAP-A2.

Wet-milling transgenic maize seed for fraction enrichment of recombinant subunit vaccine. The production of recombinant proteins in plants continues to be of great interest for prospective large-scale manufacturing of industrial enzymes, nutrition products, and vaccines. This work describes fractionation by wet-milling of transgenic maize expressing the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-B), a potent immunogen and candidate for oral vaccine and vaccine components. The LT-B gene was directed to express in seed by an endosperm specific promoter. Two steeping treatments, traditional steeping (TS, 0.2% SO(2) + 0.5% lactic acid) and water steeping (WS, water only), were evaluated to determine effects on recovery of functional LT-B in wet-milled fractions. The overall recovery of the LT-B protein from WS treatment was 1.5-fold greater than that from TS treatment. In both steeping types, LT-B was distributed similarly among the fractions, resulting in enrichment of functional LT-B in fine fiber, coarse fiber and pericarp fractions by concentration factors of 1.5 to 8 relative to the whole kernels on a per-mass basis. Combined with endosperm-specific expression and secretory pathway targeting, wet-milling enables enrichment of high-value recombinant proteins in low-value fractions, such as the fine fiber, and co-utilization of remaining fractions in alternative industrial applications.

Role of Plasmodium berghei cGMP-dependent protein kinase in late liver stage development. The liver is the first organ infected by Plasmodium sporozoites during malaria infection. In the infected hepatocytes, sporozoites undergo a complex developmental program to eventually generate hepatic merozoites that are released into the bloodstream in membrane-bound vesicles termed merosomes. Parasites blocked at an early developmental stage inside hepatocytes elicit a protective host immune response, making them attractive targets in the effort to develop a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine. Here, we generated parasites blocked at a late developmental stage inside hepatocytes by conditionally disrupting the Plasmodium berghei cGMP-dependent protein kinase in sporozoites. Mutant sporozoites are able to invade hepatocytes and undergo intracellular development. However, they remain blocked as late liver stages that do not release merosomes into the medium. These late arrested liver stages induce protection in immunized animals. This suggests that, similar to the well studied early liver stages, late stage liver stages too can confer protection from sporozoite challenge.

Precocious bilateral hip joint osteoarthritis is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of hereditary haemochromatosis. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip joint is a common disorder, especially in aging peoples of Caucasian descent. Hip OA like OA in other joints is heterogeneous and may manifest in early or late adult life. The aetiology of early onset (precocious) bilateral hip OA is poorly understood, but the clinical and radiological characteristics of this form of OA suggest that chondral resorption due to biochemical or metabolic factors is likely to be of pre-eminent importance. The hip arthropathy which occurs in Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) and the ostensibly idiopathic precocious bilateral concentric form of hip OA are virtually indistinguishable. Accordingly, the possibility exists that the causal factors for these conditions may be very similar. On the basis of this premise and in the light of the finding in a small observational study that HFE gene mutations are very common in precocious bilateral hip OA (100% amongst 8 sequentially collected patients), it is hypothesised that precocious bilateral hip OA is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of HH in which HFE gene mutation mediated articular iron deposition in hip joint tissues may be of pivotal pathogenetic importance. Confirmation of this hypothesis could have implications for the prevention and strategic medical management of this form of OA.

Rodent rhabdomyosarcoma: comparison between total choline concentration at H-MRS and [18F]-fluoromethylcholine uptake at PET using accurate methods for collecting data. To compare choline concentration/amount at proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) and [18F]-fluoromethylcholine (FCH) uptake at positron emission tomography (PET) in a tumour animal model. Twenty-two rats bearing grafted syngenic rhabdomyosarcoma in both thighs were examined on a 3T MR system and on a small animal PET system. Total choline concentration was measured on proton MR spectra using a so-called 'best internal fitting' volume of interest. Choline uptake was expressed as mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV and SUVmax, respectively) and as the percent of injected dose (%ID) after tumour delineation on fused PET-MR images. Data sets were displayed on standard scatter plots. Thirty-six tumours were available for analysis. The area under the curve of the 3.2 ppm choline peak ranged from 69 to 476 (mean, 192) in arbitrary units. Mean SUV values ranged from 0.05 to 0.49 (mean, 0.19) and the %ID from 0.05 to 2.28 (mean, 0.54). Scatter plots failed to reveal quantitative relationship between choline concentration and uptake. Empirically data-driven cut-off lines applied to choline amount (choline concentration x tumour volume) versus choline uptake suggested a paradoxically negative relationship. Total choline concentration did not correlate with FCH uptake in a tumour experimental model. A negative feedback of high values of total choline amount on cellular FCH uptake seemed to be present.

Optimal group-sequential designs for simultaneous testing of superiority and non-inferiority. Confirmatory clinical trials comparing the efficacy of a new treatment with an active control typically aim at demonstrating either superiority or non-inferiority. In the latter case, the objective is to show that the experimental treatment is not worse than the active control by more than a pre-specified non-inferiority margin. We consider two classes of group-sequential designs that combine the superiority and non-inferiority objectives: non-adaptive designs with fixed group sizes and adaptive designs where future group sizes may be based on the observed treatment effect. For both classes, we derive group-sequential designs meeting error probability constraints that have the lowest possible expected sample size averaged over a set of values of the treatment effect. These optimized designs provide an efficient means of reducing expected sample size under a range of treatment effects, even when the separate objectives of proving superiority and non-inferiority would require quite different fixed sample sizes. We also present error spending versions of group-sequential designs that are easily implementable and can handle unpredictable group sizes or information levels. We find the adaptive choice of group sizes to yield some modest efficiency gains; alternatively, expected sample size may be reduced by adding another interim analysis to a non-adaptive group-sequential design.

Cultivation and characterization of canine skin-derived mast cells. It is essential to develop a technique to culture purified skin-derived mast cells (SMCs) to facilitate immunological research on allergic diseases in dogs. This study was performed to develop an efficient culture system for canine SMCs and to characterize the cells in comparison to canine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Enzymatically digested skin biopsy samples were cultivated in serum-free AIM-V medium supplemented with recombinant canine stem cell factor. Three to five weeks after the initiation of culture, mast cells were collected by a magnetic activated cell separation system using anti-c-Kit antibody. The collected cells were composed of a uniform population showing morphological characteristics of mast cells with a round or oval nucleus and abundant toluidine blue-positive metachromatic granules in the cytoplasm. The results of flow cytometric analysis for the presence of cell membrane c-Kit and Fc epsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) indicated that approximately 90% of the cells were mast cells. The cytoplasmic granules were positive for both tryptase and chymase. Apparent dose-dependent degranulation was induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the cells. These cytological and immunological characteristics observed in SMCs were mostly similar to those observed in BMMCs; however, IgE-mediated degranulation was significantly lower in SMCs than BMMCs. The culture system for canine SMCs developed in this study would be useful in understanding the pathophysiology and developing anti-allergic therapeutics in canine allergic dermatitis.

Apoptosis-like change, ROS, and DNA status in cryopreserved canine sperm recovered by glass wool filtration and Percoll gradient centrifugation techniques. The ability of glass wool filtration (GWF) and Percoll density gradient centrifugation (PDGC) to remove spermatozoa with phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation of membrane, high levels of ROS, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by flow cytometry in frozen-thawed canine sperm. Ejaculates from 5 dogs were cryopreserved and thawed. Thawed sperm was processed by GWF and PDGC. Unprocessed, and GWF- and PDGC-processed specimens were assessed by PS translocation (Annexin V [AN]/propidium iodide [PI] assay), intracellular H(2)O(2) level (dichlorofluorescein [DCF]/PI assay), DNA integrity (sperm chromatin structure assay [SCSA]), and conventional sperm parameters. Recovery rate was also evaluated before and after sperm processing. The GWF technique yielded sperm suspensions with improved motility (%), viability (%), normal morphology (%), and membrane integrity (%) (P < 0.05). The GWF technique increased AN-/PI- (alive and non-PS translocated) sperm (%) and the viable sperm recovered by GWF showed low intracellular H(2)O(2) level (P < 0.05). DNA fragmentation was not significantly different among the experimental groups. GWF was superior to PDGC in efficiency of recovering progressively motile, viable, CFDA+/PI- (alive and intact plasmalemma), AN-/PI-, and DCF-/PI- (alive and low H(2)O(2) level) spermatozoa (P < 0.05). These results indicate that cryo-damaged canine sperm can be removed by treatment with GWF after freezing-thawing, and therefore, the GWF technique may be promising for successful ART in frozen-thawed canine sperm.

Identification of human sperm proteins that interact with human zona pellucida3 (ZP3) using yeast two-hybrid system. Sperm proteins that interact with zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) have not been clearly identified in humans. In the present study, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to identify human sperm proteins that interact with human ZP3. Human ZP3 cDNA was cloned into pAS2-1 yeast vector and used as bait to find reactive proteins in the human testis cDNA library. Six specific clones were obtained that were further confirmed for interaction using the mammalian two-hybrid system. These six clones showed homologies with several proteins in the GenBank database. Of these, the strongest ZP3-interacting protein, that shows 97% homology with ubiquitin associated protein-2 like (UBAP2L), was tested in the hemizona assay. UBAP2L antibodies significantly (p<0.001) inhibited human sperm-zona binding in this assay. We conclude that the Y2H system is a useful strategy for identifying novel genes encoding proteins that interact with ZP proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the Y2H system to identify sperm proteins that interact with human oocyte ZP3. Novel proteins identified using this system may find applications in elucidating the fertilization cascade, development of a new generation of non-steroidal contraceptives, and specific diagnosis and treatment of human infertility.

[Post-mortem diagnosis of diabetic crisis in the presence of suspicious findings at the scene]. In Germany, approximately 8 million people suffer from diabetes mellitus, of which over 90% have type 2 diabetes. Worldwide, there are around 246 million people with diabetes mellitus. As diabetes is often symptomless for a long time, around 2.5% of the population have diabetes without knowing it. Diabetic coma is a life-threatening complication, which affects up to 1.2% of all diabetics annually and is associated with a mortality rate of 20-25%. Since in 25% of patients the diabetic coma is the first manifestation of the disease, a valid post-mortem biochemical method for the diagnosis of the metabolic crisis is very important. The article presents cases from the authors' own autopsy material showing that the analysis of the vitreous humour is indispensable for the reconstruction of the events leading to death even in cases in which the cause of death is seemingly clear.

Mechanisms of local immunoresistance in glioma. Even though the central nervous system (CNS) was conventionally defined as "immunologically privileged", new discoveries have demonstrated the role of the immune system in neurologic disease and illness, including gliomas. Brain tumor immunotherapy is an exciting and revived area of research, in which neurosurgeons have taken a major position. Despite the ability to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune response, the challenge to effectively eradicate intracranial gliomas remains mainly because of tumor-induced immunoresistance. This article gives an overview of the immunologic responses that occur in the CNS and their potential role in brain tumors. The main cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate tumor escape from natural immune surveillance are also covered in this article. Glioma cells have been shown to diminish the expression of danger signals necessary for immune activation and to increase the concentration of immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment, which results in T-cell anergy or apoptosis. Finally, the authors discuss most of the over-expressed oncogenic signaling pathways that cause tumor tolerance.

Bilateral obturator hernia with intestinal obstruction: repair with a cigar roll technique. Obturator hernia is an exceedingly rare pelvic hernia that occurs primarily in multiparous, elderly thin (>70 years of age) females.

Vasospastic heart failure: multiple spasm may cause transient heart failure? There have been no reports concerning the correlation between heart failure and coronary artery spasm. From January 2000 to December 2007, 201 patients with heart failure were hospitalized at our institution. We could perform coronary arteriography and spasm provocation tests in 37 (22 men, 67±11 years) out of 201 patients with heart failure before discharge. Atrial fibrillation was observed in 13 patients (35%). After controlling heart failure and 24h cessation of vasoactive drugs, pharmacological spasm provocation tests were performed. Positive spasm was defined as >90%. Coronary spasm was observed in 12 patients (32%) and multiple spasm was recognized in 10 (83%) out of 12 patients. Though ejection fraction on admission was not different between the two groups (42±18% vs. 43±11%, ns), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimension after medical therapy over 1 year was significantly smaller in patients with positive spasm than that in patients with negative spasm. There was no difference concerning medications except the administration of nitrate and nicorandil between two groups. Coronary artery spasm, especially multiple spasm, may cause transient heart failure in a small part of unknown origin heart failure in Japan.


Splicing of the mycobacteriophage Bethlehem DnaB intein: identification of a new mechanistic class of inteins that contain an obligate block F nucleophile.

"Spider bite" lesions are usually diagnosed as skin and soft-tissue infections. Many people seek medical attention for skin lesions and other conditions they attribute to spider bites. Prior experience suggests that many of these lesions have alternate causes, especially infections with community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). This study determined the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients reporting a "spider bite" who received a clinical diagnosis of spider bite by their physician vs. other etiologies, and if the diagnoses correlated with demographic risk factors for developing CA-MRSA infections. ED patients who reported that their condition was caused by a "spider bite" were prospectively enrolled in an anonymous, voluntary survey regarding details of their illness and demographic information. Discharge diagnoses were also collected and categorized as: spider bite, bite from other animal (including unknown arthropod), infection, or other diagnosis. There were 182 patients enrolled over 23 months. Seven patients (3.8%) were diagnosed with actual spider bites, 9 patients (4.9%) with bites from other animals, 156 patients (85.7%) with infections, and 6 patients (3.3%) were given other diagnoses. Four patients were given concurrent diagnoses in two categories, and 8 (4.4%) did not have the diagnosis recorded on the data collection instrument. No statistically significant associations were found between the patients' diagnostic categories and the demographic risk factors for CA-MRSA assessed. ED patients reporting a "spider bite" were most frequently diagnosed with skin and soft-tissue infections. Clinically confirmed spider bites were rare, and were caused by black widow spiders when the species could be identified.

Outbreak of Rickettsia typhi infection - Austin, Texas, 2008.

Accuracy of a portable international normalized ratio monitor for patients receiving a low molecular weight heparin as a bridge pending full oral anticoagulant efficacy. Point of care (POC) devices measuring the international normalized ratio (INR) are accurate for patients with stable disease, but their efficiency has not been prospectively assessed during the "bridging period" when patients are receiving a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on top of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) until the target INR is reached. 188 dual INR measurement using the POC (INR(POC)) and the laboratory (INR(lab)) at the same time were consecutively determined : 69 in patients receiving LMWH+VKA (bridging group) and 119 in patients receiving only a VKA (control group). INRpoc was compared to INR(lab). Test strip failure rate was higher in the bridging group than in the control group (29% vs 4%; p<0,001). In successful tests, POC accuracy was not modified by LMWH administration: the correlation coefficients between POC and lab INR values for the bridging group and the control group were 0,81 and 0,87 respectively, and the relative measure of divergence (RMD=INR(lab) - INR(poc)/INR(lab)) was lower in the bridging group than in the control group (4+/-7% vs 10+/-14%; p=0,02). Finally, clinically relevant agreement between POC and laboratory was of 90% in the bridging group and 92.1% in the control group (p=0.6). With the POC used (INRatio), in patients receiving LMWH when the POC gives a result, it is as accurate as in patients not receiving a LMWH.

2-Propanol in the mobile phase reduces the time of analysis of CLA isomers by silver ion-HPLC. Individual isomers of octadecadienoic acid (C18:2) with conjugated double bonds (conjugated linoleic acids; CLA) exert different biological activities. Their distribution in food and tissues differs. Therefore, the separation of the various positional and geometric isomers is important. The time of analysis using silver ion-high performance liquid chromatography can extend up to 90 min. The aim of this study was to reduce this time. The time of analysis reduced from ca. 90 min onto 45 to 35 min, respectively, by the addition of 0.05% or 0.1% (v/v) 2-propanol to the mobile phase [acetonitrile (0.1%; v/v) and diethyl ether (0.5%; v/v) in n-hexane]. There was no effect on resolution of the 17 individual CLA isomers of the CLA mixture. Regarding the lowest coefficient of variation and an adequate baseline separation the use of 0.05% 2-propanol in the mobile phase is recommended, without any disadvantages and adverse effects on the service life of columns. In conclusion, adding 0.05% or 0.1% 2-propanol to the mobile phase shortens the time of analysis of CLA isomers, saves solvents and reduces costs.

Mechanistic basis of Rho GTPase-induced extracellular matrix synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells. Elevated intraocular pressure arising from impaired aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular pathway is a major risk factor for glaucoma. To understand the molecular basis for Rho GTPase-mediated resistance to aqueous humor drainage, we investigated the possible interrelationship between actomyosin contractile properties and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells expressing a constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoAV14). TM cells expressing RhoAV14 exhibited significant increases in fibronectin, tenascin C, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) levels, and matrix assembly in association with increased actin stress fibers and myosin light-chain phosphorylation. RhoAV14-induced changes in ECM synthesis and actin cytoskeletal reorganization were mimicked by lysophosphatidic acid and TGF-beta(2), known to increase resistance to aqueous humor outflow and activate Rho/Rho kinase signaling. RhoAV14, lysophosphatidic acid, and TGF-beta(2) stimulated significant increases in Erk1/2 phosphorylation, paralleled by profound increases in fibronectin, serum response factor (SRF), and alpha-SMA expression. Treatment of RhoA-activated TM cells with inhibitors of Rho kinase or Erk, on the other hand, decreased fibronectin and alpha-SMA levels. Although suppression of SRF expression (both endogenous and RhoA, TGF-beta(2)-stimulated) via the use of short hairpin RNA decreased alpha-SMA levels, fibronectin was unaffected. Conversely, fibronectin induced alpha-SMA expression in an SRF-dependent manner. Collectively, data on RhoA-induced changes in actomyosin contractile activity, ECM synthesis/assembly, and Erk activation, along with fibronectin-induced alpha-SMA expression in TM cells, reveal a potential molecular interplay between actomyosin cytoskeletal tension and ECM synthesis/assembly. This interaction could be significant for the homeostasis of aqueous humor drainage through the pressure-sensitive trabecular pathway.

Are alcohol containing mouthwashes safe? Alcohol (ethanol) is a constituent of many proprietary mouthwashes. Some studies have shown that regular use of such mouthwashes can increase the risk of developing oral cancer. Recently, the evidence has been reviewed by two separate authors. The conclusions from these reviews are conflicting. In this paper, we reconsider the epidemiological evidence linking alcohol containing mouthwashes with an increased risk of oral cancer. The evidence is considered in term of sample size, strength of association, confounding variables and data collection. In addition, clinical studies comparing alcohol versus non-alcohol mouthwashes are evaluated. The evidence suggests that the alcohol component of mouthwashes affords little additional benefit to the other active ingredients in terms of plaque and gingivitis control. In view of this outcome and the hypothetical risk of oral cancer, it would seem prudent that members of the dental team advise their patients accordingly.

Health assessment of artisanal gold miners in Tanzania. In 2003 UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) conducted an environmental and health assessment in a small-scale mining area in Tanzania. BGS (British Geological Survey) performed the environmental assessment. The Institute of Forensic Medicine - University of Munich performed the health assessment. The results of the medical, neurological and neuro-psychological examination of 180 participants from the affected area of Rwamagasa and 31 controls were analyzed. Urine, blood and hair samples were analyzed to detect the level of mercury body burden. Mercury concentrations in the bio-monitors urine, blood and hair were statistically significantly higher in the exposed population from Rwamagasa compared to the control group from Katoro. Only amalgam burners showed mercury levels above the toxicological threshold limits. A speciation of mercury in hair indicated that mainly elemental mercury vapor contributed to the high body burden of the artisanal miners. 104 amalgam-burners, the most exposed population group, were examined. 25 of these workers were found to be intoxicated. Small-scale mining is a serious health hazard for amalgam burners. Reduction of the exposure is essential to prevent further damage.

Culture of bovine embryos in intermediate host oviducts with emphasis on the isolated mouse oviduct. The oviduct provides the optimal environment for the transport of sperm and oocyte at the earliest stages of mammalian embryo development. During the early postfertilization period, several major developmental events occur in the embryo including (i) the first cleavage division, (ii) activation of the embryonic genome, (iii) compaction of the morula, and (iv) formation of the blastocyst. Most of these events are initiated in the oviduct. The absence of assistance from the oviduct may compromise the developmental ability of the cattle embryo under in vitro culture conditions. The oviducts of several mammalian species, including rabbits, cow, sheep (in situ), and mice (organ culture), can sustain early bovine embryos and yield blastocysts of better quality compared with those of culture conditions in vitro, leading to normal pregnancy rates in recipient animals. This review focuses on the use of oviducts in vitro or in vivo as intermediate hosts for postfertilization culture environment of bovine in vitro-produced zygotes with emphasis on the mouse model.

Sonography of the pelvis in patients with primary amenorrhea. Duplex/color Doppler sonography (US) is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of patients with primary amenorrhea. Careful correlation with clinical history, physical examination and laboratory findings significantly narrows the diagnostic possibilities thus allowing for a more precise diagnosis. This article discusses the wide gamut of etiologies of primary amenorrhea, the US appearance of pathologic processes that result in primary amenorrhea, and helps the reader understand when additional higher tech imaging is indicated.

Rapid clearance of circulating haptoglobin from plasma during acute pulmonary embolism in rats results in HMOX1 up-regulation in peripheral blood leukocytes. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) causes pulmonary hypertension (PH) via several mechanisms including pulmonary vasospasm. We hypothesize that PE with associated PH leads to alterations in plasma protein concentrations indicative of disease severity and prognosis. To identify plasma proteins altered in abundance by PE in rats. Plasma samples were obtained from rats at 2, 6 and 18 h after experimental PE produced with intrajugular injection of polystyrene beads at three different levels of severity (mild, moderate and severe). Total plasma protein was separated using two-dimensional sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE) and candidate protein spots altered in expression by PE were identified by mass spectroscopy. Haptoglobin identity and amount was verified by western blot analysis. The PE model produced a dose-dependent increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (mmHg) at 2 h: mild 39+/-1.7, moderate 40+/-1.8 and severe 51+/-1.3 mmHg, coincident with significant increases in free plasma (hemoglobin). Combined 2D SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis indicated time- and dose-dependant loss of plasma haptoglobin levels in response to acute PE. Haptoglobin (HP) was essentially absent from plasma within 2 h of severe PE. Clearance of HP from plasma was accompanied by increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (hmox1) in peripheral blood leukocytes and in HMOX1 enzyme activity in the liver. PE that causes pulmonary hypertension is associated with haptoglobin depletion and up-regulation of HMOX1 enzyme.

Study of branched cationic beta-cyclodextrin polymer/indomethacin complex and its release profile from alginate hydrogel. A series of branched cationic beta-cyclodextrin polymers (CPbetaCDs) with designed chemical structures were synthesized from beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), epichlorohydrin (EP) and choline chloride (CC). Indomethacin (IDM), an anionic drug, was chosen as a model drug to evaluate the drug loading capacities of CPbetaCDs. The formation of IDM-CPbetaCD complex was confirmed by (1)H NMR and DSC. Phase solubility studies and Job plots indicated that CPbetaCDs can solubilize IDM up to 100 times of its intrinsic solubility in a 1:1 complexation form. Mechanism studies with the help of adamantane revealed that the effective complexation is a combination of inclusion complexation, charge interaction and hydrophobic interaction. In addition, IDM-CPbetaCDs loaded alginate hydrogels were prepared and obtained controllable release profile in dissolution tests. The tunable structures of CPbetaCDs make them promising drug carriers with superior drug loading capacities and controllable drug release abilities.

Apoptolidins E and F, new glycosylated macrolactones isolated from Nocardiopsis sp. Two new glycosylated macrolactones, apoptolidins E (5) and F (6), were isolated from fermentation of the actinomycete Nocardiopsis sp. and their structures assigned. Lacking the C16 and C20 oxygens of apoptolidin A (1), these macrolides are also the first members of this family to display a 4-O-methyl-l-rhamnose at C9 rather than a 6-deoxy-4-O-methyl-l-glucose.

Effectiveness of oral self-care among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes. We investigated the efficacy of plaque removal after an oral self-care demonstration among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes. Fifty-four adults with diabetes completed an observed, uninstructed oral self-care demonstration with their normal mode of oral self-care. Before and after the oral self-care demonstration, the plaque levels of six test teeth were assessed using the Plaque Index. The mean percentage of plaque removal after the oral self-care demonstration was 27.4%. The mandibular teeth and the lingual surface had less plaque removal compared with the maxillary teeth and buccal surfaces. Only approximately 10% of participants achieved 50% or more plaque removal after the oral self-care demonstration. Thus, the majority of the participants did not achieve an acceptable level of plaque removal. Dental health professionals should emphasize better oral home care for people with diabetes and teach them how to access the lingual surfaces, especially of the mandibular teeth.

Budd-Chiari syndrome owing to liver hydatid disease: case report and review of the literature. Liver hydatid disease causes significant morbidity but portal hypertension is a rare complication. The mechanism may be pre-hepatic, hepatic, or post-hepatic. Echinococcus granulosus or E. alveolaris may be involved; the latter is associated with infiltration and liver failure. A 13-year-old girl presented with two large unilocular liver hydatids complicated by chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome. Analysis of the ascitic fluid demonstrated a transudate and results of liver function tests were normal. CT scan showed compression at the level of the hepatic veins opening into the vena cava, with multiple collaterals. The patient underwent cystectomy and capittonage which was followed by reversal of the portal hypertension and ascites. This is probably only the second case to be reported in the English-language literature.

Acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction in women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Preeclampsia is a major global cause of maternal, neonatal and perinatal mortality. From studies of placental pathophysiology in women with preeclampsia, a potentially important role of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the prevention of preeclampsia was expected, but the results from clinical trials have been disappointing. While recent evidence has shown that uterine Doppler can predict preeclampsia as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy, most clinical trials have evaluated ASA in the second and third trimesters. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the influence of gestational age at the time of introduction of ASA on the incidence of preeclampsia in women at increased risk, on the basis of abnormal uterine artery Doppler. Computerized searches of randomized controlled trials were conducted to retrieve studies in which pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia had been identified on the basis of abnormal uterine Doppler measurements. The trials compared women who received ASA with a control group. The primary outcome was preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes included severe preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, birth weight and gestational age at delivery. Statistical analyses used fixed effects of risk ratio (RR) with the Mantel-Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals. Nine randomized controlled trials with a total of 1317 women met the inclusion criteria. ASA treatment beginning in early gestation was associated with a greater reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia than treatment beginning in late gestation: ASA treatment started at < or = 16 weeks' gestation resulted in RR 0.48 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.68), at 17-19 weeks RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.76), and at > or = 20 weeks RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.09). ASA treatment started before 16 weeks was also linked with a significant reduction in the incidence of severe preeclampsia (RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.74), gestational hypertension (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.78) and IUGR (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). ASA treatment initiated early in pregnancy is an efficient method of reducing the incidence of preeclampsia and its consequences in women with ultrasonographic evidence of abnormal placentation diagnosed by uterine artery Doppler studies.

Glucocorticoid regulation of mouse and human dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) genes: unusual cis-acting elements and unexpected evolutionary divergence.

Partitioning of acidic, basic and neutral amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In this paper, partitioning behaviors of typical neutral (Alanine), acidic (Glutamic acid) and basic (Lysine) amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids [C(4)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][PF(6)], [C(8)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][BF(4)] and [C(8)mim][BF(4)] as extracting solvents were examined. [C(6)mim][BF(4)] showed the best efficiency for partitioning of amino acids. The partition coefficients of amino acids in ionic liquids were found to depend strongly on pH of the aqueous solution, amino acid and ionic liquid chemical structures. Different chemical forms of amino acids in aqueous solutions were pH dependent, so the pH value of the aqueous phase was a determining factor for extraction of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Both water content of ionic liquids and charge densities of their anionic and cationic parts were important factors for partitioning of cationic and anionic forms of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Extracted amino acids were back extracted into phosphate buffer solutions adjusted on appropriate pH values. The results showed that ionic liquids could be used as suitable modifiers on the stationary phase of an HPLC column for efficient separation of acidic, basic, and neutral amino acids.

[RHD variant in RhD/-/ mother with anti-D makes noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping impossible]. Noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping from maternal plasma of RhD(/-) pregnant women of Caucasian race may be used for predicting the risk of hemolytic disease because the RHD gene is usually absent in such populations. If detected in plasma of such women, the RHD gene originates from the RhD(+) fetus. The number of fetal copies of the gene in maternal plasma is extremely small. In the presented case of the RhD(/-) pregnant woman with anti-D it was impossible to give a fetal RHD result due to mother's RHD(+) genotype. The fetal RHD was determined from amniocytes. to present the difficulties related to the interpretation of results of invasive and noninvasive procedures. whole blood, plasma and amniotic fluid of the RhD(-) woman with anti-D (14 week of pregnancy) as well as whole blood of the newborn. RHD and RHCE*c were genotyped by real-time PCR in DNA isolated from maternal plasma and amniocytes and the RHD and d-genotypes were tested by SSP methods in DNA isolated from whole blood and amniocytes. RHD and RHCE*c were detected in DNA isolated from plasma. The high level of RHD suggested its origin from the mother's DNA therefore it was impossible to determine the fetal RHD. The d-little test identified a RHD(IVS3+ 1G>A) variant in the mother's genome. A weak signal of real-time PCR for the RHD was obtained in amniocytes but the RHD was not detected by SSP. The RHCE*c was detected by both methods. Results were inconclusive; the fetal RHD status remained unknown. The child was RhD(-) with RHD in its DNA undetected by either method. 1/The RHD(IVS3+ 1G>A) variant in the RhD(-) mother precluded formal noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping. 2/Real-time PCR is too sensitive for amniocyte testing and may lead to false results as it detects trace maternal DNA in amniotic fluid. 3/The frequency of RHD(IVS3+1G>A) occurrence in Poland requires further studies.

Familiarity and recollection processes in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and their unaffected parents. Episodic memory deficits are present in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and their unaffected relatives and could be considered as a cognitive indicator of genetic vulnerability to SZ. The present study, involving patients with SZ as well as their parents, used experimental tasks specifically designed to disentangle the contribution of familiarity and recollection processes to episodic memory. The performance of patients with SZ (n=26) and their unaffected parents (n=35) was compared with that of healthy control groups matched on socio-demographic variables (controls of patients, n=26; controls of parents, n=35) on two memory tasks assessing recollection and familiarity. The first task was designed to investigate item recognition and memory for item-spatial context associations whereas the second targeted item-item associations. The results revealed an overall episodic memory deficit in patients with SZ, encompassing both familiarity and recollection, while unaffected parents showed a dysfunction restricted to the recollection process. Our study highlights differences and similarities in the source of the episodic memory deficit found in patients with SZ and their unaffected parents, and it suggests that recollection could act as a cognitive endophenotype of SZ. The results also suggest that use of experimental tasks represents a promising method in the search of cognitive endophenotypes in SZ.

Response of IGF and IL-6 to ovarian stimulation in PCOS and normal women. The objective of the present study was to investigate the response patterns of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) to ovarian stimulation within 24 h in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with normally ovulating women. This controlled prospective clinical study involved 60 women who attended an infertility clinic. For the induction of the ovarian stimulation, fifty-two patients with PCOS and eight control cases were injected with human menopause gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during the early follicular phase of the natural or induced menstrual cycle. The blood was sampled before (0h) and 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after the stimulation. Serum levels of estradiol (E2), IGF-I, IGF-II and IL-6 were measured by radioimmunoassay. A significant decrease in serum IGF-II at 12 h was observed after a mixture of hMG and hCG was administered in patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) including the typical PCOS group and the PCO + OA group (accumulated p < 0.05), while normal women presented a slight decrease (accumulated p < 0.1) 18h after the stimulation. Moreover, all the groups had similar serum levels of IL-6 and IGF-I at all time points. An increase in serum E2 occurred coincident with a decrease in IGF-II in all the groups except the ovarian hyperandrogenism patients (HA + OA group). Serum IGF-II levels, which appeared to be negatively correlated with elevated E2, statistically decreased in PCO patients early after hMG and hCG administration when monitored for 24 h, while no such changes were observed in IGF-I and IL-6.

Electrochemical properties of phospholipid monolayers at liquid-liquid interfaces. Biomembrane models built at the interface between two immiscible electrolytes (ITIES) are useful systems to study phenomena of biological relevance by means of their electrochemical processes. The unique properties of ITIES allow one either to control or measure the potential difference across the biomimetic membranes. Herein we focus on phospholipid monolayers adsorbed at liquid-liquid interfaces, and besides discussing recent developments on the subject, we describe electrochemical techniques that can be used to get insight on the interfacial processes and electrostatic properties of phospholipid membranes at the ITIES. In particular, we examine the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of (modified) phospholipid monolayers and their interaction with other biologically relevant compounds. The use of liquid-liquid electrochemistry as a powerful tool to characterize drug properties is outlined. Although this review is not a survey of all the work in the field, it provides a comprehensive referencing to current research.

[The strain differentiation of Candida albicans by morphotyping]. Morphotyping is a phenotypic method for strain differentiation of yeast cultures based on the comparison of appearance of their surfaces and fringes. For its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, it is recommended as an alternative tool to genotyping of Candida albicans. Our study aimed at verifying its usefulness for typing a group of C. albicans clinical isolates with emphasis on discrimination power. Prevalence of specific morphotypes in body locations with more tested isolates and according to age groups and gender of patients was also evaluated. The tested group comprised 97 C. albicans isolates from 93 patients. With a cotton swab, 24-hour cultures were streaked onto malt extract agar. The surface and fringe morphology was assessed after 10-day incubation at 30 degrees C. A total of 30 morphotypes were detected. The most frequent one had a code profile 7240 (n = 13, 13.4 %), followed by 5240 (n = 11) and 7340 (n = 9). The discrimination power calculated by Simpson's index of diversity reached 0.95. Results of reproducibility testing were identical in 54.6 % of isolates, another 36.1 % of isolates differed in one character. Some isolates (n = 35) were biotyped by our modification of Odds method. Using morphological criteria, 14 different phenotypes were defined, as opposed to 8 found by biotyping. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing morphotypes from the oropharynx, vagina and urine; the same was true for male and female morphotypes. Our results clearly documented very good discrimination power of morphotyping for C. albicans isolates. This advantage as well as easiness to perform and low costs but markedly lower reproducibility in comparison with molecular genetic techniques makes it an optimal typing method for first-line use. Evaluation of morphological diversity of strains by this method can be further utilized in the studies of virulence, switching phenomenon or antifungal resistance.

A dynamic systems approach to the effects of aging on bimanual coordination. The present study examined the effects of aging on the execution of a bimanual coordination task in a classical phase transition paradigm in which coordination patterns (in-phase and anti-phase) and movement frequency were manipulated. Two groups of adults, the so-called young (average age 26 years) and old (average age 71 years) participants, performed both in-phase and anti-phase patterns at different frequencies. As we expected variability of relative phase was larger for older participants than for younger ones for both the in-phase and the anti-phase coordination patterns. Moreover, phase transitions occurred at lower frequencies for older participants and more transitions were observed for older than for younger participants. Although no specific hypotheses were made about the prominent source(s) of age-related changes in coordination dynamics (i.e., an alteration in the coupling function and/or an increase of the magnitude of noise), our results suggest that these changes might result from increases in the (neural) noise to be found in the (bimanual) action system.


Intra-periaqueductal grey microinjections of an imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine derivative, DM2, affects rostral ventromedial medulla cell activity and shows antinociceptive effect.

Traceability in gamma-ray spectrometry. The new edition of the International vocabulary of metrology-basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) defines metrological traceability in a different way than was defined in the previous edition. The reference to an "unbroken chain of comparisons" is replaced by a "chain of calibrations." Calibrations, unlike comparisons, render possible an interpolation of the quantity values between indicated parameters where the calibration was performed. Calibrations of software may be performed using software-measurement standards as well. Furthermore, the traceability of quantities having a minor influence on the measurement result is not mandatory. As a consequence of these modifications, the traceability of gamma-ray spectrometric results can also be attained when gamma-ray spectrometry is implemented other than as a relative method.

Identification of a cell wall-associated subtilisin-like serine protease involved in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2. Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen, and also an emerging zoonotic agent. A surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease (SspA) of S. suis was identified by screening a genomic expression library as fragments of this protein reacted most strongly with convalescent-phase pig sera. The sspA gene is present in 29 of 33 S. suis serotypes reference strains and is expressed on the surface of S. suis. Relative real-time quantitative PCR assay demonstrated that sspA mRNA expression in vivo was several thousand fold of that in vitro. A sspA(-) mutant was generated from a S. suis serotype 2 strain SC19 by allelic exchange. The mutant was not different from the wild type strain in subcellular structures and in hemolytic phenotype. However, the virulence of the sspA(-) mutant was markedly lower than the wild type in pigs as demonstrated in experimental infections. These data indicated that the surface-associated protein SspA is a conserved virulence factor of S. suis and is involved in the pathogenesis of S. suis.

Very late (10-year-old) bare metal stent thrombosis. We present findings from a 59-year-old male patient who presented with coronary artery disease and refractory angina. Ten years prior, the patient had been implanted with 5 bare metal stents (BMS); he arrived with non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Angiographic data revealed a totally occluded right coronary artery at the level of the previously placed BMS, consistent with an acute occlusion and a significant thrombus. Our findings revealed that BMS thrombosis can occur as late as 10 years after implantation. Further data through clinical trials are warranted to look at this rare, but serious, complication.

Complete recovery from severe myocardial dysfunction in a patient with anorexia nervosa. This report describes a patient who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest caused by severe hypoglycemia and malnutrition, which was successfully treated with percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) and intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). A 33-year-old female with anorexia nervosa (AN) was transferred to the emergency center because of a loss of consciousness. On admission, she was extremely emaciated, hypotensive, and hypoglycemic (10 mg/dl). A chest X-ray showed butterfly shadow. Echocardiography showed severe hypokinesis of left ventricular wall motion. On the 3rd hospital day, she experienced cardiac arrest. Myocardial dysfunction caused by malnutrition was suspected, and therefore both PCPS and IABP were administered for circulatory support and myocardial protection. Thereafter, cardiac function gradually recovered and she was later weaned from PCPS and IABP on the 9th and the 10th hospital day, respectively. She was discharged from the intensive care unit on the 43rd hospital day with normal cardiac function. Her neurological outcome after 6 months as evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was considered to be good recovery. Cardiomyopathy in AN patients is reversible ventricular dysfunction, and circulation assisting devices are considered for the treatment of cardiogenic shock.

Identification and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of formin-mediated actin assembly. Formins stimulate actin filament assembly for fundamental cellular processes including division, adhesion, establishing polarity, and motility. A formin inhibitor would be useful because most cells express multiple formins whose functions are not known and because metastatic tumor formation depends on the deregulation of formin-dependent processes. We identified a general small molecule inhibitor of formin homology 2 domains (SMIFH2) by screening compounds for the ability to prevent formin-mediated actin assembly in vitro. SMIFH2 targets formins from evolutionarily diverse organisms including yeast, nematode worm, and mice, with a half-maximal inhibitor concentration of approximately 5 to 15 microM. SMIFH2 prevents both formin nucleation and processive barbed end elongation and decreases formin's affinity for the barbed end. Furthermore, low micromolar concentrations of SMIFH2 disrupt formin-dependent, but not Arp2/3 complex-dependent, actin cytoskeletal structures in fission yeast and mammalian NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Predictors of emotional distress reported by soldiers in the combat zone. Few studies have examined rates of distress of military personnel during deployment to a war zone. Our study sought to (a) identify rates of self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms during combat deployment, (b) characterize higher order dimensions of emotional distress experienced by soldiers during deployment, and (c) identify predictors of these dimensions of emotional distress. Participants were 2677 National Guard soldiers deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006-07. We performed a principal components factor analysis on items of the PTSD Checklist - Military Version and the Beck Depression Inventory to identify dimensions of emotional distress, followed by multiple regression analyses to identify factors that predicted these dimensions of distress. Rates of PTSD and depression in our sample were 7% and 9%, respectively. Five dimensions of emotional distress emerged: negative affect/cognitions, trauma-specific re-experiencing and avoidance, vegetative symptoms, loss of interest/numbing symptoms, and arousal/irritability. Two dimensions, trauma-specific symptoms and arousal/irritability, appeared to be more indicative of trauma sequelae, while the other three dimensions were more indicative of depressive symptoms. Demographic factors, combat exposure (including injury and exposure to explosive blast), and attitudinal variables predicted trauma-specific aspects of distress. Symptoms characteristic of depression or generalized distress were predicted by female gender, recent prior deployment, and attitudinal factors but were not predicted by blast exposure or injury. These findings suggest specific targets for contextual and individual interventions to reduce deployment-related distress and point out the need for longitudinal follow-up to determine long-term implications for post-deployment functioning.


Herbal supplementation diets on hematology and innate immunity in goldfish against Aeromonas hydrophila.

Recent advances in physicochemical and ADMET profiling in drug discovery. The drastic increase in the cost for discovering and developing a new drug along with the high attrition rate of development candidates led to shifting drug-discovery strategy to parallel assessment of comprehensive drug physicochemical, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties alongside efficacy. With the proposal of a profiling paradigm and utilization of integrated risk assessment, one can exponentially enhance the predictive power of in vitro tools by taking into consideration the interplay among profiling parameters. In particular, this article will review recent advances in accurate assessment of solubility and other physicochemical parameters. The proper interpretation of these experimental data is crucial for rapid and meaningful risk assessment and rational optimization of drug candidates in drug discovery. The impact of these tools on assisting drug-discovery teams in establishing in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) as well as structure-property relationship (SPR) will be presented.

(1)H NMR-based metabolomics approach for exploring urinary metabolome modifications after acute and chronic physical exercise. Metabolomics is a comprehensive method for metabolite assessment that involves measuring the overall metabolic signature of biological samples. We used this approach to investigate biochemical changes due to acute and chronic physical exercise. Twenty-two women using identical oral contraceptives were segregated into an untrained (n = 10) or trained (n = 12) group depending on their physical training background. The subjects performed two exercises in a randomized order: a prolonged exercise test (75% of their VO(2 max) until exhaustion) and a short-term, intensive exercise test (short-term, intensive exercise anaerobic test). Urine specimens were collected before and 30 min after each test. The samples were analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and multivariate statistical techniques were utilized to process the data. Distinguishing characteristics were observed only in the urine profiles of specimens collected before vs. 30 min after the short-term, intensive exercise test. The metabolites responsible for such changes were creatinine, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, and hypoxanthine. In both groups, the excretion of lactate, pyruvate, alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and hypoxanthine increased similarly after the completion of the short-term, intensive exercise test (p < 0.03). However, acetate excretion increased to a lesser extent in trained than in untrained subjects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, metabolomics is a promising tool in order to gain insight into physiological status and to clarify the changes induced by short-term, intense physical exercise.


[Sedation in neurointensive care unit].

Predictors of body mass index in patients with moderate to severe emphysema. People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease are at risk for low body weight and the subsequent sequelae of cachexia. The goal of this study was to define the relationship between of degree of emphysema as measured by high resolution chest computerized tomography, body mass index and caloric intake. Subjects from San Diego County were recruited to participate in a multi-center randomized clinical trial to test the Feasibility of Retinoids in the Treatment of Emphysema (FORTE). Forty subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, participated in a nutrition substudy and were ex-smokers with FEV(1) between 20%-80% predicted. Body mass index was correlated with the degree of emphysema as measured by high resolution chest tomography (CT), r(2) = 0.171 p < 0.01 across the full spectrum of disease severity. Dietary intake averaged over four days using 24-hour recalls was inversely correlated with BMI, r(2) = 0.471, p < 0.001, indicating a higher energy intake in subjects with low BMI. Pulmonary function tests of percent predicated FEV(1) was mildly related to BMI (r(2) = 0.086, p < 0.06). A regression model was developed to define the relationship of BMI and degree of emphysema and calorie per kilogram body weight, which accounted for 60% of the variability, p < 0.001. Low body weight in the COPD is related to the degree of emphysema, not due to decreased caloric intake. Subjects with low body weight have compensated by increasing their caloric intake and are meeting their nutritional needs.

[Gastric melanoma--clinical case]. Malignant melanomas of the gastrointestinal tract and particulary of the stomach are very rare intra-operative findings. The majority of such melanomas are metastatic from a cutaneous primary. We present the clinical case of a 69-years-old woman with malignant melanoma of the left pectoral region resected in 1988, presented with epigastric pain, weight loss and anaemia. Endoscopy and CT-scan suggested the diagnosis of malignant tumor of the large curvature of the stomach. Explorative laparotomy revealed a large ulcerated tumor of the fornix, with spleno-pancreatic invasion. We also found several pigmented satellite nodules. The surgical solution consisted in a total gastrectomy and distal spleno-pancreatectomy. Histology revealed the tumor and the satellite nodules to be composed of nests of epithelioid cells with melanin pigment. After 3 months, the evolution was favorable. There are some articles in medical literature which present cases of primary gastric melanomas. According to these scientific criterias from the literature, we discussed the nature of this melanoma - a primary or a metastatic one.

Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to noninvasively assess coronary vasoconstrictor and dilator responses in humans. Human studies of coronary circulation are limited because of methodological issues. Recently, a noninvasive transthoracic duplex ultrasound (TTD) technique has emerged as an important tool to measure coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) in conscious humans. We employed two protocols to determine whether noninvasive "native" coronary artery velocity responses to constrictor or dilator stimuli assessed by TTD provide reliable data. In the first protocol, coronary vascular resistance (CVR = diastolic blood pressure/CBV) responses to static handgrip were examined in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and native left anterior descending artery (LAD) into which the graft was inserted (patient age 63 +/- 3 years). Our prior report documented increased CVR in the LIMA graft during static handgrip (Momen et al., J Appl Physiol 102: 735-739, 2007). We hypothesized that the magnitude of increases in CVR during handgrip would be similar in the LIMA graft and LAD in the same individual. Percent increases in CVR were similar in the LIMA and distal native LAD (27 +/- 4% vs. 28 +/- 6%). In the second protocol, we studied six patients (age 61 +/- 3 years) who underwent cardiac catheterization of the LAD. We compared coronary vasodilator responses to intravenous adenosine infusion (0.14 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire technique and TTD on separate studies. The relative increases in CBV with adenosine obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire and TTD were similar (62 +/- 10% vs. 65 +/- 12%). Noninvasive TTD provides reliable human coronary circulatory constrictor and dilator data.

Female sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions diminish the quality of life for many women, frequently causing enough distress to warrant the diagnosis of a sexual disorder. Problems with sexual function can occur in any stage of the sexual response cycle. Dysfunction is further influenced by a variety of factors: medical, psychiatric, cultural, and stage of life. A variety of treatment modalities exist, though current research has not yet provided Food and Drug Administration approved therapies for sexual disorders in women.

Subclinical hypothyroidism effects on cardiac function. To evaluate heart function in subclinical hypothyroid women in comparison with healthy subjects, a prospective study was performed on newly detected subclinical hypothyroid women presenting to endocrinology clinic of Tabriz Sina Hospital from October 2007 to February 2008. Thirty five women with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (SH) in case group were matched with 35 healthy euthyroid women in control group. All patients in both groups were studied by two dimensional echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) in Tabriz Shahid Madani Hospital. The FT4 and TSH levels were measured. Comparison of TDI results in Right Ventricle (RV) showed the significantly lower mean T(v) excursion in case group with no significant difference in other parameters. In Left Ventricle (LV), the mean A(m), A(v) and E(v)/E(m) were significantly higher and E/A was lower in the case group, but there was no significant difference in other parameters. No RV diastolic dysfunction was documented in both groups. There was no case with LV systolic dysfunction in both groups. There were 21 (60%) patients with LV diastolic dysfunction in the case group comparing with 11 (31.4%) cases in the control group (p = 0.016, OR = 0.306). Frequency of LV diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in the case group in patients aged > or = 40 years (94.1% vs. 53.3%; p = 0.013). There was no case of pericardial effusion in the studied population. According to our results, SH may cause LV diastolic dysfunction. Likewise, minor RV systolic dysfunction might be seen in these patients.

Dysregulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow in overweight postmenopausal women. A putative link between abdominal obesity and metabolic-vascular complications after menopause may be due to a decreased adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF). The present work aimed to analyze possible changes in ATBF with being overweight and menopausal and its putative link to endothelial dysfunction and autonomic nervous system balance. Forty-three healthy women were classified into four groups according to weight and menopause status. The ATBF was measured by xenon washout while fasting and after oral glucose intake. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine was used as a marker of endothelial function and heart rate variability-estimated autonomic nervous system activity. Fasting ATBF was decreased in both overweight groups (P = 0.044 and P = 0.048) versus normal-weight premenopausal women. Normal-weight and overweight postmenopausal women exhibited lower maximum ATBF compared with normal-weight premenopausal women (P = 0.015 and P = 0.001, respectively), and overweight postmenopausal women exhibited lower maximum ATBF compared with normal-weight postmenopausal women (P = 0.003). A negative correlation was found between fasting ATBF and asymmetric dimethylarginine (P = 0.015), whereas maximum ATBF was negatively associated with sympathetic-parasympathetic nervous system balance (ratio of the power of the low frequency to the power of the high frequency; P = 0.002). Loss of ATBF flexibility in overweight postmenopausal women may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction seen in this group of women.

Making framing of uncertainty in water management practice explicit by using a participant-structured approach. By now, the need for addressing uncertainty in the management of water resources is widely recognized, yet there is little expertise and experience how to effectively deal with uncertainty in practice. Uncertainties in water management practice so far are mostly dealt with intuitively or based on experience. That way decisions can be quickly taken but analytic processes of deliberate reasoning are bypassed. To meet the desire of practitioners for better guidance and tools how to deal with uncertainty more practice-oriented systematic approaches are needed. For that purpose we consider it important to understand how practitioners frame uncertainties. In this paper we present an approach where water managers developed criteria of relevance to understand and address uncertainties. The empirical research took place in the Doñana region of the Guadalquivir estuary in southern Spain making use of the method of card sorting. Through the card sorting exercise a broad range of criteria to make sense of and describe uncertainties was produced by different subgroups, which were then merged into a shared list of criteria. That way framing differences were made explicit and communication on uncertainty and on framing differences was enhanced. In that, the present approach constitutes a first step to enabling reframing and overcoming framing differences, which are important features on the way to robust decision-making. Moreover, the elaborated criteria build a basis for the development of more structured approaches to deal with uncertainties in water management practice.

Processes of sexual orientation questioning among heterosexual women. Because very little is known about heterosexual identity development, this study assesses and describes sexual orientation questioning processes of heterosexual-identified women and offers a comparison of these processes with those employed by their sexual-minority counterparts. Participants included 333 female college students (ages 18-23; M = 19.2): 228 participants primarily identified as "exclusively straight/heterosexual," and 105 participants indicated a sexual-minority identity. Sixty-seven percent of exclusively heterosexual respondents (n = 154) indicated having thought about or questioned their sexual orientation. The processes by which heterosexual participants described questioning their sexual orientation were coded for the presence of five emergent categories using an inductive thematic coding methodology. These five categories included unelaborated questioning (19%), other-sex experiences (16%), exposure to sexual minorities (26%), assessment of same-sex attraction (48%), and evaluations of same-sex behavior (26%). Several unifying and differentiating themes emerged between sexual orientation groups. Results from this study suggest that contemporary young women's heterosexuality is not necessarily an unexamined identity; indeed, the large majority of young women in this sample were deliberately identifying as heterosexual after contemplating alternative possibilities.

The telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons SART1 and TRAS1 are suppressed by Piwi subfamily proteins in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The telomere structures in Bombyx mori are thought to be maintained mainly by the transposition of the specialized telomeric retroelements SART and TRAS. The silkworm genome has telomeric TTAGG repeats and telomerase, but this telomerase displays little or no activity. Here, we report that the transcription of the telomeric retroelements SART1 and TRAS1 is suppressed by the silkworm Piwi subfamily proteins BmAgo3 and Siwi. The silkworm Piwi subfamily was found to be expressed predominantly in the gonads and early embryo, as in other model organisms, but in BmN4 cultured cells, these proteins formed granules that were separate from the nuage, which is a different behaviour pattern. The expression of TRAS1 was increased in BmN4 cells when BmAgo3 or Siwi were silenced by RNAi. Our results suggest that B. mori Piwi proteins are involved in regulating the transposition of telomeric retroelements, and that the functional piRNA pathway is conserved in BmN4 cultured cells.

Effects of cannabidiol on amphetamine-induced oxidative stress generation in an animal model of mania. Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, may present a pharmacological profile similar to mood stabilizing drugs, in addition to anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties. The present study aims to directly investigate the effects of CBD in an animal model of mania induced by D-amphetamine (D-AMPH). In the first model (reversal treatment), rats received saline or D-AMPH (2 mg/kg) once daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) for 14 days, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they were treated with saline or CBD (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) i.p. twice a day. In the second model (prevention treatment), rats were pretreated with saline or CBD (15, 30, or 60 mg/kg) regime i.p. twice a day, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they also received saline or D-AMPH i.p. once daily. In the hippocampus CBD (15 mg/kg) reversed the d-AMPH-induced damage and increased (30 mg/kg) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. In the second experiment, CBD (30 or 60 mg/kg) prevented the D-AMPH-induced formation of carbonyl group in the prefrontal cortex. In the hippocampus and striatum the D-AMPH-induced damage was prevented by CBD (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg). At both treatments CBD did not present any effect against d-AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, we could not observe effects on locomotion, but CBD protect against d-AMPH-induced oxidative protein damage and increased BDNF levels in the reversal model and these effects vary depending on the brain regions evaluated and doses of CBD administered.

Over-expression of Arabidopsis thaliana carotenoid hydroxylases individually and in combination with a beta-carotene ketolase provides insight into in vivo functions. Carotenoids represent a group of widely distributed pigments derived from the general isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that possess diverse functions in plant primary and secondary metabolism. Modification of alpha- and beta-carotene backbones depends in part on ring hydroxylation. Two ferredoxin-dependent non-heme di-iron monooxygenases (AtB1 and AtB2) that mainly catalyze in vivo beta-carotene hydroxylations of beta,beta-carotenoids, and two heme-containing cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases (CYP97A3 and CYP97C1) that preferentially hydroxylate the epsilon-ring of alpha-carotene or the beta-ring of beta,epsilon-carotenoids, have been characterized in Arabidopsis by analysis of loss-of-function mutant phenotypes. We further investigated functional roles of both hydroxylase classes in modification of the beta- and epsilon-rings of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene through over-expression of AtB1, CYP97A3, CYP97C1, and the hydroxylase candidate CYP97B3. Since carotenoid hydroxylation is required for generation of ketocarotenoids by the bkt1(CrtO) beta-carotene ketolase, all hydroxylase constructs were also introduced into an Arabidopsis line expressing the Haematococcus pluvalis bkt1 beta-carotene ketolase. Analysis of foliar carotenoid profiles in lines overexpressing the individual hydroxylases indicate a role for CYP97B3 in carotenoid biosynthesis, confirm and extend previous findings of hydroxylase activities based on knock-out mutants, and suggest functions of the multifunctional enzymes in carotenoid biosynthesis. Hydroxylase over-expression in combination with bkt1 did not result in ketocarotenoid accumulation, but instead unexpected patterns of alpha-carotene derivatives, accompanied by a reduction of alpha-carotene, were observed. These data suggest possible interactions between the beta-carotene ketolase bkt1 and the hydroxylases that impact partitioning of carbon flux into different carotenoid branch pathways.

[Prospect of application of molecular phylogeography in study of geoherbs]. This paper firstly introduces the concept, method and current research of molecular phylogeography and then discusses its application in the study of geoherbs. The relativity between three genetic differentiation patterns of plant inferred by molecular phylogeography (i.e. allopatric fragmentation, restricted gene flow with isolation by distance and range expansion) and the formation of genuine character is analysed. Molecular authentication of geoherbs based on molecular phylogeography has the advantage of former molecular identification at technology and knowing genetic differentiation of geoherbs. Using molecular phylogeography for study on changing history of geoherbs habitat is also explicated. The problem of germplasm degeneration in cultural geoherbs could be effectively resolved by molecular phylogeography method. The application of molecular phylogeography in these subjects opens up prospects for study on geoherbs by using the principle and method of molecular phylogeography.

Effect of aortic valve surgery on left ventricular diastole assessed by echocardiography and neuroendocrine response: percutaneous versus surgical approach. Aortic valve implantation through peripheral vascular access is an option for high-risk patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. The authors aimed to compare the acute effect of endovascular and surgical aortic valve procedures on left ventricular diastolic function. A case-matched, nonrandomized study. A university hospital. Patients with aortic stenosis. B-natriuretic peptide was measured in 30 patients with a logistic EuroSCORE > or =20% undergoing endovascular aortic valve implantation. Patients were case matched (age, mitral flow propagation velocity, mitral annulus early diastolic velocity, and B-natriuretic peptide measurement) with 30 control patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement through sternotomy. Left ventricular diastole was evaluated initially and after valve procedures with echocardiography by mitral flow propagation velocity and mitral annulus early diastolic velocity. B-natriuretic peptide was similar preoperatively in the 2 groups (346 [188-438] v 367 [211-458] pg/mL) and higher (p = 0.006) in the surgical group postoperatively (389.5 [237-479] v 710.5 [389-822] pg/mL), with a postprocedural statistically significant increase only in the surgical group. Diastolic function was similar in the 2 groups preoperatively, improved postoperatively in the endovascular group, and worsened in the surgical group. B-natriuretic peptide increased after surgical but not after endovascular aortic valve replacement. Furthermore, endovascular aortic valve implantation acutely improved left ventricular diastolic function as documented by increases in mitral flow propagation velocity and mitral annulus early diastolic velocity.

NOS1AP variant associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes in calcium channel blocker users in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. To validate the reported association between rs10494366 in NOS1AP (the gene encoding nitric oxide synthase-1 adaptor protein) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in calcium channel blocker (CCB) users and to identify additional NOS1AP variants associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Data from 9 years of follow-up in 9,221 middle-aged white and 2,724 African-American adults free of diabetes at baseline from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were analysed. Nineteen NOS1AP variants were examined for associations with incident diabetes and fasting glucose levels stratified by baseline CCB use. Prevalence of CCB use at baseline was 2.7% (n = 247) in whites and 2.3% (n = 72) in African-Americans. Among white CCB users, the G allele of rs10494366 was associated with lower diabetes incidence (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92, p = 0.016). The association was marginally significant after adjusting for age, sex, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, hypertension, heart rate and electrocardiographic QT interval (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38-1.04, p = 0.052). rs10494366 was associated with lower average fasting glucose during follow-up (p = 0.037). No other variants were associated with diabetes risk in CCB users after multiple-testing correction. No associations were observed between any NOS1AP variant and diabetes development in non-CCB users. NOS1AP variants were not associated with diabetes risk in either African-American CCB users or non-CCB users. We have independently replicated the association between rs10494366 in NOS1AP and incident diabetes among white CCB users. Further exploration of NOS1AP variants and type 2 diabetes and functional studies of NOS1AP in type 2 diabetes pathology is warranted.


Effectiveness and immunomodulation of chemotherapeutants against scuticociliate Philasterides dicentrarchi in olive flounder.

Pagetoid reticulosis after radiotherapy of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. We describe a 60-year-old man with a history of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma on the chest, who presented with a new scaly red plaque on the same site 11 years after radiation therapy. Histological examination revealed a dense epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells consistent with pagetoid reticulosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed the infiltrate to be CD4, CD8, and CD30. Remarkably, all the atypical cells were strongly CD30, and furthermore, the CD30 cells were found exclusively in the epidermis. In the initial cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma lesion, the CD4, CD8, and focally CD30 atypical cells were well confined within the dermis with no epidermal component. To our knowledge, the present case seems to be the first description of pagetoid reticulosis presenting at the site of a previously treated dermal anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This case also represents an extreme presentation of epidermotropism and CD30 expression in pagetoid reticulosis.

Childhood abuse uncovered in a palliative care audit. This article aims to highlight potentially high levels of childhood sexual abuse within Cancer and Palliative Care Service users. During a routine audit, data was collated to quantify a perceived high level of disclosure of pre-existing psychological trauma within the palliative care caseload of a Macmillan Children and Families Therapist. Families comprised adults (generally parents or step-parents), one of whom was terminally ill or recently deceased who had direct responsibility for children and young people aged under 20 years old. Each family had at least two members using the service for advice, emotional support or counselling. A childhood sexual abuse rate of 33% for women and 10% for men was revealed. Of 59 families, 49% had one or more members who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In addition a further 9% of adults had experienced severe physical and emotional abuse in childhood. Many families had faced multiple trauma. Palliative care clinicians have access to detailed personal and family history during a highly vulnerable transition. While confidentiality is paramount it is essential to develop better data collection methods and raise the profile of childhood sexual abuse as a major contributing factor to morbidity. A whole family assessment is crucial to ensure child protection and emotional care for children facing the loss and subsequently bereaved of a parent or a carer. Clinicians must be able to offer a range of approaches which provide distressed patients with a history of childhood abuse some sense of emotional containment at the end of life, a challenge which cannot be overstated.


Rapid clearance of circulating haptoglobin from plasma during acute pulmonary embolism in rats results in HMOX1 up-regulation in peripheral blood leukocytes.

Ion selective electrode for cesium based on 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene. A polyvinylchloride (PVC) based liquid membrane ion selective electrode (ISE) for cesium was fabricated with 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene as ionophore. Different membrane constituents were investigated to realise optimum performance of the ISE developed. Of the four plasticizers and two ion additives studied, the best response was observed with membrane having 2-nitro phenyl octyl ether (oNPOE) as plasticizer and potassium tetrakis (perchloro phenyl) borate (KTpClPB) as ion additive. Linear response over concentration range of 10(-5)-10(-1)M CsCl was obtained. The Nernstian slope of the response was 56 mV per decade for Cs with a response time less than 20s. Matched potential method has been applied to find out the selectivity for Cs over several ions like Rb(+), K(+), Na(+), NH(4)(+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Ce(3+). The response of ISE for Cs(+) was fairly constant over the pH range of 3-11. The lifetime of the electrode is 9 months which is the longest life for any membrane-based Cs-ISE so far developed. The concentration of cesium in two simulated high level active waste streams was determined and results agreed well with those obtained independently employing atomic absorption spectrometry.

The role of prophylaxis in the management of von Willebrand disease: today and tomorrow. Some patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) will experience severe bleeding complications requiring intensive treatment. Up to 40% of patients with type 3 VWD experience joint bleeding, which can lead to haemophilic arthropathy. Patients with type 2A or 2B VWD are at risk of developing recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which is associated with angiodysplasia. Some children with VWD will experience epistaxis of sufficient frequency, duration, or severity to cause anaemia and have negative effects on overall health, development, and quality of life. For these patients, prophylactic use of concentrates containing von Willebrand factor may help to avoid bleeding events and their associated complications. The available clinical data suggest that secondary prophylaxis is beneficial in patients with type 3 VWD and certain patients with type 1 or 2 VWD. The VWD International Prophylaxis (VIP) trial is an ongoing study that will help to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from long-term prophylaxis, and determine the optimal approach to prophylaxis in various settings.


Phylogenomic analyses predict sistergroup relationship of nucleariids and fungi and paraphyly of zygomycetes with significant support.

Candida albicans Cyr1, Cap1 and G-actin form a sensor/effector apparatus for activating cAMP synthesis in hyphal growth. A key virulence trait of Candida albicans is its ability to undergo the yeast-to-hyphal growth transition in response to environmental signals. This transition critically requires a rapid activation of the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 to generate a cAMP spike. However, the identity of the signal sensors and mechanisms of signal processing and integration remain largely unclear. Recent evidence suggests that some sensors are embedded in Cyr1 itself. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether purified Cyr1 can respond to hyphal induction. Here, we report that Cyr1 co-purifies with Cap1 and G-actin as a tripartite complex which can increase cAMP synthesis in response to hyphal inducing signals in an actin-dependent manner. Cap1 binds Cyr1 and G-actin through its N- and C-terminus respectively. Deleting the G-actin binding sites or treating the complex with the actin toxin latrunculin A or cytochalasin A inhibits the activation of cAMP synthesis. Strains expressing Cap1 mutants lacking the G-actin binding site are impaired in both cAMP synthesis and hyphal morphogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal an essentially intact sensor/effector apparatus composed of Cyr1, Cap1 and G-actin. Furthermore, G-actin's regulatory role in this apparatus may prove to be the missing link whereby cellular actin status knowingly influences cAMP-mediated cellular processes.

Intravital imaging of stromal cell dynamics in tumors. Tumor stroma, consisting of the extracellular matrix and multiple cell types such as immune cells, fibroblasts and vascular cells, contributes to the malignancy of solid tumors by a variety of mechanisms. Intravital imaging by different microscopy techniques, especially by confocal and multi-photon microscopy, has proven to be a powerful method for analyzing the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the dynamic tumor microenvironments. Intravital imaging has fostered the acquisition of data on parameters such as motility of different cell types in distinct tumor regions or manipulated with defined challenges, kinetics of tumor cell killing by T cells or macrophage-assisted tumor cell extravasation, functionality of the vasculature, protease activity and metabolic state. Achieving the direct observation of intact tumors offered by intravital imaging provides unique insights into tumor biology that will continue to deepen our understanding of the processes leading to malignancy and of the ways they can be targeted.

[Structural-biological characteristics of tubulin interaction with dinitroanilines]. The interaction of dinitroaniline compounds with tubulin molecules is characterized by extraordinary selectivity--these matters effectively associate with plant as well as protozoan tubulin and practically don't interact with fungal and animal tubulin in spite of extraordinarily high level of similarity of their sequences. Structural features and mechanisms of this interaction are generalized and in detail analysed in this research. In particular, the regularities of dinitroaniline binding sites' structure and localization on surfaces of tubulin different subunits and tubulins of different origin are characterized. Dinitroaniline binding sites are disposed on the surfaces of longitudinal contacts between tubulin subunits, contain residues of diamine amino acids (lysine or arginine) coupling al nitrile group (s) of dinitroanilines. Binding site location on the surfaces of the same subunit of different origin (for example, plant and protozoan alpha-tubulins) is coincided, however site localisation on surface of alpha- and beta-subunits is distinct. The described sites potentially can be the binding areas for another antimicrotubular compounds, in particular, cyanoacrilates.


Is stomach spontaneously ageing? Pathophysiology of the ageing stomach.

Differential effect of high dietary fat intakes on haemorheological parameters in rats. High dietary intake of fats has been thought to be one of the major risk factors for the development of CVD. Less is known about the possible influence of fats from various sources on haemorheological abnormalities, which are considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The goal of the present study was to investigate effects of high-fat diets enriched in unsaturated fatty acids (USFA), SFA or trans-fatty acids (TFA), respectively, on haemorheological parameters in rats. Wistar female rats were divided into four groups and fed diets based on the AIN-93M formulation containing approximately 10 % energy from soyabean oil (control group) or 40 % energy from soyabean oil (USFA), palm oil (SFA) and vegetable shortening (TFA) for 8 weeks. The results showed that rats fed high-fat diets exhibited significant increases in serum TAG levels (P < 0.01), plasma viscosity (P < 0.01), whole blood viscosity (P < 0.01) and internal viscosity (P < 0.01) compared to the controls. The TFA group showed a significant decrease in erythrocyte deformability (P < 0.01) and increase in internal viscosity (P < 0.01) compared with the other groups. In addition, a significant increase in blood levels of free radicals (P < 0.01) was found in the TFA group, suggesting that the attack of oxygen-free radicals could be responsible for the impaired erythrocyte deformability. These impairments could be partly responsible for the development of various circulatory disorders. The present haemorheological study provides additional insights into the potential adverse effects of trans-fat and high-fat diets on haemorheological parameters.

Relationships between metabolic and non-metabolic susceptibility factors in benzene toxicity. Reactive metabolites formed from benzene include benzene oxide, trans,trans muconaldehyde, quinones, thiol adducts, phenolic metabolites and oxygen radicals. Susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene has been suggested to occur partly because of polymorphisms in enzymes involved in benzene metabolism which include cytochrome P450 2E1, epoxide hydrolases, myeloperoxidase, glutathione-S-transferases and quinone reductases. However, susceptibility factors not directly linked to benzene metabolism have also been associated with its toxicity and include p53, proteins involved in DNA repair, genomic stability and expression of cytokines and/or cell adhesion molecules. In this work, we examine potential relationships between metabolic and non-metabolic susceptibility factors using the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) as an example. NQO1 may also impact pathways in addition to metabolism of quinones due to protein-protein interactions or other mechanisms related to NQO1 activity. NQO1 has been implicated in stabilizing p53 and in maintaining microtubule integrity. Inhibition or knockdown of NQO1 in bone marrow endothelial cells has been found to lead to deficiencies of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecule expression after TNFalpha stimulation. These examples illustrate how the metabolic susceptibility factor NQO1 may influence non-metabolic susceptibility pathways for benzene toxicity.

Transient cardiac ballooning--the syndrome.

In vitro synergistic activity of tigecycline and colistin against XDR-Acinetobacter baumannii. The emergence of extensive drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii limits the therapeutic options and leads to high mortality in intensive care units. Combined antibiotic therapy is frequently recommended for the treatment of these infections. Colistin (CO) and tigecycline (TIG), alone or in combination with other antimicrobials, are the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of these resistant infections. In this study, the in vitro synergistic activity of TIG and CO were tested for 25 XDR-A. baumannii strains isolated from ventilator-associated pneumonia by the Etest method. Resistance to CO was not detected, whereas 8% of the strains were resistant to TIG. The TIG-CO combination was more synergistic than TIG-rifampin and CO-rifampin according to the fractional inhibitory concentration index. No antagonism was detected between the drugs in the study. There was no strong correlation between the activity of the combinations with reference to strains or genotypes. Our results suggest that the combined use of TIG and CO may be useful for the treatment of XDR-A. baumannii infections.

[Reducing the frequency of fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion on the basis of the results of thromboelastographic study in neurosurgical patients with intraoperative blood loss]. The paper gives the results of a study of the time course of changes in the major laboratorily determined hemostatic parameters, as well as the main characteristics of a thromboelastographic curve in 95 neurosurgical patients who developed significant intraoperative blood loss at surgery. The patients were divided into 2 comparable groups: 1) a decision on fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion was taken only on the basis of laboratory parameters; 2) this was done on the basis of thromboelastographic data. In Group 2, the frequency of fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion proved to be 4 times less than that in Group 1. The use of thromboelastography to evaluate the hemostatic system during operations with a significant blood loss volume permits a reduction in the frequency of fresh frozen donor plasma, without deteriorating the results of treatment.


Sex differences in outcome after mild traumatic brain injury.

Effect of short-term 50 Hz electromagnetic field exposure on the behavior of rats. Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field generated by transformer stations located within buildings has been suspected to initiate non-specific health problems. This possibility was examined in model experiments in rats. Following short-term exposure (50 Hz, 500 mircoT, 20 min), situational and social anxiety as well as locomotor activity pattern were examined by several different tests (elevated plus-maze, novel object exploration, social interaction and territoriality).Based on our results having obtained so far, it seems that these field parameters (that equals the official reference limit for workers) may cause some kind of discomfort, may influence behavior, increase passivity and situational anxiety, but has no verified effect on the social and territorial behavior.

Altered expression of apoptotic factors and synaptic markers in postmortem brain from bipolar disorder patients. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a progressive psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent changes of mood and is associated with cognitive decline. There is evidence of excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, upregulated arachidonic acid (AA) cascade signaling and brain atrophy in BD patients. These observations suggest that BD pathology may be associated with apoptosis as well as with disturbed synaptic function. To test this hypothesis, we measured mRNA and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic (Bax, BAD, caspase-9 and caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic factors (BDNF and Bcl-2) and of pre- and post-synaptic markers (synaptophysin and drebrin), in postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from 10 BD patients and 10 age-matched controls. Consistent with the hypothesis, BD brains showed significant increases in protein and mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic factors and significant decreases of levels of the anti-apoptotic factors and the synaptic markers, synaptophysin and drebrin. These differences may contribute to brain atrophy and progressive cognitive changes in BD.

Cellular mechanisms of cardioprotection by calorie restriction: state of the science and future perspectives. Evidence from animal models and preliminary studies in humans indicates that calorie restriction (CR) delays cardiac aging and can prevent cardiovascular disease. These effects are mediated by a wide spectrum of biochemical and cellular adaptations, including redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function, inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Despite the beneficial effects of CR, its large-scale implementation is challenged by applicability issues as well as health concerns. However, preclinical studies indicate that specific compounds, such as resveratrol, may mimic many of the effects of CR, thus potentially obviating the need for drastic food intake reductions. Results from ongoing clinical trials will reveal whether the intriguing alternative of CR mimetics represents a safe and effective strategy to promote cardiovascular health and delay cardiac aging in humans.

Decrease of hypervirulent Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 in the Netherlands. After the first outbreaks of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 (North American pulsed-field type 1, restriction endonuclease analysis group BI) in the Netherlands in 2005, a national surveillance programme for C. difficile infection (CDI) was started. Furthermore, national guidelines were developed to rapidly recognise type 027 infections and prevent further spread. The mean incidence of CDI measured in 14 hospitals remained stable throughout the years: an incidence of 18 per 10,000 admissions was seen in 2007 and 2008. Between April 2005 and June 2009 a total of 2,788 samples were available for PCR ribotyping. A decrease was seen in the number and incidence of type 027 after the second half of 2006. In the first half of 2009, the percentage of type 027 isolates among all CDI decreased to 3.0%, whereas type 001 increased to 27.5%. Type 014 was present in 9.3% of the isolates and C. difficile type 078 slightly increased to 9.1%. We conclude that currently there is a significant decrease in type 027-associated CDI in the Netherlands.

Risk of heart failure relapse in subsequent pregnancy among peripartum cardiomyopathy mothers. To quantify the level of risk for heart failure relapse in a subsequent pregnancy in women who have had peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), and to test the hypothesis that meeting additional criteria may help lower the risk. Prospectively-identified PPCM patients volunteering between 2003 and 2009 were identified from the PPCM Registry of Hôpital Albert Schweitzer, Deschapelles, Haiti, and an internet support group. Data were assessed for full adherence to monitoring and diagnostic criteria, clinical data, statistical analysis, and reporting. Of 61 post-PPCM pregnancies identified, there were 18 relapses (29.5%) of heart failure. Of 26 pregnancies with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 0.55 prior to the pregnancy, relapse occurred in 12 (46.2%) pregnancies. Of 35 pregnancies with an LVEF of 0.55 or greater prior to the pregnancy, relapse occurred in 6 (17.1%) (P<0.01). No relapses occurred in 9 women who also demonstrated adequate contractile reserve. The most important criterion associated with reduced risk for heart failure relapse in a post-PPCM pregnancy is recovery defined by an LVEF 0.55 or greater before the subsequent pregnancy. Exercise stress echocardiography showing adequate contractile reserve may help to identify women at an even lower risk of relapse.


NADP+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase, a corpora allata enzyme involved in juvenile hormone synthesis.

Endo- and exo-inulinases: enzyme-substrate interaction and rational immobilization. Three-dimensional models of exoinulinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and endoinulinase from Aspergillus niger were built up by means of homology modeling. The crystal structure of exoinulinase from Aspergillus awamori was used as a template, which is the sole structure of inulinase resolved so far. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the differences between the two inulinases in terms of substrate selectivity. The analysis of the structural differences between the two inulinases provided the basis for the explanation of their different regio-selectivity and for the understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions. Surface analysis was performed to point out structural features that can affect the efficiency of enzymes also after immobilization. The computational analysis of the three-dimensional models proved to be an effective tool for acquiring information and allowed to formulate an optimal immobilized biocatalyst even more active that the native one, thus enabling the full exploitation of the catalytic potential of these enzymes.

The policy and politics of emerging academic-service partnerships. The type of traditional relationships and behaviors of academe and service no longer match the needs of an emerging and reforming health care system. Rather, the relationships required for the evolving health care system involve a cooperative and collaborative partnership. Models of the "Traditional Professional Nurse Career Trajectory" and the "Shared, Career-long Professional Nurse Formation" are contrasted. The dedicated education unit clinical teaching model created by the University of Portland and Providence Health and Services is offered as an exemplar of a new partnership between academe and service. The political dynamics and resulting policy changes are presented to illuminate the kinds of new thinking and changes required for a partnership model.

IKKepsilon phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha Ser-167 and contribution to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. IKKepsilon has recently been identified as a breast cancer oncogene. Elevated levels of IKKepsilon are associated with cell survival and growth. Here, we show that IKKepsilon interacts with and phosphorylates estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) on serine 167 in vitro and in vivo. As a result, IKKepsilon induces ERalpha transactivation activity and enhances ERalpha binding to DNA. Cyclin D1, a major target of ERalpha, is transcriptionally up-regulated by IKKepsilon in a phospho-ERalpha-Ser-167-dependent manner. Further, overexpression of IKKepsilon induces tamoxifen resistance, whereas knockdown of IKKepsilon sensitizes cells to tamoxifen-induced cell death. These data suggest that ERalpha is a bona fide substrate of IKKepsilon and IKKepsilon plays an important role in tamoxifen resistance. Thus, IKKepsilon represents a critical therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Multiple mating by females of two Bactrocera species (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae). Multiple mating was investigated in two tephritid species when females were under minimal male pressure because they were each confined with a single male in cages 20 x 20 x 20 cm and observed daily until they died. Laboratory-reared females of Bactrocera cucumis (French) lived up to 274 days and refractory periods averaged 59-63 days. However, the distribution of matings among B. cucumis females was not significantly different to that expected by chance. Wild females of Bactrocera cacuminata (Hering) reared from field-collected fruits of Solanum mauritianum Scopoli lived for up to 134 days and mated up to three times with refractory periods between matings averaging 27-39 days. The distribution of the number of matings among females of B. cacuminata was non-random because of the high proportion of non-maters (50%); but, when only females mating more than once were considered, there was no significant departure from random expectation.

Twigs into branches: how a filopodium becomes a dendrite. A dendrite grows by sprouting filopodia, some of which mature into stable dendrite branches that bear synapses and sprout filopodia of their own. Recent work has shown that a filopodium begins deciding to become a stable branch within 1min of contacting a presynaptic partner, but what triggers this decision remains unknown. We consider the evidence for three possible triggers: activity of neurotransmitter receptors, signaling through adhesion proteins, and heightened membrane tension as the filopodium attempts to retract but is held in place by adhesive contacts with the target. Of these, membrane tension-induced signaling is especially appealing, as it would serve as a general reporter of attachment, independent of which specific adhesion molecules are used.

[Bioinformatic search of plant protein kinases, participating in microtubule protein phosphorylation and cell division regulation]. Bioinformatic search of plant homologues of human protein kinases SLK, PAK6, PAK7, MARK1, MAST2, TTBK1, TTBK2, AURKA, PLK1, PLK2 and PASK participating in microtubular protein phosphorylation and cell division regulation is carried out. The homologues of protein kinases SLK, MAST2 and AURKA were identified. It is found that closest homologue of human AURKA protein kinase is a protein with unknown function A7PY12_VITVI (STALK--Serine-Threonine Aurora-Like Kinase) from grape (Vitis vinifera). Reconstruction and analysis of three-dimensional structure of STALK protein confirmed its relation to the group of AURKA-like protein kinases.

Restoration of photoreceptor outer segment after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. To report photoreceptor restoration and visual outcomes after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. Retrospective, observational case series. We prospectively studied the tomographic features of reattached retinas in 20 eyes with a macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography 1, 3, and 6 months after 3-port vitrectomy with SF(6) gas tamponade. All eyes were examined more than 3 months after surgery. The optical coherence tomography foveal findings were classified as a disrupted inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) line, a residual foveal detachment, and a continuous IS/OS line. A disrupted IS/OS line was seen in 11 eyes (55%) at 1 month and in 8 eyes (40%) at 3 months, a foveal detachment was seen in 8 eyes (40%) at 1 month and in 7 eyes (35%) at 3 months, and a continuous IS/OS line was seen in 1 eye (5%) at 1 month and in 5 eyes (25%) at 3 months. In 18 eyes followed up for 6 months, optical coherence tomography showed a disrupted IS/OS line in 3 eyes (17%), a foveal detachment in 6 eyes (33%), and a continuous IS/OS line in 9 eyes (50%). The mean best-corrected visual acuities at 1 and 6 months were 0.26 and 0.16 with a disrupted IS/OS line, 0.60 and 0.95 with a foveal detachment, and 0.8 and 0.95 with a continuous IS/OS line. The mean best-corrected visual acuity was significantly (P < .0001) lower with a disrupted IS/OS line compared with the other formations at 6 months. The IS/OS line at the fovea recovered gradually after surgery. The postoperative visual acuity was correlated with a restored IS/OS line.

[Clinical aspects and epidemiology of uncomplicated cystitis in women. German results of the ARESC Study]. Uncomplicated cystitis in women is among the most frequent infections in the community setting. The German results of the international ARESC Study are reported concerning clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and investigated clinically including urinalysis and urine culture. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antimicrobials In Germany a total of 442 patients were enrolled and 412 were eligible. A positive urine culture (cfu>/=10(4)/ml) was found in 335 (81.3%); 325 (97.1%) of them had a monoinfection. A total of 317 uropathogens were further analyzed in a central laboratory (Genua). Escherichia coli was the most frequent (76.7%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (4.7%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.5%), enterococci (2.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (97.9%) followed by mecillinam (97.5%), nitrofurantoin (95.4%), and ciprofloxacin (95.4%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (59.2%) followed by cotrimoxazole (74.0%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.1%), mecillinam (97.5%), ciprofloxacin (92.3%), and nitrofurantoin (86.3%). The lowest rates were found again for ampicillin (56.6%) and cotrimoxazole (73.9%). Fosfomycin, mecillinam (not available in Germany), and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Because of increasing resistance rates cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim) and fluoroquinolones are generally not recommended as first-choice drugs for empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.

Hematology: first-line bortezomib benefits patients with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib-based regimens are beneficial in the treatment of patients with symptomatic, newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. researchers who investigated the efficacy and safety of single-agent bortezomib as first-line therapy in patients with myeloma have particularly emphasized the incidence and management of peripheral neuropathy, which is the most common adverse effect of bortezomib administration.

Left atrial pressure reduction for mitral stenosis reverses left atrial direction-dependent conduction abnormalities. Left atrial (LA) stretch-associated electrophysiological changes in patients with mitral stenosis (MS) predispose to atrial fibrillation. We hypothesized that the normalization of the pressure gradient by percutaneous transvenous mitral balloon valvotomy (PTMV) affects LA but not right atrial (RA) conduction, depending on the site of stimulation. Because direction-dependent (asymmetric) changes of conduction may contribute to arrhythmogenesis, we assessed conduction symmetry in MS patients and tested whether it is restored by PTMV. In nine patients with MS, atrial effective refractory period and local activation times (ATs) were determined during stimulation before and after PTMV, with up to four decapolar catheters (LA and RA). Eight patients with ventricular pre-excitation served as controls. ATs at basic cycle length were similar before and after PTMV. With stimulation from either atrium, they were about 45 ms in the ipsilateral atrium and about 115 ms in the contralateral atrium. With premature stimulation, ATs increased dramatically. The shortest ATs were found in the RA with RA stimulation (78 +/- 9 and 80 +/- 6 ns, before and after PTMV). PTMV caused a shortening in LA-ATs (following LA stimulation) from 118 +/- 14 to 82 +/- 5 ms (before and after; P < 0.05). Asymmetry in conduction properties was therefore normalized by PTMV. PTMV led to a decrease in RA-ATs (following LA stimulation) from 196 +/- 11 to 174 +/- 13 ms (P < 0.02). In addition, following RA stimulation, the dispersion in ATs in the LA decreased significantly by PTMV (from 66 +/- 10 to 34 +/- 7 ms; P < 0.02). MS is associated with LA conduction delay, increased LA dispersion of conduction, and conduction asymmetry. These changes are immediately reversible by PTMV.

Molecular biology of familial and sporadic vestibular schwannomas: implications for novel therapeutics. Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are benign tumors arising from the sheath of cranial nerve VIII. The pathogenesis underlying most familial and sporadic VSs has been linked to a mutation in a single gene, the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene located on chromosome 22, band q11-13.1. In this review, the authors summarized what is known about the epidemiology of NF2 mutations and patients with VSs. The authors also discuss the function of the NF2 gene product, merlin, and describe the known and hypothetical effects of genetic mutations that lead to merlin dysfunction on a broad variety of cellular and histological end points. A better understanding of the molecular pathobiology of VSs may lead to novel therapeutics to augment current modalities of treatment while minimizing morbidity.

Alcohol consumption-related antigay aggression: theoretical considerations for individual- and societal-level interventions. A substantial literature has identified risk factors for intoxicated aggression and the mechanisms by which these effects are exerted. This theoretical and empirical foundation is a valuable resource for the development of treatment inventions. In contrast, a comparable literature is not available to guide development of clinical interventions for intoxicated antigay aggression. To address this gap in the literature, the present article (1) identifies risk factors and mechanisms pertinent to alcohol consumption-related antigay aggression, (2) advances predictions regarding how alcohol will increase antigay aggression, and (3) reviews societal- and individual-level considerations for intervention based upon these hypotheses.


Autophagy inhibition in combination cancer treatment.

Early detection of apoptosis in living cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Early detection of apoptotic cells via caspase activity is demonstrated with fast response time. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is used to identify the presence of a cleaved fluorogenic probe based on the fluorescence of rhodamine 110 in Jurkat cells. FCS curves are shown to be markedly different for autofluorescent (non-apoptotic) cells, whereas cells with cleaved probe showed diffusion and molecular brightness characteristic of rhodamine 110. Using FCS measurements, cells were identified as apoptotic on the basis of the presence of autocorrelated fluorescence, average molecular brightness (eta), and molecular dwell time (tau (D)). Apoptotic cells identified in this manner were detected as early as 45 min after induction. Unlike other methods with similar identification times, such as western blotting and electron microscopy, cells remain viable for further analysis. This multi-parameter approach is rapid, flexible, and does not require transfection of the cells prior to analysis, enabling apoptosis to be identified early in a wide variety of cell types.

Investigating the mechanism of clofibric acid removal in Fe(0)/H2O systems. Since the introduction of iron wall technology, the inherent relationship between contaminant removal and iron corrosion has been mostly attributed to electron transfer from the metal body (direct reduction). This thermodynamically founded premise has failed to explain several experimental facts. Recently, a new concept considering adsorption and co-precipitation as fundamental contaminant removal mechanisms was introduced. This consistent concept has faced very skeptic views and necessarily needs experimental validation. The present work was the first independent attempt to validate the new concept using clofibric acid (CLO) as model compound. For this purpose, a powdered Fe(0) material (Fe(0)) was used in CLO removal experiments under various experimental conditions. Additional experiments were performed with plated Fe(0) (mFe(0): Fe(0)/Pd(0), Fe(0)/Ni(0)) to support the discussion of removal mechanism. Main investigated experimental variables included: abundance of O(2), abundance of iron corrosion products (ICPs) and shaking operations. Results corroborated the concept that quantitative contaminant removal in Fe(0)/H(2)O systems occurs within the oxide-film in the vicinity of Fe(0). Additionally, mixing type and shaking intensity significantly influenced the extent of CLO removal. More importantly, HPLC/MS revealed that the identity of reaction products depends on the extent of iron corrosion or the abundance of ICPs. The investigation of the CLO/Fe(0)/H(2)O system disproved the popular view that direct reduction mediates contaminant removal in the presence of Fe(0).

Expression of leptin receptor gene in developing and adult zebrafish. Interactions of leptin and leptin receptors play crucial roles during animal development and regulation of appetite and energy balance. In this study we analyzed expression pattern of a zebrafish leptin receptor gene in both developing and adult zebrafish using in situ hybridization and Q-PCR methods. Zebrafish leptin receptor message (lepr) was detected in all embryonic and larval stages examined, and in adult zebrafish. In embryonic zebrafish, lepr was mainly expressed in the notochord. As development proceeded, lepr expression in the notochord decreased, while its expression in several other tissues, including the trunk muscles and gut, became evident. In both larval and adult brains, large lepr expressing cells were detected in similar regions of the hindbrain. In adult zebrafish, lepr expression was also observed in several other brain regions including the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the fish homolog of the arcuate nucleus. Q-PCR experiments confirmed lepr expression in the adult fish brain, and also showed lepr expression in several adult tissues including liver, muscle and gonads. Our results showed that lepr expression was both spatially and temporally regulated.


Comparative evaluation of quercetin, isoquercetin and rutin as inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase.

Treatment of bladder diverticula, impaired detrusor contractility, and low bladder compliance. Bladder diverticula are common enough to be encountered by most urologists in practice but are reported less frequently in the literature than they were 50 years ago. Some patients can be managed nonoperatively, whereas others will need surgical intervention consisting of bladder outlet reduction and possibly removal of the diverticulum itself. In addition to the decision to operate, the timing of each intervention deserves careful consideration. Cystoscopy, computed tomography with contrast, urodynamic studies, cytology, and voiding cystourethrography play important roles in informing the clinician. Many new techniques for treatment of the bladder outlet and the diverticulum are available, such as laparoscopy and robotic surgery.

Two-dimensional proteome reference map for the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus geothermalis. 2-DE reference maps for Deinococcus geothermalis cytosolic and cell envelope proteomes were constructed. In total, 403 spots were identified as 299 different proteins. Unique in the proteomes were four subunits of V-type ATPase and Deinococcus specific proteins constituting one-fourth of cell envelope proteome. The cytoplasmic proteome included enzymes of the central carbon metabolism, chaperones, enzymes of protein and DNA repair, and oxidative stress. A total of 34 abundant proteins with unknown function may relate to the extreme stress tolerance of D. geothermalis.

The role of Sirt1: at the crossroad between promotion of longevity and protection against Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Sirt1, a mammalian member of the sirtuin gene family, holds great potential for promoting longevity, preventing against disease and increasing cell survival. For example, studies suggest that the beneficial impact of caloric restriction in promoting longevity and cellular function may be mediated, in part, by Sirt1 through mechanisms involving PGC-1alpha, which plays important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and inflammatory and antioxidant responses. Sirt1 may also interfere with mechanisms implicated in pathological disorders. We will present recent evidence indicating that Sirt1 may protect against Alzheimer's disease by interfering with the generation of beta-amyloid peptides. We will discuss Sirt1 as a potential novel target, in addition to the development of Sirt1 activators for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Animal transgenesis: an overview. Transgenic animals are extensively used to study in vivo gene function as well as to model human diseases. The technology for producing transgenic animals exists for a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species. The mouse is the most utilized organism for research in neurodegenerative diseases. The most commonly used techniques for producing transgenic mice involves either the pronuclear injection of transgenes into fertilized oocytes or embryonic stem cell-mediated gene targeting. Embryonic stem cell technology has been most often used to produce null mutants (gene knockouts) but may also be used to introduce subtle genetic modifications down to the level of making single nucleotide changes in endogenous mouse genes. Methods are also available for inducing conditional gene knockouts as well as inducible control of transgene expression. Here, we review the main strategies for introducing genetic modifications into the mouse, as well as in other vertebrate and invertebrate species. We also review a number of recent methodologies for the production of transgenic animals including retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, RNAi-mediated gene knockdown and somatic cell mutagenesis combined with nuclear transfer, methods that may be more broadly applicable to species where both pronuclear injection and ES cell technology have proven less practical.

Urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein predicts adverse outcomes in acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition with significant associated morbidity and mortality. The insensitivity and non-specificity of traditional markers of renal dysfunction prevent timely diagnosis, estimation of the severity of renal injury, and the administration of possible therapeutic agents. Here, we determine the prognostic ability of urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), and further characterize its sensitivity and specificity as a biomarker of AKI. Initial western blot studies found increased urinary L-FABP in patients with confirmed AKI. A more extensive cross-sectional study found significant increases in urinary L-FABP, normalized to urinary creatinine, in 92 patients with established AKI compared with 62 patients without clinical evidence of AKI. In hospitalized patients, the diagnostic performance of urinary L-FABP for AKI, assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.93. This compares favorably with other established biomarkers of AKI such as kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and interleukin-18. Our study shows that age-adjusted urinary L-FABP levels were significantly higher in patients with poor outcome, defined as the requirement for renal replacement therapy or the composite end point of death or renal replacement therapy.

Treating infant sleep disturbance: does maternal mood impact upon effectiveness? To explore whether mild-to-moderate maternal depression affects the effectiveness of a behavioural approach to treating infant sleep disturbance (ISD). The health records of 90 mothers attending an inpatient parenting service for management of their 5-12-month-old infant's sleep difficulties were examined. These records contained detailed, nurse-completed, 24-hour behaviour charts of infant sleeping and crying. Participants were allocated to the depression group based on Edinburgh Depression Scale score and/or review of mental health assessment notes. There were no differences between infants of mothers with (n= 39) or without (n= 51) depression on either (i) the severity of their initial sleeping difficulty, or (ii) their response to behavioural treatment. Both groups showed significant improvements over the 5-day stay on all sleep variables observed, including number of night wakings, time to fall asleep, time spent crying at night and total time slept at night. Mild-to-moderate maternal depression does not appear to attenuate ISD behavioural treatment outcomes. Given ISD treatment has been shown to improve maternal mood, the results of this study argue against recommendations initially to address maternal mood in isolation when managing ISD.

Beyond cuticular hydrocarbons: evidence of proteinaceous secretion specific to termite kings and queens. In 1959, P. Karlson and M. Lüscher introduced the term 'pheromone', broadly used nowadays for various chemicals involved in intraspecific communication. To demonstrate the term, they depicted the situation in termite societies, where king and queen inhibit the reproduction of nest-mates by an unknown chemical substance. Paradoxically, half a century later, neither the source nor the chemical identity of this 'royal' pheromone is known. In this study, we report for the first time the secretion of polar compounds of proteinaceous origin by functional reproductives in three termite species, Prorhinotermes simplex, Reticulitermes santonensis and Kalotermes flavicollis. Aqueous washes of functional reproductives contained sex-specific proteinaceous compounds, virtually absent in non-reproducing stages. Moreover, the presence of these compounds was clearly correlated with the age of reproductives and their reproductive status. We discuss the putative function of these substances in termite caste recognition and regulation.

Motorcycle accident injury profiles in Jamaica: an audit from the University Hospital of the West Indies. There is little data available on the prevalence of motorcycle accidents, their resultant injuries and the demand on the health care services in Jamaica. We performed a descriptive, analytical study to evaluate the extent of this problem and the need for preventative national policy measures. Between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2007, demographic and clinical data on all motorcycle accident victims admitted to the University Hospital of the West Indies were collected in a prospective database. The data were analysed using the SPSS version 12.0. Of 270 motorcycle accident victims, there were 257 (95.2%) males and 13 (4.8%) females. Overall, 134 (49.6%) victims wore helmets at the time of their accident. The more common injuries were as follows: soft tissue trauma 270 (100%); head injuries 143 (53.0%); long bone fractures 126 (46.7%); abdominal injuries 38 (14.1%); thoracic injuries 71 (26.3%); vascular injuries 11 (4.1%). The mean injury severity score was 9.0 (SD 9.4; Median 8; Mode 4). There were 195 patients needing surgical intervention in the form of orthopaedic operations (94), neurosurgical operations (43), abdominal operations (49) and vascular operations (14). The mean duration of hospitalisation was 10 days (SD 11.2; Range 0-115; Median 6; Mode 3). There were 12 (4.4%) deaths, 9 (75%) due to traumatic brain injuries. Fatal injuries were more common in males (11) and un-helmeted patients (10). Motorcycle accidents take a heavy toll on this health care facility in Jamaica. Measures to prevent motorcycle accidents and reduce consequent injuries may be one way in which legislators can preserve precious resources that are spent during these incidents. This can be achieved through active measures such as educational campaigns, adherence to traffic regulations and enforcement of helmet laws.

African legumes: a vital but under-utilized resource. Although nodulated legumes have been used by indigenous peoples in Africa for centuries, their full potential has never been realized. With modern technology there is scope for rapid improvement of both plant and microbial germplasm. This review gives examples of some recent developments in the form of case studies; these range from multipurpose human food crops, such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), through to beverages (teas) that are also income-generating such as rooibos (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren, honeybush (Cyclopia Vent. spp.), and the widely used food additive gum arabic (Acacia senegal (L.) Willd.). These and other potential crops are well-adapted to the many different soil and climatic conditions of Africa, in particular, drought and low nutrients. All can nodulate and fix nitrogen, with varying degrees of effectiveness and using a range of bacterial symbionts. The further development of these and other species is essential, not only for African use, but also to retain the agricultural diversity that is essential for a changing world that is being increasingly dominated by a few crops such as soybean.

PEGylated lactoferrin enhances its hepatoprotective effects on acute liver injury induced by D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide in rats. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to proteins in order to increase their half-life in circulation and reduce their immunogenicity in vivo. The present study was conducted to examine whether two different sizes of PEGylated bovine lactoferrin (40k- and 20k-PEG-bLf) would enhance the protective effect of native bLf on liver injury induced by D-galactosamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. The treatment of PEGylated bLf more remarkably prevented the elevation of serum levels of hepatic enzyme markers and inhibited inflammatory and hemorrhagic changes and hepatic apoptosis induced by GalN/LPS than native bLf. The treatment of PEGylated bLf more significantly inhibited the increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) in serum caused by GaIN/LPS, and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) production more than native bLf. PEGylated bLf decreased serum levels of nitric oxide (NO) more than native bLf. These results indicate that PEGylated bLf inhibits more significantly the induction of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and NO than native bLf, resulting in the enhancement of its prevention of fulminant liver failure induced by GalN/LPS in rats. The present study provided evidence that PEGylated bLf may offer a novel alternative therapy for the prevention of acute hepatic failure through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.

Scleral penetrations and perforations in strabismus surgery: incidence, risk factors and sequelae. To evaluate the incidence and identify associated risk factors and sequelae of scleral penetrations and perforations during strabismus surgery. Medical records of patients who underwent strabismus surgery at Siriraj Hospital between June 2001 and May 2006 were reviewed. Strabismus operations were performed by residents in ophthalmology training, pediatric ophthalmology fellows, or attending physicians. The authors documented demographic data, surgical techniques, and management of the scleral penetrations and perforations. All patients with scleral penetrations or perforations were examined intraoperation by indirect ophthalmoscopy and followed up for at least 6 months to determine late sequelae of this complication. Of the 1025 patients and 2195 procedures, scleral penetrations (full thickness scleral pass without retinal break) were recognized in 15 procedures (0.68%). No scleral perforation (full thickness scleral pass with retinal break) was found. The mean age of these complications during strabismus operations was 14.26 years. Scleral penetrations were more likely to occur with rectus muscle recession than rectus muscle resection. All sclera penetrations occurred while rectus muscles were recessed and reattached to the new insertions. All 15 scleral penetrations were performed by residents in training or pediatric ophthalmology fellows. Re-operation in the same extraocular muscle was not a risk factor for this complication. All patients with scleral penetrations were managed by dilated pupils and fundus examinations and the authors applied cryotherapy or indirect ophthalmoscopic laser to the retinal lesions. Retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis were not found in the present study. The incidence of scleral penetrations in the present study was 0.68%. Risk factors of scleral penetrations in strabismus surgery are rectus muscle recession and surgeon factors. No serious complications such as retinal detachment or endophthalmitis were found in this study.


The dynamic interaction of quality and efficiency in the emergency department: Squaring the circle?

[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Legionella pneumonia]. We present a case report with a 49-year-old woman with legionella pneumonia and fulminant respiratory failure. Despite maximal conventional respirator treatment with positive pressure ventilation, 100% oxygen and pharmacological treatment in an intensive care unit, further deterioration with hypoxemia and multi-organ failure occurred. The patient was referred to ECMO as a last option of treatment. Eight days of treatment with ECMO was completed without any complications except critical illness polyneuropathia (CIP) for which she was treated for an additional four weeks in the ICU.

[Expression of heterogenous pyruvate carboxylase in Escherichia coli with lactose as inducer and its effect on succinate production]. Escherichia coli strain DC1515, deficient in glucose phosphotransferase (ptsG), lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) and pyruvate:formate lyase (pflA), is a promising candidate for the fermentative production of succinate. To further improve the succinate producing capability of DC1515, we constructed plasmid pTrchisA-pyc with heterogenous pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) from Bacillus subtilis 168 under the Trc promoter and introduced it into DC1515. We used lactose as a substitute of IPTG to induce pyc. We optimized the culture conditions such as the lactose addition time, the lactose concentration and the culture temperature after induction for succinate production. We also explored the effect of lactose supplement during the fermentation. The results showed that pyc can be expressed under lactose induction in the fermentative medium with 15 g/L glucose due to the deficient of ptsG in DC1515. Under optimized conditions, the final succinate concentration reached to 15.17 g/L, which was 1.78-fold higher than that of control strain. If complementing lactose twice to the concentration of 1 g/L during the fermentation, the final succinate concentration could further reach to 17.54 g/L. This work might provide valuable information for gene expression in E. coli strains using lactose as inducer for succinate production in a glucose-medium. Due to the reduced cost, E. coli is becoming a more promising strain for succinate production through fermentation.

Update on disparities in oral health and access to dental care for America's children. This contribution updates federal survey findings on children's oral health and dental care since release of Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General in 2000. Dental caries experience continued at high levels, impacting 40% of all children aged 2 to 11 years, with greater disease and untreated disease burden borne by poor and low-income children and racial/ethnic minorities. Caries rates increased for young children (to 28% of 2- to 5-year-olds in the period 1999-2004) and remained flat for most other ages. The total volume of caries and untreated caries increased as the numbers of children increased. The proportion of US children with a dental visit increased modestly (from 42% to 45% between 1996 and 2004), with the greatest increases occurring among children newly covered by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Disparities in dental visits continued to be evidenced by age, family income, race/ethnicity, and caregiver education. Parental reports of children's oral health and dental care parallel these findings and also reveal higher unmet dental needs among children with special health care needs. Racial- and income-based disparities in both oral health and dental care continue into adolescence and young adulthood. These disparities can, as in the past, be expected to exacerbate under the forces of growing income disparities and demographic trends.

Childhood economic conditions and length of life: evidence from the UK Boyd Orr cohort, 1937-2005. We study the importance of childhood socioeconomic conditions in predicting differences in life expectancy using data from a large sample of children collected in 16 locations in England and Scotland in 1937-39, who have been traced through official death records up to 2005. We estimate a number of duration of life models that control for unobserved family heterogeneity. Our results confirm that childhood conditions such as household income and the quality of the home environment are significant predictors of longevity. Importantly, however, the role of socioeconomic status appears to differ across cause of death, with household income being a significant predictor of death from smoking-related cancer. Moreover, we find that (1) poor housing conditions in childhood is associated with reduced longevity, that (2) early doctor-assessed childhood health conditions significantly predict a reduced length of life, that (3) children born in a location with relatively high infant mortality rates live significantly fewer years, and that (4) there is a high correlation in longevity across children from the same family across all causes of death. We estimate that the difference in life expectancy between those with the 'best' and 'worst' observable characteristics is about 9 years, which increases to 20 years when we take into account the 'best' and 'worst' observable and unobservable household characteristics.

Oxidant stress due to non ionic low osmolar contrast medium in rat kidney. Contrast media may cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in risk group. This study was taken up to establish possible effects of non ionic low osmolar contrast medium administration on oxidant/antioxidant status and nitric oxide (NO) levels in rat kidney tissues. Fourteen female, 14 wk old Wistar-albino rats were divided into 2 groups of 7 rats each (control and contrast groups). Non ionic low osmolar contrast medium was administered iv to the animals in the contrast group. The day after, animals were sacrificed and malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO levels and activities of antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT)] and oxidant [xanthine oxidase (XO)] enzymes were measured in kidney tissues. Serum creatinine levels were measured to evaluate kidney functions. Contrast medium administration caused an increase in MDA levels and a decrease in NO levels in kidney tissues. The results suggest that non ionic low osmolar contrast medium administration leads to accelerated oxidant reactions and decreased NO level in rat kidney tissues. Further studies need to be done to assess the role of these changes in CIN.

Identification of a cis-regulatory element that acts in companion cell-specific expression of AtMT2B promoter through the use of Brassica vasculature and gene-gun-mediated transient assay. The molecular basis underlying the development, maintenance and function of companion cells in plants is largely unknown. The identification of several genes expressed specifically in companion cells implies the contribution of specific transcriptional elements to the identity of companion cells. However, less is known about the companion cell-specific transcriptional regulation of promoters. We established a novel assay method using gene-gun delivery of partially deleted promoters to string-containing vascular bundles excised from the petiole of Brassica napus for the rapid identification of cis-elements. To test this system, we analyzed the Arabidopsis METALLOTHIONEIN 2B (MT2B) gene, which is expressed in companion cells. The assay revealed a 49-bp region possessing two predicted cis-regulatory elements: a G-box and an evening element-related sequence (EEr), and EEr showed higher activity. We confirmed the reliability of the result with stable transformants harboring a deleted MT2B promoter:GUS transgene. The lack of EEr completely eliminated the MT2B-like expression, but the lack of G-box did not eliminate it. We conclude that EEr is a major cis-regulatory element of the MT2B promoter. Our method will help to explain the transcriptional background of companion cells through the rapid identification of cis-regulatory regions.

Development of a model of tissue with potentially malignant disorders (PMD) in the hamster cheek pouch to explore the long-term potential therapeutic and/or toxic effects of different therapeutic modalities. Given that locoregional recurrences developing from a tissue with potentially malignant disorders (PMD) in oral mucosa are a frequent cause of therapeutic failure, and that tissue with PMD is dose-limiting, the aim of the present study was to develop a model of tissue with PMD to evaluate the long-term therapeutic/toxic effects of different therapeutic modalities. We evaluated 5 carcinogenesis protocols based on topical application of the carcinogen dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene in the hamster cheek pouch, twice a week for 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks and the classical 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Long-term follow-up (8 months after protocol completion) was only possible with the 4- and 6-week carcinogenesis protocols. Tumour development increased progressively with time and aggressiveness of the carcinogenesis protocols. The time at which tumours developed in > or =90% of the animals was at protocol completion (T0) for the 12-week protocol, 1 month post-T0 for the 8-week protocol, 3 months post-T0 for the 7-week protocol and 4 months post-T0 for the 6-week protocol. <40% of the animals in the 4-week protocol developed tumours within the 8 months follow-up period. DNA synthesis rose as a function of time and protocol aggressiveness. The 6-week carcinogenesis protocol was selected for long-term studies of different therapeutic modalities in tissue with PMD because it permitted long-term follow-up and guaranteed tumour development in > or =90% of the animals.

The Active Living by Design national program: community initiatives and lessons learned. Public health advocates have increasingly highlighted the importance of implementing comprehensive physical activity interventions that use an ecologic framework. Such a framework can broadly address physical activity barriers, such as the lack of opportunities, social support, policies, built environments, and community awareness. The Active Living by Design (ALbD) was a community grant program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), which was established to help 25 communities create environments that support active living. Each funded site established a multidisciplinary community partnership and implemented the 5P strategies: preparation, promotions, programs, policy, and physical projects. The community partnerships worked within neighborhoods, schools, worksites, and other organizations to increase physical and social supports for physical activity. Ten community examples illustrate the 5Ps. Throughout the 5-year grant, the ALbD national program office provided community partnerships with group and individualized learning opportunities. Technical assistance and peer-to-peer learning was facilitated by ALbD project officers, who also coached each community partnership via site visits, regular phone calls, and electronic communications. The ALbD grant program provided valuable lessons for communities, technical assistance organizations, and funders. Community partnerships experienced success in a variety of settings and their collaborative approaches encouraged multiple organizations, including funders, to participate in improving conditions for active living. Strong local leadership was a key to success and community partnerships benefited considerably from peer-to-peer learning. The 5P model, while challenging to implement comprehensively, proved to be a useful model for community change.

Lipoatrophy of the footpad in HIV-treated patients is associated with increased PAI-1. To describe lipoatrophy of the plantar pedis fat pads in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with or without long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART); to compare the characteristics of ART patients with and without plantar pedis lipoatrophy; and to examine the effects of HIV and metabolic/cardiovascular risk parameters and treatment history on plantar pedis lipoatrophy. Participants included 134 patients who started protease inhibitors in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 and 49 treatment-naive patients, recruited in 2004. Participants were examined and graded for lipoatrophy of five body compartments including the plantar fat pads. Baseline HIV- and ART-related factors were documented together with follow-up metabolic/ cardiovascular risk parameters. Plantar pedis lipoatrophy occurred more often among ART patients (60%) than among treatment-naive patients (12%; p < .001). ART patients with plantar lipoatrophy were older, had higher plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) values, a higher prevalence of lipoatrophy in other body compartments, and longer stavudine and didanosine treatment history as compared to patients without plantar lipoatrophy. Multiple logistic regression modeling revealed that among the metabolic/cardiovascular parameters, increased PAI-1 was strongly and positively associated with plantar lipoatrophy. Among the treatment history parameters, didanosine was the strongest independent predictor for plantar lipoatrophy. Increased PAI-1 was not associated to lipoatrophy in any other location. Plantar lipoatrophy is common among patients on long-term ART and, though often overlooked, may cause significant discomfort. The association to PAI-1, a well-known marker of increased cardiovascular risk, is intriguing and places further focus on the need for an active approach to evaluating and lowering cardiovascular risk factors in long-term HIV treatment.

Strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings. Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has increased rapidly to reach over three million people in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains low as only 31% of people in need were receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow exponentially to meet the need for universal access and keep pace with or exceed the new HIV infections. This calls for strategies that will have the greatest impact on the reduction of opportunistic infections, toxicities, and early mortality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as well improve adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expanding antiretroviral therapy to all those eligible requires evidence-based decisions about how, when, and where expansion should occur. In this article we highlight some of the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within the constraints of limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa. Key strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes include, i) scaling up HIV testing to identify all in need of HIV treatment, ii) strengthening the links between HIV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests to support clinical monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of patients in HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving the health infrastructure, and increasing the human resources to handle the growing numbers of people in need of HIV treatment.

Retrocyclin 2: a new therapy against avian influenza H5N1 virus in vivo and vitro. We tested the ability of retrocyclin 2, a type of theta defensin, to protect cells and chicken embryos from infection by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. A gene fragment of retrocyclin 2 was designed based on the protein sequence of retrocyclin 2 and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA4.01 (HismaxA), named pcDNA4-RC2. The expression vector pcDNA4-RC2 protected MDCK cells and chicken embryos from infection by the H5N1 virus through inhibition of virus replication and viral mRNA transcription. Retrocyclin 2 is therefore effective in preventing H5N1 virus infection in vivo and in vitro and could be considered as a new therapy for H5N1 influenza and other diseases.

Pituitary tumours: acromegaly. Excessive production of the growth hormone (GH) is responsible for acromegaly. It is related to a pituitary GH-secreting adenoma in most cases. Prevalence is estimated 40-130 per million inhabitants. It is characterised by slowly progressive acquired somatic disfigurement (mainly involving the face and extremities) and systemic manifestations. The rheumatologic, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic consequences determine its prognosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by an increased serum GH concentration, unsuppressible by an oral glucose load and by detection of increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Treatment is aimed at correcting (or preventing) tumour compression by excising the disease-causing lesion, and at reducing GH and IGF-I levels to normal values. When surgery, the usual first-line treatment, fails to correct GH/IGF-I hypersecretion, medical treatment with somatostatin analogues and/or radiotherapy can be used. The GH-receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) is helpful in patients who are resistant to somatostatin analogues. Thanks to this multistep therapeutic strategy, adequate hormonal disease control is achieved in most cases, allowing a normal life expectancy.

The risk of placental abruption when using prostaglandins for cervical ripening in women with preeclampsia: comparing misoprostol versus dinoprostone. Recent data have raised concern about the safety of using misoprostol in women with preeclampsia. We wanted to evaluate the risk of placental abruption in women with preeclampsia undergoing cervical ripening with misoprostol compared to dinoprostone. We evaluated data on 403 preeclamptic women receiving either misoprostol (N = 235) or dinoprostone (N = 168) at different regimens and delivering in two university hospitals in Switzerland (Geneva and Basel). The main outcome was the incidence of placental abruption in both groups using two definitions for placental abruption ("clinical" and "post hoc"). We performed univariable and multivariable analysis. The overall incidence of placental abruption was 1.5% (six cases); 1.3% (3) in the misoprostol group versus 1.8% (3) in the dinoprostone group; p = 0.69). When using the post-hoc definition the incidence was higher in the latter group (1.3 versus 5.4%; p = 0.03). In multivariable analyses, the risk of placental abruption using the "post hoc" definition was associated with the use of dinoprostone. The use of misoprotol in preeclamptic women appears to be safe and is not associated with a higher risk of placental abruption when compared with other prostaglandins. Concerns about the use of misoprostol in the case of preeclampsia are not justified.

Strategies for TGF-beta modulation: a review of recent patents. TGF-beta has been identified as a key factor in the progression of various diseases, in particular cancer and fibrosis. The signaling of TGF-beta can be modulated through three distinct strategies: using antisense nucleotides that block TGF-beta mRNA (trabedersen (AP 12009)), using monoclonal antibodies to block TGF-beta isoforms (lerdelimumab, metelimumab) or using small molecule inhibitors of the TGF-beta receptor 1 (TGF-betaR1 or ALK-5). This review focuses on small molecules and summarizes the most recent TGF-betaR1 inhibitors reported in the patent literature. We searched and analyzed the patent literature claiming chemical matter for TGF-betaR1 inhibition from the 1(st) of January 2005 to the 1(st) of January 2009. The inhibition of TGF-beta has recently been clinically validated with antisense nucleotide trabedersen. Small molecules inhibitors of TGF-betaR1 that are now in Phase I clinical trials and in preclinical stage are, therefore, of high interest and could provide a more versatile route to TGF-beta modulation through oral dosing while maintaining the same therapeutic benefits.

Work-life conflict and associations with work- and nonwork-related factors and with physical and mental health outcomes: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine work- and nonwork- related factors and physical and mental health outcomes associated with combined time- and strain-based work-life conflict (WLC) among adult employees living and working in Switzerland as well as possible gender differences in this regard. The data used for the study were taken from wave 6 of the nationally representative Swiss Household Panel (SHP) collected in 2004. The analysis was restricted to 4'371 employees aged 20 to 64 years. Trivariate crosstabulations and multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by gender were performed in order to calculate gender-specific prevalence rates (%), beta coefficients (beta) and crude as well as multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR) as measures of association. Every eighth person (12.5%) within the study population has a high or very high WLC score. Prevalence rates are clearly above average in men and women with higher education, in executive positions or managerial functions, in full-time jobs, with variable work schedules, regular overtime, long commuting time to work and job insecurity. Working overtime regularly, having variable work schedules and being in a management position are most strongly associated with WLC in men, whereas in women the level of employment is the strongest explanatory variable by far, followed by variable work schedules and high job status (managerial position). In both men and women, WLC is associated with several physical and mental health problems. Employees with high or very high WLC show a comparatively high relative risk of self-reported poor health, anxiety and depression, lack of energy and optimism, serious backache, headaches, sleep disorders and fatigue. While overall prevalence rate of (very) high WLC is higher in men than in women, associations between degrees of WLC and most health outcomes are stronger in women than in men. This important issue which up to now has been largely neglected in public health research needs to be addressed in future public health research and, if the findings are confirmed by subsequent (longitudinal) studies, to be considered in workplace health promotion and interventions in Switzerland as elsewhere.

Common mental disorders in late pregnancy in women who wanted or attempted an abortion. In countries where legal abortion is restricted, many unwanted pregnancies are carried to term. Attempting an unsuccessful abortion may influence women's mental health. This study investigated the common mental disorders (CMDs) of depression and anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy in women who wanted or had attempted an abortion in a poor region of Brazil. CMDs were assessed by using the 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) in all pregnant women aged 18-49 years who were registered with publicly funded primary health care in Recife, Northeast Brazil. The study achieved a high response rate and 1121 (98.9%) women completed the interview. The prevalence of CMDs for the sample was 43.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.2-46.1], and 63.6% (95% CI 55.4-71.2) among the 13.7% of women who attempted an abortion. The association between CMDs and attempted an abortion [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% CI 1.3-3.1] remained after adjustment for confounders. This study found that attempting an abortion in the current pregnancy was associated with CMDs. Good access to family planning programs, including access to contraceptive methods and safe abortion, should help to improve the mental health of women.


Thawing boar semen in the presence of seminal plasma: Effects on sperm quality and fertility.

Translating the neuroscience of alcoholism into clinical treatments: from blocking the buzz to curing the blues. Understanding the pathophysiology of addictive disorders is critical for development of new treatments. A major focus of addiction research has for a long time been on systems that mediate acute positively reinforcing effects of addictive drugs, most prominently the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system and its connections. This research line has been successful in shedding light on the physiology of both natural and drug reward, but has not led to therapeutic breakthroughs. The role of classical reward systems is perhaps least clear in alcohol addiction. Here, recent work is summarized that points to some clinically important conclusions. First, important pharmacogenetic differences exist with regard to positively reinforcing effects of alcohol and the ability of this drug to activate classical reward pathways. This offers an opportunity for personalized treatment approaches in alcoholism. Second, brain stress and fear systems become pathologically activated in later stages of alcoholism and their activation is a major influence in escalation of alcohol intake, sensitization of stress responses, and susceptibility to relapse. These findings offer a new category of treatment mechanisms. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling through CRH1 receptors is a major candidate target in this category, but recent data indicate that antagonists for substance P (SP) neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors may have a similar potential.
