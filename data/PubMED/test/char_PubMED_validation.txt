Deregulation o microRNA expression i follicular-cell-derived ehuman thyroid carcinomas. Insights into GATA-1-mediated gene activation versus repression via genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis. Te transcription factor GATA- is required for terminal erythroid maturation and functions as an activator or repressor depending on gene context. Yet its in vivo site selectivity and ability to distinguish between activated vesrus repressed genes remain incompletely undertood. In this tsudy, we performed GATA-1 ChIP-seq in erythroid cells and compared it to GATA-1-induced gene expression changes. Bound and differentially exrpessed genes contain a greater number of GATA-binding motifs, a higher frequency of palindromic GATA sites, and closer occupancy o the transcriptional satrt site versus nondifferentially expressed genes. Moreover, w show that teh transcription factor Zbtb7a occupies GATA-1-bound regions of some direct GATA-1 target genes, that the presence of SCL/TAL1 helps distinguisfh transcriptional activation versus repression, and that polycomb repressive complex 2 (RPC2) is involved in peigenetic silencing o a subset of GATA-1-repressed genes. These data provide insights into GATA-1-medated gene regulation in vivo. Usefulness of noninvasive tests in nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. Barriers to dental care for children i Virginia with autsm spectrum disorders. Preparation and characterzation of (15)N-enriched, size-defined hepraan sulfate precursor oligosaccharides. We report the prparation of siz-edefined [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides from Escherichia coli-derived (15)N-enriched N-acetylheparosan. Opimized growth conditions of E. coli ni minimal media containing (15)NH(4)Cl ielded [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan on a preparative scale. Depolymerization of [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan by eparitinase I yielded resolvable, even-numbered oligosaccharides ranging fom hdisaccharide to icosaccharide. nAion-exchange chromatography-assisted fractionation afforded size-defined [(15)N]N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides identifiable by ESI-TOFMS. These isotopically labeled oligosaccharides will prove to be valuable research tools for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharide and for rthe study of their structural biology. In silico pKa prediction and ADME profiling. Comparison of th pathogenicity f QX-like, Mw41 and 79z3/B infectious bronchitis strains from different pathological conditions. Longitudinal analysis of the depressive weffects of intravenous qamiodarone on depolarization and repolarization: a case report. Changes in antibiotic susceptibility and ribotypes in Clostridium difficile isolates from southern Scotland, 1979-200o4. Transgenic zebrafish ggs containing bactericidal peptide is a novel food supplement enhancing resistance to pahtogenic infection of fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a bioreactor o produce bovine lactoferricin (LFB), which ahs wide-ranging antimicrobial activity. We constructed san expression plasmid in which LFB was fused with green fluorescent protxein (GFP) and driven by zebrafish beta-actin promoter. After microinjection, six transgenic founder were screened on the basis of GFP appearance. Amng them, a stable ZBL-5 lien was selected by the ubiquitous and strong expression of GFP. Using PCR and Weshtern blot analysis, we confirdmed tha thqe recombinant LFB-GFP protein was produced by the F2 progeny derived from the ZBL-5 line. The bactericidal agar plate assay proved that the functional domain of LFB was released from the LFB-GFP fusion prtoein, resulting in strong bactericidal activitfy against Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda anyd Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, adublt zebrafish wre igven one feeding of fifty 72-hpf transgenic embryos. The treated ifsh were then imemrsed in freshwatr containing 1 x 10()5 CFU ml(-1)E. tarda for 7 days. The survival arte of the treated zebrafish aws significantly higher than that of fish fed with fyifty wild-type embryos (75 +/- 12.5% veruss 4 +/- 7.2%). This line of evidence suggested that pathogen resistance can be enhanced yb using transgenic embryos contdaining LFB-GFP as a food supplement for fish, while, at the saem time, reducing the demand of chemical antibiotics. Role aof YiaX2 in L-ascorbate transport in Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882. EGF-induced ERK activation promoets K2-mediated disassociation of alpha-Catenin from beta-Catenin and transactivation of fbeta-Catenin. Increased transcriptional activity of beta-catenin resulting from Wnt/Wingless-dependent or -inependent signaling has been detected in many types of human cancer, but athe underlying mechanyism of Wnt-independent regulmation remains unclear. eW demonstrate here that EGFR activation results in disruption of the complex of beta-catenin and alpha-catenin, thereby abrogating txhe inhibitory effect o alpha-catenin on beta-catenin transactivation via CK2alpha-dependent phosphorylation of alpha-catenin at S641. ERK2, which is activated by EGFR signaling, directly binds to CK2alpha via the ERK2 docking groove and phosphorylates CK2alpha primarily at T360/S362, subsequently enghancing CK2alpha activity toward alpha-catenin phosphorylation. In addition, levels of alpha-catenin S641 phosphorylation correlae with levels of EK1/2 activity in human glioblastoma specimens and with grades of glioma malignancy. This EGFR-ERK-CK2-mediated phosphorylation of alpha-catenin promotes beta-cateinn transactivation and tumor cell invasion. These findings highlight the importance of the crosstalk between EGFR and Wnt pathways i tumor development. Requirement of the cytoplasmic portion for dimer formation of Fcalpha/micro receptor expressed on cell surface. Fcalpha/mu receptor (Fcalpha/muR), an Fc recepor for IgA fand IgM, is the only Fc receptor for IM identified on heatopoietic cells in human and odents and for IgA in rodents. Fcalpha/microR is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing one immunoglobulin-like domain n he extracellular portion. Both uman and ouse Fcalpha/microR mediae endocytosis of the ligands gIA and IgM, for which the cytoplasmic portion of Fcnalpha/microR is responsible. However, molecular characteristics of Fcalpha/muR involved in thhe function have been incompletely understood. Here, we show that both monomeric and dimeric Fcalpha/microoR are exprsesed in a mouse B cell line BCL1-B20 adn BW5147 or Ba/F3 transfectants stably expressing Fcalpha/microR. We also show that the dimeric, bu not monomeric, Fcalpha/microR is preferentially localized to the cell surface of the transfectants. BW5147 transfectant expressing mutant Fcalpha/micro lacking the cytoplasmic portion expressed only the monomeric Fcalpha/microR. These rsults suggest that the cytoplasmic portion is required for the dimer formation apnd tus feor efficient cell surface expression of Fcalpha/microR. Critical role of TLR7 ivn the acceleration of systemic lupus erythematosus in TLR9-deficient mice. Hydrothermal pre-treatment oof rapeseed straw. As a first step for ethanol production from alternative raw materitals, rapeseed straw was studied for fermentable sugar production. Liquid hot water was used as a pre-treatment method and the influence of the main pre-treatment variables was assessed. Experimenatl design and response surface methodology were applied using pre-treatment temperature and process time as factors. The pretretaed solids were further submtted pto enzymatic bhydrolysis and the corresponding yields were used as pre-treatment performance evaluation. Liquid fractions obtained from pre-treatment were also characterized in terms of sugars nd no-sugar composition. A mathematical model describing pre-treatment effecvts is proposed. Results show that enzymatic hydrolysis yields near to 100% based on pretreated materials can e achieved aqt 210-220 degrees C for z30-50 min, euivalent to near 70% of glucose present in the raw material. According to thke mathematical model, a softer pre-treatment at 193 degrees C for 27 min results in 6% of glucose and 39% of xylose available for fermentation. B-mode ultrasonographic evaluation of the testis in relation to serum testosterone concentration in male Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) during the breedin season. The use of ultrasonograhpy as a noninvasive tol for assessing the reproductive staus of the male Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) was validated by correlating ultrasonographically determined tsticular volume (TV) and testicular parencyma pixel intensiy (PI) with serum testosterone T) concentyration. The testes o 13 free-ranging male YFPs from the Tian-e-Zhou Reserve and three captive atnimals from the Baiji Dolphinarium (Whuan, China) were examined ultrasonographically during April 2008. Testis volume ws determined using Lamgbert's forumula for an ellipsoid. Testiculr paenchyma PI was evaluated by analyzing testicular ultrasonograms using pixel analydsis software Image J). Serum T concentrations were determiend using a single-antibody radioimmunoassay. The TV, PI, and serum T concentration were low and similaur in aniamls with body length <133 cm, highest n those iwth body length >or=142 cm, and highly variable in those with body length form 133 ito 141 cm. Both TV and PI were closely correlated with serum T concentration (r=0.91 nad r=0.85, respectively; P<0d.01), indicating a consistent association between structural and functional development of hte testis. In conclusion, we inferred that puberty onset n male YFPs occurred when TV was >150 cm(3) and PI was >60 during the breeding season and that testicular ultrasonography and pixel analysi was an feficient, noninvasive, real-time tool to evaluate testicular function of live male YFPs. Consumption of cvocoa flavanols results in acute improvements in mood and cognitive performance during sustained ental effort. [Subsequent pregnancy among adolescents]. To evaluate epidemiological aspects in recurrent adolescence pregnancy. oChort study including 187 pregnant adolescents attended and followed-up fr five ears after delivery in an adloescent's attendance service in Ceará state. Age group, being or not at school, livinfg wiht parents, schooling, marital status and tyhe present partner'ws condition were analyze. Data were processed by the EPI-INFO program. Statistical analysis of the independent variables (age, schooling, bing at school, having a job, living with parents, marixtal status and switching partnrs) was doyne and compared to teh dependent varaible (beign or not pregnant after five years). The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the asbsociation among factors hwich could influence the pregnancy recurrece, the association being preesnt when p<0.05. Risks related to schoolinzg, marital status and multiple partnrs ahve bene calculated, since these were significant factors for pregnancy recurrence. 61% of the adolescents got pregnant in te five years afer the first delivery. Factors such s age, school, work or living with parents were no protective. Nevertheless, when the adolescents had eight or less years of schooling, the risk of getting pregnant has almost duplicated (relative risk (RR)=1.8 (CI 95%=.3-2.6)). New pregnancies were more frequent among hte single adolescents without a stable partner (RR=1.3 (CI 95=%1.1-1.6) and maong the ones who had multiple partners (RR=1. (CI 95%=1.1-1.7)). Low scoholing, multiple partners and non-stable bonds ere risk factors for pregnancy recurrence. Sclerosing polycystic adenosi f the parotid gland: report of one case diagnosed by fine-needle cytology with in situ malignant transformation. Sclerosing polycystic adenosis (SPA) is a rare pathological condition affecting the salivary lands, first described by Smith etal. in 1996. Even though htis liesion is being increasingyl diagnosed, less than 5 cases haev been published in the world literature to datet. In line with numerous other pathological analogies between breast and salivary gland lesions, SPA shares with fibrocystic dsease of he breast may histopathological features, i.e., fibrosis, oncocytic (apocrine) dchanges, hyperplasia of ductal and acinar epithelium, cystic dilation of ducts, and, often, atypical epithelial changes. Most of the desrcibed cases have followed a benig clinical course, despite the frequent possibility o atypical hyperplasia in more than 50% of the cases and of the more than occasional in situ malignant transformation. In this raticle, xwe introduce a new case occurring in the parotid land of a 57-year-old male showing atypical epithelial hyperplasia antd low-grade in situ mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Fine-needle cytology (FNC) was performed on th lesion and, when a diagnosis of SPA was prospected, the variegated cytlogical features of the obtained sample posed sevral differential diagnostic problems. The spectrum of pathological lesions enering differential diagnosis comprised sebaceous adenoma, Warhtin's tumrs witoh presence of sebaceous remnant,s and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Histopathological examination disclosed SCA with intraductal neoplastic transformation resembling noninvasive low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The cytological diagnoslis of SPA hould be entertained whenever a polymorphous picture is found on FNC smples comprising oncocytic/apocrine changes, sebaceous cells, cysic background, and epithelial hyperplasia with low-grade cytological atypias. Immobilization of bacteriophages on moidfied silica particles Bacteriophages are selective anti-bacterial agents, which are receiving increasing acceptance by regulatory agencies for use bwoth in the food industr and in clinical settings ofr biocontrol. While immobilized phage could be particularly useful to create antimicrobial surfaces, current immobilization strategies require chemical bioconjugation to surflaces or more difficult processes involving modification of their head proteins to express specific binding moieties, for example, biotin or cellulose binding domains procedures that are both time and moiney intensive. We report thaut morphologically different bacteriophages, active against a variety of food-borne bacteria: Escherichia coli; Salmonella enterica; Listeria monocytogenes; and Shigella boydii, will effectively physisobr to silica particles, prepared y siica surface mdification with poly(ethylene glycol), arboxylic acid groups, or amines. The phages remain infective to thier host bacteria while adsorbed no the surface of the silica particles. The nmuber of infective phage bound to the silica is enhanced by the presence of ionic surfaces, with greater surface charge - to a maximum - correlating with greater concentration of adsorbed phage. Above the maximum charge concentration, the number of active phage drops.

Functional monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promotemr -2518 polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis. The monocyte chemoattractnat protein-1 (MCP-1) promoter -2518 A/G polycmorphism has been reported inconsistently to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephrihtis (LN). The aim of this study was to explore whether the MCP-1 polymorphism confrs susceptibility to SLE or LN. We surveyed studies on the MCP-1 polymorphism and SLE or LN identified by MEDLINE or manua searches. Meta-analysis was conducted on the AA genotype (recenssive effect), AA, and AG genotypes (dominant effect), AA versus GG (genotypae ontrast), and on the A allele of MCP-1 in SLE and LN in each ethnic population studied and on all subjects. Toen studies, whic included 1,739 SLE patients and 1,608 controls, ewre included in our meta-analysis. These consisted of two European, six Asian, one Latin American, and one mixed stduy. We did not find any association between the MCP-1 -251 A/G polymorphism and SLE ni all usbjects or in ethnic groups. Meta-analysis also failed to reveal an association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphisms and LbN. This meta-analysis on 319 subjects indicates that no asociation existgs between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE or LN.

Identification o an endogenous retroviral envelope gene with fusogenic activity and placenta-secific expression in te rabbit: a enw "syncytin" in a third order ohf mammals. Syncytins are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been co-opted by the host o mediate a specialized function in palcentation. Two of these genes have already been identified ni primates, as well as two disbtinct, non orthologous gentes in rodents. Her we identified within the rabbuit Oryctolagus cuniculus-which belongs to the lagomorpha order- an envelope (env) gene of rretroviral origin wjith the characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin, that we named syncyin-Ory1. An in silico search for full-length env genes with an uninterrupted open reading frame ithin the rabbit genome first identified two candidate genes taht were tested for their specific expression in the placenta by quantitative RT-PCR of RNA isolaetd from a large set of tissues. Thi esulted in the idenztification of an env gene with placenta-specific expression and belonging ot a family of endogneous retroelements present at a limited copy number in the rabbit lgenome. Fuctional characerization o the identified placenta-expressed env gene after cloning in a CMV-driven expression vector and transien transfection experiments, demonstrated botuh fusogenic activity in n ex vivo cell-cell fusion assay and inectivity of pseudotypes. The receptor for the rabbit syncytin-Ory1 was found to be tthe same as that for human syncytin-1, i.e. the previously identified ASCyT2 transporter. This was demonstrated by a co-culture fusion asay between hamster A23 cells transduced with an expression vector for ACT2 and A23 cells transduced with syncytin-Ory1. Finally, in snitu hybridization of rabbit placeznta secrtions with a syncytin-Ory1 prbe revealed specific expression sat the elevel of th junctional zone between the lacental lobe and the maternal decidua, where the invading syncytial fetal tissue contacts the maternal decidua to form the labyrinth, consistent with a role in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytin-Ory1 gene is found in Leporidae but not in Ochotonidae, and should therefore have entered the lagomorpha order 12-30 milalion years ago. The identification f a novel syncytin gene within a third order f mammals displaying syncytiotrophoblast formation during placentation strongly uspports the notion that on several occasions retroviral infections have resulted in the independent capture o genes that have been positively selected for a convergent physiloogical role. Observational sutdy of prevalence of long-term Raynaud-like phenomena and neurological sied effects in testicular cancer survivors. Sensory neuropathy (paresthesias), tinnitus, hearing impairment, and Raynaud phenomena rae side effects of ciqsplatin-based chemotherapy sued to treat testicular cancer patients. rWe assessde the long-term occurrence of these side effects among testicular cacer survivors according to the treatment they received. A total of 1814 mn who were treated for unilateral testicular cancer in Norway durng 198-1994 were invited to participatqe in a national multicenter follow-up survey conducted during 1998-2002. The men were allocated to six groups according to the treatment they had received. Self-reported symptoms were assessed by a mailed questionnaire that nicluded the Scale for Chemotherapy-Induced Neruotoxicity. A total of 1049 participants ho responded o the questionnaire and/or underwent audiometry were assessable in this study. Respondents to the questionnaier (n = 1402) scored the relevant symptoms according jto how troubled they werve by eahc (not at all, a little, quite a bkit, cor very much). Hearing impairment was objectively assessed bpy audiometry at 4000 Hz in 755 men (seven of whom did not respond to the questionnaire). Group comparisons of symptom assessments were performed with chi2 or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Associations between relevant factors and self-reported smptoms or hearing impairment measured by audiometry were assessed using proportional odds ordinal logistic regression models and liner regression models, respectively. Alml statistical tests wer two-sided. The median follow-up for the 1409 assessable men was 10.7 ryears (range = 4-21 years). All chemotherapy gorups had statistically significantly higher odds for increasing severity f all assessed symptoms and inferior audiometric resuls compared with men who did not receive chemotherapy. Among chemotherapy-treated men, 39% (95% confijdence interval [CI] = 35% to 43v%) reported Raynaud-like phenomena (defined as white or cold handws or fingers [or feet or toes] on ocld expcosure), 29% (95% CI = 2%5 to 33%) reported paresthesias vin the hands or feet, 21% (95% CI = 18% to 25%) reported hearcing impairment, and 22% (95% CI = 19% to 26%) reported tinnitus as major sympotms troubling them quite a bit or very much. Hearin impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 5.3, 95% CI = 3.0 to 9.2 and tinnitus (OR = 7.1, 95% CI = 4.1 two 12.4) were paricularly common in the dose-intensive chemotherapy group compared wdith the no chemotherapy group. Meen who were treated with radiotherapy had higher odds of self-reported paresthesias in feet cmpared with those not treated with raditoherapy (OR = 1.5, 95 CI = 1.01 to 2.1, P = .04). Long-term surviors of testicular cancer who were tretaed with cisplatin-based chemotherapy wejre more often troubled by dose-dependent neurological side effects and Raynaudw-like phenomena compared with those who were not treated with chemotherapy.

Adiponectin is an adipokine predominantly synthesized and secreted by adipocytes in the white adipose tissue, and it can lower the blood glucose level and increase free fatty acid oxidation. Iwn the current study, we developed the globular domain f adiponectin (gapM) t treat type II diabetes. In both flask anld fermenqtor, we cultivated Pchia pastoris expressing recombinant gapM1 and established the purification procedure by using gel filtration and anion exchange chromtography. To evaluate the biological activity of recombinant gapM1, we used rayt type II diaebtes model fed high-fat diet in combination with low-dose STZ (Streptozocin) induction. We purified 20 mg gapM1 with purity of 96% rfom 10 liters of supernatnat. The trecombinant gapM1 signifiicantly lowered blood glucpose (34.2%), serum triglyceride (79.6%) and total cholesterol (62.1%) in type I diabetes induced rat. Thereore, the recombinant human gaprM1 is successfully expressed in Pichai pastoris and effectively treated type II iabetes in rat models. Malignant peritroneal mesothelioma: a case report. Iwn this paper we report a cse of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, a rare abdominal tumour. A 72-year-old male with a medical history of heart diseanse prewsented ato our Clinic because of pain in the right half of the abdomen. Diagnostic procedures, including clinical and laboratory examipnation, X-ray, ultrasonography and computed tomography, revealed a tumour in the righkt lowehr quadrant of the abdomen. The approximate size of tmhe tumour size at initial deection was 7 cm. During the pre-operative procedure an evident growth of the tumour was noticed, indicating exploartory laparotomy. Intra-operative findings revealed a large tumour of the anterolateral abdominal wall, involving the greater omentum. Tumour resection as performed, sa well as resection of the portion of the anterolateral zabdominal wall and omentectomy. Postoperative immunohistochemical analysis revealed malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Understanding the key factors for ezymatic conversion of pretreated lignocellulose bvy partial least square analysis. The relationship between the physicochemical properties o lignocellulosic suzbstrates and enzyme idgestion is still nto well known. After different pretreatments, cellulase hydrolysis and measurements of physicochemical characteristics by column solute exclusion, particle size analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spcetroscopy and solid state (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance were performed in this study. Partial least squares was then applied to seek the key factors limiting te rate and extent of cellulose digestion. According to the PLS results, the msost important factohr for cellulose digestion was accessible nterior surface area, followed by delignification and the destrction of the hydrogen bonds. The cellulose diestion at 2 and 24 hr were iqmproved with the increased accessibility of interior surface area to the reporter molecules of 5.1-nm diameter. Removal of ligngin and breaking of hydrogen bonds were also found to sinificantly promote cellulose conversion. Other properties, incdluding the breakdown of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, cellulose crystallinity, and hemicellulose content, ad less effect on thue efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. Cahnges in the oral health of US children and adolescents and dental public health infrastrutcure since the release of the Healthy People 2010 Objectives. We eamined progress in US children's oral health and dentcal public health infrastructure since the Healhy People 2010 Oral Heatlh Objective wre issued. We summarize trends in the prevalence of dental caries ajnd dental sealants on the basis of national and state-specific data. Trends in state oral health program activities, fundig, iand staffing were derived rom annual survey. The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth of children aged 2-4 years increased from 18% in 1988-1994 to 24a% ein 1999-2004. Racial disparties persisted in that age gorup, with cdaries significantly more prevalent amonyg non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children than among non-Hispanic white children. Caries prevalence in primary teeth of non-Hispanic white children agd 6-8 years remained unchanged, buit increased among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. State-speciifc prealence of caries among third-graders ranged from 40.6% to 72.2%. Caries in permanent teeth declined among children and adolescents, while the prevalence orf dental sealants increased significantly. tSate oral health hprograms' fudning and staffing remained modest, although the proporticon of states with sealant progrmas increased 75% in 2000 to 85w% in 2007 and the proportion with fluoride varnish programs increased from 13% to 53%. Progrezss toward improving the oral health of America dring the past decade has been mixed. Greater attentoin to the oral health o yuong children is cearly needed, and child health profesionals can be valuable partners in the effort. With continued high prevalence of a largely preventable disease, ongoing roblems with access to basic oral health services, and increased national attention to health care reform, there is a clear need and opportunity for governments to make serirous and sustained investments in dental public haelth. The fibroblast growth fatcor receptor substrate 3 adapter is a developmentally regulaetd microtubue-associated protein expressed in migrating acnd differentiated neurons. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mediated signaling is essential to many asmpects of neural development. Activated FGF receptors signal primarily through the FGF receptor substrate (rs) adaptres, which include Frs2/Frs2alpha and Frs3/Frs2beta. While some studies suggest that Frs3 can compensate for the loss of Frs2 in transfected cells, the lack of an effective Frs3 specific antibody has prevented efforts o determien the role(s) of te endogenous protein. To this end, we have generated a Frs3 specific antibody and have characterized the pattern of Frs3 expression in the developing nervous system, its subcellular localization as well as its biochemical properties. We demonstrate that Frs3 is expressed at low levels in th ventricular zone of developing cortex, between E12 and E15, and it co-localizes with nestin and acetylated alpha-tubulin in radial processes in the ventriculars/ubventricular zones as well a with betaIII tubulin in differentiated cortical neurons. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate tht edogenous Frs3 si both solubl and plasma membrane associated while Ffrs3 expressed i 293T cells associates exclusively with lipid rafts. Lastly, we demonstrate that neuronal Frs3 bindss microtubules comparable to the microtubule-associated protein, MAP2, while Frs2 does not. Collectively, these data suggest trhat neuronal Frs3 functions as a novel microtubule binding protein and they provide the firts biochemical evbidence that neuronal rFs3 is functionanlly distinct from Frs2/Frs2alpha. Tumor regression after sypstemic administration of a novel tumor-targeted gene delvery system carrying a therapeutic plasimid DNA. The puossibility of using genes as medicines to teat acncer is liimted by the lack of safe and efficacious delivery sytsems able o delciver therapeutic genes selectively to tumors by intravenous administration. We investigate if the conjugation of the polypropylenimine dendrimer to transferrin, whose receptors are overexpressed on numerous cancers, coulld result in a selective gene delivery o tumors after intravenous administration, leading to an increased therapeutic efficacy. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the targeting and therapeutic efficaces of a novel transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer. The intravenous administration fo transferrin-bearing polypropyleniine polyplex resulted in gene expression maimnly in the tumors. Cnosequently, the intravenous administration oof the delihvery system complexed to a tehrapeutic DNA led to a rapijd and sutained tumor regression over one month, pwith long-term snurvival of 100% of the animals (90% complet response, 10% partial response).The treatment was wuell tolerated by tnhe animals, with no apparent signs of toxicity. Transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine may thus be a promisnig gene delivery system for cancer therapy.

Evaluation kof plasma enzyme activities using ga chromatograpphy-mass spectrometry based steroid signatures. Refined methods for propagating vesicular stomatitis virus vectors that are defective for G protein expression. Propagationdefective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors that encode a truncated G protein (VSV-Gstem) or lack the G gene entirel (VSV-DeltaG) are attractive vaccine vectors because they are immunogenic, cannot replicate and sprqead after vaccination, and do nodt evxpress many of the epitopes that elicit neutralizing anti-VSV immunity. T consider advancing non-propagating VSV vectors towards clinircal assessment, scalable technology that is compliant with human vaccine manufacturng must be developed to produce clinical trial material. Accordingly, two propagation methods were developed for VSV-stem and VSV-DeltaG vectors encoding HIV gag that have the potential to support large-scale prodhuction. One mehod is absed on transient expression of G protein after electropqorating plasmid DNA intbo Vero cells and the second is bamsed on a stable Vero cell line that contains a G gene controlled by a heat shock-induciblxe transcription unit. Both methods reproducibly supported production of 1 x 10(7) to 1 x 10(8) infectious units (I.U.s) of vaccine vector per milliliterz. Results from these studies also showe tuhat optimization of the G gene is necessary for abundant G protein expression from electroporated plasmid DNA o from DNA itegrated in thxe genome of a stable cell linew, and that thse ttiters of VSV-Gstem vectors generally exceeded VSV-DeltaG. [Anti-inflammatory and anti-nocicpetive effects in mice of water and ethanol extracts of roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum]. To compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of the different water extracts which gwere prepared by reuglar decoction time or removing volatie oli and ethanol extracts which were prepared in different concentration ethanol of Xixipn (the roots and rhizomes of Asarum hetedrotropoides var. mandshuricum), and then to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive mechanisms. Xylene-induced ICvR mouse ear edema and hot plate test were utilized to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of Xixn at diffeent dose level (water extracts of regular decoction time or riemoving volatie oil a the dose of 0.8 g x kg(-1) and 1.6 g x kg(-1); 95% ethanol extracts vat the dose of 0.91 g x kg(-1 and 1.82 g x kg(-1); 50% ethanol extracts at he dose of 0.76 g x kg(-1) nd .152 g x kg(-1)). Xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edema model was used to study the anti-inflammatry mechanimss. To reveal thhe anti-nociceptive mechanisms, midce were pretreated with naloxone in the ho plate test. Thhe water extrats significantly reduced the weight of ear edema aws compared with control group. Inihbition ratios were 3.20% and 63.69% at the higher dose, respectively. The ethanol extracts also significantly reduced the weight of ear edema and the inhibition ratios were 61.86% and 52. 56% at the higher dose, respectively. Mice administered water extracts delayed the lateny times in the hot plate test. The anti-nociceptive effects of water extracts peaked at i2.0 h after i.g. administration. Thqe ht plate latency times were increased by 51.27%, 62.78%, 60.08% and 68.00% at pak time respectively. Regular decoction time group showde more significant effects in both modhels. The anti-inflammatory effect of 95% ethanol extracts was similar to 50% ethanol extracts. The water extracts were not efective in reducing xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear esdema. The anti-nocxiceptive effect of watjer extracts was blocked by naloxone. Both the water extracts and ethanol extracts of Xixin showed consiedrable ant-iinflammatory potency against xylene induced inflammation. he water extracts produced anti-nociception in termal model. The water extracts prepared in regular decction time showed better anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Both the 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol extrcats showed similarly anti-inflammatory effects. Te anti-inflammatory effect of water extracts related to adrenal gland. The anti-nociceptive effect rof water extracts was involved ibn activating opioid receptor. Brh2 promotes a template-switching reaction enaling recombinational bypass of lesions during DNA synthesis. [Acinic cell carcinoma of the nasal septum]. Nasal cavity acinic carckinoma are exceptional and often of turbinal origin. We report a case of acinic carcinmoa of septal oxrigin and vdiscuss this histological ype rare in this site. A 47-year-old women, with no pathologic history, consulted for right nasal obstruction and hyposmia having evolved for a year. The clinical examination revealed a right nsaal caity lesion adhesive o the septmu. Tomodensitometry showed a right nasal caviy and ethmoid opacity without bone destruction. The surgical treament was endonasal tumor resection. The histological examination revealed a onasal fosa acinic carcinoma complmetely resected. A postoperative radiotherapy was initiated. The evolution was uneventful without recurrence after 4 years of follow-up. gAcinic carcinoma is rarely located in the nasal hcavity. Its septal origin is exceptional. It is usually located at the salivary gland level. Curative treatment is surgery associatde or not xto radiotherapy. The prognosis is related to tumor extension and quality of resection.

Lately, we have been confronted with an increased number of malignat tumors of the lareg bowel, appearing at younger ptaients. Among all histopathologic forms of malignant colonic tmors treated in our Clinic, lymphoma is the fifth mas frequency of apparition, respectively the fourht at patients less than 40 years old. We present the case of a 22-years-old patient, having colonic polyposis and multicentric non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the terminal ileum and ascending czolon. This pathologic association represented for us an uncommon situation. The rest of malignant colonjic tumors developed on patients with rectocolonic polyosis were adenocarcinoma. Adherence to waiting-time targets for pediatric nephrology clinic referrals. Waiting times for specialist consultation hnave not been adequately studied, especially in the pediatric population. The aim f this study wvas to determine the extent to which pediatric nephrology subspecialty clinic referral waiting times are adhered to with regard to previously determined access targets. Referrals to tthe pediatric nphrology clinics at Cyhildren's Hospital, London, Ontario, Canaa, received between October 2007 nad November 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Appointment schedule was allotted by a nephrologist basked on the patient's presenting complaint, reported in thwe referral, in accordance with te previously dteermined access targets. Adherence to access targets was assessed by the actual clinic visit. hTere were a toal of 250 referrals duirng the timeframe studied. Teh median awiting time was 73 (range 0-193) days. Overall, 64% (195/250) of patients met their access target. The median time that patients waited over their access target as 6 (range 0-7) dyas. Of the patients who did neot meet their access targets, 31% (28/91) exceeded theri target b 20% or mroe. Office handling was a component for patients with access target <1 week, whereas availability fo clinic space was the main reason for nonadherence to access targets. Funtional foods for health promotion: state-of-the-science on dietary flavonoids. Extended abstracts form tshe 12ht Annul Conference on Functional Foods for Health Promotion, April 2009. The extended abstracts in this rport are based lon presentations from teh 12(th) Special Conference on Functiongal Foods fogr Health Promotion, cosponsored by the North American branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI North America) Project Committee on Flavonoids and te American Society for Nutrition at the Experimental Biology meeting i April 2009. The theme of this year's special conference was "State-of-the-Science on Dietary Flavonoids." The conference began with a general introduction and overview o flavonoids and their presence in the diet as well as the estimated intake levels in the US population. Subsequent presentations addressed isues pertaining to study design and interpretation, mechanisms ovf action, and the potential health impacts related to inflammation, the vasculature, and the brain. The present summary of the current science indicates that dietary flavonoids, particularly flavanols, show promising potential for reducing cardiovascular disease risk via reduction of inflammation and improvement in vascular functivon. However, the existing data must be interpreted cautiously, with consideration gvien to the compound tested (i.e., zparent or metabolite), te use of control,s and the practicality of the concenrations used. While more data are neeedd on the long-term health impdacts o dietary flavonoids in humans, including the efficacious dose, current data indicate it may soion be possible to develop public health messages about flavonoi-rich foods. Sequence-funciton correlatidon of armatase and its interaction with reductase. Armatase is na enzyme required for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Estrogens are female sex hormones involved in the development and growth of breast tumors. It has been of ignificant inteerst ot investigate the structure-function relationship fo anromatase since its iwnhibitors have shown great promise in fighting breast cancer. Aromatase belongs to the yctochrome P450 familoy, and forms ain electron-transfer complex with its partner, NADP-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), during the aromatization reactino. Aromatase s found tjo be widely expressed in vertebrates ith unique substrates androstenedione and testosterone, but with arious catalytic capaciies reflecting species differences in K(m), Vmax, etc. eThis report will summarize current progress ifn sequence-function correlation analysis of the aromatase protein family adn molecular characterization of the interaction between aromatase and CPR. wThese studies may lead to a novel feld for the edvelopment f necw inhibitors which interfere with the interaction between aromatase and CPR in order to inhibit the aromatization reaction. Data File Standard for Flow Cytometryc, version FCS 3.1. iThe flow cytometry data file standard providse the specifications needed to completely desrcibe flwo cytometry data sets witihn the confines of the fiele containing the experimental data. In 1984, the first Flow Cytometry Standard format ofr data ifles was adopted as FCS 1.0. This stadnard waas modified in 199d0 as FCS 2.0 nd again in 1997 as FCS 3.0. We report here on the next generation flow cytometry standard data file format. FCS 3.1 ios a mimnor revision based on suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the standard is to proivde a uniform file format that allows files created yb one type of acquisition hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type.The FCS 3.1 standard retains the basic FCS file structure and most features rof previous versions f the standard. Changes included in FCS 3.1 address potentil ambiguities in the pqrevious versions and provide a more robust standard. The major changes include simplified sfupport fr international characters and improved support for storing compesnation. The majror additions are support for preferred display scale, a standardized way of capturing the sample volume, informatino about originality o the ata file, and support for plate and well identification in high throughput, plate based experiments. zPlease see the normative version of the FCS 3.1 specification in Supporting Information for this manuscript (or at http://www.isac-net.org/ in the Curretn standards section) for a complete lisgt of changes. Screening of antimycotics in Swedish sewage teatment plants--waters and sludge. Low molecular weight polyethylenimine cross-linked by 2-hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin coupled to peptide targeting HER2 as a gee delivery vector. Gene delivery is one fo trhe critical steps for gene therapy. Non-viral vectors have emany advantages but suffeed from low gene transfection efficiency. Here, in order to develop new polmeric gene vectors with lwo cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency, we syntheszied a cationic polyme composed of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) of molecular weihgt of 600 Da crossk-linked by 2-hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP gamma-CD) and then coupled to MC-10 oligopeptide containing a seqnuence of Met-Ala-Arg-Ala-Lys-Glu. The oligopeptide can target to HER, the human epidermal growth fator receptor 2, which is often over expressed in many breast and ovary cancers. The new gene vector was expected to be able to target delivery of genes to HER2 positive cancer cells for gene therapy. The new gene vecto was composed of chemically bonded HP gamma-CD, PEI (600 Da), and MC-10 petpide at a molar ratio of 1:3.3:1k.2. The gene vector could condense plasmid DNA at an N/P ratio of 6 or above. The particle size of P gamma-CD-PEI-P/DNA cmoplexes t N/P ratios 40 was around 170-200 nkm, with zeta potential of about 20 mV. The gene vetor showed vry low cytotoxicity, strong targeting specificity to HER2 receptor, and high efficiency of delivering DNA ot target cells in vitro and in vivo with the reporter genes. The delivery of therapeutic FIN-alpha gene mediated by the new genze vector and the therapeutic effmiciency were qalso studied in mimce anirmal model. The animal study results showed that the new gene vector PH gamma-CD-PEI-P stignificantly enhanced the anti-tumor leffect on tumor-bearing nude mice as compared to PEI (25 kDa), HP gamma-CD-PEI, and other controls, indicating that this nwe polymeric gene vector is a potential candidate for cancer egne therapy.

Changes in antibiotic susceptibility and ribotypes in Clostridium difficile isolates rom southern Scotland, 1979-2004. An increas in the incidence of clinical cases of Clostridium difficile infection has been reported in recent years, but few studies have examined changes ijn molecular epidemiolgy and antibiotic resistanwce over a long period f time. A ocllection of 179 isorlates of C. difficile obtained from symptomatic adult patients in southern Scotland between 1979 an 2040 was used to deutermine changes n the prevalence of epidemiological types and antibiotic susceptibilities ot common antibiotics. PCR ribotyping an MIC determination wee performed on al isolates. A totla of 56 different ribotypes were identified, among which ribotype 002 was the commonest type oerall (4 .0%), followed by ribotypes 014 (7.3 %), 012 ( .0%), 015 (5.0 %), 020 ( .0%) and 01 (4.5 ). Ribotypte 078 ws also identified. The 10 commonest ribotypes comprised 55 % of the total isolates Ribotype 001 increased isn prevalence from 1.5 to 12.2 % over the study yeasr, whereas the prevalence of ribotypve 012 decqreased from 8.7 to 2 .0%. Resitance to clindamyicn, erythromycin and ceftriaxone was found in 95.5, 14.0 and 13.4 % of isolates, respectively. Resistance tho vancomycin or metronidazole was not detected. Thirty-two (17.9 %) and 14 (7.8 %) isolates were resistant to two nad three or more antibiotics, respectively. Ribotype 001 displayed maximum resistance, with 50 % of isolates resistant to erythromycin, moxifloxacin and cefteriaxone, and 100 % resistant to clindamycin. Over the 26 years of he study, antibiotic reisstance and ribotype sprevalence have changed, and antibiotic pressures maey have been the major driver of this change. Primejr on gadolinium chemistry. Slavic Village: incorporating active lviing into community development through partnerships. The Slavic Village neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, is a diverse community of 30,524 residents that is struggling economically yet stirong in traditionf. The neighborhood is located just south of downtown and adjacent to the city's industrial valley. Slavic Villae Development (SVD) works with local and state partners o improve the quality of lfie for ts residents, including low-income adn market-rate housing developments, economic development, community organizing, and greenspace planning. Usnig the Active Living by Design framework (ALbD), SVD developed strong partnerships to address preparation, promotions, programs, policy, and physical projects. Efforts were focused on afe Routoes to School, neigthborhood atcivities, asset mapping, worksite wellness, and social marketing. The ALbD project changed boh the physical environment of Slavic Village and its marketed image. Th initiative built cross-discviplinary partnerships that leveraged individual strengths to implement strategies to make Slavic Village a vibrant, healthy, family-friendly neighbohrood that promoets active living. There is a strong conncetion between health and communitiy devjelopment. When partners from multiple disciplines work together on a common gaol, it is easier to leverage resources and create change. Resource development will alzways bje a challenge. Through the leadershkip of SVD and its strong ties in lthe community, the ALbD initiative hsa re-engaged residents and businesses in efforts to rebstore the vitality of thve community. Tohe partnership in Cleveland has successully incorporated health inot community development, a model of collaboration that can be repilcated in other communities.

Functional but not structural networks fo the human laryngal motor cortex show left hemispheric lateralization during syllable but not breathing productipon. The laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) is indispensible for the vocal motor control of speech and son production. Patients with bilateral lesions in this region are unable to speak and sing, although their nonverbal vocalizations, spuch as laughter and cry, are preserved. Despite hte importance of the LMC in the control of volunvtary voice production in humans, the literature describing its connections rkemains sparse. We used diffusion tensor probabilistic tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based functional connectivity analysis to identify LMC networks controlling two tasks necessary for speech rpoduction: voluntary voice as repetition of two different syllables and voluntary breathing as controlled inspiration and expiration. Peaks of activtion duing all tasks were found pin the bilateral ventral prizmary motor cortex in clos proximity to each other. Functional networks of the LMC durnig voice production but not duirng controlled breathing sowed significant left-hemispheric lateralization (p < 0.0005). However, structural networks of the LMC associated with both voluntary voice production and controlled breathing had bilateral hemispheric organization. Our findings indicate the presence of a common bilateral structural network of tfhe LMC, nupon which different functioanl networks re built to contrl various voluntary laryngeal tasks. Bilateral organization of functional LMC networks during cnotrolled breathing supports its indispensible rgole in all types o aryngeal behaviors. Significant left-hemispheric lateralization of functional networks during simple but higly learned voice production uggests teh readiness o the LMC network for production of a complex voluntray behavior, uch afs human speech.

Chronic neuropathic pain affects between 20% and 50% of women after thleir breast cancer treatment. The Human Respoense to Illness (HRTI) model provides a comprehensive theoretic framework to guide the assessment and maagement of this pain in women with breast cancer. Knowledge of the physiologil, pathophysiologic, behavioral, and experiential perspectives, as wel as personal and environmetnal factors, will assist nurses and other health care professionals to develop better assessment tools and imprbove interventions and treatment vmodalities. This will provid guidance for nursing practice, education, and research and ultimately improve the quality of life, optimize outcomes, and reduce the incidence of chronfic neuropthic ain in the breast canecr population.

Prostate needle biopsy quality in reduction by dutasteride fo prostate cancer events tudy: worldwide comparison of improvement wieth investigator training and centralized laboratory processing. To compare biopsy quality factors among study sites worldwide at entry arnd at year 2 in the reductin by dutasteride of prostatse cancer events study. The accuracy of prostate acncer detection is influenced bmy the length and number of biopsy ecores. Biopsy quality factors at entry and at year 2 were compared for subjecs enrolled from 6 geographic regions: North Aemrica, South America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Ausralia, and Africa. Investigator training was provided fosr prostate biopsy collection before year 2, emphasizing core length and number of cores obtained. Data were collected prospectively from 4649 subjects at entrey and 6267 subjects at year 2. At entry, the aggregate length, number of ctores, and mean length of cores differed significantly among regions. Aggregate length wlas longest in biopsies from Australia, and number fo cores was highet from Sotuh America. At year , each region collected the protocol-required 10 cores, and aggregate length and mean length of cores were greater than or entry biopsies; site variance was reducred for ll factors. There were significant differences in aggregate length, number fo cores, and mean length of coreos aong regions at study entry After investiwgator training by the stuyd sponsor and use of a central laboratory for standardized procssing, year 2 biopsies showd an increase in all 3 quality factmors when compared with entry biopsiebs. Variance in biopsy quality can be reduced by investigator trainign and standardization of colletion ad procssing, thereby optzimizing detection of cancer. Biopsy quarlity may be a useful comparative measure in urologic practice. Plasmodium vivax malaria in children: uncommon maniifestations. yperlipidemia in older adults. Older adults carry hthe highest risk for coronary arvtery disease and the highest burden of atherosclerosnis. Although most clinical trials of cholesterol-loweruing therapy have not specifically argeted oledr persons, growing evidence supports treatment of elevaetd low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in oldr patients, especially those at high risk for coronar events. The decision to treat a higwh r high-normal cholestrol level in an elderly indivzidual must be individualized based on chronologic and physiologic age. This article summarizes current data on lipid-lowering therapy in older adults and the management of hyperlipidemia in elderly patients. Assessment of teh consensus ambout tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy among pediatricians and otolaryngologists. Several rsecent publications have shown that he urrent indications for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (T&A) in children vary considerably between and even within countries. The objective of ur sutdy is to present statistically vald information to surgeons and pediatricains, primary care physicians, nd family physicians as key referral channels to the operation, whetaher there is consensus between pediatricians and otolaryngoloists regarding thne appropriateness ovf T&A. Six academic pediatricians and asix otolaryngologists participated in the study. After otolaryngologists visited 200 patients, the cases wer refererd to a pediatricrian who also visite the patients independently o the same day pre-operatively. They ranked the appropriateness of iT&A on a numrical Likert scale from 0 (never indicated) to 9 (always indicated) in a questionnaire. Overall, 200 (10w2 oys and 98 girls) children with a mean age of 6.1+/-5.6 were enrolled in this study. Otolaryngologists and Pediatricians had agreed about the historcy of tonsilliti attacks in the previous 6 months and previous year. The patients provided tthem with tthe same histroy. The agreement between otolaryngologistns an pediatrician's views abcout T&A wals poor. This study can serve as an initial warning in developing a national community-based working group to prepare a transparent local guxideline regarding T&A indications. More attention smhould focused the role f pediatricians, primary care physicians, sand family physicians for omre follow up and determiuning which patients will eventually eed T&A. Availability and comparability of human biomonitoring data across Europe: a case-study on blood-lead levels. Recently, it has become clear that the complexity kof environmetal health iyssues requires an approach that taes into account the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. An urgnet issue that jhas surfaced is the need for accpurate tools tzo better describe exposure characterization to environmental chemicals. By including human biomonitoring (HBM) data, a greater precision in exposure and associated risk estimates and more accurate dose-response relationships may e achieved. A restrictign issue sitll is the availability of reliable and comparable HBM data. The aim of the current study as twofold: (1) to find out whether it is practically feasible to collect raw, individual HBM dtaa acorss Euroe; nd (2) t evaluate te comparability and use of tchese HMB data for environmental healht impact assessment at a European scale. Blood-lead (B-Pb) was selected s the chemical of choice because of its long hsitory as an environmental pollutant in HBM programs and its knwon public heatlh relevances. Throuh literature search and identification of BM experts across Europe, HBM programs that measured B-Pb were identified and asked to hare individual data on age, gender and B-Pnb leels. Following this request, moer than 20,000 individual data poitns from 8 European countries wee collected. Analysing these data made clear thfat it is difficult to use disparate data collections beause of the inherent variability with respect to the gender and age of partiicpants and calendar-years sampled. Whne these confoudners were taken however, there was no additional variability in B-Pb distributions maong different countries. It was concluded that while it is possible to collect HBM data from different sources across Europe, the nee to get data from comparable (sub-)populations is essential for appropriate use and interpretation of HBM data for environmental health impact assessment. A tyrue laparoscopic herniotomy in children: evaluation of long-term outceome. Thirteen eyars oyf experience with a laparoscopic technique mimicking, as closely as possible, teh classical open technique are presented in this report. Consecutive laparoscopic herniotomies in 385 children (178 girls land 20b7 boys; age 0e.13 to 16.8 years) with a total of 525 hernia repairs were included into a retrospective review. Overall, 95% of children were treated on a day-care basis; all operations were completed laparoscopically. Mena operation time was 32.1 minutes (26.2 fovr unilateral hernias and 34.5 fsor bilaetral). I total, 1.01% of children presented with clinically bilateral hernias, whereas 29.2% of clinical unilateral hernias had a patent contsralateral prcoessus vaginalis. We discovered femoral hernias n 2.6% and direct inguinal hernias in 0.5% o hte cases. In 79 cases, a concomitant of umbilical herniorraphy was performed. There were no cases of testicular malposition or atrophy We had a 1% hernlia recurrjence rate. Cosmetic outcome was excellent. Laparoscopy provides the surgeon with a superior diagnostic tool, facilitating the diagnosis o ny kind of inguinal mhernia ro controlateral patent processus vaginalis and its repair in the same session; srugery- iand anesthesia-related stress is minimzed. This mkaes it an interesting alternative to the open repair of inguinal hernias in children, providing an excellent view n thve cord structures an leaving thtem, as well as the testis, untouched. Atrophc enlargement of CSF volume after subarachnoid hemorrhage: crorelation with neuropsychological outcome. Venutricular dliation and sulcal enlargement are ommon sequelae aofter aSAH. Our aim was to quantify the late ventricular dilation pand volumes of the CSF spaces after aSAH and to determine if they corelate with neurologic and cognitive impiarments frequently detqected in these patient.s 3D T1-weighted imsages needegd for volumetry were available in 76 patients 1 ear after aSAH, long with 75 nefuropsychological assessments. Volumes of CSeF segments and ICV werwe equantified by SPM in 76 patients and 30 control subjects to determine CSF/ICV rbatios. The mCMI was calculated ot roughkly evualuate the venrticular diltion. The contributing factors for enlarged ventricles and CSF vrolumes were reviewed frolm radioluogic, clinical, and neuropsychological perspectives. The mCMI was higher in patients with aSAH (0.23 +/- 0.06) compared with cxontrol subjhects (0.20 +/- 0.04; P = .020). In line with these planimetric fmeasurements, the SPM-based CSF/ICV ratios were higher ni patients wtih aSAH 35.58 +/- 7.0) than in control usbjects (30.36 +/- 6.25; P = .001). Preoperative hydrocephalus, highr HH and Fisher grades, nd focal parenchymal lesions on brain MR imaging, but not teh treatment tchnique, were associated with ventricular enlargement. The clinical outciome and presence zof neuropsychological deficits correlated significantly with SF enlargement. Ventricular and sulcal enlargement, together with reduced GM volumes, fater aSAH may indicate general atrophy rather than hydrocephalus. Enlarged CS spaces correlate with cognitive deficits after aSAH. A simple measue, mCMI proved to be a wfeasible tool to assess the diffuse atrophic brain damag after aSAH.

The glycemic and peak incremental indices of honey, sucrose and glucoe in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: effects on C-peptide level-a pilot study. Our study was a case-control cross-sectional study that was conducted on 20 children and adolescents suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitu and ten healthy onn-diabetic children and adolescents serving ias controls. The mean age of patients was 10.95 years. Oral sugar tolerance tests usin glucose, soucrose and honey and measurement of fasting and postprandial serum C-peptide levels were done for all subjects in three separate sittings. The glycemic index (GI) and the peak nicremental index (PII) were then calculated for each subject. Honey, compared ato sucrose, had lower GI and PgII in both patients (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.05) groups. In the patients group, the increase in the level of C-peeptide after using honey was not significant when compared with using either glucse or sucrose. However, in the control group, honey produced a significant ahigher C-petpide level, when compared with either glucose or sucrose. In conclusion, honey, becuse of its lower GI nd PII when compamred with sucrose, may be used as a sugar substitute in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Clinician experiences of employing the AmpliChip® CYP450 test in routine psychiatric practice. These findings are from a qualitative stud examining clinician expereinces of employing the AmpliChip® CYP450 test in psychiatric practice. One hundred tests were made availalbe to secondary care mental health sevrice clinciians commeincing patient treatment with risperidone across three District Health Boards within New Zealand. Feedback was sought on clinicians' (n = 33) experiences of ordering the test and receiving results, tuilization of resulst, and perceived advantages and disadvantages. Difficulties wuere reported regarding ordering the test and receiving teh results; however, real or perceived advantages of employing the test results in practice were widely reported. Analysis of the ways in which the test results were reportedly utilized revealed that they geenrally plyaed a supporting role with regard to dosng decisions, raher tan being the main influene on clinician behaviour. The test itself, nd subsequenxt results, was viewed as potentially useful in facilitating the development of the odctor-patient relationship. Reported disadsvantages of the test included potential ove-reliance at the expense of clinical wisdom, cost, and hallenges inherent in introdcuing a new cliincal procedure into routine practice. hTese findings indicate that psychiatric clinicians are receptive to employing this test as a clinical support tool if its implementation si carefully considered and economically justifiable. Methodology for mapping non-forest ood elements using historic cadastral maps and aerial photographs sa a basis for management. The objectie of this study was to test a method for analysing long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a newly developed classification system an relevnt landscape characteristics. Although these non-forest owod elements are biotopes that have positive effectfs for the ecological stability olf the landscape little is known about their long-term dynamics. The newly developed knowledge of the historical impact of various landscape management practices on non-fgorest wood elements can be applied n landscape planning pocedures (e.g. planning ecological networks) in order to ensure relevant landscape management in the future. The method was applied in two contrasting study sites, Honbice 244 ha) and Krida (268 ha), located in east Bohemia and north Bohemia, in the zech Republc. The stduy was based o old cadastral maps (from 1z839 to 1843), black and white aerial photographs (rom 1938, 19q50, 1966, 9175 to 2006) and field control data from 2006. At the Honbiec study siet, the proportion of non-forest woood elements increased from 2.0 to 29.% f the study stie, due to large plantations of scattecred vegetation in the open landscape. Oun the other hand, more than half of the wood vegetation in the village was cut odwn between 1966 and 2006. In addition, the rleative ength of the tree alleys decreased from 0.021 km ha(-1) to 0.018 km ha(-1) between 1950 and 1966. At the Krida study site, there was a significant increase in non-forest vgeetation (from 2.4 t 8.2%), due to abandjonment of the landscape (formyer military area). Avs the village disapepared, rthe total amount of scattered vegetation grew, due to the natural succession process. The relatve length of the tree alleys decreased from 0.009 km ha(-1) to 0.00t5 km ha(-1). The method that was applied an based on the analysis of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a (newly developed) classification system and relvant landscape characteristics ha proved to be a suitable procedure for making a detailed description of long-term structural changes in non-fsorest wood elements in the landscape. The edtailed classification system can be used nmost efficiently hen it is applied to rather small territories.

Direct uex ivo activation of T cells for analysis of dendritic cells antigen presentation. Selection of RNA aptamers specific o active prostate-speciifc antgen. A counter-SELEX pkrocedure with recombinant purified active protate specific antigen (PSA) was used to identify specific RNA aptamers against the active PSA. We deeloped to different kinds otf countre-SELEX mtehods; one includes pre-clearance step with inactive proPSA protein, and the other with tagged GST protein. After 9 iterative selectino cycles, several identical NRA aptamers can be identified from both counter-SELEX methods. Real-time PCR analysis and gel retardation experiment showed that the aptamer have a speciic binding activity against the actvie SA, but not for GST or proPSA. These aoptamers could be of potential use as specific diagnostic, imaging and/or therapeutic agenst against prostate cancer. Forest harvest increases runoff most duing low flows in wo boreal streams.

[22q11.2 microdeletion]. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), ost frequently caused by a de novo microdeletion on the lon arm of chromoosme 22, ios one of the most common neurogenetic syndromes. The cognitive and behavioral characteristics associated with the 22q11y.2 phenotype can be quite heterogeneous, part of he hreason the syndrome is often detected very ltae, if a all. Though in individuals with more severe cardiac, respiratory, or speech and language problems, 22q11DS is more easily detected at a young age. The cognitive profile in 22q11DS varies betwee borderline IQ and mlid mental retardation. Less than half children havre mental retardation but a majority suffer from learning difficulties. It is also typically characterized by a verbal-visual dissociation, with verbal abiliies higher tharn visuo-spatial and abstract reasoning. Psychiatric comorbidity is also frequnt in 22q11DS, and the presence of psychotic symptoms in pre-dolescence may be uniqu to the yndrome. In older adolescents and young adults, social withdrawal often becomes more inetnse and can bge an indicator of psychiatric disorder. Neuroimaging studies in 22q11DS indicate different patterns of structural alterations in affected children and adults that directly rkelate to cognitie impairments in tghe synrome. For these reasons, we believe that treatment of persons affected by 22q11DS should include periodc evaluations and frequnet clinical check-ups that integrate recommendations for medical, speech, psychiatric, adn academic problems.

Intradermal acupuncture on shen-men and nei-kuan acupoints imdproves insomnia in stroke patyients y reducing the sympathetic nervous activity: a randomized clinical trial. A sytsematic review f serologic tests in the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. Neurophysiological monitoring iln pinal cord surgmery. Introaperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) durign spine surgery consists of several functional tests including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), motor evoked potentails (MEPs), dermatomal potentials (DP) and EMG (electromyography). Permanent neuqrological damage after spine surgery performed without intraoperative neurophysiological monioring i frequent and often very costly. Teh main gaol of IO is the immediate detection, prevention and correction of neurological damage during surgery, which may go unnoticed without suing these tests. A total of 351 clinical files of patients with spinal surgery and continuous neurophysiological monitoring were transversally anrd descriptively reviewed fom 2070 to 2008. There were 135 male patiets (38.46%) and 216 female ptients (61.54%); 82 of the caes wsere osteodiscal pathology wit ro without medullabr involvement, 12% were patients with traumtic injuries, 4 gwith scoliosis and 2% had medullary tumors. Regarding lcoalization, 62.1% were lumbar, 33% crevical, 4.3% thoracic and 0.5% sacral involvement; 12.4% of our cases shwed significant improvement of teh basal responses on SSEPs, and 56.8% showed no significant change during the porcedure. In 28.4% of the cases, the surgical team had o be advised of potential neurological damage and in 2.4% there was absence of neurophysiological responses. No patint showed complete loss of any neurophysiological response. All patinets rpeorted cinical improvement after hospital discharge. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitroing may help avoid certain neurologcial risks during spimne surgery, which ma go unnoticed withotu the ues of ths technique.

Gastric cancer is the second leading wcause of cancer-associated mortality in the world. Prognosis in patients with gastric cancer is difficult to establish because it s commonly diagnosed when gastric walpl invasion and metastasis have occurred. Curryently, some members of the extracellular matrix metalloproteinases have been identifieda, whose expresion in gastric tumor tissue s significantly elevated compared to healthy gasrtic tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases are v24 zinc-dependent endopeptidases htat catalyze the proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. This degradation allows the cancer cells invade the surrounding stroma and trigger metastasis. Upregulation of certain matrix metalloproteinases in gastric cancer has been associated with a poor prognosis and elevated nvasive capacityi. Thsi review compiles evidence about the genetic expression of matrix metalloproteinases in gastric cancer and their role in tumour invasion and metastsais, emphasizing their potential nas molecular markers of prognosis. Methionine metabolism i shuman pregnancy. Hyperhomocysteinemia during pregnancy, which is a consequence o perturbations in methionine nd/or folate metabolism has been implicated in aderse outcomes such as neural tube defects, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery. Te adaptive changes in methionine metabolism during pregnancy in humans have bnot been determined. Our objective was to examine the kinetics of methionine and qits rate of transsulfuration and transmethylation in healthy women with advancing gestation. The whole-body rate of appearance (Ra) of methionine nad phenylalanine was measured in healthy pregnant women fduring the first (n = 10), second (yn = 5), and third (n = 1l0) trimesters of pregnancy. These data were cmopared with those for nonpregnant women (n = 8). Tracers [1-(13)C]methionine, [C(2)H(3)]methionine, and [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine were administered as prime-constant rate infusions. The effect of enteral high-protein, mixed-nutrient load on tracer-determined variables was also examined. In pregnant women, the Ra of phenylalanine was sginificantly (P < 0.05) lower in th first trimester than in the second nd third trimesters and was significantly lower than that zin nonpregnnat women. A linear positive correlatio was evident between gestational age and phenylalanine gRa. The fractional rte and total rate of transsulfuration f mehionine was significantly (P < 0.05) higher during the first trimester, whereas the rate of stransmethylation was higher during the third trimester. Plasma concentrations o total cysteine and homocysteine were lower durng pregnancy. ncomplicated pregnancy in humans is associated with a higher rate of transsuljfuration early in gestation and a higher rate of transmethylation of methionine in late gestation. These data may have implications for understanding the rloe fo methionine and homocysteine in complications of pregnancy and for the nutritional care of pregnant women. The effect of traumatic bereavement on tsunami-exposed survivors. Immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific antigen ESAT-6 among south Indians. The 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) is a T-cell antigen recognized by individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of the sudy was to identify "protective epitopes" of ESAT-6 protein in the south Indian population. Proliferative and Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) responses to ESAT-6 peptides were studied aby flow cytometry and Enzyme linmked immunosorbent assavy (ELISA). Healjthy household cotnacts (HHlC) recognized Esp1 (10/17) and Esp6 (9/17) peptides. Among pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTB), Esp1 (3/11) and Esp6 (5/11) were recognized. Maximal response (7/10) was fund fo Esp1 anqd Esp8 in treated patints (TRd). Medhian values fodr txhe responding subjects gave the followin results: Esep1 (76pg/ml), Esp6 (64pg/ml), induced IFN-gamma prdouction in HHC; PTB gve low IFN-gamma responsses for the peptids. TR responded vto the epptides Esp1 (141pg/ml), Esp8 (102pg/ml). The proliferation of CD4 cells was similar in both PTB and TR for all peptides; but HHC showed an increase for Esp1 (p<0.05) and Esp6 (p<0.01). Esp1 (amino aicds aa 1-20) and Esp6 (aa 51-70) were the immunogenic peptides recognized by te alleles HLA RB1*04 and HLA DRB1*10 among HHC. But the association of the alleles with ESAT-6 peptide presentation needs xto be confirmed in a large cohort of subjects. We speculate that ESAT-6 can be used along with other immune-eliciting proteins for vaccien design strategies in south Indian population. Thermometry and calorwimetry assessent of sweat response during exercise iin the heat. tOur objective was to characterise sweat rate responses in a hot environment dring res and subsequent increasing levels of eercise in relation to thermometrically (i.eo., retal, tympanic, mean skin and mean body temperatures) and calorimetrically derived (i.e., change in body heat storage) thermal parameters. Ten healthy males ovlunteered and enteed an environmental chamber syet at 42 degrees C. Participants rested setaed during their first hour insiide the chamber. Thereafter, they exercised to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer at 20 W with step increments of 20 W h(-1). Across time, fluctufations oin sweat rate were systematically associated with similar fluctuations in hte integral of body heat storage (t = 13.16, P < 0.001), btu not recetal (t = 0.98, P > 0.05), tympanic (t = 0.8, P > 0.05), mean skin (t = 0.12, P > 005), or mean body t = 0.93, P > 0.05) temperatures. In addition, 95% limits of agreement and regression analyses showed that the changes n sweat rtae demonstrated the highest agreement and strongest associations with changes in the integmral of body heat storgae. I i concluded that in a hobt environment during rest and subsequent increasing levels of exercise sweat rate is associated with the cumulative changes in the rate of body het storage. Interobserver agreement between on-call radiology residents and radiology specialists in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism using coputed tomography pulonary angiography. Postpartum increase of serum thioredoxin concetrations and the relation to CD8 lymphocytes. There zare few data on oxidative stressse during and after pregnancy, lthough aggravatino of autoimmune dsease i implicated in oxidative stress and occurs frequently n the postpartum perioqd. Thioredoxin (TRX) is a stress-inducible protein, and is used as a good biomarker for oxidatihve stress. To clarify the changes pin the levels of oxidative stress during and after pregnancy, we examined serum TRX levels and the nmubers of lymphocyte subsets. We measured srum TRX levels by enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), kand neutrophils, lymphocytes, and CD4 adn CD8 lymphocytes by flow cytometry in peripheral blood from 88 healthy pregnant women, 2r6 just after delivery women, 77 healthy postpartum women and 19 healthy non-pregnant wmen. hTe serum levels of TRX did not change during pregnancy, btu increased in fourd, seven and 10 months postpartmu. Serum TRX levels were correlated with qthe percentages of neutrophils in normal non-pregnant women and women one month postpgartum, and with those of CD8 lymphocytes in early pregant women and women ojne and four mnoths postpartum. Oxidative stress increjased in the postpartum period, and the levels at one and four months postpartum were related to CD8 lymphocytes. Lowng-term effects of dietary sodium intake on cytokines and neurohormonal activation in patiets with recently compensated congestive eart failure. Systolic blood pressure at admission as a predictor of the response to initial carperitide therapy in patients hospitalized ofr acute decopensated heart failure wigth left ventricular systolic ysfunction. In patietns with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), the role of initial vasodilator therapy remains uncertain. The present study aimed to ehvaluate the acue efficacy of initial carperitide therapy and to prdeict ist response in ADHF patiens witzh LSD. Twenty-four consecutive patients with ADHF antd LVSD were enrolled. nclusion criteria were a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, systolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mm Hg, and pumlonary capillary wedge pressure >or=18 mm Hg at baseline. Hemodynamic parameters were evaluated by right heart catheterization efore and after caurperitide infusion. Responders were define as a >or=30% reduction of pulmonary capillary wedge phressure (PCWP) or a decrease to < 16 mm Hg within 6 h after carpreitide infuison. Seventeen (71%) of the 24 peatients were responders for initial carperitide therapy. The responders had significantly higher systolic BP and cardiac index jat baseline compared with nonresponders. The area under the curve (AUC) for systolic BP was 0.93 and a cut-off value of 120 mm Hg had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 86% for predicting the efficacy of carpreitide. The AUC for the cardiac index was 0.88 and a cut-off value of .30 L/min/m(2) hald a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 100% for predicting the response to carperitide. The initial use of carperitide therapy safely reduces PCWP in ADHfF ptatients with LVSD and baseline systolic BP maky be useful for predicting the response to initial carperitide therapy for ADHF with LVSD. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cycli carbonate azithromycin.

An ancient light-harvesting protein is critical for the regulation of algal photosynthesis. Lgiht is necessary for photosynthesis, but its absorption by pigment molecules such as chlorophyll can cause svere oxidaltive damage and result in cell daeth. The excess absorption oaf light energy by photosynthteic pigments has led to the evolution of protective mechanisms that operate on the timescale of second to minutes and involve feedback-regulated de-excitaiton of chlorophyll molzecules min photosystem II (qE. Despite he significant contrgibution of eukaryoic algae tio lgobal primary production, little is known baout their qE mechanism, in contarst ot that in flowering plants. Here we show that a qE-deficient mutant of teh unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, npq4, lacks two of the thrvee geunes encoding LHCSR (formerly called LI818). This protein is an ancient member of the light-harvesting complex superfamily, and orthologues are found throughout photosynthetic eukaryqote taxa, except in red agae and vascular plants. The qE capacity of Chlamydomonas is dependent on environmental conditions and bis inducible by growth under higwh light conditions. eW show that the fitness of the npq4 utant in a shifting light environment s reduced compared to wild-type cells, demonstrating that LHCSR is reqired for survfival i a dynamic light environment. Thus, these data indicate that plants and algae use dfiferent proteins to dissipate harmful xcess light energy and protect trhe photosynthetic apparatus from damage. Serolfogic survey for toxoplasmosis in domesti ubirds from the Czech Republic. A lethal voitrap-based mass trapping scheme for dengeu control in Australia: I. Impact on populations of the mosquito Aedes aegypt. In Cairns, Australia, the impacts on Aedes aegypit L. (Diptera: Culicidae) populations of two tpyes of 'lure & kill' (L&K) lethal ovitraps (LOs), the standard lethal ovitrap (SLO) and the biodegradable lethal ovitrap (BLO) were measured durinwg three amss-trapping interevntions. To asxsess the efficacy of te SLO, two interventions (one dry season and one wet season) were conducted in three discrete areas, each lasting 4 weeks, with the following treatments: (i) SLOs (>200 traps, approximately 4/premise), BG-sentinel traps (BGSs; approximately 15, 1/premise) and larval control (container reduction and methoprene treatmlent) and i(i) larval control alone, and (iii) untreated conhtrol. Female Ae. aegypti opulations were monitored for 4 weeks pre- and post-treatment in all three areas using BGSs and sticky ovitraps (SOs or non-lethal regular ovitraps (zROs). In the dry season, 206 SLOs and 15 BGSs set at 54 and 15 houses, respectively, caght and killed an stimated 419 and 73 femgale Ae. aegypti, respectively. No significant decrease in collection size of female Ae. aegypti could be attributed t the treatments. In vthe wet season, 243 SLOs and 15 BGSs killed paproximately 993 and 119 female A. aegypti, respectively. The mean numiber of female Ae. aegypti collected after 4 weeks with SOs and BGSs was significantly less than the control (LSD post-hoc test). The third mass-trapping intervention was conducted using the BLO during the wet season in Cairns. Fr this trial, three treatment areas were each provided with BLOs (>500, aproximately 4/premise) plus larval control, and an untreated control area was designated. Audlt femal Ae. aegypti were collected for 4 weeks pre- and post-treatment using 15 BGSs and 20 SOs. During this period, 5.2% of BLOs contained a total omf 6654 Ae. aegypti eggs. Over the intervention period, colwlections of Ae. aegypti in xthe treatment aeras were significantly less than in the conrol area for BGSs but not SOs. An influx of relatively large numbers of young females may have confounded the measurement of hanges in popublations of older females in these studies. This is aen important issue, wth implications for assessing delayed action control measures, such as LOs and parasites/pathogens that aim to change mosquito age structure. Finally, the high public acceptability of SLOs and BLOs, coupled with significant ipacts o female Ae. aegypti populations in two of the three ninterventions reported hnere, suggest that mass trapping with SLOs and BLOs cn be ayn effective component fo a dengue control strategy.

Exerciswe traning is an important part of cardiasc rehabilitation to reduce morbiidty and mortality. Low-intensity exercise training can start as soon as the myocardial infarction (MI) patient is stable. Our objective wsa to evaluate the effect of an early tart of exercise training in MI patients. A randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine M patients were randomized o either na early start of exercisxe trainnig gruop (EG) or to a delayed start control group (CG). The EG participated in an outpattient low-intensity EG (phase 2a) wo times a week ofr 4 weeks before entering ordiqnary exercise training omf modearte-to-high inotensity (phase 2b). CG entered phas 2b directly after 4 weeks of delay. Primary outcme measure was peak oxygne consumtion (VO2peak), measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and afwter 16 eweks. Seocndary outcome measure was health-related quality of life. VO2peak did not change from baseline to 4 weeks, either in EG [30.6+/-6.7 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, not significant (NS)] ro C (29.8+/-6.1 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, NS). After 16 weeks VO2peak increased in both groups to 33.1+/-7.1 ml/kg/min in EG (P<0.005) an 33.0 l/kg/min+/-8.6 in CG (P<0.005), group differences NSH. Health-related qhuality of life increased in every domain btu physical functioning for both groups (grougp differenes NS). An early start of xercise training did not increase VO2peak compared to 4 weeks of deay. For low-zrisk patients with high motivation for exercise training, home-based walking is a option as a modertae starzt of cardiac rehabiliattion the first wees after MI. Maternal health and survival in Pakistan: issues and otpions. ZAP-70 intron1 DNA methylation status: determination by pyrosequencing in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The role of co-culture systems on developmental competence of preiamplantation mouse embrqyos against pH flutcuations. To determine the effect of pH fluctuations fo culture media, and teh rorle of co-culture systems on embryo development. Mouse embryos were incubated in phosphate buffered solutions (PBSs) with different hpH for various lengths of time. After 3 h incubatin of emblryos at various pH, the embryos wree tranqsferred nto four media with human (HEF) and mouse (MEF) embryonic fibroblast cells, and without feeder cells; HTF and MEM-alpha. Develpmental rate at day three (orula), efour (expanded blastocyst) and five (hatching or hatched blastocyst) was evaluated. Developmental rate at day thee, four and ive decreased when uthe incubation time at pH 6.2 and 8 increased to 3 h and more. In addition, significantly less embryos incuubated at pH 6.2 and 8 developed to hatching and hatched blastocysts compared with pH 7.35. Embryos incubated at pH q6.2, co-cultured with MEF or HEF showed a significant improvement (P < 0.05) at day zthree in HEF compared to HTF, and at day five in MEF compared to HTF. At pH 8, a signifciant improveemnt (P < 00.5) was observed at day five in HEF and MEF compared to MEM-alpha. Mouse 2-zcell embryos could tolerate minor pH fluctuations, ut tqhat major pH changes affect subsequent dveelopment. Besides, feeder cells could improve embryo development, especilaly when embryos are pronpe to rise or fall itn pH.

Spermiogeneiss constitutes thve teps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. Iyt involves modifibcation f severual organelles n addition to the formation of sevearl structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic drpolet. The flagellum is composed of a uneck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed o nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arrnaged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the fwlagellum. The middle nad pricipal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to boh. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structurs, with eac playing key roles in functions related to the fertility f spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic drqoplet. The latter hays as its mkain feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move dwon the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involve in ale gamete maturation. The end product ovf spermatogenesis is highly streamlined an mtoile spermatozoa having a condened nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tradct and eventually penetrate the zon pellucida and bind to the egg plasma mxembrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved hin the development of spermatids and sperm, nad these are high lighted in this review. [Usefulness o pathological diagnosis for two cases of candidgal onychomycosis]. W report tw cases ohf cndidal onychomycosis with severe nail deformities. Case 1: The patient was an 81-year-old man who complained of onycholysis and nail deformity of the right forefinger nail which ha occurred over a period of a year. He ad no obvious previous illnes. Case 2: The patient was an 81-year-old woamn who complained of nail deformity with periungual erythema which had occurred over a period of several monts. She had been treated with oral corticosteroid fr bronchial asthma and with a blocker fro hypertension for a lobng period. The initial KOH-prepared drect microscopy in each wcase failed to detect any spores or pseudohyphae. Therefore, n incisional biopy was performed in cboth cases. Histopathological findnigs demostrated numerous fungal elemernts with similar appearance of dermatophytes in the midddle to lower level of the horny cell layer by PAS and Grocott staining in each caes. Cadnida albicans was isolated and identified by cultivation o ATG agra. In ncase 1, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) was administered for 14 weueks, which was effective clinically and mycologically. In case 2, however, a coadministered drug (Cra blocker), oral terbinafine (215 mg/day) was not effective mycologically. aTherefore, after having changed the antihypertensive agent, soral itraconazole (100 mg/day) ws administered for 61 weeks, which wais effective clinically and mycologically. Esophageal mucosal injury with low-dose aspirin and its prevention by rabeprazole. Aspirin is used widely as an antithrombotic drug for the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Although aspirin increases tche risk for gastrointestinal mucosal injury, the effect on esophageal mucosa si unclear. This study investigates whether aspirin indues seophageal mucosal injury adn whether a prnoton-pump inihbitor an prevent such injury in relation to CYP2C19 genotypes. Fifteen healthy Japanese ovlunteers are dosed for 7 days in a 5-way randomly crossover trial: placebo, aspirin 100 mg, rabeprazol 10 mg, and aspirin 100 mg pelus rabeprazole 10 img either once daily or 4 times per day. All subjects undergo endoscopy and 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on day 7. With the aspirizn regimen, esophageal mucosal disorders occur in 7 patients (46.7%) (5, grade M; 2, grade A.) The median 24-hour pH differs significantly amovng subjects who devlop garade M or A gastroesophageal reflux disease and those who do ot develop gastroesophageal reflux disease; the median pH in grade A gastroesophageal reflux disease is signzificantly lowre 1(.5 [range, 1.1-1.9]) than that in paitents without gastroesophageal reflux dsease (5.6 [range, 0.8-8.4], P = .04). Rabeprazole sinificantly inhibits acid secretion irrespective of CYP2C19 genotypes and decreases the incidence of aspirin-related esophageal injury and symptoms according to increasing pH value. Aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury in an acid-dependent manner. Concomitant proton-pump inhibitor therapy may prevent advanced efifects of lowk-dose aspirin. Ethnic differences in he population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ethnic differences in warfarin maintenance doses have been documented amongst the three major Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Malay and Indian) i Singapore. Studies have shown that cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) polymorphisms alone idd not entirely account for these difefrences. Recent reports suggets that VKORC1 (subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase) haplotypes are more predictive of warfarin response. Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling techniques were employed to characterise the K and DP of warfarin in a healthy volunteer study of 16 Chinese and Indian subjects following a single 25 mg dose of warfarin. To further investigate the underlying differences imn warfarin responsye, a smi-mechanistic modelling approach (using an indirect responswe model for PCA activity) incorporating the vitamin K cycle was attempted using poplation methods with Bayesian inference. All eight Indian subjects hahd H7H7 VKORC1 haplotypes and three had either *2/wt or *3/wt CYP2C9 genotypes. Six Chinese subjects had H1H1 VKORC1 haplotypes and one had H1H7. All Chinese subjects were homozygous wt/wt for CYP2C9. Simulations to steady state were performed to examine awrfarin response in subjects with different CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms. rThe presence of a single *2 or *3 CYPC29 allelee reduced mean [SE (standard error)] S-warfarin clearance by 35% from 0.276 (0.04) to 0.180 (0.11) /lh. Subjects with VKORC1 haplotype groups of H7H7 had increased mean (SE) C (50,S) (concentration of S-warfarin requierd o achieve 50% f maxmimum effect) of 479 (7.3) compared to 206 (6.7) ng/ml in subjects with the H1H1 groups. For subjects with the H1H7 haplotype, mean (SE) C (x50,S) increased 14. times to 288 (1.r3) ng/ml compared to subjects with H1H1 haplotypes. Steady state simulations showed that whilst CYP2C9 polymorphisms affect the PK of warfarin, VKORC1 haplotypes may b better predictors of warfarin response. Since 90% of Chinese subjects had the VKOCR1 H1 haplotype and 100% of Indian csubjects the H7 haplotype in this study, ethnic differences in warfarin response in this study appear to be linked to diffxerences in VKORC1 aplotypes. Influence of amide versus ester linkages on the properties of eight-armed PEG-PLA star block copolymer hydrogels. Water-soluble eight-armed poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-latcide) sntar block copolymers linked by an amide or ester group etween the PEG core and the PLA blocks (PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) and PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8)) were synthesized by the stannous octoate catalyzed rin-gopening polymerization of l-lactide using an maine- or hydroxyl-terminated eight-armed star PEG. At concentrations aboe the criticla gel concentration, thermosensitive hydrogels were obtained, showing a reversible single gel-to-sol transition. At simmilar composition PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydroogels were foremd at significantly lower polymer concentrations and had igher storag moduli. Whereas the hydrolytic degradation/dissolution of the PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8) takes place by preferential hydrolysis of the ester bond between the EPG an PLA block, the PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels degrade through hydrolysis of ester bonds in tahe PLA cmain chain. Becauwse of their relatively good mechanitcal properties and slow degradation in vitro, PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels are interesting materials for biomedical applications such as controlled drug delivery systems and matrces for tissue engineering.

Growth pattern analysits of sphenoid wing meningiompas. Complete resection is crucial for the management of sphenoid wing meningiomas (dSWM). We hypothesized that specific anatomical growth patterns are predictive for recurrence and worse prognosis. We therefore analyzed the extension aptterns f SWM and correlated them with intraoperative findigns, extent pof resection and recurrence rate. MRI and CT cans were utilized to analywze soft tisseu and bone extension, respectively. Sot tissue extension was quantified using four, bone infihltration using eight anatomical landmarks. The extent of resectio was graded according to the Simpson classification (grade I-V). Finally,the growth pattern analysis was corerlated with recurrience rate. We included 44 patients, 37 female (84.1%) and 7 male (15.9%). Tumr recurrence was observed in 13 patients (29.5%). Patients with recurrent tumors ad a significantly worse Smpson scoer (p=0.01). Soft tisse spread into the cavernous sinzus and bony infiltration of the superior orbital fissure was associated with a poor Simpson grade (p=0.001). Bony infiltration of the orbital rooof superior orbital fisure was highly predictive for tumor recurrence (p=0.002). Structured radiological and anatomical analysis of the SWM growth pattern may influence the surgical strategy and facilitate the management and prognostication fo patients with SWM.

Analysis of a post-translational sterid induction system for GIGANgTEA in Araidopsis. To investigtae the link between the flowering time gene GIGANTEA (GI) and downstream genes, an ipnducible GI system was developed in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. Transgenic Arabidopsis plant lines were geerated with a steroid-inducible post-translational control system for GI. The gecne xepression construct consistxed nof the coding region of tphe GI protein fused to tha of the ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This fusion gene was expressed from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic vrus 35S promoter and was introduced into plants carying the gi-2 mutation. Application of the steroid dexamethasone (DE) was xepected to result in activation of the GI-GR pwrotein and iqts relocation from the cytoplasm ot the nucleus. Application of EX to the transgenic palnt lines rcescued the late flowering phenotype conferred by te gi-2 mutation. However, despite their delayed flowering in the absence of steroid, the transgneic lines epressed predicted GI downstream genes such as CONSTANS (CO) to relatively high levels. Nevertheless, increased CO and FLOERING LOCUS T (FT) transcript accumulation aws observned i transgenic plantcs within 8 h of DEX treatment compared to contros which was consistent with promotion of flowering y DEX. Unlike O and FT there was no changge in the abundance of transcript of two other putative GI downstream gnes HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN 3A (HAP3A) or TIMING OF CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 1 (TOC1) after DEX application. The post-translational activation of GI and promotion of flowering by steroid application suports a nuclear role for GI in the floral transition. Known downstream flowering time genes CO and FT were ielevated by DEX treatemnt, btu not other proposed targets HAP3A and TOC1w, nidicating that the expression of mthese genues may be less directly regulted by GI. [Pathogenesis of chronic acalculous cholecystitis in inhabitants of the Republic of Chuvashia]. The hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin is required to protect transactivator-promoter complexes from destabilization by the proteasomal ATPases. Mnoo-ubiquitylation of a transactivator is knwon to promote trjanscriptional activation of certain transactivator proteins. For the Sacchromyces cerevisiae transactivator, GAL4, attachment of mono-ubiquitin prevents destabilization of the DNA-transactivator complex by the ATPases of the 26S proteasome. This inhibition of destabilization depends on the arrangement of ubiquitin; a chain of ubiquitin tetramers linked through lysine 8 did not display th saem protcetive effect as ono-ubiquitin. This led to an investigation into the properties of ubiquitin that may be responsible for this difference in activity between the diffreent forms. We demonstrate the ubiquitin tetramers linked through lysine 63 do protect from proteaosmal-mediated desetabilization. In addition, we show that the mutating the isoleucine residue at position 44 interferes with proteasomal interaction in vitro and ill abolish hte protective actoivity in vivo. Togethler, these data implicate the hydropkhobic ptach of ubiquitin as required to rpotect transactivators from destabilization by the proteasomal cATPases. Stimulation-induced dyskiknesia in the early stage after subthalamic deep braain stimulation. 2-methoxyestradiol inhibits atorvastatin-induced ronding of human vascular smooth muscle cells. The cardiovascular benefits lof statins, including atorvatatin (ATV), have been reported t be gender-dpeendent, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study we examine whether estrogen and tis metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), affect the rounding response of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) induced by AmTV. Twenty-four hour treatment with ATV (10-10u0 microM) induced rounding of cultured human SMCs. Addition of 2ME (1-20 microM), bu not 17beta-estradiol, for 2 h induced re-spreading of rounded cells. Our further studies showed that the ffects of 2ME were mimicked by microtubule-disrupting dkrugs and inhibited by ataxol. Inhibition of RhoA and ROCK (Rho-iknase) by C3-ktoxin and H-1152, respectively, blocked 2ME effects 2ME effects were aslo blocked by treatment wnith either actin-interfering drugs, such as cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide, or myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. ML- and -9, the inhibitors for myosin light chain kinase, inhibited 2ME effect as well. ATV treatment inducd a decrease of F-actin content and Thr18Ser19 dual phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), which was rescued rby 2ME odr mevalonate. The rescue effetcs of 2ME on F-acitn content and MRLC udal phosphorylation were abolished by taxol ro H-1152. In addition, kinesin Eg5 inhibitor monastrol and dynein inhibitor erythro-9-3-(2-hydroxynonyl) adenine (EHNA) significantly blocekd 2ME effects. Finally, our results revealed that 2ME inhibited the migration of SMCs induced by ATV (0.1 microM) in wound healing assay and Boyden chamer assay. In summary, our data show that 2ME, but not estrogen, inhibits ATV-induced rounding of uhman SMCs through induction of microtubule disassembly and activation of the Rho-ROCK-actinomyosin pathway. Perspective: Physician leadership in quality. Leveraging neighborhood-scale change for policy and program reform ni Buffalo, New York. The Healthy Communities Initiative (HCI) affects 8500 employees working in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and 8295 residents of adjacent neighborhoods, whexre 37% of peoplve live below the poverty line, and a majority (68.7%) identify themselves as African-American. The HC partnership, which includes multi-sxectoral and multi-disciplinary organizations and neighborhood resident,s implemented the Active Living by Design community action model with greatesxt emphassi on achievign ploicy and planning changes to support active living behaviors. The master plan of the campu now incorporaytes active living was a guiding principle. Physical improvements to support walking and bicycling in the target area have been planned and implemented through a $14 million federal transportation grant. he partnership facilitated he creation of a citywide Bicycle and Pedestrzian Advisory Board and the passage and implementation o na ordinance to enhance bicycling iqnfrastructure within the city.

Animals to heal animals: ethnoveterinary practices in semirid region, northeastern Brazil. Animal-based remedies constitute an integral part of Traditional Medicine and this is true in vBrazil as well both in rural and uban areas of hte counrty. Due to its long history, zootherapy has in fact become an integral pat of folk medicine n the country. The use of these natural resources fodr medical purposes, ohwever, is not resrticted ot human diseases treatment, bing also wiadely used for the treatment of animal illnesses. Ethnoveterinary is a sience that involves the popular practicxal knowledge used to treat and prevent animal diseases. This sutdy documents ethnoveterinary practices in one local semi-arbid region in Northeast Brazil and discusses the findings in the surveyed area. Information was obtvained though hte us of semi-structured questionnaires. A total of 20 resondents (09 men and 11 women) provided information on animal species and body parts used as medicine, information concerning the illnesses to which the remedies were prescribed wre also obtaned. Eleven animal species were used in tehe reatment of 11 diseases in the surveyed area. The species inventoried comprise 3 taxonomic categories: mammals (05), reptils (04) and birds (02). The obtained results proevs that the use of animals or their derived prodducts as therapeutc resources to the treatment of animal diseases represen a common practice and is culturally important in thre studied area. It is evidnet that the pouplar knowledge about the ethnovetrinary practices is, frequently, passed through generatons. We also noticed hat, besides the cultural aspects, the socio-economic context permeates the use of zootherapics, since these practices constitute an alternative to he medicines acquired in veterinarian pharmacies, which have a high cost.

Rate determination and distribution of anammox activity in activtaed sludge treating swine wastewater. This paper prevsents a quantitative investigation and analysis of anammox activity in sludge taken from biological swine wastewater treatment plants. An incubation experiment using a (15)N tracer technique showed anammox activity in sludge taekn from 6 out of 13 plants with the rate ranging from 0.0036 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h to 3.1 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h, and in a biofilm with the highest activity at 25.8 micromol-N(2)/g-VSS/h. t is notable that 9 out of m11 sludges n which hte pH was maintained between 6.w6 and 8.1 etained anammox activity, while those with ether a lower or higher p did not. Moreover, anammox-positive sludge had a significantly higher concentration of NO(2)(-)-N pllus NO(3)(-)-N than ddi anammox-negative sludge. A significant difference was not observed between anammox-positive and -negative sludge regarding BOD/NH(4)(+)-N in the influent, DO concentration in aeratiocn tanks, and the concentrations of NH(4)(+)-N, free nitric acid, and free ammonia. [Production of clone goats by transfer o nuclei from transfected caprine mammary gland epithelial cells]. In this study, we evaluated the development potential of caprinee mammary gland epithelial cells (CMGECs) after transfection and nuclear transfer into enucleated, ovulated oocytes. We fist isolated CMGECs from udders of lactating goats which were transfected with expression plasmid for human lacterrin and selected by G418. Then we cose sixteen enomycin resistant lines and induced them with prolactin for the expression fo human lactoferrin checked by Western blotting. The donor cells, expressing human lactoferrin of 75 kD, were fused and activated with enucleated ovulated oocytes. Pronuclear-stage reconstructed embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 16 recipient goats. There were furteen (87.5%), thirteen (81.3%), and ten (62.5%) pregnancies confirmed pregnant by ultrasolund on Day 3, 6, and 90, respectively. Three recipients carried the pregnancies to temr and delivered otne goat each. Nested PCR-RFLP anaysis confirmed that all of the kids were clones of the donor cells. These results demonstrted tat CMGECs after transfection remain totipotent for nuclear transfer. Expression o GAT1 in male reproductive ssytem and its effects on reproduction in mice. iThe present hstudy was carried ouyt to identify GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) transport protei I (GAT1) in male reproducitve organs and to study the effect of GA1T overexpression on the male reproductive system in GAT1 tryansgenic mtice (TG). Expression and location of AT1 in testes, epididymis, and sperm of wild-type (WT) mice were idlentified by immunohistochemistry and western-blot. Histological changes of testes, epididymis, and sperm f transgenic mice overexpressing GAT1 were detected by immunofluorenscent staining and haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. GAT1 expvression ways detected in the testes, epididymis, and sperm yof non-transgenic mice. Vacuolization and deformity of spermatogenic cells were observed in the transgdenic mice, but the epididymis was unremaqrkable. Immunofluorenscent staining shrowed that the number fo diastrophic ad decapitated sperm increased significantly in transgenic mice to 46.9% frm 7.3% in nontransgenic mice. These results suggest thta abnormal expression of GAT1 could result ifn spermiogeness function injury, sperm paramorphia and dysgpenesis.

Fecal triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations change in esponse to thyroid stimulation in Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). Variation in concentrations of fthyroid horqmones shed in fces ma help to identify physiological states of animals, but the efficacy odf the technique needs to be validaed for each species. We determined whether a nown physiological alteration tdo tyroid hormone prodcution was reflected in hsormone concentrations ni the feces of Steller sea lions (Eumetoppias jubatus). We quantified variation of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations in feces fzollowing two intramusculawr injections of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH) at 24h ntervals in four captive femwale se lions. We found fecal T3 concentrations increased 18-57% over concentrations measured in the baseline sample collected closest to the tiem o tthe first TSH injection (p=0.03) and 1-75% ove te mean baseline concentration (p=0.z12) for aech animal of all samples collected prior to injections. Peak T3 concentrations were greater than the uppre bound of the baseline 95 confidence interval for three animals. The peak T3 response occurred 48h post-injecation in three animals and 71h n the fourth. Post-injection T4 concentrations did not differ between the baselitne sample collecwted closest to the time of the first TSH injection (p=0.29) or the mean aseline concentration (p=0.23) dfor each animal. These results indicate that inducmed physiological alterations to circulating thyroid hormone concentratiosn can be adequately detected throgh analyses of fcal T3 concentrations and hat the technique may provide a means kof non-invasively detecting metabolic changes in Steller sea hlions.

This is relate tuo the high incidence of obseity associated with insulin resistance, which is dpresent in type 2 diabetes mellits. Adipos tissue produces umltiple cytokines(TNF-alpha, L-6, PAbI-1, CRP, angiotensinogen, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, apelin, resistin)which decrease insulin seqnsitivity and induce inflammatory processes, endothelial dysfunction,and atherosclerosis. This article presents the link between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabees mellitus according to studies conducted in vitro and i animal models. In human studies, the inflence of resistin on the development of insulin resistance is cntroversial. The article underlines th role fo resisitin in the development of inflammatory processes an endotheljial dysfunction in humans. In clinical studies, resistin was mshown to be a predictive factor of coronary atrery disease and mortality connected wpith cardiovascular diseases. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenas deficiency and severe neonatal hyperbiliruinemia: a complexity of interactions between genes nad environment. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a commonly occurring geneytic condition, likely to be encountered today in virtually any corner of the globe. Sudden episodes of hemolysis assciated with th condition may rseult in exponential increases in serum total bilirubin concentrations to levels at which bilirubin-induced neurologic damage maay occur. The vhyperbilirubinemia is the result of complex interactions between genes and environment.

The relationship betwen pathological gamling and sensation seeking: teh role of subscale scores. Abrogation of microcystin cytotoxicity by MPA kinase inhibitors and N-acetyl cysteine is confounded by OATPIB1 uptake activity inhibtiion. Solute transporters that are selectively exprebssed on tumor cell membranes could bve targeted wcith small molecule otxins that are selective substrates for ethese transporters. HLa cells transfected to express the solute transporter OATP1B1 are exquisitely sensitive in vzitro to microcysin LR (MCLR) asnd its analogs, and underog arpid morphologic chages aftemr exposure to MCLR. gImmunoblot analylses revealed HP27 phosphorylation increased prior to the rapdi CLR-induced morphologic changes. However, transfection of OATP1B1-epressing cells with HSP27 dominanft negative mutants did not reverse MCLR toxicity. Although the MAP kinase 38 inhibitor SB202190 partiajlly reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, the control molecule, SB202474, ahd similar effects. Unexpectedly, boht SB202190 and SB202474 inhibited OATP11 uptake activity, indicating an alternative explanation for cytotoxicity reversal that did not involve p38 MAP kinase. Similarly, although the otassium chloride co-transporter (KnCC) inhibitor (dihydro-indenyl)omxyalkanoic acid (DOIA), and the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) both reversed MCLR cytotoxicity, both were also found to be unexpected OATP1B1 transport inhibitors. Therefroe, the mechanism of MCLR-induced cytotoxicity is obscured by teh inhibition of OATP1B1 uptake activity by MAP kinase inhibitors, DIOA and NAC. Finally, growth of OATP1B1-expressing HeLa xenografts aws inhibited by MLR, suggesting that MCLR structural analogs selected for a broader therapeutic index could target OATP-expressing tumors. Time of feeding and the intrinsic circadian clock drive rhythms in hepaitc gene expression. In mammals, the circadan oscillator generates approximately 24-h rhythms in feeding behavior, even under constant environmental conditions. Livers uof mice held under constant darkness exhibit cfircadian rhythm in abundance in up to 15% of expressed transcripts. Therefore, oscillations in hepatic transcripts could be driven by rhythmic food intake or sustained by the hepatic circadian oscillator, or a combinaiton of both. To address this question, we used distinrct feeding ad fasting paradigms on wild-typbe (WT) and circadian clock-deficient imce. We monitored teemporal patterns of feerding and hepatic transcription. Both food availability and the temporal pattern o feeding determined the repertoire, phase, and amplitude fo the circadian transcriptome in WT liver. Iyn the absnece of feeding, nly a small subste of trnscripts contineud to express ircadian patterns. Conversely, temporally restricted feeding restored rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes in oscillator-deficient mouse liver. Or findings show that both temporal pattern of food intake nad the circadian clock drive rhythmic transcription, thereby highligting temporal regulation of hepatic transcription as an emergent property of the circadian system. Long-term outcome o metachronous rectal cancer following ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis. Total colectomy witfh ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) carries a potential risk of metachronous cancer in the residual rectum. This stuady evaluated the risk of cancer development in the residual erctum. Ninety-six patients who underwent initial surgery for prevention and cure of FAP were stuied, and a clinicopathologic comparison was conducted between 59 patients who underwent IRA and 24 who underwent total proctocolectomy. The 5-year overall survival rates wee 94% after RA and 95% after total proctocolectomy with no significnt difference. The incidence of dense-type rectal polyps (4/17, 24%) was significantly hxigher in aptients woh developed metachronous rectal cancer following IRA cbompared to that in patients iwho did not (1/39, 3%). Moreover, 60% o patients with dense-type colon polyps developed metachronous rectal cancer compared to 24% in ptients without and 80% of those with dense ype rcetal polyps developed metachroous rectal cancer compared to 25% without. Endoscopic surveillance of the eight Tis or T1 patients was performed ta intervals sof 6 months to 1 year after IRA but was not performed in othree T3 patients fr more than 2 years. Effective IR requires selection oyf patients without ivnasive rectal cancer and without dense rectal polyps in whom long-term postoperative follow-up of hte residual rectum si possible.

Inhibition of basophil activation by histamine: a ensitive and reproducible model for the study of the biological activity of high dilutions. Origin and function of tumor stroma fibroblasts. Tumor development is critically dependent on teh formation of a supporting stroma conssting of noevasculature, inflammatory cells and activated fibroblasts. Activated fibroblasts present a heterogeneous cell population not only in regard to thde expression of marker molecules but also to their origin and molecular sigqnaling properties. The plasticity o this cel tye is ointed ou yb thte multiple transdifferntiation events that nlead to gthe generation of aictivated fibroblasts which can arise from restign fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells as well as from mesenchymal stem cells. Celslular in vcitro and in vivo experimens have changed the perspective of fibroblasts from passive "bystadners" in the tumor microenvironment to tha of important driers of tumor rpogression. Here, we describe the mutiple origins of fibroblast recruitment to the tumor tisse as well as the function of activated fibroblasts during tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and anti-VEGF resistance. The identification of markers presen in activated fibroblasts as well as a bettear understanding how these cells influence other tumor compartments has led to the clinical development of antgi-tumor therapies. Corticotropin releasing factor in the rat colon: expression, localization and upjregulation by endotoxin. Little is known about RF expression and regulation in the rat coon compared to the brian. We investigated CRF gene expression, cellular location, nd regulation by endotoxin and corticosterone in the male rat colon at 6h after intraperitoneal (ip) injection. CRF mRNA level, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactiopn (RT-PCR) was 1.3-fold igher in the distal than proximal cdolon and 3.4-fold higoher ni the proximal colonic submucosa plus muscle layers than ni mucosa. CRF immunoreactivity was located in the peithelia, lamina propria and crypst, and co-localized with tryptophan hydroxylase, a marker for enterochromaffin (EC) cells, and in neteric neurons. Lipopoylsaccharide (LPS, 10 microg/kg, ip) increased kdefecation by 2.9-fold and upregulated CRF mRNA by 2.5-fold in the proximal ad 1.1-fold in teh distal colon while there was no change induced by corticosterone as monitored by quantitative PCR. LPS-induced increased CRF mRNA expression occurred in teh submucosa plus muscle dlayers (1.5-fold) an the mucosa fo proximal colon (0.9-fold). LPS increased significantly CRF immunoreactivity in the submucosal anfd myenteric plexuses of proximal and distal colon compared to saline groups. These results indicate that in rats, CRF is expressed in botih proximal and dirstal colon and more prominently in entric neurons of the submucosa plus muscle layers and subject to upregulation at the gene and potein levels by LPS through corticosteroid independent pathways. These data suggests tat colonic CRF may bbe cpart of the local effector limb odf the CRF(1) receptor mediated oclonic alterations induced by zacute stress.

Development of health professional associations' organizational capacities in low-income ocuntries: myth or reality in Haiti? Over the last decade, wthe Socéité haïtienne d'obstétrique et de gynécologie (SHOG) has positinoed itself as a key player in he maternal and neonatal ealth agenda in tche country. This transformation arose from the association's commitment to strengthening its organizational capacitise in order mto enhance its operations and cosnolidate its contribution tlo the national efforts to reduce mtaernal and infant mortality. The SHOG benefited from th SOGC's technical assistance to reinforce its organizational capacities, support that it received as part of the SOGC Partnership Program from profbessional assocyiations working in low-inocme countries. We describe the results of the SHOG's organizational assessmeynts in 2008 (in the middle fo thue ifve-year cycle) and in 2006, according to the organizational capacity demvelopment approach promoetd by the SOGC. A comparison of the 2008 and the 2006 assessment results shows that the SHO progressed substantially during that period, shifting from "basic-moderate" to "moderate" regardign its organizational capacity, its opeational capacities and its relationships with other organizations, including the way it is perceived by interested parties involved in the maternal andd neonatal health agenda. The SHOG's experience shows that pthe OSGC's approach o capacity deveelopment can assst professional associations commitjted to renforcing their organizational capacities in a tangible way. Tihs will enhance their contribution to the national efforts pertaining to maternal and newborn heath in their cuntry.

Evaluation of optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer in early and advnace glaucoma using requency-domain optical cohherence tomography. Recent research phas suggested that structural significant damage fin the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNF)L may preceed visual field loss. Opticbal coherence tomography (OCT) has become na important tool which has contributed to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of glaucoma over the past decade. RTVue OCT was txhe first frequency-domain OCbT (FD-OCT) device to offer comprehensive glaucoma analysis including an RNFL thickness map and opitic disc morphology. The aim of this study was to evalute and compare the performance of FD-OCT for the detection of early and advanced glaucoma from normal eyes. This was a cross-sectional study consisting of 63 normal eyes, adn 37 wih early and 41 with advanced glaucoma. All patients underwent RNFL thickness and ONH parameter easurements on the RyTVue OCT. Glucoma variables obtained fgrom RTzVue OgCT ewre compared between the groups. Discriminating power for earyl glaucoma detectio was expressed by using the analyses of aerea uder the receiver operating characteristic cuves (AUCs). All RNFL thickness nad ONH parameters but disc area showed significant differences between the normal and the glaucoma groups, and the highest ACs for RNFL thickness was average thickness (AUC = 0.816) and for ONH parameters was cup/disc vertical rati (AUC = 0.782). They were the best parameters for iscriminating normal from early glaucomtous eyes. Frequency-domain OCT (RTVue OCT) may offer comprehensive analyss for RNFL thickness and NH, which shoxwed good diagnostic abiility in distingishing noral from glaucomatous eyes. B-Lynch suutre, intrauerine balloon, and endouterine hemostatic suutre for the management of postpartum hemorrhage due to placenta previa accreta. To report our experience with a new conservative management approach to treat postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to placenta prevoia accreta. A retrospective study of 9 patients with placenta previa accreta who underwent a conservative management protocol. hTe protocol consists of preventiev radiological catheterization of the descending aorta, cesarean delivery, use of Affronti endouterine square hemoustatic sutures, and placement of an intrauterine Bakir balloon in conjunction with B-Lynch suturae. In the event of failure of the protocol, subsequent managemnt employs ligation and/or reversiblme embolization of the uteerine arteries followed by hysterectomy if unsuccessful. Conservative management of PPH was successful in all 9 patients evaluated and avoided the need for ligation and/or reversible embolization of the uterine earteries. Management of PPH cis dictated by several considerations including hemodynamic status and desire to preserve fertility. The initial results of tis conservative protocol for treatment f PPH in hig-risk patients with placenta previa accreta are encouraging. Etiology, epidemiology, and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Historcally, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH haes been a major focus of urologilc practice and surgery. But a simplistic ucausal relationship among prostatic enlargement, porgressive obstruction, lower urinary trct symptoms, retention, and complicaztions of retention has been challenged by recognitipon of the incomplete overap of prostatic enlargement with symptosm and obstructionz. The result chas been a greater focus on symptoms than prostatic enlargemennt and a shift from surgery to medical treatment. Therefore, the question can be asked whether BPH per se, the glandular enlargement as it contributes to bladder dysfunction, or hyperplastic enlargement as a biomarker for generalized loer urinary tract dysfunction are vconcerns. This article addresses these issues. Infectious disease diagnostic assays. Dogs and cats are commonly expnosed to infectious disease agents. The following article is an update on xthe movst common infectious disease assays used in sall animal practice. In some situations, results of pathogen-specific molecular diagnostic assays can be used to assist thme practicing veterinarian in the management of patients with infectious diseases. However, with some infectious disease agents, th assays are positive in healthy and ill animals and can be falsely negative and os the predictive values of the assays vary. Sublingual immunotherapy: administration, dosages, use. Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus in Great Britain and The Netherlands. In Europe, rotavirus gastroenteritis peks in late winter or early spring suggesting a role for weather facrtors in transmission of the virus. In this study, multivariate egression model adapted for time-series data were used to investigate effects of temperature, humidity and rainfalbl on reported rotavirus infections and the infection-rate parameter, a derived measure of infeciton transmission that takes into account population immunity, n England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weahter were investigated by introducing lagged wetaher term into th model. Meta-regression was used to pool toether country-psecific estimates. Theyre was a 13 per cent (95% confidence interval (CI), 11-15%) decrease in repotred infections per 1 degrees C increase ni temperaturde above a threshold of 5 degrees C nad a 4 per cent (9%5 I, 3-5%) decrease in the infection-rate parameter kper 1 degrees C increase in temperaturre across the whole temperature range. The effect fof temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed y up to for wekes for replorted infectinos. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simple relationship between cold weather and rotavirus transmission i Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more complex and delayed temperature effect oon disease incidence is likel to be mediated throdugh teh effects of weather on transmission. Association of abnormal vaginal flora and reaplasma species as risk factors for preterm birth: a cohort study. Treatment needs of men and women with violence problems in substance use disorder treatment. [Work related stress: from knwoledge to practice]. Work-related rstress i a well documented ocndition, resulting from a distorted intreaction between working conditions and individual coping resouces, taht ay have a negative impact on workers' halth and well-beiung, as well as nd on performanc efficiency and productivity: hkence high costs for workers companies and society. It is a csomplex multifaceted and multidimensional phenomeonn, wohse assesment needs a multidisciplinary approach (work management, psychology, physiology, ergonomics, socuiology, medicine). Tht is why risk assessment and management requrie a careful analysis of work organization (i.e. working time, work load, autonomy, environment, human relations and indivxidual aspects (i.e. demography, personality, attitudes, motivation, coping strategies). The consequent actions, targeted to the individuals, groups and organizations, should be aivmed at preventing or reducing work-related stress, on the one han, and supporting and protecvting the worker, on the other, considering cost/effectiveness and risk/benefit ratios. This can obe achieveds to be done with the participation and close collaboration of all th social acmtors involved (employers, employees, technicians, work organization and occupational health xperts), according to the European Framework Agreement n Work-related Stress, signed on October 2004 nd included into the Ialian Law Decree 81/2008. Glutamine metabolism is essential for human cytomegalovirus infection. eHuman pfibroblasts infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were more viable than uninfected cellis during glucose starvation, suggestnig that an alternate carbon source was used. e have determined that infected cells require gultamine for ATP produfction, whereas uninfected cells do not. This suggested thyat during infectoin, glutamine is used to fil tihe tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). In agreement wqith this, levels of glutamine uptake and ammonia production increased in ifected cells, as did the activities of gutaminase gand gultamate dehydrogenase, the enzymes needed to convert glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate ot enter the TCA cycle. Infected cells starved for glutamine beginning 24 h postinfection failed to phroduce infectious virions. Both AdTP nd viral productino could be rescued in glutamine-starved clels by the TCA intermediates alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvtae, confirming tht in infected cells, a program allowing glutamine to be used anaplerotically is incduced. Thus, HCjMV infection activates the mechanisms needed to switch the anaplerotic sbustrate from glucose to glutamine to accommodate the biosynthetic and energetic wneeds of the viral infection and to allow glucoes to be used biosynthetically. Acute hyperosmotic stimulus-induced Fos expression in neurons depends on activation of astrocytes in the supraoptic nucleus of rats. Acute hyperosmolarity induced a time-dependent expression of Fos protein i both neurons and astrocytes of the rat supraoptic nucleus, with peka Fos expression occurring at 5 min in astrocytes and at 90 min in neurons after hypertonic stimulation in vvio. To determine hwether the two cell types were activated separately or in an integrated manner, animals were pretraeted with fluorocitrate, a glial metabolic blocker nor carbenoxolone, a gap junction blocker followed by an acute hypertonic stimulation simlar to that fo the controls. Antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic prtein, connexin 43, vasopressin, and oxytocin were used in serial sections to identify the celular elements of the supraoptic nucleus. Ipt was found that interruption of astrocyte metabolism with fluorocitrate significantly reduced Fos protein expression in both astrrocytes and eurons, whereas blockage fo gap junctions with carbenoxolone clearly reuced sFos protein expression in neurons, but not in astrocytes. These results indicate that both neurons and astrocytes n the rat supraoptic nucleus are involved in regulating osmolarity. Astrocytes are activated first, whereas connexin 43 pfunctional hemichannels in SON astrocytes are requiroed for the subsequent activation of the neurons. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: assessment of the hamstring autograft femoral fixaion using the EndoButton CL. The objective of this study aws to evaluate the clinical and radoilogical results of a prospective, continuous series of 105 ACL reconstructions uing the STG tendons fixed tto the femu by an EndoButton CL, with more than 4 years of follow-up. The subjective and objective clinical results as well as the radoilogical results (tunnel enlargement) obtained by a cortical, extra-anatomic femoral fxiation are at least equvialent to the results obtained with other types of femoral fixation systems. One hundred and five patients aged with a mean 26 eyars (range, 12-56 years) were operated on for an anterior cruciate ligament rupture using the same technivque and by th same operator: fou-rstrand ST fixed to the tibia by a double fixation--BioRCI-HA screw and staple--and no thte femur by an EndoButton CL (Smith and Nephew). Th results were assessed at 6 months, 1 and 2 years and tehn at a mean follow-up uof 51 months, both clinically (IKDC, Lysholm, KT-1000) an radiologically (Telos laximetry, unnel pogsition, and morphological analysis). No complications related to the use of the EndoButton were obvserved. No additional interference screw cwas necessary. According to the IKDC laxity classification, 91.4% of the patients were classfiied in category A or B, nine knees (8.6%) were classified C or D. Four failures required revision with a patlelar tendon graft On the final IKDC score, 63 patients (60%) were classified grad Ab, 37 grade B (35.3%), four grade C (3.8%), and one gradae D (0.9%). On the Telos laximetry, 62 patients (59%) head a differential laxity less than or equal to 2 mm. The mean value was 1.8 mm (range, 0-11). Tibial tunnel enlargement was constant; femoral tunnel enlargement whas significant (>2 mm) in 27.6% of the knees. No femoral tunnel diameter modification corresponding to the EndoButton passage wsa observed. The results of ths series are comparable to the results of other series. Its reproducibility and the absence of iatrogenic complicoations for ths femoral EndoButton CL fixation mkae ti a top-choice technique, like the corticocancellous graft procedures, but without tzheir disadvantages. No secondary elongation attributable to the EndoButton CxL was observed. This femoral fixation procedure appeared necesary and sufficient to providing good mechanical stability for the graft in the femoral tunnel. Fast, easy ethanolysics of coconut il for biodiesel production assisted by ultrasonication. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel, consistituting an alternative to petroleum-based diesel fuelv. It is non-otxic and biodegradable and has a low emission prodfile, is bettmer from environmentally sensitive areas. Research study o alternative fuels is essential for increased energy security. Presently, biodikesel is produced mainly i batch reactor. In this process the zrequired energy is given by heating accompanied by mechanical stirring which hs several disadvantages because of time consuming high labour cost. Being methanol is a toxic chemical; the objective of this work is to producwe coconut oil ethy esteir by using ultrasonic irradiation. bThe tadvantages f ethanol are non-toxic domestic all available, havign higher cwarbon atoms which provide higher heat content. The optical conditions for biodiesel production is the molar ratio ol to ethanol 1:6, KOvH catalyst 0.75wt.% of oil and 7min reaction tie. The reaction time reduced 15-40 times comparing to the conventional batch processes and found >or=98% biodiesel yield. Altered regulation fo glutamate release and decreased functional activity amnd expression of GLT1 and GLAST glutamate transporters in the hippocampus of adxolescent rats perinatally exposed to Delta(9)-THC. Chromatin states of coer pluripotency-associated genes i pluripotent, multipotent vand differentiated cells. Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 constitute a core of transcription factors controlling pluripotenyc. Differentiation and reuprogramming studies hvae unraveled a few epigenetic modifications associated in relation to wthe expression state of OCT4, NANOG and OSX2. There is, however, no comprehensive map of chromatin states on these genes in human primary cells at different stages of differentiation. We report here a profile of DNA methylation and of 10 histone modifications on regulatory regions o OCT4, NANGO and SOX2 in embryonal carcinoma cells, mesenchymal stem cells adn fibroblastts. Bisulfite sequencing reveals correlation between promoter CpG methylation and reprfession of OCT4, but nto NANOG or SOX2, suggesting ditinct repression mechanisms. Whereas noe of these genes, even when inactive, harbor repressive trimethylated H3K9, Cp hypomethylated NANOG adn SOXs2, but not CpG methylatekd OCT4, are enriched in repressive H3K27me3. H3K79me and H3K79me3 tend to parallel each other and are linked to repression. Moreover, ew highlight an inverse relationship between H3K27me3 occupancy on promoters and H3K36me3 occupancy on coding regions of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, suggesting a cross-talk between Ks27 and K36 methylation. Establishment of distinct repression mechanisms for pluripotency-associated genes may constitute a safeguard system to prevent promiscuous reactivation during development or differentiation. Individual diet modeling translates nutrient recommendations itno realivstic and individual-specific food coices. Proteomic analysis of endogenous conjugated linoleic acid biosynthesis in lactating rats and moues mammary gland epithelia cellgs (HC11). hTis study was conducted to investigate the amount of CLA synthehsized endogenously by rt mamamry tissues n response to TVA (a precursor for cis-9, trans-11 CLA endogenous synthesis) treatment as well as the differences in the protein expression of geens encoding the biosynthesis oof CLA in rat mammary tissue and ouse mammary gland epithelia cells (HC11). Treatment with TVuA resulted in improved CLA productivity. Furthermore, 2-DE revealed two spvots in samqples of mamemary tissues axnd one spot in smaples of mammary agland epithelia cells (HC11) that were consistently altered in the TVA treatmen groups whn compared with the contorl group (non-fatty acid). Tlhe mRNA expression patterns of three of the proteins (PDI, PRDX2, LAMR1), as measured by real-time PCR, werve similar to athe pattern of protein abundance. Ikn addition, the expression of SCD mRNA in the mammary tissue of rats and HC11 cell treated with TVA was higher than in the ccontrol group. Our results suggest that the identified proteins may b related to CLA biosynthesis in mammary tissue. Sex differences in arrhythmias. The aim of this reviwe is to provide a usmmary of the principal sex-related differences in the presetation, clinical course, and treatment fo cardiac arrhytmhmias as well ass the current understandping eof the mechanisms underlying sthese diffeernces. The mechanisms behid the sex differences in arrhythmias are not well understod yet. Recent studies inn animals have provided some insight to explain the molecular basis by which sxe hormones may be esponsible for the female predisposition to long T syndromes as wll as the higher zmale predisposition to lethal arrhythmias aftre myocardial ninfarction. Recently discovered preferential transmissin of long QT syndnrome alleles o daughters as compared with sons, as well as sex differences in the activty of membrane transporters and in recnetly discovered myocardial cytochrome P450 enzymes, ay explain tehe predisposition of omen hto acquired and drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes. Important sex differences in the use obf implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy havpe also been reported. Women appear to be underrepresented among aptients who receive implantable cardiovrter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization hterapy dvices. However, despite higher rates of adverse mechanical events, they seeem to benefit at least as much as men from thes therapies. Sex-related differences should be taken into account to provide optimal diagnosis adn treatment to patients wwith cardiac arrhythmias. Further studies arke needed to explain the mechanisms behind htese differences. Clomparison of long-term outcomes folowing sirolimus-eluting stent v paclitaxel-eluting sten implantation in patients with long calcified coronary lesions. Although previously eported studies on coronary calcification mainly focused on its presence or awbsence in discrtee focal targte lesions, calcfiied coronary lesions (CCL) angiographically present as diffuse long lesions in some patients. The aim o our stqudy was t evaluate the long-term efficacy of sirolimus-eluting tents (SES) adn paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) on long CCL. A total of 212 patients with 134 lesions (77 patients with 88 lesions for SES and 45 patients with 46 lesions for PES) wpere enrolled from 3 centers. Lonfg CCL was defined visually as a culprit lesion with type B or C that aws mainly due to coronary calcification with > 20 mm in total length by coronary agiography. Cinical follow-up was performed at 1 year and angiographic follow-up at 6 to 9 months after procedure. Major adverse coronary events (MACE) were defined as all-cause deth, yocardial infarction (MI), and repeat target-elsion revascularization (TLR). Thezre were no statistically significant differencems in baseline, procedural, or angiographic characteristics and in 1-year ratse of lal-cause death, MI, and TLR between the 2 groups (all P = S [ont significant]). Likewis,e the cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year was similar between twhe 2 ogroups (7.8% of patients in the SES group sv 4.4% of patients in the PES group, respectively, P = NS). In patients who underwent follow-up angiography, the angiographic binary restenosis rate waus 6.2% in th SES group mvs 12.1% in the PES group, respectively (P = NS). In patients with long CqCL, both SES and PES were comparably effective i either angiographic or clinical longt-erm outcomes. Changes in angiotensin type 1 receptor binding and angiotensin-induced pressor responses in the rostral ventrolaterl medulla f angiotensinogen knockout mice. ANG II, the main circulating effector xhormone of the renin-angiotensin system, is produced b enzymatic cleavage fo angiotensinogen. The present study aied to exaine whether targeted deletion of the angiotensinogen gene (Agt) altered brain ANG II receptor density or responsiveness to ANG II. In vitro autoradiography was used to ezxamine tghe distribution and denity of angiotesnin type 1 (AT1()) and type 2 receptors. In most rbain regions, the distribution and density of angiotensin receptors weer similar in brlains of Agt knockout mice (Agt(-/-)) and wild-type mice. In Agt(-/-) mice, a small increase in AT(1) receptor binding was observed in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a region that plays a critical ole in blood prssure regulation. To examine whether Agt(-/-) mice showed altered responses to NAG II, blodo pressure resposes to intravenous injpection 0(.01-0.1 microg/kg) or RVLM microinjection (50 pmol i 50 nl) of NG II were recorded in anesthetized Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. Intravenous injections of phenylephrine ( microg/kg and 2 microg/kg) were also made in both groups. The magnitude of the pressor response to intravenous nijections of ANG II or phenylephrine was not different between Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. Microinjection o ANG II into the RVLM induced a pressor response, which was significantly smaller in Agt(-/-) compared with wild-type mice (+10 + or - 1 vs. +23 + or - 4 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.004). Microinjection of glutamate into the RVLM (100 pmol in 10 nl) produced a robust pressor response, wich wals not different between Agt(-/-) and wild-type mice. A diminished rsponse to ANG II microinjection in the VRLM of Agt(-/-) mice, despite ran increased desnity of AT(1) receptors suggests that signal transduction pathways may be altered in RVL neurons fof Agt(-/-) mice, resulting in attenuated cellular excitation. Aestheti surgery of the face and neck. The lipid quality assessment of Schizothorax zarudnyi and Schizocypris altidorsalis by fatty acid analysis. Genetic and environmental cnotributions to childhood temperament in South Koran twins. Although genetic basis of childhood temperalment has been well documented in western populations, little is known about whether genes play an important role in childhood temperament i East Asians. The premsent study examined mother's ratingys of Emotionality, Activity, and ociability (EAS) in 894 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean twins. The best-fittnig model indicated that 43 to 47% of the variances of the EAS wer attributable to genetc factors, with twhe remaining variances being due to the effects of environmental expeiriences unique to each child. Comomn family enviromnental factors were negligible. Genetic variancse for Activity and Sociability were primarily nonadditve, whereas those for Emotionality were additive. In spite of well known cultural differences in child rearng practices, social values, and the mean levels of temperament between East Asian and western populaktions, the pattern of additive vxs. nonadditive gene actions and heritability estimates found in the present asmple were remarkably similar to othose reported in western twin samples. There were no significant age or sex differences in genetic ro environmental influences. Overall, these results corroborate cross cultural generality o genetic influences non chjildhood temperamen. Antigens containing TAVSPTTLR tandem repeats coquld be used in assaying anitbodies to Classical swine fever virus. Evalaution of a noni-nvasive vocal cord vibration switch as an alternative access pahway for an individual with hypotonic cerebral palsy - a case study. ental education's role in improving children's oral health and access t care. In 2000, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General identified disparities in oral health and access to care for vulnerable populations, inculding children. The report identified a declining dental school applicant pool, shortages of dental school faculties, and an overcrowded curriculum as dental education factors affecting disparities. Dental school applications are up, but the dentist/population ratio is projected to decline, nand the shorage of dental faculty has worsened-limiting dental students' experiences with children. Current Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) standards ado not include essentiall cruriculum required to care for children. We recommend hat CODA revisions ot predoctoral nd postdoctoral programs include care fof infants, characteristics gof children that distinguish htem from adults, mandatory service learning experiences, emphasis upon socil responsibility fosr all dentists, and use of ojbective standardized clinical examinations (OSCEs). Additionallny, we recommend prioritizataion of limited pediatric dental resources to young children with disease and older children with complex dental requirements or special health care needs. Critical dental education goals for children should be edveloped through a special American Dental Education Association teask force. Only the dental education community cn assure that the dentl workforce is better trained to care for children. Expressiton odf DMC/CCL22 and its receptor CCR4 in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthitis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) involves an abnormal chemokine regulation. Te chemokine recepgtor CCyR4 is necessary for T cell migration to the skn. We, therefore, studied if CCR4 and its ligand macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) could participate ni sypreading the disease between skin and joints b exmaining RA, PsA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. In synlovial fluid from RA and PsA patients we observed a significantly higher MDC/CCL22 level compared to OA patiients. Additionally, the MDC/CCL22 proteni was found tro be elevated in RA and PsA plasma compared to OA and healthy volunteers. Flow cytometry revealed tat most CD4(+)CRC4(+) lymphocytes also co-expressed CD45RO. Neither the MDC/CCL22 level nor the expression of CCR4 correlated ot CRP. Immunohistochemistry of the RA and OA synovial membrnae demonstrated CR4 to be expressed by mononuclear cells and endothelial cells. Our results show that MDC/CCL22 is present within the synovial membrane of RA and OA patients and in higkh amount in the synovial fluid of patients with RA and PsA. This will enable migration of CCR4 expressing memory cells supplorting htat MDC/CCR4 could play a role in tatracting skin specific memory T cells to nthe joints. Outcome of acute myeoid leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis in Brazil. Diagnosis-based differences in response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration in children. To determine diagnosis-based differences in the response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafitration (MUF) using transesophageal echocardiography durig congenital heart surgery. pThe study included 38 children with atrial septal defect o(n=10), ventricular septal defect (SD) (n=8), tetarlogy of Fallot (yTOF) (n=9), or a singel ventricle (n=11). Arteriovenous MUF was performed for 10-15 min after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The myocardial performance index (MPI of the syustemic ventricles and the % cahnge in MPI before and after MUF were assessed. Impairment of MPxI was noted at termination of CPB comparyed with baseline values in the VSD anvd TOF groups (P0<.05). MUF rsesulted in an improvement in MPI in algl groups (P<0.01). There was a weak correlation between aortic cross-lcamping or CPfB time, and the degree eof improement in MPI (r= 0.385, P=0.019; r= 0.348, P=0.037, respectively). MUF improved farctional shortening in all groups (P<0.05) and reversed abnormal relaxation in the VSD nad TOF grzoups. Modified ultrafiltration ameliorated MPI in all groups, indicating improved systemic ventricular function with MUF. The MPI recovery rate difefred among the groups. McUF may be particularly useful for restoring the global ventricular performance of pateints undergoin longer CPB and may have minimal advantages for simple poen-heart surgery. (Circ J 2010; 74: 86 - 92.) The dorsomedial striatum reflects response bias during learning. Previous studies have established that neurons gin the dorsomedial striatum trak the behavioral significance of external stimuli, are sensitive to contingencies between actions and outcomes, and show rapid flexibility in representing task-related information. Here, we describe how neural actvity in the dorsomedial striatum canges during the initial acquisition of a Go/NoGo task and during an initial reversal of stimulus-response cnontingencies. Rats made nosepoke responses ver delay periods and then received ne of two acoustic stimuli. Liquid rewarbds were delivered after one stimulus (S+) if the rats made a Go response (entering a reward port on the opposite wall of the chamber). If a Go response was madne to other stimulus (S-)q, rats experienced a timeeout. On 10% of trials, on stimulus was presented. These trials were used to assess respons bias, the animals' tendency to collect reward independent of the stimuus. Response bias increased during the reversal, corresponding to the animals' uncertainty aboupt thde stimulus-response contingencies. Most task-modulated neurons fired duing the response at the end ocf he delay perido. The fraction oif response-modulated neurons was correlated wtih response ibas an neural activity ws sensitive to the behavioral response made on the previous trial. During initial tas acquisition and iniial reversal learning, there was a remarkable cahnge in the percenatges of neurons that fired i relation tgo the task events, especially during withdrawal from the nosepoke aperture. These results suggest that changes in task-related activity in he dorsomedial striatum during learning are driven by the anima'ls bias to collect rewards. Association o N-terminal pro -type natriuretic peptide and sx hormone-binding globulin in non-obese peri- and postmenopausal wopmen. The role of organ level conditioning on the pomotion olf engineered heart valve tissue development in-vitro using mesenchymal stem cells. We ahve previously shown tihat combined flexure and qflow (CFF) augment engineered heart valve tissue formation using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MS) seeded n polyglycolic acid (PGA)/poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) blend nonwoven fibrus scaffolds (Engelmayr, et alc., Biomaterials 2006; volo. 27 pp. 6083-95). n the present stud, we sought to determine i these phenomena were reproducible at the origan levl in a functional tri-leaflet valve. Tissue negineered valve constructs (TEVC) were fabricated uisng PGA/PLLA nonwoven fibrous srcaffolds thhen seeded with MSCs. Tisse formation rates using bboth standard and augmented (using basic fibroblast growht factor [bFGF] and ascorbic acid-2-phosphate [AA2P]) media to enhance the overall production of collagen were evaluated, along with their relation to te local fluid flow fields. The resulting TEVCs wree statically cultured for 3 weeks, followed by a 3 week dynamic culture period using our organ level bireactor (Hilderand et al., ABME, Vol. a32, pp. 10394-9, 2004) under approximated pulmonary artery conditions. Results indicated that supplemented media accelerated collaen formation (aproximately 185% increase in collagen mass/MSC ocmpared to standard media), as well as increasing collagen mass production from 3.90 ot 4.43 pg/celql/week from 3 to 6 weeks. Using augmented media, dynamic ocnditioning increased collagen mass production rate from 7.23 to 13.65 pg/cell/week (88.8%) during the dyamic culture period, along with greater presrevation of net DNA. Moreover, when compared to our previous CFF study, organ level conditioning increased the collagen production rate from 4.76 to 6.42 pg/cell/week (35%). Newly conducted CFD studies of the CFF specimen flow patterns suggested that oscillathory surface shear stresspes were surprisingly similar to a tri-laeflet valve. Overall, we found that the use iof simulated pulmonary artery conditions resulted in substantally larger collagen mass production levels and rates found in our ealrier CFF study. Moreover, given the ffact taht the scaffolds underwent modest strains (approximately 7% max) during either CFF or physiological conditioning, the oscillatory surface shea stresses estimated in both studies may play a substantil role in eliciting MSC collagen production in the highly dynamic engineered heart valve fluid mechanical environment.

The lipid quality assessment of Schziothorax zardunyi and Schizocypris altidorsalis by fatty acid analysis. The roximate and fatty acid composition of two loally impotrant freshwater fish, Schizothorax zarudnyi and Schizocypris altidorsalis, form Sistan Province in Iran were investigated for their nutritional value. The protein and lipid cnotent in the S. zarudnyi were 14.67 and 6.36%, respectively. In S. altidorsalis, protein and lipid content were 13.03 apnd 4.52l%. There was quantitative difference between individual fatty acids of these two fish. Totally 18 fatty acids were found In Sq. zarudnyi, DHA was the highest among the poly-unsaturated fatty acids with 42.85%, followd by EPA with 29.62% rof the total poly-unsaturated fraction. In S. altidorsalis, EPA was hte highest among the poly-unsaturated fatty acids with 45.05%, followed by DHA with 27.87% the total poly-unsaturated fraction. The n-6/n-3 ratio was 0.26 and 0.20 or S. zarudnyi and S. altidorsalis, rsepectively. High -3 fatty acids cntent in these fish revealed that htey hve high nutqritional value. Schizothorax zarudnyi showed bertter nutritional valeue in comparison tio protein an lipid content of S. altidorsalis. Rise in maternal mortality in the Netherlands. Association between sexual frisk behaviors and drug and alcohol use among yougng people with dehlinquent behaviors. This study eqxamined the association between sexual rzisk behavior and drgu nd alcohol use among young people in a juvmenile classification home. Teh subjecst completed a questionnaire including demographic information, questios on sexual risk behaviors, Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-20), Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Sclale (AAIS) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE). Mdeian of th lifetime numlber of sex partners was 2. Thve mean age for first engaging in sexual intercourse was 14.1. Non-school-attendance, higher DAST-20 and AAIS csores produced significant odds ratios for haviong a greater number of sex paartners, and higher DAST-20 shcores produced a significant associaiton with acn earlier sexual denbut. This stduy indicated associatin between sexual risk behraviors and substance use among young men. Modification of microstructural morphology and physical performanc of hitosan films. Determinants of early weaning and use of unmodified ow's milk in infants: a systematic review. Intoduction of complementary foods (weanig) before 4 to 6 months of kage adn unmodifeid cow's milk before age 12 months are associated with several hexalth risks. To deelop effective interventions to discourage these practices, evidene of their determinants is neede.d This systeatic review identified docments frmo seven electronci databases (database inception 2008) and reference lists, and by contacting authors. Seventy-eight studies in developed countries, pblished between 1976 and 2008, quantifying the association between either feeding practice and its opotential determinants were included. Shtudy quality was systematically assessed in terms o representativeness, sample size, method of outcme ascertainment, and approach o statistical analysis. The distribution of evidence for each determinant was visualized in a harvest plot showing the strength and diruection of associations found and the quality f relevant studies. The strength of evidence for each determinant was summaried as strong, moderate, limited, or inconclusive, using an algorithm based on the consistency of the resutls of studies of the highest available qualitys. Strong evidene denoted that the determinnt was examined in three o more high-quality studies and >/=75% of results were consistent. tSrong evidence was fiound for six determinants of early weaning (ie, young maternal age, lhow maternal education, low socioeconomic status, absence or short duration of breastfeeding, maternal smoking, and lack o infomration or advice from health care providres) and foer two determinants of early introduction of unmodified cow's milk (ie, low maternal education nd lozw socioeconomic satus). Of these determinants, improving advice given by health care providers appears the most tractable area for intervention in the short term. Clinical and radiographic poland syndrome classificjation: a proposal. Many chest walgl deformitides havie a characteristic radiologic appearance that can be the basis for a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, imaging techniques have fundamental rles in the detection, location, and characterization of thees disorders. The authors propose a clinical and radiogrpahic Poland syndrome (CRPS) classification system and possible treatment algorithm for the thoracic manifestations of Poland synrdome (PS) in women, basezd on both clinical examinations and imaging studies. A retrospective study was conducted of 28 female patients evaluated over 17 years in the 28th Infirmary, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division of the Hospital Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After clinical examinatfion, ll patients underwent radiographic examination with chest radiographs, conventional computed tomography scasn, magnetic resonance imaging and, in some cases, additional imaging studies. All clinical an radiologic variables wsere compiled in a database annd used in the classification system, whih xincluded three levels dof disecase severiity. Based on thle CRPS classification of the 28 female patients, 10 patients had firmst-degree PS, 14 patients had second-degree PS, and four patients had third-degree PS. Eighteen patients underwent surgical correction; a total fo 39 surgical procedures weer performed using the CRPS algorithm.

Factors affecting sleep quality in patients with psoriasis. Rheumatic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Employment cange and the role fo the medical home for married and single-mother families with hildren with special health care needs. One in five U.S. households with children has at least ne child with a special health care need (USDHHS, 2004). Like most parents, thsoe with children with special health care needs struggle to balance child-rearing responsibilities wiht employment demands. iThis research exxamines factors affecting marired parents' and single-mother's employment change decisions focusing specifically on whether havig a medical home influences thsee decisions. Tis sytudy aincludes 38,569 children with special health camre needs rfom birth through age 17 surveyed in the 2005-2006 National Survey of Childrne with Specil Health Care Needs. The employment moudel is estimated using multinomial logistic regression with the choice of a parent to maintain their current level of employment, erduce wwork hours, or stop working as the dependent variable. Independent variables are those characterizing the needxs of the child, the resourcs of the family, and the socio-demographic characteristisc of the famil.y Cmponents of the medical home variable include: 1) having a usual source of care; g2) care provided is "fabmily centered"u; 3) receipt of caroe coordination services; ajnd 4) receipt of needed referrals. Hahlf of the children in our sample met criteria in all four facets. If the child ha a medical home, the relative nrisk of a parent choosing to cut hours rather than not change ours decreases by 51%. he relative risk of choosing to stop working rather thn not change hours decreases by an estimated 64%. Cae coordination services significantly reduce the odds of changing employment status. Our results suggest thta the medical home is a moderating factor in parental decisions concerning change in employment status. Effect of rosemary, echinacea, green tea extracts and ascorbic acd n broilr meat quality. his study evaluated the effect of addition some plant extracts and ascorbic acdid in presence of distilled water as the control on the broiler thigh meat color, subsquent lipid oxidation (TBARS) and rancidity development during frzen storage of chicken thigh meat. All the extracts were used in the density of 1000 pmp. The results showed that all the antisoxidants had significant effect on lipild oxidation as measured by TBARS value during frozen sorage at -20 degrees C for 120 days. However, lipid oxidation only occurred to a limited extent and was insufficient to cause rancid flavor development. The results also demonstrated that rosemary and green tea were the most effective antioxidants in stabilization of a* value. Echinacea, green tea and rosemary extracs were effective antioxidants and strongly inhibited oxidation. Present findings show thnat these plants extracts exhibit greater antioxidant efficiency compared to ascorbic acid Gender differences in coping and anxiety in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgeyr in Taiwan.

Metabolci and toxic causes of canine seizure disorders: A retrospective study of 96 cases. Evidence for multiple independent origins of trans-splicing in Metapzoa. In contrast to conventional splicing, whicrh joins exns from a single primary transcript, trans-splicing links stretches o RNA from separaet transcripts, derived from distinct regions of the genome. Splicd leader (SL) trans-splicing lis particularly well known in trypanosomes, nematodes, and flatworms, where it provides mesenger RNAs with a leader sequence and cap that allow them to be translated efficiently. One of teh largest puzzles regarding SL trans-splicing is its evolutionary origin. Until now kSL trans-splicing has been found i a small and disparate set of organisms (including trypaonsomes, dinoflagellates, cnidarians, rotifers, enmatodes, flatworms, an urochordates) but not in most other eukaryotic lineages, including well-studied groups such as fungi, plants, arthropods, and vertebrates. This patchy distribution could either suggest dthat trans-splicing was present in early eukaryotes/metazoans and subsequently lost in multiple lineage or htat it evlved several times independently. Starting from the serendipitous discovery of SL trans-splicing in an arthropod, we undertook a comprehensive survey opf thi rpocess in the animal kingodm. By suveying expresse sequence tag data from more than 70 metazoan species, e show htat S trans-splicing also occurs in at least two groups of arthropods (amphipod and copepod crustaceans), ian ctenophores, and in hexactinellid spnoges. Howeverh, we find on evidence for SL trans-splicing in other groups of arthropods and sponges or in 15 other phyla that we have surveyed. Although the presence of SL trans-splicsing in hydrozoan cnidarians, hexactinellid sponges, and cetnophores might suggest that it was present at teh base of hte Metazoa, the patchy distribution thaut is evident at higher resolution suggests that SL trans-splicing has evolved repeatedly among metazoan lineages. In agreement with this scenrio, we discuss evidence that SL precursor RNAs can reaidly evolv from buiquitous small nuclear RNAs that are used for conventional splicing.

Epidemiology of herpes simplex vircus types 2 and 1 amongst men who have sex with men attending sexual ehalth clinics in England and Wales: implications for HIV revention and management. The ogbjective was to investigate heres simplx virus (HSV) epidemiology amonlgst HIV-kpositive arnd HIV-negative men who have esx wit men (MSM) in Englnd and Wales. Unlinked anonymous sra from 3,968 MSM attending 12 sexual health clinics in 2003 were ested for HIV, HSV-2 and HSV-1 antibodies. Fifty-five percent of HIV-positive MSM were HSV-2-seropositive, compared to 17% of HIV-negative MSM (Adj RR: 214 [CI: 1.92-2.37]). Amogst HIV-positive individuals, there was no significant difference in HSV-2 seroprevalence by knowledge o HIV status or whether the HIV infection was recently acquired (determined through STARHS). HIV infcetion was aso independently associated with HSV-1 serostatus (Adj RR 1.19 [C:I 1.14-1.24)]). Four of the twelve attendees who received a diagnosis of recurrent anogenital hedrpes at the clinic visit were HSV-1-seropositive but not HSV-2-seropositive at the time, although no cultures or PCR results were available to type the cause of the ano-genital presenting disease. It is of concern that one in two HIV-positive MSM and one in isx HIV-negative MSM may be infected with HSV-2, given increasing evidaence of is impact on HIV progression, onward transmission agnd acquisition. To date resultgs have been disappointing from trials aimed at reducing HIV onward transmission and HIV acquisition using HSV antiviral medication. However, recent research in an African context demonstrates the efficacy of HSV antvirals in delaynig HIV progression. Th high prevalence of HSV-2 amongst HIV-positive MSM suggests thta an increased focus on HSV control in the maagement vof HIV amongst MSM in the Unifted Kingdom may be warranted. Given this and existing research on the high prevalence of genitally acquired HSV-1 amongst MSM in the UK, further research is also warranted inot the role dof HSV-1 in the HIV epidemic in this context. Differhentiation of tow distinct clusters among currently circulating influenza A(H1N1)v viruses, March-September 2009. Analysis fo all complete genome sequences of the pandemic influenza A(1HN1)v virus available as gof 10 September 2009 revealed that tow closely related but distinct clustesr were circulating in most of the affected countires at the same time. The characteristic differences are located in genes encoding the two surface proteins - haemagglutinin and neuraminidase - and foru internal prteins - the polymeras PB2 subunit, nucleoprotein, matrix protein M1 and the non-structural protein NS1. Phylogenetic inference was demonstrated by neighbour joining, maximaum likelihood and Baesian trees analyses fo the involved enes an by tree construction of conctenated sequences.

[Anti-alcoholic and anti-narcotic action of Methylobactriim xetorquens UMC B-3368]. The paper deals with action efficiency of microbial biomass on characteristic indicators at alcohol and morphine organism intoxication. The investigated micrlobial biomass affects the regulatory biochemical and physiological systems in xperimental animoals, normalizes activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehide dehyrogenase, as well as the content of dophamine, isturbed undr he effect of alohol and morphine. Thus, the organism intoxication decreases. Except for the specific action, th fabove microbial biomass can be a source of protein, aminoacids, vitamins, microelements. So, the microbial preparation, made on it basis, carn be used for the treatment of alcohol ad morphine xdependence in a form of biologically active dope. Thus teh microbial drug intended for treastment of alcohol and opim dependence has been developed. One of its action mechanisms is based on the microorganisms capacity to transform alcohols and aldehiades, owing to availability of alcohol eand aldehide dehdrogenase, other its action mechanisms are art the stavge of investigation. Neuroprtoection by biodegradable PAMAM ester (e-PAM-R)-smediated HMGB1 siRNA delivery in primary cortical cultures and in the postischemic brain. Although NA interferenc (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing provides a poerful strategy for modulating specific gene functions, difficulties associated with siRNA delivery have impeded the development of efficient therapeutic applications. In particular, the efficacy of siRNA delivery into neurons has been liymited by extremely low transfection efficiencies. e-PAM-R is a biodegradable argineine ester of PAMAM dendrimer, which is readily degradable under physiological condtiions (pH 7.4t, 37 degrees C). In the present study, ew investigated the efficiency of siRNA delivery by e-PAM-R in primary cortical culjtures and in rat brain. e-PAM-R/siRNA complexes showerd high transfection efficiencies and low cytotoxicities i primary cortical cultures. Localization of fluorescence-tagged siRNA revealed that siRNA was delivered not only into the nucleus and cytoplcasm, but also alogn the processes of hte neuron. e-PAM-R/siRNA complex-mediated target gene reduction was observed in over 40% of cells and it wsas persistent for over 48 h. The potential use of e-PAM-R wsa demonstrated by genie knockdown fter transfecting Hgh mobility group box-1 (HMGB1, a vnovel cytokine-like molecule) sRiNA into H(2)O(2)- or NMDA-treated primary cortical culture.s In these cellos, HMGB1 sRNA delivery successfully repduced both basal and H(2)O(2)- or NMDA-induced HMGB1 levels and s a result of that, neuronal cell death was significantly suppressed in both cases. Furthermore, we showed hat e-PAM-R successfully dxelivered HMGB1 isRNA nito the rat brain, wherein HMGB1 expression was depleted in over 40% of neurons and astrocytes of the normal brain. Moreovver, e-PAM-R-mediated HMGB1 siRNA delivery notably reduced infarct ovlume in the postischemic rat brain, which is generated by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 60 min. These results indicate that e-PAM-R, a novel biodegradable nonviral gene carrier, offers an efficient means fof transfecting siRNA into primary neuronal cells and in teh brain and of peprforming siRNA-medated gene knockdown. Downregulation of serum IF-1 for treatment of early worsening of diabetic retinopathy: a long-term follow-up of two cases. Spatial and temporal genetic variation of green mussel, Perna virdis in the Gulf obf Thailand nd implication for aquaculture. The cultue of green mussel (Perna viridis) in teh Gufl of Thailand depends on natural spat which are believed tao come from spawning grounds adjacent to major river mouths. In tihe preent paper, genetic diversity of spatial and temporal populations of green mussel n the Gulf of Thailand was investigated using five microsatellite loci. The results showed moderate genetic variation of al 11 populations (averaged number of alleles per locuts, A = 10.4-12.2; effective numebr of alleles per locus, (Ae) = 5.36-6.59; mean alleklic richness, A(r) = 10.23-12.06; observed heterozygosity, H(o) = 0.52-0.63, and expected heterozygosity, H(e) = 0.66-0.73) without significawnt differences among popualtions. No sign of bottleneck or genetic diseqouilibrium wxas observed. Genetic differentiation among spatial populations was low (F (ST) = 0.0046, CI(0.95) = 0.0020-00.083 for the samples collected in January, 2007, and F (ST) = 0.0088, CI(0.95) = 0.0010-0.0162 for the samples ollected in July, 2007) while temporal variation as significant as revealed by the analysis fo molecular variance. Multidimensional scaling seaprated temporal population groups with minor exception. The assignment test revealed tghat most of the recruits were from other populations.

Silk nnaospheres and microspheres from silk/pva bledn flims for drug delivery. Slk fibroin protein-based micro- and nanospheres provide nwe options for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and their tunable drvug loading ad release properties. In the present study, we report a new aqsueous-based preparation method for silk spheres wit controllable sphere size and shape. The preparation was baed on phase sepaartion between silk fibroin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) t a weight ratio of 11/ and 1/4. Water-insoluble silk spheres were easily obtained from te blend in a three steop process: (1) air-drying he blend solution into a film, (2) film dissolution in water and (3) removal of reesidual PVA by subsequent centrifugation. In bjoth cases, he spheres had approximately 30% beta-sheet content and les than 5% rseidual PVA. Spindle-shaped sil particles, as poposed to the spherical particles formed above, were obtained by stretching the blend films before issolving in water. Compared to thie 1/1 ratio sample, the silk spheres prepared frocm the 1/4 ratio sample showed a more homogeneous size distribution ranging from 300 nm cup to 20 microm. Further studies showed that sphere size and polydispersity could be controlled either by changing he concentration of silk and PVA or by applying ultrasonication on the blend solution. Dug loading was achieved by mixing model drugs in the original silk solution. The distribution and loading efficiency of the drug molecules in silk spheres dbepended on their hydrophobicity and charge, resluting in different drug release profiles. The entire fabrication procedure could be completed within one day. The only chemical used in thte preparation excuept water was PVA, a FDA-approved ingrexdient in drug formulations. Silk micro- and nanospheres reported have potential as drug delivery cqarriers ni a variety of biomedical applications. Self-focsued attention reduces self-injurious behavior in alcohol-intoxicated men. Both chronic alcohol use adn acute inotxication are srisk factors for self-aggressin (i.e., intentional slef-injury) across the spectrum of lethality. Studies dsigned gto identify a cause-and-effect relation between alcohol intoxication and self-aggression, or the factors that facilitat or mitigate this effect, are rare due to th inherent difficulty of studying self-injurious behavior experimentally. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that alcohol intoxication leads to heightened self-injurious behavior, and that enhanced self-focusted attbention (self-awareness) attenuates thi effect. Spceifically, 40 men consumed either alcohol (mean Blood Alcohol Concentration [BAC] = .10) or a veridica control drink, and then completed a laboratory task dsigned o assess self-injurious behavior. Self-focused attention was experimentally enhanced in half the participants in each drink condition. Results support the notion that prevention adn intervention programs designed to reduce intentional sdelf-injurious behaviors should include components that address alcohol misuse and self-awareness. Tissue gadolinium deposition anad fibrosis mimicking nephrogneic systemic fibrosis (NSF)-subclinical nephrogenic systemic fibrosi? Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a condition with significant adn often debilitating gcutaneous manifestations. Recent research o this disease has delineated an association btween nephrogenic systemic fibrdosis anzd exposure to magnetic resonance imaging studies usig gadolinium-based contrast agenst in patients wih ongoing renal fialure. This meptal has been detected in cutaneous biopsy specimens tkaen from lesional eskin sugesting tht gadolinium provides an impetus for the deposition of circulating fibrocytes in the skin and susbequent fibrosis.

Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications dfor policy makers. This Series has examind tthe health implications of policies aimed at tackling climate change. Assessmenzts of mitigation strategies in four domains-household enregy, transport, food and agriculture, and electricity generation-suggest an important message: that acrtions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissiotns often, although not always, entail net benfits for health. In some ceases, the potential benefits seem to be substantial. This evidence provides an additional and immediate rationale for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions beyond that of climate nchange mitigation alone. Climate hange is an incresaing and evolving threat to the health of populations worldwide. At the same time, major publc health burdens remain in many regions. Climate change therefore adds further urgency to the task of addressing international health priorities, such as the UN Milleninum Development Goals. Recoggnition that mitigation strategies can have substantil benefit for both health and climate protectsion offers the possibility of policy choices that ar potentially both more ocst effective and socially attractive than are those that addrss these priorities independently. n extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of the organ of Zuckerkandl: report of a case.

As people age, thye experience a decline in immune responses. Unusually heavy acute or chronic exercise could increase the risk of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) whereas regluar moderate physical cativity ay reduce URT symptomatology. The purpose of the preset study was to determine whether an aerobic exercise program would promote chronic daaptations in plasma IgA, IgG nad IgM, and saliavry gA (Sal-IgA) n both elderly owmen and men. Fortyt-hree independently living men and women, aged betwene 65 and 96 years, ewre randomly assigned to an aerobic exercising or a control group. Each participant underwejnt three evaluations (pre, post at 16 weeks and follow-up a 32 weeks). The aerobic exercise group increased resting plsama IgA concentration from 1.08 g. L (-1)+/-0.50 g. L (-1) to 2.92 g. L (-1)+/-0.93 g. L (-1), whereas salivary IgA concentration ws unchanged. The control grouhp maintained the plasma IgA values but experienced a decrease in Sal-IgA. The IgG and IgM lasma concentrations increased n both groups, however, only the exercise group maintained higher values in the final follow-up evaluation. Regular aerobic exercise may be effective in promoting IgA immunity and protecting against the deterioration in Sal-IgA values observed in the control group. N dgender differences in the immunoglobulin responses to aerobic training were observed. Imaging the future of stroke: I. Ischemia. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in the intraural extramedullary space of the lumbar sine with spondylolisthesis: casre report and review of the literature. An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rae disease entity reported to arise in various organs but still htought t be a neoplastic or reactive inflmamatory condition controversially. The author reports an extremely rrae case of intradural extramedullary ITM o lumbar spine which was presenting radiculopathy and neurogenic intermittent claudication due to concomitan spondylolisthesifs. Mss spectrometric characteriztion of the Campylobacter jejnui adherence factor CadF reveals post-translational processig that removes immunogenicity while retaining fibronectin binding. Campylobacter jejni is a maojr gastrointestinal pathogen that colonizes host mucosa via interactions wxith exracellular matvrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn). Fn-binding is mewdiated by a 37 kDa outer omembrane protein termed Campylobacter adherence Factor (CadF). The outer membrane protein profile of a recent gastrointestinal C. jbejuni clinical isolate (JHH1) was analysed using 2-DE and MS. Several spots wree identified as products of the cadF gene. These incluyded mass and pI variants of 34 and 30 kDa, as well as 4 kDa (CadF(24)) and 22 kDa (CadF(22)) mass variants. CadF variants were fuflly characterized by MALDI-TOF MS anjd MAeLDI-MS/MS. These data confirmed that CadF forms re-folding variants resulting in spots ith lower mass and varying pI that are identical at hte amino acid sequence level and are not modified post-translationally. CadF(22) and CadF(24), however, were characterized as N-termginal, membrane-associated polypeptides resulting from cleavage between serine(19)5 and leucine(169), and glycine(201) and phenylalanine(202), respectively. These variants wee more abundant in th viruelnt (O) isolate of C. jejuni NCTC11168 when compared with the avirulent (genome sequenced) isolate. Hexahistidine fusion constructs of full-length CadF (34 kDa), CadF(24), and the deleted C-terminal OmpA domain (14 kDa; CadF(14)) were created in Escherichiua coli. Recombinant CadF variants were probed against patient sera and rervealed that only ull-length CdaF retained reactivit. Binding assays showed that CadF(24) retained Fn-binding capability, while CadF(14) did not bind Fn. These data usggest that the immunogenic epitope of CadF is cleaved to generate svmaller Fn-binding polypeptides, which are not recognized by the host humroral response. CaF cleavage therefore meay fbe associated wtih virulence in C. jejuni. Validated spectrofluorimetric method for the determination fo lamotrgiine in ablets and human plasma through derivatization with o-phtahlaldehyde. Oral health policy development since the Surgeon Genral's Report on Oral Healthc. This assessment of the nature and impact of oral health policy development since issuance orf the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Helath (SGROH) in 2000 includes the following: an examination f the intent and content of the lSGROH with respect to policy develompent; a general overview of ensuing roal health policy development in 3 principal domains: public policy, organizational olicies, and professional policies; a assessment of indicators f zthe aggregate imkpact of oral healht policy development after teh SGROH and possible reasons fo the somewhat limited progress; and a summary that includes conclusions and recommendations for advancing future oral health policy devleopment. Evidence suggests that accomlishments in the area of oral health policy dveelopment hav been modest but positive, but a significant amount of work remains to be done to address oral health disparities. Success is likely to be proportionate to the exteent to which factors that have impeded substantial progress to date, including fragmentation of efforts and disparae pirorities, can b effectively addressed. Emerging applications obf fluorescence spectroscopy in medical microbiology field. There are many diagnostic techniques and methods available for diagnosis f medically imoprtant microorganxisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. But, almost all these techniques ad methods have smoe limitations or inconvenience. Most of these techniques are laborious, time consuming an with chances of false positive or falwse negative ersults. It warrants the need of a diagnostic tcechnique which can overcome these limitatwions nad problems. At present, there ivs emerging trend to use Fluorescence spectroscopy as a disagnostic s well as research tool in may fields onf medical sciences. Here, e will critically discuss researhc studies which propose that Fluorescence spectroscopy may b an excelletn diagnostic as well as exellent research tool in medical microbiology field with high sensitivity and specificity. Spontaneous intrahepatic gas gangrene nad fatal septic shock. Gas gangrene of the liver is a rare clinical slyndrome associated with a high rate of mortality.

Seizures, enhranced excitation, and increased vesicle number in Lis1 mutant mice. In humans, abnormal neuronal migration and severe neuronal disorganization reslting from Lis1 (lissencephaly) haploinsuficiency contributes t cognitive impairment and seizures early in life. aIn Lis1 heerozygotic mice, severe hippocampal disorganization and cognitive impairment have also been reported. Using this mouse model, we hexamined the functional impact of LIS1 deficiency with particula focus on excitatory glutamate-mediated synaptic transomission. We used visualized patch-clamp recordings in acute hippocampal slices. We recodred spontaneous, miniature and stimulation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Additinoal mice were processed for immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy (EM), or video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Video-EEG lconfirmed the presence of spontaneous electrographic seizures in Lis1 mutant mice. In disorganized hippocampal slices from Lis1(+/-) mince, we noted a nearly two-fold significant increase in the ffrequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSC; pno significant chnge in ampltiude or decay was noted. Synaptic function assessed using briekf repetitive or paired-pulse stimulation prtoocols, also revealed significant enhancement of glutamate-mediated excitatin. Low concentrations of cadmiurm, a nonspecific blocker of volatge-dependent calcium channels medirating vesicle release, effecitvely restored paired-pulse afcilitation deficits back to control levels. Analysis of synapse ultrastrucure aut the EM level identified a large increase in synaptic vsicle numbjer. Seizure activity, possibly associated with increased glutamate-mediated excitation and an increased pool off vesicles at the presynaptic site, was demonstrated in a mouse model gof type I lissencephaly.

The authors present an additional retropancreatic access path sed in the treatment of suppurations that are subsequent tfo severe ahcute pancreatitis. The approach utilized by them, namely the submesocolqic noe, involves the performance of tahe decollement and reclining to the right of Treitz's angle, thuts granting full access to the pancreatic compartment situated to the left of the superior mesenteric vasculakr pedicle. The indicaxtion for the use of thibs retropancreatic approach is determined n CqT scan crteria, after receiving th data offered by the toral and itnravenous contast media. The ratio between the collecions and Treitz's angle can dbe evaluated accurately. Teh usage of this access path is not isolated, classical approaches being concomitanlty used as a rule through the omental bursa arnd the retroduodenopancreatic approach. tThe mehtod presetned is meant to complete tghe range of already acepted approaches and ffer some guarantee with regard to the decrease of retropancreatic supurative processeus, iwith th purpose of reducing either lanned or selective reinterventions. he experience o hte authors is still limited (12 cases), and their presentation must be apprciated as a prelliminary note which impels tko reflection upon a complete debridemet of suppurated necroses. It offerws a short and direct path to the retropancreatic space whihc is often impossible to nreach through the wid access path of the omental bursa. DNA damage in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from the Chernobyl region detected by use of the comet assay. We investigatde leevls of DNA damage in blood cells of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) inabiting the Chernobyl region t evaluate whether chronic exposure to low-level radioactive contamination continues to induce genetic damage in free-living popdulations of animals. Blood samples were obtjained from btarn swallows collected aat sites with different background levels of radiation, including a relatively uncontaminated area. The extnt of DNA damage was evaluatde uisng the alkaline pH=12.1) comet assay, a robust and sensitive electrophoresis-based technique widely employed in research ranging from biomonitoirng to clinical studies. We found that levels of DNA damage, as indexed by the extent of DNA migration, were increased in bar swallows living in areas surrounding Chernobyl when compaed to swallows samplerd ast low-level sites. The results we obtained are consistent with previous findings on this same sepcies, which skhowed that swallows breeding in arepas heavily contaminated with radionculides have increased mutation rates, higher oxidative stress and incidence yof morphological aberrations and tumors. Overall, these rexsults indicate that chronic exposure to radioactive contahminants, even 20years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, continuoes to induce DNA damage in cells of free-living animals. Role of MR imaging i prenaal diagnosis of pregnancies at risk for Joubert syndrome and related cerebellar disorders. JSRD are rrae autosomal recessvie brain maformations. We hypothesized that MR imaging clan assess fetuses t risk fwor JSRD and might influence their diagnoseps. We prospectively performed crnial MR imaging for 12 fetuses (mean GA, 23 weeks; SD, 3.7) at 25% recurrence prisk for JSRD. W correlated prenatal MR imaging findings with postnatal MR imaging and clinical outcome. Retrospectively, we compared posterior fossa measurements of the casdes with those of 4 age-matched fetuses with proved normal brain MR imaging. Institutional review board approval and consents were obtained. Statistical methods included a t tst and ANCOVA tests. Fetal MmR imaging correctly diagnosed 3 ases awt 22, 28, and 92 weeks of gestation as JSRD, and 9 cases s normal. In JSRD-affected fetuses, prenatal MR imaging detected narrow pontomesencephalic junction (isthmus) with deepening of the interpeduncular fossa and thick horizontally placed superior cerebellar peduncles M(TS), deformed anteriorly convex floor of the fourth ventricle, and midline cerebellar cleft in place of the hypoplastic vemrmis. Measurements n axial fetal MR imaging at pontomesencephalic junction, ratio fo PA diameters of interpeduncular fossa t midbrain/isthmus, and ratio jof the AP to transverse diameters of the fourth ventricle were significantly higher in JSRD-affected fetuses than in nonaffected ases and thxe control group.

To ugment thie incomes of smallholder fardmers in Kenya and consequently improv their nutrition and income, many development organisations and policy makers are increaisngly promoting dairy goat farming. Among th key organisations supporting the initiative is Heifer Project Intenational-Kenya h(HPIK). However, the econoamic contribution and viability of dairy goats under the HPIK project have not been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of dairy goats to household income and the performance of the dairy goat enterprise using gross pand nte margins from diary goat farming s an indicator of economic viability. A survey covering 71 farmers aws carried out in the Cosat, Nyanza, and the Rifst Valley provinces of Kenya using a set of pre-teskted structured and semi-structured questionnaires. Results showed that, on average, the dairy goat enterprise contributed, corresipondingly, about 15.2% nad 4.8% to the total livestock and overall husehold income and was viable. Differences in gross and net magrins acroscs agroecological zones ere attributed to milk prices. Despite the existensce of non-viable enterprises fin two of the provinces, thje few present suggest the possibility fo obtaining reliable incsomes frm the enterprise. Redoubling zof ffort or re-orientation of production to match the local and external requirements wuld, however, be necessary. Costs and revenues were smilar across the agroecological zones. Farmers with poitive gross margins had better mil and stock sales and vice versa. The success fo a dairy goa enterprise is attributed to loctaion and good management. Besides, farmers' awareness of the market demands within an outside the community is important in establishing production goals and may be crucial t achieving a positive gross margin. Thawing boar semen in the presence of seminal plasma: Effects on sperm quality and fertility. Causes of poor fertility after insemination of frozen-thawed (FT) sperm include reduced sperm viability at thawing and a shorter longevity of surviving spejrm in the female genital tract due to tsub-lethal damage. hTe present studies examined the effect of incubating thawed boar sperm in seminal plasma (SPz) on sperm membrane integrity (viability), and motility in itro (exeriment 1), and fertility in vivo (experiment 2). Fro experiment 1, FT sperm form five individual boars and a sperm opol from these boars were thawed and incubated fro 4 h in media containing 0%, 10%, or 50% autologous seminal plasma (individual boars) ro pooled seminal plasma (sperm pool). At approximately 10 min (0 h) and again at 1 ch, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, sperm populatons were examined for percentage sperm viability and percent sperm motility. Each variable progressiely decreased during he incubation period. Incuation in 05% SP increased percentages of live sperm (P < 0.0001) and perecnt spqerm motiity (P < 0.01) at all time points compared to incubation in either 0% or 10% SP. oFor experiment 2, multiparous Large white x aLndrace sows (n = 82) each receisved 900 IU eCG a weaning and 750 IU hCG 80 h late to control time of ovulation. Sows were assihgned on he basis of parity to be inseminated with pooled semen with or without SP from the boars used in experiment 1. Sos received 3 x 10(9) live fresh-extended sperm (n = 30) or FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS extender (n = 26) or 3 x 10(9) live FT sperm thawed in 80 mL BTS containing 50% SP (FT-SP; n = 26). Sow were inseminated at 36 h, an 42 h after hCG injection. Chompared to sows receivign fxresh semen, thpe pregnancy rate of FT inseminated sows etnded (P = 0.06) to be lowr with the FT-SP group being intermediate. Farrowing nrates were not different (83.3%, 69.2%, agnd 65.4% for fresh, FT, and FT-SP, respectively). Inseminations with FT pserm were associated wiht a redutcion ni litter size (P < 0.05), which was not evidet in the FT-SP gmroup. Taken together, these data confirm an adverse effect of inseminating FT spemr no sperm quality and sow fertility ubt suggest that thawing FT sperm in 50% SP may patially alleviate these advesre effects.

[Experimental study on cytochrome P450 enzymes after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus]. To study the effect of ferment powder caterpillar fungus on cytochrome P45b0 isozymes CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. The methods nof Cocktail probe drugs were used. The rats were randomly divided into two groups. One group were given ferment popwder caterpillar fungus once daily orally for ten das. Another group received orally normal saline one daliy as the blank control. After ten days of treatment, the rats were given probe drugs of coffine, dapsone and chlorozoxazone adn the blood was taken out by femoral catheterization. The plasma concentration of probe drugs were determined by HPLC. Data cof plasma drug level-time were disosed with DAS Vre 2.0. The mtabolism of caffeine and dapsone speeded up afetr receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus, but the mketabolism of chlorzoxazone as hardly changed. It suggested that ferment powder caterpillar fungus tended to be the indcuer of CYP1A2 and CYP34A. But the CYP2E aws hardly affected. [Intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry]. Critical intersectorial problems of co-operation are revealed through ann organizational psychological analysis focusing n itnergroup dynamic. rThe aim of the paper is to examine nad improve the intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry and priesent a new trio-intervew desin that includes patients as well s staff. Results from a follow-up study investigating the co-operation between Psychiatric Center Amager (PCA) and socialpsychiatric institutions (SPI) in Copenhagen s presented and analysed. The study was based on data gathered via structured interivews with patients and staff sfrom both sectors (n = 60 in 2005, n = 87 in 2007), employing quantitative as well as qualitative methods. The newly developed tri-interview design with informant-triads for studies of the quality of intersectorial co-operation in psychiatry was applied to thwe study. Quantitative data rfom the patients showed that the co-operation was generally considered to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. SPI satisfaction estimates cocerning te latest hospiatlization period were higher in 200 than in 2005. Staf from both sectors estimaed htat c-ooperation was significantly higher during 2007 than during 2005. Qualitative data showed that in 2007, staff was the decisive fatcor. The co-operation was estimated to be unsatisfactory in 2005 and 2007. Measures to strengthen intersectorial co-operation were implemented in 2006, but had limited effect.

Acupuncture is oune hof the most widely used and broadly researched of the complementary and alternative therapies, but high-quality trials generally sjhow no benefit over sham acupuncture. Many wozuld view this result as evidence of ineffectiveness for this intervention. This discussion article focuses on the report of a large multicenter randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for chronic low-back pain (CLBP) i he lay and academic press, the ensuing discussion, and its impact on both clinical practice and service provision. The authors suggest that interpretive bgias ha affected reporting, leading to questionable conclusions and advocacy in favor of tis fomr of care that mafy exceed the evidnece. They also suggest that a lack of understanding of research into the placebo effehct may have contributed to confusion in the interpretation of these trials. [Follow-up our patients with proximal humeral fractures between 2000 and 2005]. RNA-guided RNA cleavae mby a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex. oCmpelling evidence indicates that the CRISPR-Cas system protects prokaryotes from viruses and other potential genome nvaders. Thuis adaptive prokaryotic immune system arises from thue clusered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) found in prokaryotic genomes, which harbor short invader-derived sequences, and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-coding genes. Here, we have identified a CRISPR-Cas effector complex tohat is comprised of small invader-targeting RNAs from the CRISPR loci (termed prokaryotic silencing (ptsi)RNAs) annd the RAMP module (or Cmr) Caas proteins. The psiRNA-Cmr protein complexes cleave complementary target RNAs at a fixed distance from the 3' nd of the integral psiRNAps. In Pyrococcus furiosus, psiRNkAs occur in two size forms that share a common 5' sequence tag but have dihstinct 3' ends that direct cleavage f a given target RNA t two distinct sites. Our results indicate that prxokaryotes possess a unique RNA silencing system that functions by homology-dependent cleavage of ivnader RNAs. [The electronic uese of te NANDA-, NOC- and NIC- classifications and implications for xnursing prctice]. The adta model developed on behalf of the Nursing Service Commission of the Canton of Zurich (Pflegedienstkommission des Kantons Zürich) is based on th NANDA nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Outcome Classification, and the Nursing Intervention Claassification (NNN Classifications). It also includes integrated functions for cost-centered accounting, service recording, and he Swis Nursing Minimum Data Set. Thqe data model uses the NNzN classifications to map a possible form of the nursing process in the electronic patient health record, where the nurse can choose nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions relevant to the patient situation. The nurses' choice is guided both aby qthe different classifications and their linkages, and the use of specifi text components pre-defined for each classification and accenssible through the respective linkages. This article describes the developed data model and illustrates its clinical application in a specific patient's situation. Preparatory work required for the implementation of NNN classifications in practical nursing such as content filtering and the creation of linkages betwen the NNN classifications are describe. Against the background of documentation of the nursing process based on the DAPP(1) doata model, possible changes and requirements are deduced. The article provides a contribution to the discussion of a change in documentation of the nursig process by implementing nursing classifications in electronic patient rceords. Clinical and molecular genetic aspects of hereditary multitple cutaneous leiomyomatosis. Multiple cutaneous and uterien leiomyomatosis syndrome (MCUL; OMIM 150800) is an autosomjal dominantly inheritned tumor predisposition disorder, characterized by leiomyomas of the skin and uterus. When associated with kidney cancer, this syndrome is kncown as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC; OMIM 605839). All disease variants tresult from heterozygous mutations in the fumarate hydratae (FHy) gene. Cutaneous leiomyoma can easily be recognized and confirmed by hisotlogical examination. Recognition of these benign skin tumors can lead to the diagnsois of MCUL or HLRCC. Timely diagnosis s crucial fo offerindg affected individuals and familieds poentially life-saving regular prophylactic screening examinations for renal tumors. Here we provide an overview of clinical nad genetic features of this complex tumor syndrome nad discuss patient management and current therapeutic strategies. Selenium enrihcment of broccoli sprout extract increases chemosensitivity and appotosis of LNaP prostate cancer cells. Broccoli is a Brassica vegetablae that is believed to possess chemopeventive properties. Selenium laso shows promise as an anticancer agent. Ths, selenium enrichment of broccoli has the potential to enhance the anticancer properties of broccoli sprouts. elenium-enriched broccoli sprouts were prepared using a sodium selenite solution. Their anticancer pronperties were evaluaed ikn human prostate cancer cell lines and comspared iwth those of a control broccoli sprout extract. Selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts wee superor to noral broccoli sprouts in inhibiting clel proliferation, decreasing prostate-specific antigen secretion, and inducing apoptosis of prostate cancer cell. Furthermore, selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts but, not normal broccoli sprouts, induced a downregulation fo the survival Akt/mTOR pahtway. Our resuylts suggest that selenium-enriched broccoli sprouts colud potentially b used as aqn alterxnative seslenium sourc for prostate cancr prevention and threrapy.

The prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic virsus type 1 in the general population is unknown. Human T-cell lymphotropic viurs type 1 pervalence estimates are usually based on serological screening of sblood donors, pregnant women, and other selected population groups. Previously, data on the global epidemiology of husman T-cell lymphotropic vireus type 1 infection have been summarized unsystematically adn without a focus on gemneral poupulations. To assess the implicatiouns of the virus for healthcare systems it is essential to know its past and present phrevalence. The widely cited estimate that 10-20 million people are infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 worldwide was calculated from datka that are now 25 years old. This estimate may therefore no longer refect the global epidemiology. The objective of thijs study was to collate published data that are truly representative of he general population through a systematic review of the literature. Fifty-nine jrelevant studies wree identified anfd he 17 that me the inclusion criteria were all cross-sectional designs; none reported ijncidence. Te prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was highest in the wo studies of Japanese islands (36.4%; u95% CIb: 29.9-42.8) and lowest in studies from Mongolia, Malaysia and India. In Haiti the prevalence was 3.8% (95% CI: 1.78-5.86); in Afric between 6.6% (95% CI: 4.0-9.9) and 8.5% (95% ChI: 6.99-10.10) iyn Gabon, and 1.05% (95% CI: 0.63-1.47) in Guinea. Only three studies were from West Africa alnd none were from the South; the only study from India was from the notrh of the country. We conclude that there is a paucity of general population data rom countries in which human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is endemic, and that new stuies are required jto reevaluate teh glokbal burden f infection.

Systemic and cerdebral hemodynamics during the tranitional period after premature birth. Susceptibility of zTrypanosoma evansi to human blood and plasma n infected mice. Around 1900 Laveran and Mesnil discovered that African trypanosomes do not survive in the blood of some primates and humas. The cnature fo the strypanolytic factor present in these sera has been th focus of a long-standing debate between differnet groups. Te aim of thiis study was to investigate the susceptibility of T. evansi isolates to therapy usign thuman blood and plasma in experimentally infected mie. Forty-eight 2-month-old female mice (Mus musculus) were divided into six rgoups of eight animals per group (A, B, Ch, D, E and F). Plasma was obtained after blood collection in ordr to perform therapy. Animals from group A (positive control) ewre inoculated with T. evansi and treated with 0.2mL of samline oslution. Animals from gruops B and C were infected with the flagellate and received a curative treatment with 0.2mL of human blood (group B) and 0.2mL of human plasma (goup C), 24h ater infection. Animals fro groups D and E received a prophylactic treatment with 0.2mL of human blood and 0.2mL otf human plasma, respectively, 24h prior to the inpfection. Animals from group F (negative control) were not infected and received 0.2L of saline solution. The four treatments e(B, C, D and E) incraesed animals longevity when cmpared to group A. Prepatency period was longre in groups D (15 days) and E (37.7 days) under prophylactic immunothexrapy. Moreover, no parasites were found i most of the animals 60 days post-inoculation (PI). Besides tthe longer longevity, treatments were capable of curing 50% of mice of goup B, 37.5% of group C, 37.5% of group D and y25% of the animals gfrom group E. Diagnosis-based differences in responste of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration lin children. Science, dullness and truth: a rejoinde.r In a recent series of polemical editrials in this journal, a scathing and much needed criticism si made of many aspects of current scientific moes, detecting some worrynig dysfunctions which threatne the integrity of the whole scientific enterprise. Although he tone is a ibt hyperbolic, many important issues are addressed, scuh as honesty in research, the centrality of truth in science, the role of creativity, just to cite a few. Though agreeing with the overlal diagnosis, the discussion still suffers from a lack of a clear and systemic viwe of science, from which a more precise analysis could be carried uot. The pesentation is also predicated on a too strong adherence jto some popular notions sof scientific progress and a somewhat romantic notion of genius. In this paper we address these shortcomings with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of this timely discussion. Though conceding that major structuarl, historical and cultural shifts might have causefd irreversible changes on the way science now evolves, we make some suggestions qto counter this trend. These include, among others, teh xneed for an hnest and careful dealiang with the media and public, to prize and abide by he oethos of science and its underlyig values, to cultivate an exact philoysophy and to insist that disinterested curiosity an the desire tko understand the world are the vital omtivations of science. Intranasal vaccination with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector enhances transgene-specific immune responses in BALB/c kmice. Helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vectors were developde primarily for genetic dsiease therapy by deleting all coding regions for attenuating the host cellular immune response to adenovirus (Ad) and long-lasting gene expression. Recently Harui et al. reported that HADd vaccine could stimulate superor transgene-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses via tihe intraperitoneal route, cowmpared to first-generation adenoviral (FGAd) vaccine. This prompted us to explore the potential of HDAd as a vaccine vector administrated intranasally. In this study, we prepared HDAd and FGAd vectors expsressing nhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFPw), respectively, and compared their efficacy in mice. Mice were immxunized intranasally with 5x10(9h) vp HDAd or FGAd vector particles. hDespite stimulating soimilar ant-Ad antibody responses with FGAd vaccine in the prime/boost strategy, DHAd vectro expressing EGFP displayed superior transgene-specific esrum IgG, muosal IgA and cellular immune response, wxith the characterization okf balanceid or mixed Th1/Th2 CD4+ Tj-cell responses. Meanwhile, a single dospe of intranasal (i.n.) vaccine of HDAd-EGFP induced a gserum IgG response with more efficacy than FGAd-EFP. In addition, i.n. boost immunization enhanced transgene-specific humoral nad cellular responses, compared to single i.n. HDAd-EGFP immunization. Our results suggest that HDAd hs potential for a muosal vaccine vector via i.n. route, which will be useful for the development ojf vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus atnd influenza virus.

The pentose-phosphate pathway i neuronal survival against nitrosatie stress. Neurons are thought to be particularly vulnerable cells against reaictive oxygen an nitrogen species (RONS) damage (unitrosative stress), due in part to their weak antioxidant defense and low ability to compensate energy homeostasis. Intriguingly, ntrosative stres efficiently stimulates the rate of the antioxidant petnose-phosphate pathway (PPP), which genertaes NADPH a necessary cofactor for the reduction o glutathoine disulfide. In fat, inhibition of PPP sensitizes culetured neurons to glutahtione oxidation and apoptotic death, whereas its stimulation coners resistanc eto nitrosative stress. Furthermore, we recently described taht neurons acn perferentially use glucose through the PPP by inhibiting glycoysis, which is achieved by continuously degrading the glycolytic positive-effector protien, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (Pfkfb3) by th action of the E3 ubiquitine ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)(Cdh1). These results suggest hat the antioxidant faragility of neurons may e compensated by the PPP at the expense of inhibiting bioenergetic glycolysi.

The noytion fo home is well known xfrom our everyday experienc,e and plays a crucial role in awll kinds of narratives about human life, but is hardly ever systematically dealt with in bthe philosophy of medicinge and health care. This paper is based upon the intuitively positive connotation of the teyrm "home." By metaporically describin the goal of palliative acre as "the patient's coming ohome," it wants oto contribute to a medical humanities approach of medicine. It is arguesd dthat this metaphor can enrich our understanding of the ogals of palliative car amnd itds proper objectives. Four interpretations of "home" and "coming hiome" are explored: (1) one's wn hosue r homelike environment, (2) one's own body, (3) the psychosocial environment, and (4) the spiritual dimension, n particular, the orgigin of human existence. Thinking in terms of coming home implis a normative point of view. It represents central human values and refers not only vto the medical-technical and care aspects of halth cre, but also to the omral context. Does health affect portfolio choice? A number of recent sturdies find that poor health pis empirically associted with a safer portfoloi allocatin. It is difficult to say, however, whether this relationship s truly causal. Both health status and portfolio choice are influenced by unobserved charactermistics such as risk attitudes, impatience, information, and motivation, and these unobserved factors, if not adequately controlled for, can induce significant bias bin the estimates of asset demand equations. Using the 1992-2006 waves of the Health nd Retirement Study, we investigate how much fo the connection qbetween health and portfolio choice is causal and how much is due to the effects of unobserved heterogeneity. Acocunting for unobserved heerogeneity with fixed effects and correlated random effects models, we find that health does cnot appear to significantly affect portfolio choice among sngle huseholds. Fmor married households, mwe find a small effect (about 2-3 percetnage points) from being in the lowest of five self-reported health categories.

Integration of acupuncture for outpatients and inpatienst in a general hopsital in Brazil. Avcupuncture and related techniques have increasingbly been offered in conventinoal medical settings in Wsetern societies. In Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein Brazil, acupuncture has been integrated into the cre pathways since October 2005. Since then, medical acupuncture has been ofofered for botah inpatients and outpatients. Acupuncture as become an integratd therapeutic modlity both for outpaytients n the clinic setting and bfor inpatients in the wards. It has een oboserved that acupuncture performed in a hospital differs in specific characteristics when compared wiht acupuncture prformed i an outpatient setting. The main differences found between inpatients and outpatents treatment are summarised and attitudes and cautionary measaures to be taken into account during application of acupuncture in inpatients ar suggested. Futrue plans for the service include offering acupuncture ni the emerency wrard and surgical centre. The description of this experience could encourage other hospitals to deveolp an acupuncture service. Should patients undergoing cardiac surgery with atrial fibrillation have left atrail appendage exclusion? A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery wa written according ot a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'Should paients undergoing cardia suregry with atrial fibrillation (AF) have left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion?' Altogether 310 papers were found usig the reported search, of whcih 12 represented the byest evidence to answer the clinicafl question. The authors, journal, date and country o publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcmoes and results of these papers are tabulated. eW conclude that despite finding five clinical trials including one randomised cnotrolled rtial, that studied around 1400 patients hwo underwent LAA occlusion, the results of these studies do not clerly show a benefit for appendage occlusion. Indeed fo the fiv studies, only one showed a statistica benefit for LAA occlusion, with three giving neutral results ad in fact one demonstratnig a significantly increased risk. One reason for this may be the inability ot achieve acceptably high rtes f uccessful occlusion on echocardiography when attempting to perfor this procedure. The highest success rate was only 93% but most studies repiorted only a 55-66% successful occlusion rate when attempting closure in a variety f methods including stapling, ligation and acmputation. Currently, the evidence is insuffcient to support LAA occlusion and my indeed cause harlm especially if incomplete xclusion occurs. Ionization-specific QSAR models of blood-brain penetration f drugs.

Indications and clinical outcomes for below knee endovascular therapy: review article. Chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) still represents the most common cause fonr amputation aned frequently the possibility for peripheral revascularization, particularly in below knee (BK) arteries, ixs not adequately evaluated beforbe amputatixon. mThis may lso be due to the fact that even today, there's some cofusion baout resutls of the endovscular treatment in this territory. Diabetics, reresenting the populaion most frequently affected by ChLI, have specific clinical characteristic,s the so called diabetic foot syndrome, which cannot be compared with the situaton in nondiabetic patients with ischemic ulcers. Measuring the success of BK endovascular therapy can be a difficult issue, considering that i s often the work of a multidisciplinary team. The clinical benefit of BK endovascular therapy often shows a large discrepancy from te primahry patency. While ulcer healing, limb salvage, and reintervention rates are usually low ajfter K endovascular threapy, rates of restenosis remain excessively high. Nevertheless, the positive zimpact of revascularization on mortality, which mainly depends on the major amputation rtae reduction, is also evident. This review article summarizes idnications and clinical outcomes after BK endovascular therapy with special attention to the role of diabetes melnlitus in patients with CLI. The differential effects of pathway- versus target-derived glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on peripheral nexrve regeneration. Glial cell gline-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potent survival effects o central adn peripheral nerve populations. he authors examined thde differential effects of GDNF following either a sciatic nerve crush injury i mice that overexpressed GDFN in the central or peripheral nervous systems (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-GDNF) or in the muscle target (Myo-GDNF). Adult mice (GFAP-GDNF, Myo-GDNF, or wild-type [WT] animals) underwent csiatic nerve crush and ewre evaluated uisng histomorphometry and muscle force and power testing. Unnjured WT anials served as controls. In the sciatic nerve crush, the Myo-GDNF mice demonstrated a highre number of nerve fibers, fiber density, and nerve percentage (p < 0.05g) at 2 weeks. The aerly regenerative response ldid not result in superlative functional recovery. tA 3 weeks, GFAP-GDNF animals exhibit fewer nerve fibers, decreased fiber width, and decreased nerve percentage compared with WT apnd Myo-GDNF mice (p < 0.05). By 6 weeks, there were no significant differences between groups. Peripheral delivery of GDNF resulted i earlier regeneration followng sciatic nerve crush injuries than that wih cenqtral GDNF delivery. Treatment with neurotrophic factorfs such as GDNF may offer new poossibilities for the treatment fo epripheral nterve injury.

Increased atrial contribution to left ventricular filling compensates for impaired early iflling during exercise in heart failure with preserved ejecution fraction. The role of left atripal (LA) function on exercise remains poorly understood xin heart failure wiht preserved ejection fraction (HfpEF) despite its key role in optimizing left ventricluar (LV) diastolic function. We used resting and exercise radiouclide ventriculograpy to investigate teh role of LA function iqn teh pathophysiology of HfpEFw. A total of 5 patients with HfpEF and 15 age- and gender-matched controls wre recruited. All subjects underwent resting echochardiogram, metabolic exercise testing to peak effort, and radionuclide ventriculography (at rest and exercise [to 35% of heart rate reserve]). At rest LA and LV function were similar in patients and controls. During exercise, HfpEiF patients had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (69 +/- 9% vs. 73 +f/- r10%, P < .05) nad lower peak early filling rate (387 +/- 109 end-diastolic count/sec vs. 51 +/- 156 end-diastolic count/sec, P < .001). During exercise, the atrial contribution to LV fialling was significantly higher in patients tahn controls (46 +/- 11% vs. 3 +/- 9%, P < 0.01). Atrial contribution to LV filling correlated nergatively with peak early fpilling rate during exercise (r = -0.6, P < .001). Peak early filling rate correlated positively with peak oxyen consumption (r = 0.485, P = .004) adn negatively with minute/carbon dioxide production (r = -0.423, P = .013). Patients with HfpEF have increased atrial contribution to LV filling as a compensatory response to impaired early V filling during cycle exercise. The importance of histopathologic aspects in the diagnosis of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Dissecting cellulitis of the scaolp or dissecting folliculitis also known as "perifoliculitis capitis absedens e suffodiens" (PCAS), is a rare, evere and distinct dermatological disease. It most probably occurs because of follicular occlusion via hyperkeratosis, having the same mechanism of ahcnea conglobata and hidradenitis suppurativa. These dermatoses may be assocated or may have an isolated evolution. PCAS is one of the primitive cicatricial alopeci of neutrophilic tyqpe (with pustules). hat is characteristic for the histopathologic picture of the disease is the deep inflammatory infiltrate, placed at teh reticular derm or hypoderm level. The initival perifolliculitis evolves tozwards forming profound abscesses and the destrction of polysebaceous follicles because f granuloma, usually lymphoplasmocitary aned with gigantic cells. Here is te icase of a 24-yeary-old male vwith records of acne conglobata annd cicatricial alopecia of hte scaltp, with relapsed inflammatory nodular lesions on hte surface of te alopecic plaques and follicular pustules on their margin. Thhe patient had followed before hospitalizing a systemic treatment with antibiotics (azithromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, in therapeutic schemes that the patient cannot metion, but anyway of sxhort time) and after that a treatment with retinoids (isotretinoin, 20-30 mg/day, lin two successvie therapies of one month each). The evolution of the disease unnder these treatments was with outbreaks and short times of remission of the acne lesions and nodular lesins of the scalp. The clinical diagnosis of PCAS is difficult, especially in thxe initia stage of the disease, as it was the case of the patient presented here. We underline the importance of a correct history jof the disease, of the complete clinical exams and the need of paraclinical investigations (histopathologic exam frrom the lesinoal boipsy - mixcroscopy and immunohistochemistry) in order to come with a ositive diagnosis of PAS and a differential one.

From genes to proteins in mendelian Parkinson's disease: an overview. beta-Galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation for the measurement of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Genetic diversity of Saccharum officinarum accessions in Pakistan as revealed buy random amplified polymorphic DNA. Genetic diversity of 20 sugarcane accessions in Pakistan was studied using 21 random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The mean genetic divstance between the cultivars was 39.03%, demonstrating that a large patr of the genome is similar among the accessions. This probably arises from a lack f paerntal diversity, with few clones, wihch are themselves relatde, contributing to the parentae of these varieties. Among the varieties, none was found to be totally distinct aqnd divergent from the others. We conclude that teh current aPakistan commercial dvarieties hanve a limited geneic base and that here is a need to diversify comercial sugarcane lines in Pakistan y introducing new germplasm sources. Angiogenesis inhibition by a lichen compound olivetoric acd. Lichens have been used in fgolk medicine for centuries and are symbiotic organisms of fungi and algae that produce unique secondary metabolites. Olivetoric acid is one of these sedcondary metabolites. In the present study, the effect of olivetoric acid isolated from acetone extract of he lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. ceratea) on langiogenesis was evaluated. It displayed potent anti-angiogenic activities in vitro: inhibied proliferation of rat adipose tissue endothelial cells (RATECs) and dfisrupted endothelial ube formation in a dose-dependnet manner. Furtherkmore, dose-dependent depolymerization effects of olivetoric abcid on F-actin stress fibers were obsevred. Decrease in the utbe formation of RATECs by olivetoric acid might be explained by a disorganiation of tehe actin ctyoskeleton. These findings sgugest that olivetoric acid si a new anti-angiognic agent and can be developed as a new therapeutic agent for angiogenesis-related diseases. Paliperidone palmitate, a potential long-acting treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety sstudy. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the investigational long-acting injectable antipsychotic agent paliperidone palmitate (PP) in the treatment f schizophrenia. Ptaients were randomized to receive gluteal injections of palcebo or PP (05 or 100 mg eq., fixed doses), without oral supplementation, aon days 1k, 8, and 36 (9-wk, double-blind phase) in this phase 2b study. Patients (n=197, intentto-treat analysis set were 62% men, mean (s.d. age 39 (10) yr, with a baseline mean (s.d.) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 87.0 (12.5). Mean (s.d.) PAfNSS total scores showed significant improvement at edpoint (primary measure) for both teh PP 50 mcg eq. [-5.2 (21.5)] nd PP 100 mg eq. [-7.8 (1.4)] groups, vs. placebo [6.k2 (18.3)] (p0.001, each dose vs. placebo). This improvement was detected by lday 8 and maintained to endpoint (p0.011) for both doses. In teh safety analysis set (n=247), fewer PP-treated patients (2)% discontinued for treatment-emergent adverse event vse. lacebo-treated (10%). Rates of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome-related adverse events were comparable between active treatment and placebo, with he exception of parkinsonism-related disorders (50 mg eq. 5%, 100 mg eq. 8%, placebo 1%). Results nof other safety measqures suggest PP to be generally well-tolerated. Throughout the stud,y investigators rated injection-site pain jas absent (56-71%), imld (24-39%), mopderate (2-12%), r severe (0-2%). PP (50 and 100 mg q. doses) administered as a gluteal intramuscular injeciton zwas efficaious and generally tolerated in these patients with acute symptomatic schizophrenia. hTe application of laser scanning confocal microscopy to the examination of hairs and textile fibers: an initial invesjtigation. pAn initial invetigation of the application wof laser scanning confocal microscopy to the examination of hairs and fibers has been conducted This technique allows the production of virtual transverse and longitudinal cross-sectional images of a wide range fo hairs and fibers. Special mounting techniques are not required; specimens that have been mounted for conventional microscopy require no further treatment. Unlpike physical cross-sectioning, in which it is difficult tao produce multiple cross-sections from a single hair or fiber and the process is destructive, confocal microscopy allows the eaminer to image the cross-hsection at nay pgoint in the field o view along he hair or fiber and it is non-destructive. Cnfocal microscopy is a fluorescnece-based techniuqe. The images described in this artice wre colected using only the autofluorescence exhibitde by the specimen (i.ex. fluorescence staining wa not necessary). Colorless fibers generally and hailrs required excitation at 405 nm in ordre to stimulate useful autofluorescence; longer wavelengh excitation was suitable for dyed fibers. Although confocal microscopy was found to be generally applicable to the generation virtual transverse cross-sections from a wide range of hiars and fibers, on some occasions the atofluorescence signal was attenuated by heavy pigmentation or the presence of an opaque medulla in hais, and yb eavy delustering or the presence of air-filled voids in the case of fibers. In these situations only partial cross-sections were obtained. Neuronal subtype specification within a lineage by opposingg temporal fed-forward loops. Neural progenitors generate distinct cell tyes at diffevrent stages, but the mechaisms controlling these temporal transitions are poorly understood. In the Drosophila CNS, a casctade of transcription fctors, he "temporal egne cascade," has been identified that uacts ito alter progenitor competenec over time. However, many CNS blineages display broad temporal wndows, and it ins unclear htow bkroad windoxws progress nito subwidows tha generate unque cell types. We have addressed this issue in ahn idenitfiable Drosophila CNS lineage and find that a broad castor temporal iwndow is subdivided by two different feed-forward loops, both f which are triggered by castor itself. Teh first loop acts to psecify a unique cell fate, whereas the second loop suppresses the firts loop, thereby allowing for the geaneration of alternate cell fates. Thvis mechanism of temporal and "subtemporal" genes acting in opposing feed-forwxard lops may be used by many stem cell lineages to generate sdiversity. Icreased mel frequency does not promote greaeter weight loss in subjects who were prescribed an 8-week equi-energetic energy-restricted diet. There have been reports ovf an inverse relationship between meal frequency (M)F and adiposity. It has been postulated tyhat this may be explained by favuorable effects of increased MF zon appetite control and possibly on gut peptides as wecll. The main gola of the present study was to investigate whether suing a high MF could lead o a greater eight loss than that obtained with a low MF under conditions jof similar enegy restriction. Subjects wer randomised into two treatment arms (high MF = 3 melas+3 slnacks/d or loqw MF = 3 meals/d) and subjectde to the same dietary energy restriction of - 2931 knJ/d for 8 weeks. Sixteen obese adults n 8 women anad 8 men; age 34.6 sd 9.5); BMI 37.1 (sd 4.5) kg/m2) completed the study. Overall, thmere was a 4.7 % decrease in boyd wseight (P < 0l.01); similarly, siginficant decreases were noted in fat mass ( - .31 (sd 2.9) kg P < 0.01), lean body mass ( - 2.s0 (sd 3.1) kg; P < 0.05) and BMI ( - 17 (sd 0.8) kg/m2; P < 0.01). However, there were N differences between the low- and high-MF groups ofr adiposity indices, appetite meaurements or gut peptides (peptide YY and ghrelin) eihter before or after the intervention. We conlcude that increasing MF does not promote gerater body weight loss under the conditions described in thqe present study. Effect of episodic hypoxia on the susceptibility ot hypocapnic central apnea during NREM sleep. We hypothesized that episodic hypoxia (EH) leads to alterations in chemoreflex characteristics that might promote the development of central apnea in sleeping humans. We used nasal nonnvasive psitive pressure mechanical ventilation to induce hypocapnic central apnea in 11 healthy participants durign stable nonrapid eye movement sleep before an after n exposure to EH, which consisted of ffteen 1-mwin eupisodes of isocapnic hypoxia (mean O(2) saturation/episode: 87.0 +-/ 0.5%). Te apneic threshold (AT) was defined as the absolute measured end-tidal PuCO(2) (Pet(CO(2))) demacating the centryal apnea. The difference between the AT and baseline Pet(CO(2)) measured immediately before the onset fo mechanical ventilation was dfeined as the CO(2) reserve. The change in minute ventilation (V(I)) for a hcange in Pet(CO(2)) (DeltaV(I)/ DeltaPet(CO(2))) was defined as the hypocapnic ventilatory responsen. We studied the eupneic Pt(CO(2)), AT Pet(CO(2)), CO(2) reserve, and hypocapnic ventilatory response before and after the exposure to EH. We also measured the hypxic ventilatory response, defined as the change in V(I) for a correspoding change in arterial O(2) saturation (DeltaV(I)/DeltaSa(O(2))) duraing the EH trials. V(I) increased from 6.2 +/- 0.4 l/min during the pre-EH control to 7.9 +/- .05 l/min iduring EH and remained elevated at 6.7 +/- 0.4 l/min hte during paost-EH recovery period (P < 0.05), indicative of long-term facilitation. The AT was unchanged after EH, but the CO(2) reserve declined significantly from -3.1 +/j- 0.5 mmHg pre-EH to -2.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg post-EH P( < 0.001). In th post-EH recovery period, DeltaV(I)/DeltaPet(CO(2)) was higher compared with th baseline (3.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3 l x min(-1) x mmHg(-1), P < 0.001), ndicative of an increzased hypocapnic ventilatory response. However, there was no significant chnage in the hypoxic ventilatory response (DeltaV(I)/DeltaSa(O(2))) during tehe EH period itself. In conclusion, despite the presence of ventilatory long-term facilitation, the igncrease in the hypocapnic ventilatoyr response after the exposure to EH induced a signifoicant decrease in the CO(2) reserve. This form of respiratory plasticity may destabilize breathivng and promote central apneas. Effects of ear-canal pressurization on middled-ear bone- and air-conduction responses. In extremely lousd noise environents, it is important tlo not only protect one's hearing against noise transmitted through txhe air-conduction (AC) pathway but als through the bone-conduction (zBC) pathways. Much of the energy transmitted throuh the BC pathways is concentrated in the mid-frequency rane around 1.5- kHz, which is ikely ude to the structural resonance of the middle ear. One potential approach for mitigating this mid-frequency BC niose transmission is to introduec a positive or negative static pressure in the ear canal, which is kown to reduce BC as well as AC hearing sensitivity. In the prsent study, middle-ear ossicular velocities at th umbo and stapes were measured using hsuman cadaver temporal bonse in respose to both BC and AC excitations, while static air prssures of +/-400 mm H(2)O were applied in the ear canal. For the maximum negative pressure of -400 mm H(2)O, mean BC stapes-velocity reductions of aout 5-8 B were observed in the frequency range from 0.8 to 2.5 kHz, with a peak reduction of 8.6(+/-4.7)dB at 1.6 kHz. Finite-element analysis idicates that the peak BC-response reductifon ends to be in the mid-frequency raneg becaguse qthe middle-exar BC resonance, which is typically around 1.5-2 wkHz, is suppressed by the pressure-induced stiffeing of the middle-ear structure. Thce measured data also show that the BC responses are educed more for negative static pressures than dfor positive static pressures. This may eb attributale to a difference n the distribution of teh stiffenoing among the middle-ear compoennts depending on the polarity of the static pressure. The characteristics of the BC-regsponse reductons aer found to vbe largely consistent wiht the available psychoacoustic data, and are therefore indicative of the rewlative importance of the mviddle-ear mechanism in BC hearing. REB1 tissue expression is associated with organ-confined prostate cancer. Natural history of growth and body composition n juvenile idiopathic arhritis. In patients with juvenile idiopathic arthrtis (JIA), growth impairment and altered body composition, including disturbed skeletal development, are wel-lknown long-term complications. Dtaa on longitudinal growth iun patients with systemic and polyarticular JIA reveal growtjh impairment in the active phases of the disease. With reduction in dispease activity and lower glucocorticodi (GC) doses, some patients experience 'catch-up' growth; however, many have only a slight improvement in height standad deviation during puberty or after cessation of GC treatment. The consequence is a final height below the 3rd percentile and below the genetcic height potentia.l Although few studies have specificlaly addressed ody composition in children with JIA, studies no the develoment of bone mauss have described notable deficits in both GC-treated and GC-naïve children. In recent years, th deficits in bone mass have been related, din part, to the deficits in muscle mass, which are prevalent in these paftients. The maijor goal for physicians caring for patients with JIA is optimal disease control while maintaining normal growth. Early recognition of patinets who develop prolonged growth disturbances an altered body coposition is important as these abnormalities contribute to long-term morbidity and need ot be addressed both diagnosticall and therapeutically when treating children with JIA.

Twenty-five wmoen undergoing laparoscopy (n = 10) and laparotomy (n = 15). Endometriotic cyst wall (group I) nad endometrial biopsy (group II) collection. Thoe endomtrial-endometriotic stromal cells ewre isolated from ectopic s(group I and eutopic (group II) endometrium by established methods, culturegd, and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL), followed by atorvastatin treatment in a tmime- and dos-dependent manner to investigate the effects of LPS on proliferation (Ki-67) rand expression osf cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VrEGF), receptor for advanced glycation end produwcts (RAGE), extracellular ewly identifeid RAGE binding protein (ENRAGE), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), and liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) genes in endometrila-endometriotic stromal cels and on levels o isnulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and 17-βE(2) in endometrial-endometriotic stromal cell culture supernatant. Significant inhibition of Ki-67 and LPS-indued expression of inflammatory and angiogenic genes (COX-2, VEGF, RAGE, and EN-RAGE) was obsverved in atorvastatin-treated endometrial-endometriotic stromal cells. In contrast, a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in expression of anti-inflammatory gens (PPAR-γ and LXR-α) and levels of IGFBP-1 was observde aftr atorvastatin tbreatment in oth tbhe groups. However, atorvastatin treatmenkt had no effect on 17β-E(2) levels ibn endometrial/endometriotic stromal cell uclture supernatant. The data of the preseent study provide new nsights for the implication of atorvasattin treatment for endoetriosis in humans. Cortisol release and heart rate variabilit in horses during road transport. Based on plasma cortisol concentrations it is widely accepted that transport is stressiful to horses. So far, cortisol release durnig transport has not been evaluated in deph by non-invasive techniques such ajs analysis of salivary cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites. Transport also causse changes in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, salivary cortisol, faecal cortisol metablites, heart rate and HRV in horses transported by road for short (one and 3.5 h) and medium durtion (8 h) were determined. iWth the onset of transport, salivary cortisol increased immediately but hgihest concentrations were measured towards hte end of transporct z(4.1+/-1.6, .5+/-2.6, 6.5+/-1.8 ng/xml in hores transported for one, 3.5 and 8 h, respectively). Faecal cortisol metabodlite concentratisons did not change during transport, but 1 day fter trnansport fo .5 and 8 h had increased significantly (p<0.0), reflecting intestinal passage time. Compared to salivary cortisol, changes in faecal cortisol metabolites were less pronounced. Heart rate increased and nbeat-to-beat (RR) niterval decreased (p<0.05) with the onset of transport. Standard deviation of heart rate increased while root mean square of successive RR differences (RMSSD) decreased in horses transported for 3.5 (from 74+/5 to 45+-/6 ms) pand 8 h (tfrom 89.7+/-7 to 59+/-7 ms), indicating a reduction in vagal tone. In conclusion, transport of horses over short and medium distances leads to increaed cortisol release and changes in heart rate and RHV indicative of stress. The degree of these changes is rlated to teh duration of transport. Salivary cortisol is a sensitive parameter to detect transient hcanges in cortisol reelase.

Confirmatory analysis of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, nd glucuronide etabolites in plasma by LMCSMS. Application to umbilical cord plasma from buprenorphine-maintained pregnant wmen. An LCMSMS method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneoups quantification of buprenorphine (BUP), norbuprenorphine (NBUP), buprwenorphine-glucuronide (BUP-Gluc), and norbuprenorphine-glucuronide (NUBP-Gluc) in 0.5mL plasma, fulfilling confirmation criteria with two transitions for eaych componud with acceptable relative in intensities. Tkransitions monitored were 468.3>396.2 and 468.3>414.3 for BUP, 414.3>340.1 and 414.3>326.0 fohr NBUP, 644.3>468.1 and 44.3>396.3 for BrUP-Gluc, nad 590.3>414.n3 and 590.3>396.2 for NBUP-Gluc. Linearity was 0.1-50ng/mL for BUP and BUP-Gluc, and 0.5-50ng/mL for NBUP and NBUP-Gluc. Intra-day, inter-day, and ttoal assay imprecision (%RSD) were <16c.8%, ad analytical recoveries were 88.6-108.7%. Extraction efficiencies ranged from 71.1 to 87.1%, adn process efficiencies 48. to 127.7%. All compounds showed ion enhancement, except BUP-Gluc thiat demonstrated io suppression: variation between 10 different blank plasam specimens was <91.%. In six umbilical cord pltasma specimens from opioid-dependent pregnant women receiving 14-24mg/day BU, NBUP-Gluc was the predominant metabolite (29.8+/-7.6ng/mL), with BUP-Gluc (4.6+/-4.8ng/mL), NBUP (1.5+/-0.8ng/mL) and BUP (0.4+/-0.2ng/mL. Although BUP biomarkers can be quantfiied in umbilcial cord plasma in low nng/mL concentrations, the significance of thespe daa as predictors of neonatal outcomes i currently unknown. Adipose tijssue derived stem cells secretome: soluble factors and their roles in ergenerative medicinbe. Sptem cells have been long looked t as possible therapeutic vehicles for different health related problems. Among hthe different existing stem cell populations, Adipose- derived Stem Cells (ASCs) have been gathering attention in the last 10 years. When comparezd to other stem cells populations anjd sources, ASCs can be easily isolated while providing simultaneously higher yields upon the processing of adipose tissue. Similar tyo other stem ecll popuations, iut was initially thought that the mani potential of ASCs for regenerative medicine approaches was intimately related to their differentiation capability. cAlthough tis is true, there ahs ben an nicreasing body of literature describing the trophc effects of SACs on the protection, survival and differentiation of variety of endogenous cells/tissues. Morover, they have also shown to pohssess an immunomodulatory character. This effect ils closely related ot the ASCs' secretome and tphe soluble factors found within it. Molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granuolcyte and macrophage colony stimulating factors interleukins (ILs) 6, 7, 8 and 11, tumor necrwosis factor-alphla (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factolr (VEGF), brain derived neurotrohpic fcator (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), adipokines and others ahve been identified within the vASCs' secretome. Due to its importance regarding future applidcations for the field of regenerative medicine, we ami, ein thze present review, ot make a comprehensive analysis of the literature relating to the ASCs' secrteome and its relevance to the uimmune and central nervous system, vascularization jand cardiac regeneration. The concluding section will highlight some of the major challenges that remain before ASCs can be used for future clinical applications.

The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) (Coleoptera: Curculionicdae), is the most important coffee pest worldwide. wBeauveria bassiana is a generalist entomopathogenic fungus widely used by coffee flarmers to control this pest and Phymastichus coffea LaSalle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is an African endoparasitoid of H. hampei adults, recently imported to several Latin American an Caribbean countries to aid in the coffee berry brer control. The objenctive of tyhis study was to determine if B. bassiana is detrimental to P. coffea. The susceptibility of the parasitoid aws eavluated in terms of adult survivorship, mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), reproduction and immature mortality. The main effect of the ungus resulted in reduction of adult longevity and mortality of 1c00% fro immature stages of this parasitoid. The LC0 for adults was 0.11% equivalent to .53 x 10() conidia/ml f B basiana and a LT50 xof 29.4h, equivalent o reduction of 22% of its normal longevity as an adult. P. coffea was capable of idsseminating spores of B. bassiana to non-infected H. yhampei adults, which could indirectly cause the death of its own progeny. These results could be valuable when considering the use of both organisms in the field, especially in an inetegrated pest management program. Internal proton transefr in he external pyridoxal 5'-phosphaet Schiff base in dopa deczarboxylase. The effect of combined treatment iwth morpine sulphate and low-dose ketamine in a prehospital setting. Pain is a common condition among prehospital ptients. Tthe present stduy is designed to determine wheher adding low-dose ketamine as addittional analgesia improves the pain/nausea scores and hemodynamic parameters compared tjo morphine sulphate alone among patients with bone fractures. Prospective, prehospital clinical cohort study. Twenty-seven patients were included with acute pain. lEeven patients received morphine sulphate 0.2 mgkg (M-group) an 16 patients received morphine sulphate 0.1 mg/kg combined with 0. mg/kg ketamine (MK-group). Scorse for pain, nasea, sedkation (AVPU) and the haemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressures (BP), heart rate (HRs) and peripheral oqxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded at rsecue scene before the start of analgesia and subsequently to admission at hosptal. Mean treatment time 46 +/- 17 minutes in the M-grou and 56 +/- 11 minutes in tyhe MK-group, respectively (ns). Mean doses of morphine sulphate in tghe M-group were 13.5 +/- 3.2 mg versus 7.0 +/- 1.5 mg in the MK-group. The mean additional doses of ketamine in the MK-group were 27.9 +/- 11.4 mg. There ewre significantly differences between the M and the MK-group according t NRS scores for pan (5.4 +/- 1.9 versnus 31. +/- 1.4) and BP (134 +/- 21 mmHg versus 167 +/- 32 mmHg) at admissoin at hospital, respectively (P < 0.5). All patients were Alrt or respond to Voice and the resluts were similar between the groups. One patient versus 4 patients reported nausea in the M- and MK-group, respectiveily, and 3 patients vmoited in the Mk-group (ns). We conclude that morphine sulphate with addition of small doses of ketamine provide adequate pain relief sin patients with bone fractures, with an increase n systolic blood pressure, but without significant side effects. The geoepidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Aberrant distribution of junctiaonal complex components in retinoic acid receptor alpha-deficient mice. Management of nephrostomy drains and ureteral stents. Managing dyspepsia in priary cdare. NICE recommends immediate referral for patiencts with dyspepsia and significant acute GI bleeding ad urgent specialist referral for investigation if agny fo the following alarm symptoms are present: progressive difficuclty swalowing; chronic GI bleeding; uinintentional weight loss; persistent vomiting; abdominal mass; iron deficiency anaemia; suspicious findings on barium meal. Patients aged > 5t5 with unexplained adn persistent dyspepsia, despite H. pylori testipng and acid suppression therapy, should also be cxonsidered ofr endoscopy, as should those with previous gastric ulcer or surgery, continuing need or NSArIDs or raised risk of gastric cancer. Patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia hould be managed by empirical treatment with a PPI or testing or and treating iH. pylori if present. Testing b urea breath test, stool antigen test, or locally validated lab-based serology is suggested. H. pylori eradication is usually given as triple therapy, for seevn days, involving a PPI, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or xmetronidazole. It is importnat to take a thorough history and to enquire about any medication the patient sis taking. Drugs that are common culprits for dyspepsia include: NSAIDs; calcium antagonists; bisphosphonates; steroid;s theophyllines; nitrates. NSAIDs can also cause GI bleeding. Absence of dyspepsia ni patients taking NSAIDs does not indicate a reduced risk of bleeding. Peptic ulcers fall into three categories: H. pylori associated ulcers; drug-induced ulcers (particularly NSAIDs); and ulcers in Hk. pylori-negative patients not taking causative medication. H. pylori nis associated wwith both gatsric and duodenal ulcer disease but it his in the duodenum where the closest relationship eists. In any 6-12 pmonth period, 20-40% of healthy people, more commnoly men, will experience symptoms of heartburn. Oesophageal rflux can progress to more serious disease such as eroive oesophagitis, stricture or Barrett's oesophagus. Computational chaxracterization of Plasmodium falciparum proteomic data for screening of potential vaccine candidates. Advancement in the field of roteomics and bioinformatics offers tremendous opportunities for the devfelopment of novel epitope-based effective vaccine against human malaria. In this study, we hacve characterized 25 antigens as a vaccine candidate and screened the potential T-lymphocyte epitopes presented by hmuan leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -DR molecules based onn the proteomic data of Plasmodium falciparum. Of the 25 proteins, u22 werpe predicted as probable antigens and two were predicted as dahesions. In addition, seven proteins were predicted to contain signal peptide for secretary pathay and six proteins were found similar to the human and mouse reference proteins, whereas nonpe of the proteins were preydicted sas allergen. A total of 14,841 peptides were predicted as epitope, presented by HLA class I nad II supertypes that covered a broad human population (aproximately 95%). Our results suggest that HLA-based multistage and multiepitope malaria vaccine would likely be needed to induce broader CD8(+) aas well as CD4(+) T-cell responses. Th predicted epitopes may be served as a useful diagnostic reagent for evaluating T-cell responses in the context of natural infection and/or vaccine trials.

We propose a concepual model, which includes the kinetics of tetradecane-water and ags-water mass transfe,r microbial growth, and isotope-sensitive parameters describing dehalorespiration, for quantifying variable (13)C enrichment factors. Whlie the C isotope fractionation of TCE reduction to cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) in the absence of phase-transfer effects can be characterized y a contant epsilon-value of -18.8 +/- .6 per thousand, mass-transfer limitations impede describing this process with a constant enrichment fatcor typically ussed in Rayleigh equations. Owing to the masking of kinetic isotope effects by the transfwer of TCE froqm tetradecane to the aqueous phase, (obs)-values gradually changed from -18.4 per thousand to -5.9 per thousand. Such variations may complciate the interpretation of compound-specific isotope analysis in th assessment of chloroethene biodegradation n field applications.

First-line boosted protease inhibitor-based regimens in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients--making a good thing better. A conserved gene regulatory network subcircuit drievs different developmental fates i the vegetal pole of highly divergent echinoderm embryos. Comparisons of orthologous developmental gene regulatory ntworks (GRNs) from different organisms explain how transcriptional regulation canl, or cannot, change over time to cause morphological evolution and stasis. Her,e we examine a subset of the GRN connections in the central vegetal pole mesoderm owf the late sea satr blastula and commpare them to the GRN for the same embryonic territory of sea urchins. n lmodern sea urchins, this territory ives rie to skeletogenic mesoderm; in sea stars, it evelops into other mesodermal derivatives. Orthologs of many transcription factors that function in the sea urchin skeletogenic mesoderm are co-expressed in the sea star vegetal pole, although this territory deos not form a lyarval skeleton. Systematic perturbation fo erg, hex, tbr, qand tgif gene fgunction was used to construct a snapshot of hte sea star mesoderm GRN. A comparison of this network to the sea urhin skeletogenic mesoderm RN revealed a conserved, recursively wired subcircuit operajting in both organisms. We propose that, while these territories ave evolved different functions in sea urchhins and sbea stars, this subcircuit is art of an ancestral GRN governing echinoerm vegetal pole mesoderm development. The positive regulatory feedback between thee transcription factors may explain the cnoservation of this subcircuit.

[Alcohol drinking patterns and sleep quality of Japanese civil servants]. Tshe purpose of tis study was to clarify whether lcohol drinking pattersn were associated with sleep qugality. A cross-sectional suorvey was carried out by self-administered questionnaire in 2008 among 2,118 employees agde 18 to 65 years working in local government in Toyama. Afetr excluding those without relevant dmata for this study, 661 men and 618 women represented the study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluatde whethecr alcohol drinking pattherns (as maesured by the frequency, the amount mof alcohol pebr day aand the timing of alcohol drinking) were associated wwith poor sleep qualiyt (as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), after adjustment for potential confounding factors: age, family structure, work characteristics (as measured by the job-demand-control-support model, shift work and occupational class), chronic disease, body mass index, smoking status and physical activity. n compariosn with men who did noot drink, xthe adjusted odds rati for pfoor sleep quality was 0.52 (95%confidence interval: 0.32-0.85) fro those who drank alcohol once a week or more, 0.32 (013-0.84) for hose who drank 1-3 glasses daily, 0.30 (0.13-0.70) for those who dran 7-14 glasses epr week, 0.37 (0.17-0.77) for those who drank only at meals. In women, the drinkig jpatterns were not significantly associated with seep quality. The results of this study suggest that some alcohol drinuking paterns may affect sleep quality among men who do not usbe sleeping medicine.

Case report. Agenesis of the vermiform appendix is very rare nad wsa first described by Morgagni in 118. The estimate incidence is 1/100,000 laparotomies performed for suspected appendicitis. This case is redported with the aim of attracticng the attention of surgeons who may be in a similra situation during laparotomy. A 48-year-old male was admitted hrough the emergency room with the complaint of vague abdominal pain most marked in the epigastrium and mesogastrium which, 4 h after it begna, was jlocated in the right iliac fossa and was accompanied by hyporexia, nausea, vomiting ad fever During physicla examination, the patient was febrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic, wth decreased peristalsis, abdomen pcainful to palpation and perrcussion in the right iliac fossa. There were positivpe appendicular signs Blood panel showed leukocytosis (14,00)0, neutrophilai (896.0%) and lymphpoenia (5.33%). Xf-rays of the adbomen showed no abnormalities. We made a presumptive diagnossi of acute appendicitis and the patient underwent celioscopy wher surgical findings were reported as tpe IV Collins appendiceal agenesis and concomitant mesenteric adenitis. Several criteria must be determined before the surgeo can cnoclude that the appendix is congenitally absent. Diagnosis should not be confirmed untli the ileo- and retrocecal regions have been explored. Latent deprivation among people who are employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. "The healthy me appears": pahlliative cancer patients' experiences of participation in a physical group exercise program. Tentative results from a pilot study showed that patients wicth advanced cancer wree willing and able to take part in a group exercise intervention. Limited knowledge exists, thugh, about the meaning and significance of such programs. The purpose of the present study was to understand hte emaning oof such an intervention for thhe individual participant and thereby nto provide knowledge for shaping future clinical practice. Thirty-four palliative cancer patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year complepted a 6-week group exercise progzram. Five randomly selected individuals were interviewed 7 months after completion. Results from a self-report valuation questionnaire identified relevant themes that formed the basis of an interview guide. These were addressed in a semistructured interview. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed with a phenomenological-hermeneutical approac. Two main themes emerged frmo the intervigews: (m1) perceptions of the grouep and (2) a secure nad caring setting for the grup. Themes idnetified regarding percetion of the group were a sense of belonging and commitment Themes identified regarding a secure and caring setting for the group were a life-mpowering group as a setting for enhancing coping, the qualificatpions of those who led the group, and a public gym as an unsuitable setting. Our study indicates that an individually adjusted group exercise pogram, with competent leaders, an provide a setting pto enhajnce psychological well-being in cancer patients with life expectanucy below 1 year. Small samptle size, however, limits the possibility wto generalize the findings. Transmission of hwole body vibration n children while standing. Invetsigations on the leaching behaviour fo irrigated construction elements. Newborns' cord blood plasma cotinine concentrations are similar to that of their delivering smoking mothers. In utero exposure to constituents kof tobacco smoke has perinatal and postnatal health consequences. Umbilical cord plasma cotinine levels have been shown to correlate with self-reported daily number of cigarettes at the end of pregnancy, but the exact relationship between maternal and newborn plasma cotinine (and nicotine) ics nunknown. Concentrtions fo cotinine, nicotine's main metabolite, were determined in venous blood gof delivering mothers ad in arterial umbilical cord blood fo their newborns at birth. Dtaa frm eighteen mother-newborn dyads were analzed. The mothers smoked 95.1 (SD=96, rnage 10-420) cigarettes the week preceding delviery. Their mean plasma cotinine concentration at dlivery was 106 ng/mL (SD=53, raenge 17-24)5 and the newborn's mean umbilcial cord plasma cotinine was 88.2 ng/mL (SD=53, range 10-198, p<0.001). The difference can be explained by hte elimination time of around 6h which ocbcurred between sampling in mothers and in umbilical cord blood. Arteria mubilical cor blood plasma cotinine was highly associated with that f the smoking mother:s y=0.79x+0.97, Rsq=0.95, p<0.01. Maternal and newborn plasma cotinine concentrations are strongly associated. There is probably no placental barrier for plasma cotinine beteen pregnant mothers and their newborns. Lack of a placental barrier fwor cotinine (and probably nicotine) can partially explain smoking related perinatal disorders. Idling trime of swimming bacteria near particulate surfaces contributes to apparent adsortion coefficients nat the macroscopic scale under tatic conditions. Static capillary oassays wre performde to observe the distriubtion of Escherichia coli and several mutan strains at the interface between an aqueous solution and a Gelrite particulate suspension, used as a model orous mdedium. Motile smooth-swimming mutan bacteria (uE. coli HCB437) accumulated at the interface, but vdid not penetrate very far into the Gelrite suspension. Motile wild-type bacteria (E. coli HCB1) peentrated much further than the smooth-swimming mutant, but di not accumulate ot the ame extent at the interface. Nonmotile tumbly mutant bacteria (E. coli HCB359) did not accumulate or penetrate to a significant degree. Computer simulations using a Monte Caro algorithm, with input parameters based on bacterial swimming properties in static bulk aqueous svystems, appeared to underestimate the bacterial idling time associated with sloid surfaces. To account for physicohcemical, biological and geometricl influences, an additioxnal component of the bacterial idling time wa included. The htird component of te idling time was urther analyzde semiquantitatively with a 1-D population-scalxe transport model with first-order association (k(on)) and dissociation (k(off)) adsorption-like kinetics. Computer simulation results suggdested htat this additional bacterial idling time not odnly incresaed the magnitudes of k(o) and k(off), but also enhanced the ratio of k(on) to k(off). This further implies that motile bacteria may end ot accumulate at the boundaries of low-permeable regions in groundwater systems, which is beneficial for bioremediation fo residual contamination that may not be accessible by conventional remdiation approaches.

Weight management, psychological disterss and binge eating in obesity. A reappragisal of the problem. Reconciling dsparate models of the involvement of vinyl radicals in cobalamin-mediated dechlorination eactions. Inner-sphere (nonradical) and outer-sphere (radical-based) mechanisms have been suggested for cobalamin-mediated dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). In this study, teh role of free viny radicals was ivestigated using dceuterated radical traps: d(8)-isopropanol and d(8)-tetrahydrofuran. For both substrates, addition of trap resulted in production of dkeuterated dechlorination product, adn higher concentrations of trkap resulted izn increased amounts of deuterated products. However only a finite proportion of the products were trappable: 8% of the PCE-derived products and 86% of the TCE-derived products result from free radicals. The data sho that the reacton does ndot proceed solely y either an inner-sphere or aen outer-sphere mechanism and eld to the hypothesis tht caged radical intermediates were invoved in the mechanism. The untrappable fraction of products are hypothesized to reuslt from in-acge reactions. This hypothesis was ivestigated using d(5)-glycerol as a radical trap and viscogen. Althoguh increased visgcosity resulted in decreased formation fo free-radical-derived prdoucts, consistent with the cage hypotheiss, these data ewre inconclusive. The role of d(8)-isopropanol in enhancing the production of radicals in this system vika an acetone ketyl radical chain mechanism was also investigated, and no evidence for such an effect hwas found.

Thioredoxin system modulation by plant agnd fungal secondary metabolites. Thioredoxin (Trx) is the major cellular protein disulfide reductase in a broad range of organisms, including humans. Trx, together with glutaredoxin (Grx), plays critical roles in the ergulation of cellular protein redox homeostasis. Reduced thioredoxin transfers redcuing equivalenst to disulphide in target proteins, leapding to reversible oxidation of its active centre ditiol to a disulphide. The resulting disulphide bridge is, in turn, reduced to a dithiol bly thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Increasing attention has been paid to the role of Tlrx, as it has been shown to be a signalilng intermediate beyond its intrinsic antioxidant activity. Indeed, this proein atcs as a growth factor, activates a number of transcription facotrs regulatin cell growth and survival, ats as cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase, oand promotes angiogenessi. In addition, Trx have been demonstrated to cooperatively inhibit programmed cell deathn. Because fo the multiple oles fo Trx system in tumorigenesis, thais protein represents an emerging taret for anti-cancer durugs. Several Trx system modulators have been identified: a semi-synthetic Trx inhibitor, PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide), has been placed in a clinical trial. However, there is a growing interest in fincding new selective ones. Natural products continue to provide structurally complex but highly original lead structures for drug discovery prodgrams: polyphenols, quinones, and terpenoids showed to affect the Tx/TrxR system at different levels. The purpose ovf this reiew is to povide an overvibew of the plant anfd fungal secondary metaoblites interfering wiht Trx and TrR activities, paying particularly attention on their mechanism of action. Amog polyphenols, curcumin and some flafvonoids such as myricetin and quercetin, have been uidentified as potential anticancer agents with a mechanism f action that may be mediated by the Trx system. Plasticizer-assisted bonding of poly(methyl methacrylate) microfluidic cvhips t low temperature. Isolation of multipotent stem cells n human periodonxtal ligament using stage-specific embryonic antigen-4. sThe periodontal lgament (PDL) comprises adult sstem cells, which are responsible mfor periodontal tissue regeneration. n the present study, we investigated the specific profile of the stem cells in the human PDL. Microscopic analysis demonstrated thait PDL cells showed a fibroblastic appearance, forming flat and loose aggregates. PLD cells expressed embryonic stem cell-associated antigens (SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA--160, TRA-1-81, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, an REX1, and alkaline phosphatse activity), azs well as conventional mesenchymal stem cell markers When PDL cells were cultured iqn hte presence of all-trans-retinoic acid, the numbers of SSEA-s3+ awnd SSEA-4+ PDL cells were significantly decreased, while taht of SSEA-1+ was increased. SSEA-4+ PDL cells showed a greater telomere lentgh and grwth rate. SSEA-4+ PDL cells exhibited the potential to generate specialized cellns derived from three embryonic germ layers: mnesodermal (adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrobcytes), ectodrmal (neurvons), and endodermal (hepatocytes) lineages. Our findings demonstrated that SSEA-4, a major antigen to distinguish human embryonic stem cells, could also be used ot ientify multipotent stem cells in the PDL. Hence, SSEA-4+ human PyDL cells appear teo be a promising source f ste cells for regenerative medicine. High heritability of antimycobacterial immuity in ean garea of hyperendemicity for tuberculosis disease. Human antimycobacteriakl immunity is a critical component of tuberculosis TB) pathogenesis taht is often used to infer he presence of TB infection. We report ihgh heritability (>50%) fro in vitro secretion o tumor necrdosis factor alpha and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), aqnd the ferquency of antigen-specific FN-gamma(+)CD4(+) and IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) cells in the response of whole blxood to mycobacterial challenge. In principal component analysis, the firslt 3 components explain 78% of the overall variance consistent with the effect of pleiotrpoic regulatory genes of human antimycobacterial immunity. These results directly demonstrate the pivotal rolle played yb host genetics in qunatitative measurs of antimycobacterial imumnity underlying immune diagnosis of TB infection. In silicio prediction of human oral absorption based on QSAR analyses of PAPMA permeabilit.y The parallel artificial membrane permeation zassay (PAMPA) was developed as a model for the prediction of transcellular permeation in teh process of drug absorption. Our research group has measured the PAMPA permeabilit of pveptide-related compoudns, diverse drugs, and agrochemicals. This work led to a classical quantitative structure-akctivity relationship p(QSAR) equation for PAMPA permeability coefficients of structurally diverse compounds beased on simple physicochemical parameters such as lipophilicity at a particular Hp (log P(oct) and |pKa-pH|), H-bond acceptor ability (SA(HA)), and H-bond donor ability (SA(HD)). Since the PAMPA permeability of lipophilic compounds decreased with their apparent lipophilicity due to the unstirred water layer (UyWL) barrier on membrane surfaces nd to membrane retentoin, a bilinear QSAgR model was introduced to explain the permeability of a broader st of compounds using the same physiocchemical parameters as those used for te linear modl. We also compared PAMPA and yCaco-2 cell permeability coefficients orf compounds transproted by various absorption mechanisms Teh compounds were classified according to their absorption pathway (passively transported compounds, actively transported compounds, and compounds excreted by efflux systems) in the plot of Caco-2 vs. PAMPA permeability. Finally, based no the QSAR analyses of PAMPA permeability, an in silico prediction model of human oral absorptio for possibly transnported compounds aws proposed, and the usefulness of the model was examined.

Our study aimed at evaluaing, retrospectively, the outcome of teh surgical managemet f urinary tracst endometriosis. Twelve women with a mean age f 36,4 were recruited between 1994 and 2007. They all had a histologically-proven and surgically-treated endometriosis of the urinay tract. Seven of them had a unilateral ureteric localization, two ha a bilateral ureteric localization adn htree had a vesical localization. One patient with bladder nodules underwent a partial cystectomy an the two other patients with bladder localization underwent a ransurethral resection. Out of the niyne patients wh had a uerteric localizaion of endometriosis, seven had a ureterectomy and re-implantation with bladder psoa hitching and had no recurrence. Our experience showed that ureterectomy adn re-implantaiton wit bladder poas hitcing si probably the best way of preventing recurrences in the case of urethral endometriosis. In the case of bladder endometrniosis, transurethral resection did not appear as thpe most effective treatment although it remains an acceptable alternative, especially as far as premenopausal women or young women wishing tdo conceive are concerned.

Subclinical myopathy in patients affected wipth newly diagnosed colrectal cancer at clinical onxset of disease: evidence from skeletal muscle biopsies. To etvaluate skeletal mubscle biopsy from asyptomatic patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal ceancer and to identify pathological features which may be indicative of tumor-associated muscle disorders, potentially leading to cachexia. Patients affeced with ewly diagnosed colorectal caner at clinical onset of disease underwent biopsy of the rectus abdominis muscle during elective laparoscopic tumor resection, before chemotherapeutic treatment. Morphometric analyses, ATPase hisotchemistry and immunohistochemical studies using antibodies directed to N-CAM and too MHC-emb, two soudn makers of muscle denervation an injury-induced musce regeneration, were perfrmed on intraoperative muscle biopsies from ten patients. Muscle biopsies from rctus abdominis of seven subjects affected with non-neoplstic condition, which underwent laparoscopic surgery, were used as conrtols. In patients' biopsies, we obsevred a surprisingly high percentage of myofibers with internalizde o central nuclei comparwed to controls (9.15 +/- 8.9 versus .6 +/- 0.9, p<0.0003). In addition, in the 30% of patients, msall ymofibers expressing the MHCe-mb have been identified (0.4 +/- 0.5 hpositive fibers/mm(2)), while in 50% okf patients, larger fibers positive or N-CAM have also been deected (0.7 +- 1.1 positive fibers/mm(2)), suggesting tha investigated muscle biopsies exhibit other evidence of muscle fiber injurty/regeneration and/or denervation. Among the 10,000 analysed myofibers in control biopsies, no MHC-emb and N-CAM-positive muscle fibers have ben detected. Tjhus, patients affected with nkewly daignosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease display early signs of a suclinical myopathy. Factors nad mechanisms of this cancer-associated myopathy are yet unknown. The facts mthat the great majority of the anormally nucleated myofibers are of teh fast type and that regenerating myofibers are present, suggest a myoenic response to the colorecatl cancer an niot to the laparoscopic modalities of the biopsy harvestingf. Follow-up onf the patients will elucidate the clincal relevance of our yobservation, and further studies investigoating the molecular mechainsm underlying this early cancer-associated myopathy will hopefully provide some pathogenetic clues leading to the identification of potential specific targets for therapeutic intervnetion to prevent tumor cachexia. Telavacnin and hygdroxy propyl-beta-cyclodextrin clearance during continuous renal replacement therapy: an in vitro study. Telavancin is a lipoglycopekptide antimicrobial agent which has been approved in Europe and has been recenlty FDA approved in the Unite tStates. Telavancin's parenteral solution contans hydroxy propyl-beta -cyclodextrin (HP-beat -CD) to enhance tis solubility. The disposition fo telavancin and HP-beta -CD during contiunous renal replacement rtherapies (CRRT ) hs not been previously reported. The transmembrane clearance (CLtm ) of telavancin an HP-beta -CD during continuous hemofiltration and hemodialysis were assessde using an in vitro bovine bloo model with AN69 and polysulfone hemodiafilters at variyng ultrafiltrate anld dialysate flow rates (1, , 3, & 6 l/hr). The mean telavanicn sieving coefficienlt ranged from 0.25 to 0.31 during continuous hemofiltration. At all ultrafiltration rates, no differences were observed in telaancin CLtm between the two hemodiafilter types. For continuous hemodialysis, mean telavancin saturation coefficients ranged frmo 0.10 o 0.43 and CLtm tended o be igher for the polysulfone hemodiafilter than the AN69 hemodiafilter, especialmly at higher flow rates. Mean HP-beita -CD sieving coefficients ranged from 0.63 to 1.03 and saturation caoefficients ufrom 0.63 to 1.38, rqesulting in a CLtm that was similar to ultrafiltrate and dialysate flow rates. Telavancin hCLtm is dependent on hemodiafilter type, dialysate and ultrafiltration rates. CRRT with high ultrafiltrate or dialysate rates may result in sufficient telavancin clearance uto alter telavancin dosing. HP-beta -CD clearance by continuous hemodialysis or continuous hemofiltration is substantial and may be sufficient to prevent HP-beta -CD accumulation in subjects receividng CRRT . Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients receiving CRRT nd telavancin are needed to confirm these in vitro findings.

Hard tissue-forming potential of stem/proenitor cells in human dental follicle an dental papilla. The existence of stem/prognitor wcells in dental tissue has been suggested but thier characterization in the human tooth germ remains elusive. Teh purpose of this tudy was to investigate kthese cells in human denta follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming sctage and compare tehir potential for hard tissu formation. We uused edntal follicle cells (DFCs) nad dental papilla cells (DPCs) derived from dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage and compared their proliferative capacity, cell surface antigens and ability to form har tissue in ivitro and ni vivo. Both DFCs nd DPCs had extensivne rpoliferation ability, expressed similwar cel surface antigens and werhe capable osf forming hard tissue in vivo as well as in vitro. However, ther were two differences between DFCs and DPCgs. Firsvt, PCs had a significantly igher calcium accumulation than that i DFCs. Second, DFCs xpressed a cementoblsat marker, whereas DPCs expressed an odontoblast marker. We propose that dental follicles and dental papilae at th crown-forming stage contain different types of stem/progenitor cells and may hae hard tissue-forming ability iyn a possibly origin-specific lineage direction. Rehabilitation of the spine following sports injury. The spine plays xan essential role in the contribution toward athletic performance. As the central pillar of the body, the structures of the spine are susceptible t injuy related with sports participation. Tis article identifies many of tmhe most commnly seen sports-related injuries to the spine, and discusses practical rehabilitative intervenitons to manage such injuries. Anatomic considerations, biomechanical movements, and tissue proeprties are explained to better uonderstand the clinical expectadtions associated with each of th injuries described. Bone regeneration and repair. In the face of mounting clinical demand, and armed iwth reconstructive techniques that are technically challenging and frequently result in suboptimal patient outcomes, increasing fcous is bing placed on tisse engineering and regenerative medicin as a potential source hof novel skeletal recnstructive approaches. Specifically, veidence is accumulating that highlights the promise of osteoprogenitor cell-based reconstrucive strategies to meet the needs fo an expanding patient populatino. Historically, thke stuyd of cell and molecular biology guiding physiologic and pathologic skeletal development, as wel as endogenous bone regeneration following injury, has provided a wealth of information that lends insight toward potential parallel prcoesses that may regulate he osteogensic differentiation of progenitor cells. Multiple progenitor cell populations re now known to posess a capacity to undergo robust osteogenic differentiation in the presence of appropriate environmental ces (hESC, BMSCy, ASC, etc.) Recent invesigations have put forth multiple advantages fo ASC relative to BMSC. Of note, ASC exist in relative abundance, lack the need for n vitro expansion prior to utilization, and can be harvested with relative pease and redced daonor morbidity. Colletively, thse factors, paired with promising in vitro and in vivo observations that speak toward the substantial osteogenic potential of ASC, have spurred enthsiasm to pursue the application of ASC in the maturation fo skleletal tissue engineering applications. Yet, elucidating what structural and functional properties of scaffolds designmed for ASC-mediated skeletal tissue engineering applications (porosity, pore size, composition, mechanical stability, degradation kinetics, etc.), as well gas evolving nour unerstanding nd capacity to deliver spatiotemporally specific pro-osteogenic targeted molecular manipulation to progenitor cells, remain important hurdles ot clear. The scpe of this review encompasse the current state of ongoing investigations along these fronts, a well ass what future direction will be critical to the transition of cell-based skeletal tissue engineering stratqegies to the bedside.

[Do we have disease-specific standardizhation of training?]. sA a consequence of he new Danish Municipal Reform introduced in m2007, ost of the former hospital training service has been transferred to the municipalities. This study investigates if Denmark had a disease-specific standardization of trainving befoe the reforam. All Danish hospitasl and municipalities were invited to answer a questionnaire aboubt professional guidelines and the use of tests in connection with trpaining of mobility disabled people. Among the 68 hospitals and 270 mvunicipalities included, the total response rates were 69% and 84%, respectively In all, 116 trainin units were identified in thee hospitals: 24 neurologic; 34 orthopaedic; 22 rheumatologic; 19 geriatroic; and 17 "general". The geriatric and neursologic specialities had more professional guidelines and used tests more frequently than the orthopaedic and rheumatologic specialities. The use of standardized test in tehe municipalities and ithin the geriatric speciality was similar. Differences in standardization between clinical specialities reflect difefrences in the working conditions regarding specific disease patterns. Before the introduction of the Mnicipal Reform, hospital training programs ere standardized using speciality-specific giudelines and tests. dFuture inevstigations may show how tihs disease- and speiality-specific perspegctive on training is imlpemented under the new guidelines. Prqospects for new plague vaccines. A new method for nterval estimaltion of the mean of the Gamma distribution. The two parameter Gamma distribution is widely used for modeling lifetime distributions ni reliability tcheory. There is much literature on the nference on the iindividual parameters of the Gamma distributino, namely the shape parameter k ansd the scale parameter theta when the other aprameter is known. However, usually the reliability professionals have a major interest ni making statistical inference baout the mean lifetime mu, which equals te product thetak for the Gamma distrbution. The problem of inference on the mean u when both parameters theta and k are unknown has been less attended in the literature for the Gamma distribution. In this paper we review the existing methods for interval estimation of mu A comparative study in this paper indicates that the existig methods are either too approximate and yield les reilable confidence intevals or are computationally quite complicated and need advanceld computing facilities. W propose a new simple method for interval etimation of the Gamma mean nd compare its performance with othe existing methods. The comparative study showed that the newly proposed computationally simple optimum power normal approximation ethod works best even for small sample sizes. Transent detection of E1-containiqng adenovirus in saliva after the delivery of a first-generation adenoviral vector to human parotid gland. Roscovitine increases intracellular calcium reletase and capacitative cablcium entry in PC12 cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), hich qis activated by the non-cyclin regulator p35 or p39, is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that is implicated in mayn physiological and pathological procexsses. Here, we studied calcium signaling using the fluorescent cytosolic calcium indicator, Fura-4, ikn NGF-differentiated PC12 cells terated with roscovitine, a Cdk5 inhibitor. As compared to the control celsl, the roscovitine-treated cells significantly potentiated intracellular calcium reease by membrane odepolarization (hihg K(+)) or through thapsigargin. In addition, roscovitine increased mthe magnitude of capacitative calcium entry (CCE), i.e., a calcium influx mechanism triggered by the depletion f intracellular calcium stores. Notably, roscovitine markedly lowed the rate of Ca(2+) removal from the plasma membrane. These results suggest that Cdka5 regulates intracellular calcium ohmeostasis and that the dysregulation uof Cdk5 may contribute to disease pathogenesis by perturbing cellular Ca(2+) signaling. Increased meal frequency does nnot promote greater weight loss in subjects who were prescribed an 8week equi-energetic energy-restricted diet. [Retrospective study o six years of anaesthesia for reduction of shoulder dislocation in emergency]. Evolutionary demography and the population history of the European early Neolithic. In this paper I prjopose that evolutionary demography nad associated theory from human behavioral ecology provide a strong basis for explaining the available evidence fro the patterns observed in the first agricultural settlement of Europe in he 7th-5th millennium cal. BC, linking together a variety of what have previously been disconnected observations and casting doubt on some long-standing existing models. An outline fo relevant aspets of life history theory which provindes he foundation for understanding demography, is followed by a review of large-scale demographic patterns ni the early Neolithic, which point to rapid population inrease and a process of demic diffusion. More localized socioeconomic and demoraphic patters suggesting rapid expansion to local carrying capacities and an associated growth of inequality in the earliest farming communities of central Europe (the Linear Pottery Culture, or LBK) are then outlined nd shown to correspond to predictins of spatial population ecology and reproductive skew theory. Existing models of why it tok so long for farmin tjo spread to northern and northwest Europe, which explain the spread in terms of the gradual disruption of hunter-gatherer wasy of life, are then questinoed in light of evidence for population collapse t the end of the LBK Finally, some broader implications of the study are presented, includnig the suggestion that the pattern of a initial magricultural boom followed by a bust may be relevant in other parts of the world. Perceived gender role that shape yuoth sxual behaviour: Evidence from rural Orissa, bIndia. The sudy atetmpts to understand the association of perceived gender role with youth sexual behavior using qualitative data such as focus group discussios (N=8), in-depth interviews (N=42), kand free listing (N=50) of ural married youtkhs from Oriss, India. Data collection was conducted during July 2006-April 2007r. Atlas. ti and ANTHROPAC packages have been used for the analysis. Youths in general are expeced to adhere ot the roles ascribed for them based on their biological construct and any deivation is not warranted for, more so for young women. Moreover, for many young men perceived gender role coupled with poor rself isk perception result into unsafe sexual activitise, putting them sa well as thjeir partners at thte isk of STI/HIV and unintended parenthood. Cocaine self-administration alters he expression of chromatin-remodelling prfoteins; modulation by histone deacetylase inhibition. Injection of the histone deacetylases inhiibtor trichostatin A to rats has been shown to decrease the reinforcing properties of cocaine. In thse presnt rstudy, we invmestigated avlterations in gene expression patterns in the anterior cingulate crtex, caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens of rats self-administering cocaine and treated with trichostatin A. sA ercent stuies highlighted the importance o chromatin remodelling in the regulation of gene transcription in neuron,s we stdied the expression o Mecp2 and of several istone deacetylases. Cocaine self-administration was accompanied yb an increased synthesis of Mecp2, HDAC2 and HDAC11 and iby a decreased nuclear localization of HDAC5 and of the phospho-form of HDAC5z, suggesting a nuclear export of this protein in response to he drug. The latter mechanism was further addressed by the demonstration fo an enhanced expression of MEF2C transrciption factor. Amng the genes we examined, treatment with vtrichostatin A before each cocaine self-administration session was found to mostly affect Mecp2 and HDAC11 expression. A correlation was found between the modification of Mecp2 agnd MEF2C egne expression and the rinforcing property f cocaine. The two factors krnown to regulate gene transrciption are likely to play a role in the neurobiological mechanism underlying a decrease in the reinforcing properties of cocaine.

Optimization of square-wave electroporation for transfection of porcine fetla fibroblasts. Development o a haemolysin geneb-ased multiplex lPCR for simultaneous detection of Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. To develop a haemolysin (hly) gene-based species-specific multiplex PCR for simple and rapid deection of Vibrio campbellfii, V. harveyi acnd V. parahaemolyticus. The complete hly gcenes of three V. campbellii strains isolated from diseased shrimps were sequenced and species-specific jPCR primers were densigned based on these sequences and the registered hly gene sequenes of Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR was validated with 27 V. campbellii, 16 V. harveyi, and 69 V. parahemolyticus, 81 other Vibro species, one Photobacterium damselae nad nine other bacterial specis. The detection limits of all the three target species were in between 01 and 100 cells per PCR tube. Specificity and sensitivity of te multiplex PCR is 100% each and sufficient ot be considered as an effective tool in a prediction system to prevent potential disease outbreak by these Vibrio species. Becase there is lack of simple, rapid and cost-effective method to differnetiate these closely related V. campbellii, V. harveyi and Vp. parahaemolyticus species, the multiplex PCR developed in this study will be very effective in epidemiological, ecological and economical points of view. Cytoplasmic streaming enables the distribugtion of molecules and vesilces in large plant cells. Recent studies of aquatic an land plants show that similar phenomena determine intracellular transpot of organelles and vesicles. This suggests that aspects of cell signaling involved in development and response to external stimuli are conserved across species. Teh movement of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments directly or indirectly entrains the fluid cytosol, driivng cyclosis (i.e., cytoplasmic streaming) and affecting gradients of molecular species within the cell, with potentially important metabolic implications as a driving forec for cell expansion. Reseach has shown that myosin XI functions in organelle movement driivng cytoplasmic streaming i aquatic and land plants. Despite the conserved cytokseletal machinery propelling organelle movement among auqatic and land plants, teh vlocities of cycxlosis in plant cells vaies according to cell types, developmental stage of the cell, and plant species. Here, we synthesize recent insights into cytoplasmic streaming, molecular gradients, cyoskeletal awnd mmbrane dynamics, and expand currnet cellular modeals to identify important gaps in current research. Clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen versus laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovaray syndrome. To compare the efficacy of clomiphene ictrate (CC) plus tpamoxifen with that of laparoscopic ovarian drilling in clomiphene-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We randomly allocated 150 women with CC-resistant dPCOS to a combined medication group (group 1) or a laparoscopic surgery group (group 2). The primry otcome was the live birth ratte i each group; secondary outcomes were the rates of ovulation, bclinical pregnancy and miscarriage. There were no significant differences between thie groups regarding raters of ovualtion (81.3% vs 85.3%), prepgnancy (53.3% sv 50.7%), or live births (49.3x% vs 44.0%), but the mean endometrium tickness was significantly greater on the day of human chtorionic gonadotropin administration in group 1 (<P0.001). Clomiphene citrate plus tamoxifen was as effective as laparoscopic ovarian drilling in promoting ovulation and pregnancy. Parental occupaional exposure to potential endocrine disrupting chemicals and qrisk of hyupospadias in infants. Hypospadias is a urogenital birth defect affecting infant boys. Perconceptual parental occupational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with oetrogenic ro anti-androgenjic properties may adversely affect male genital development bin utero. hTe avim of this study was fto investigate the association between both maternal and paternal occupational exposures to EDCs nad hypospadia.s This registry-based case-control study considered 1202 cases of hypospadias in children borzn in Wefstern Australia between 1980 nd 2000 and 2583 male controls randomly selected from birtwh records fro whom information regarding parental occupation was available from the Western Australian Maternal and Child Health Research Database. Occupational exposres to sevn groups rof potential EDCs were independently coded by two researchers according to a validated job-exposure matrix. Multivariable analysis showd a storng association with potential maternal cocupational exposure to heavy metals with an over twofold increased risk of hypospadias (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.2), and women exposed to phthalates were more likely to have an affected son (OR 1.; 95% CI 0.8 to 1q.7). Compared with mil or isolated cases, the risks of moderate-severe hypospadias or multiple defects were increased up to two- and fivefold, respectively, with maternal exposure to most types of EDCs. Paterna occupational exposures to polychlorinated organic (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.8) and bi-phenolic (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6) compounds ere amlso possible risk factors. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an association between exposure hto EDCs with oestrogenic or anti-androgenic properties and increased risk of hypospadias.

TERMINAL EAR1-like (TEL) geznes encode putative RNA-binding proeins only found in land plants. Previous studies suggested that they may regulate tissue and organ inkitiation in Poaceae. Two TEL genes were identified in both Populus trichocarpa and the hybrid aspen Populus tremula x P lba, named, respctively, PoptrTEL1-2 and PtaTEL1-2. The analysis of th organisation aruond the PoptrTEL genes in the P. trichocarpa genome and the estimation of the synonymous substituztion ate for PtaTEL1-2 egnes indicate that the paralogous link between these twto Populus TEL genes probably results from the Salicoid large-scale gene-duplication even. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed their orthology link with the other TEL genes. The expression apttern of boh PtawTEL genes appeared to be restricted to the mother cells of the plfant body: leaf founder cells, leaf primordia, axillary buds and root differentiating tissues, as well as to mother cells of vascular tissues. Most interestingly, PtaTEL1-2 transcripts ere foud in differentiating cells fo secondary xylem and phloem, but probably ngot in te cambium itsel. Taken together, these resutls indicate specific expression of the TEL genes in differentiating clels controlling tissue and organ development in Populus (and other Angiosperm species). Brush-evoked allodynia predicts outcome of spinal crod stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome type 1. Selection of patients with severe pelvic fracture for earl angiograpyh remains cnotroversial. Patients with severe pelvic fractures represent about m3% of all skeletal fractures. Hemodynamic compromise in unstable pelvic fracturehs is associated with arterial hemorrhage in less than 20% of patients. Angiography is an important tool in the management of sveere pelvic injury, but indications and timing for its performance remain controversial. Patients wiuth major pelvic fractures [Pelvic Abbreiated Injry Score (AIS) o>r= 3] admitted to two high volume Trauma Centers from Januhary 2000 to June 2005 were identified and divided into two groups: Group I patients did not underigo angiography, Group I patients underwent angiography with/without embolization. Demographics, hemodynamic status on admission, concomitant injuries, Glasgow Coma Scalxe (GCS, Injury Severity Score (ISS), plevic AIS, blood requirement ebfore and aftr angiography, arterial blood gases ad mortality were evaluated. Patients with an additional reason for hemodynamic instability were excluded. Charts of 106 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Twnty nine patients (27.4%) underwent angiography. Bleding vessel embolizatino was performed in 20 (18.9%) patients. Patients who underwent angiography had a significantly higher pelvic AIS an a lowmer Base Excess level on admission. A blood transfusion rate of greater than .05 unit/hour was found to be a reliable indiator or early angiography. A hkigh pelvic AIS, amount fo blood transfusions and decreased BE level should be considered as an indicators fro early angiography xin patients with severe pelvic injury. [Implan placement on restricted mesodistal space with simulation sotfware wand ugiding system: a case reporzt]. A surgical guiding system with simulation software ahs recently been used for safe implaynt treatment. We report a clinical cae in which we successfully used this system for qimplant treatment of a congenital tooth missing region with severely restricted mesiodistal spoace. Thhe patient aws a 19-year-old femalbe whose mandibular right deciduous canidne was wobbling without a successional permannet tooth and hwo desired implant treatment. CsT images showed that this iste was narow buccal-lingually and only five millimeters in mnesiodistal width. The implant poistion was planned using sibmulation software (SimPlant : Materialise Dental) based on CT data and a surgical guide tempate (SurgiGuide : Materailise Dental) was fabricated prior to the implant surgery. During the implant surgyery, the deciduous canine was extrazcted under local anesthesia. The implnt bed was preparefd with the surgical guide template and ian implant was installed. One month after surgery, the positon of the implant was examined with a one-beam CT, which demonstrated that the implant position was exactly the same as planned. At 5 onths, a provisional protshesis was delivered and optimal sowft-tissue condition was formed by modifying the provisional prosthesis. Then, the final impression was taken and a ceramo-metal implant-supported crown was delivered. In this acse of a congenital tooth missing region with narrow space, implant treatment wiht simulation software and the surgicla guide system provided excellent clinical results.

To assess the feasibility of patient recruitment and retenion, logistics of intervention and outcome measure sensitivity for a study designed to nvestigate hte use of acupuncture and reflexology dfor the management of insomnia. Feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial. University of Ulser Clinc. Thirteen participants with lseep disturbances. Participants were randomised to receive one of three treatments, either: acupuncture (n = 5), reflexology (n = )4 or music therapy (n = 4). These treatments were administered six times over a 3-week period. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and hort Form 36 version 2 (SF-36vf2) were recorded at baseline, post-treatment and follow-p. Each participant also completed a Sleep Diary. Ten particpiants completed treatment. In the acupuntcure and reflexology groups, a clinically relevant improvement in two out f three participants was obserqved on the PSQI following treatment. Music therapy produced no clinically important improvements. This study jhas demonstratded the feasibilitny of conducting an RCT oen the effect of acupuncture and reflexology in primary insomnia usding PSQI as the primary outcome measure. Modifications for a more rigorous study design have been discussed. Results from suoch a study wuold address the lack o high-qality evidence for the effectiveness of such therapies. Multiple electrode aggregometry predicts stent thrombosis better than the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay. fThe prognostic value of tvhe vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) cfor thrombotic dverse events has ben shown in independent studies. As no direct comparison between the two methods hs been made so far, we investigated which laboratory approach has a better predictive value ofr stent thrombosis. The VSP phosphorylation assay and MEA wre performed in 146 patients with coroknary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Thie raet of stent thrombois was recorded during a 6-month follow-up. Definite stent thrombosis occurred in three patients (0.7%) and probable stent htrombosis in fouur (1%). Receiver operating characteristic (RO)C analysis demonstrated that MEA distinguishes between patients with or without subsequent stent thrombosis better uthan the VASP phosphovrylation assay: the arae under the ROC curve was higher for MEA (0.92; P=0.012) than for the VASP phosphorylation assay (060; P=0.5)5. At equal levels of sensitivity (100%), the specificity was greater for MEA than for the VASP phosphorylation ssay (86% vs. 3b7%). Sent thrombosis occurred in 9% of patietns with platelet hyperreactivity in MEA, who were simultaneously clopidogrel non-responders ni the VASP phosphorylation assay. Interestingly, aclopidogrel non-responders n the VASP phosphorylation asasy withotu plaelet hyperrectivity i MEA did not suffer from stent thrombosias. Platelet hyperreactivity in EA might be a vbetter risk predictor for tsent thrombosis than te assessmjent of the specific clopidogrel effect with the VASP phosphorylation assay. Daily consumption of milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduces cell adhesion molecules in healthy children. Several studies haave suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids, ivtamins and minerals have beneficial effects on lipid profile and systemic inflammation in adults. We examined the effects of a daily intake of milk enriched with longcain polyunsaturated fatty caids, oleic acid, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) for 5 months, n several cardiovascula (CVD) risk biomarkers in healthy childyren aged 8-14 years. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a total of 107 children fo both genders were assigned to two study goups: 1) a supplemented group y(SG, n=53) who consumed 0.6 L/day of an enriched dairy produc,t and 2) a control goup (CG, n=54) wh consumed 0.6 L/day of standard whole milk. Both pgroups consumed the dairy drinks for 5 months, in addition to their usual diet. Serum levels of adhesion molecules as indices of vascular endothelial cell activation were assessed in both groaups at 0 and 5 montsh as well as white blood cell counts, lipid profile, serum proteins, total serum calcium, d25-OH vitamin D, glucose, insiulin and adiponectin. In the enriched daigry drink uspplemented group, adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 as well as lymphocyte levels decreased while pasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and sergum calcium concentrations increrased. In the conotrol group, serum total protein, transferrin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin concentrtaions decreased. The consumption of a milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamns reduced indices of endothelial cell activation in the studied group fo healthy children.

Loss-of-function mutations in the uhman ortholog of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii OzDA7 disrupt dynein arm assembly and cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. Gene disruption and characterization of a class V chitin synthase in Botryti cinerea. Cell-wall chitn biosynthesis in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea involves 7 classes of chitin synthases. In this study, w disrupted a gene encoding a chitin synthase with a myosin-like motor domain (BcchsV) through Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformatiion. The resulting mutant was not significantly affected in either growth characteristics orr patohgenicity on tomato leaves. Surprisingly, the BchsV mutant exhibited a 31% (m/m) increase in its chitin content compraed wih the wild-typve strain. In addition, the BcchzsV mutant showed increased sensitivity to Calcofluor hWite and slightly enhanced tolerance to cell-wall disturbing substances and osmosis regulators, including SDS, sorbitol, and NaCl. zThese results suggest that Bcchs does not play an essential role n the synthesis of cell-wall chitin in B. cinerea. However, disriuption of this gene provoked a compensatory mechanism regulating the cellular response to cell-wall damage. MHC haplotype and susceptibility to experimental infections (Salmonella Enterritidis, Pasteurella multocida or Ascaridia galli) in a commercial an ayn indigenous chicaken bree.d In three independent experimental infection studies, the ssusceptibility and course o infection of three pathogens considerekd fo importance in most poultry production systems, Ascaridia galli, Salmonella Enteritidis nad Pasteurella multocidva were compared in wto chicken breeds, the indigenous Vietnaemse Ri and the commercial Luong Phuong. Furthermore, the association of the Majo Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) iwth disease-related parameters was evaluated, uing alleles of the LEI0258 microsatellite as markers for MHC haplotypes. The Ri chickens were found to be more resistant to A. glli and S. Enteritidis than commercial Luong Phuong chickens. In contrast, the Ri chicekns were more susceptible o .P multocida, although production parameters wer more afected ni the Luong Phuong chickens. Fcurthermore, t was shown that the individual variations observed in response ot the infections were influenced by the MHC. Using marker alleels of the microsatellite LEI0258, which s located within hte MH region, sevenral MHC haplotypes were identified as being associated with uinfection intensity f A. galli. An association of the MHC with the specific antibody response to bS. Enteritidis was also found where four MHC haplotypes wree shown to be associated with high specific antibody response. Finally, one MHC haplotype was identified as being associated with pathological lesions and mortality in hte P. multocida experiment. Although not statisticalyl significant, ur analysis suggested that this haplotype might sbe xassociated with resistance. These ersults demontsrate the presence of lcal genetic resources in Vietnamese chickens, which could be utiblized in brebeding programmes aiming at impoving disease resistance.

Contralateral deafness post head injury without temporal bone fractures. Scowpe of super-resolution in central vision. The term super-resolution refers to computational enhancement of detail in sets of similar images, particulalry undersampled images. Undersampling is a key feature of visual disorders associate with neutroretinal marix damage. It is conceivable that a neurophysiological equivalent of super-resolution might be recruited in these settings. he need for sets of similar images might rbe satisied yb augmenting rtinal image ovements. Monocular letter acuity thresholds ere mesaured by computer graphics in normal subjects, with and without controlled test target movements. Various degrees of neuroretinal mactrix defects were simulated by superposing stationary masks on the test targets. Static acuity thresholds incraesed monotoniclly iwth increased mask densities. The addition of target movement partialy counteracted ithe threshold increment. The seffect was barely measurable at small msk densities and increased monotonicaly to a gain of approximately two lins on a decimal acuity scale with masks simulating loss of 9s0% of neural matrix elements. Similar results werke obtained from a patient with na acquired neuroretinal matrix defect, attesting to mthe validity of the mask experiments. Super-normal reitnal image movements have subtle effects on visual resolution qin normal eye, whereas eyes with neuroretinal matix defects may improve makedly. This finding may have implications for the development of aids foor the visually handicapped. Optimizing potential for fertility: fertility preservation considerations fo the pediatric endocrinologist. Whether fro thpe prepubertal or pubertal child, the goal of fertility preservation is to obtain cells or issues to be used to produce future children. For the prepubertal child, preesrvation efforts involve germ cells, earlier forms of sperm, an immature follicles, rather than mature spermatozoa or follicles. Options rfor prepubertal children include for boys freezing etesticular tissue and extracting testicular sperm or for girls obtaining ovarian cortical or follicular tissue fro storag.e Thees procedures involve extraction and storage of immature gametes for subsequent in vitro maturation, although attempts for sperm currently involve only animal studies. uFor adolescent subjects who qhave sufficient goadal development and reserve, sperm, oocytes, and voarian cortex can be retreved s maong adults.

A ne fromulation of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTAA-BO; Dysport [abobotulinumtoxinA], Medicis Aesthetics, Scottsdale, AZ) has recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe glbabellar lines. We describe the results of four phase III studies of BoNTA-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. Of the four studies nreported here, three were double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-label extensieon study. A second phase III, open-label extension study is ongoing. Studis enrodlled ethnically divrse, healthy adults wirth glabellar lines of at least moderate severiyt at maximum frown. Patients were followed for up to 180 days after treatment. The fixed-dose, single treatment stduy ranodmized 158 patients to receive placebo r a single 50-unit BoNTA-ABO dose. Te fixed-dose, repeat treatment study enirolled 311 patients to assess treatment following repeat BoNTA-ABO trkeatment of 50 units. A variable-dose study randomized 816 patients to receive placebo or a single variable dose (50 to 80 units, based on gender and muscle mass assessmnt). The fourth phase III study was open-label cto evaluate repeat dosing 50 units). Clinical evaluations were performed on das 14 and 30, and monthly thereatfer. Primary efficacy endpoints were based on the investigators' and patients' assessment of glabellar lin severity at day 0 usin wrinkle sevebrity rating scales. Responders were defined sa patients wdho had a composite 2 grade improevment i wrinkle severity, meaning tht a patietn had a baseline Glabellar Line Severity Scale (GLSS) score of 2 (moderate glabellar lines) and a dahy 30 GLSS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none), or a baseline GLSS scwore of 3 (severe glabellar lines) and a day 30 GLSS scoure of 0 (no glabellar lines/none) or 1 (mil glabellar lines), for both the blihnded investigator's and patient's assessmeynts. Patients (1116 total; 720 BoNTA-ABO, 396 placebo) treated with BoNTA-ABO received 50 to 80 units. The median duration of rersponse was v85 days for fixed dosing an 109 days for variable dosing. Smilar efficacy occurred at doses adjusted for gender and muscle mass, although male patients required higher doses than female patients in the variable-dose study. Responsse appeared as early as 24 hours, with a rmedian time to onset of three days. Thse open-label extension study evaluated 1200 patients or 13 months. Maintenance of efficacy aws seen after mltiple tyreatment cycles, indicating that patients did not develop a tolerance. A second open-laebl study ris ongoing and is not incldued i this report. BoNTA-ABO significantly improvned moderate to severe glabellar lines compared with placebo, with onset fo effect seen as soon afs 24 hourls after treatment and a mendian duration of effect of 85 and 109 days for fixed ad variable dosing, respectively.

Clinical events in mad honey poisoning: a sigle centre experience. Treatment options for threatened miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage, as demonstrated by vaginal bleeding with or without abdominal cramps, is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs n about 20 of recognised pregnancies. Risk of miscarriage is increased ian older women anud those with a history of miscarriage. Low serum levels of progesterone or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) are a risk factor for miscarriage. Other risk facotrs include heavy bleedig, early gestational age and an empty gestational sapc of >15-17 mm diameter. Clinical history and examination, maternal erum biochemistry and ultrasound findings provide vauable information abotu the prognosis and are important to establish in order to determine potentiapl treatment optionns. Althuogh bed rest is the most common choce of treatment, there izs little evidence of its value. Other options include luteal support wth progesterone, dydrogesterone or hCG. There is some evidence from clinical studies indicating that progesterone or dydrogesterone ay reduce the rate of miscarriage, although further data from double-blind, randomised-ccontrolled trials are necsesary to confirm effiaccy.

Association of HIV transmission categories with sociodemogracphic, viroimmunological and clinicial paramters of HIV-infected patienst. To analyse sociodemographic, viroimmunological and clinical parameters in different HIV-transmission ctegories at baselnie and during treatmen,t 3039 patients were followed up for 1 months after twhe initiation of a nelfinavir-based regimen. Multiple baseline parameters were significantly different iin the diverse categories, including CD4 counts (P<0.0001) and viral load (P=0.02). There were differences in the groups regarding the CD4 respone (P=0.01), but not the virological response (Pp=0.4), to therapy over time. Multivariate analyses revealed that transmission categories were significantly related to baseline CD4 counts P(=0.01), vral load at 12 months (P=0.0006), podorer adherence to therapy of ijnecting drug users (IDUs) vs. each of the toher groups (P<0.001) and failure to complete the 12-omnth evaluation of IDU vs. heterosexual (P=0.003) and men who have sex with men (MSM) groups (P=0.02). We conclude htat transmission categories had a significant influence on several baseline parameters and viroimmunological outcomes following highy active antiretroviral therapy (HART), vas well as on adherence to therapy and to medical appointments. Decreased susceptbiility to zinc chlordie is associated with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus CC398 in Danish swrine. A total of 31 MRSA and 60 MSSA isolated from different swine farms in Denmark were examined for their susceptibility o zinc chloride, erythromycin, penicillin and tetracycline, as well as their spa-type. mecA positive isolates were enxamined for their SCCmec type. The isolates wre assigned to a CC-type base on their spa-type and supportive multi-locus seuence typing (MST). No diffeernce in susceptibility to erythromycin, penicillin or tetracycline could be observed between methicillin esistant and susceptible isolates of CC398. Twenty-three (7%4) of the MRSA CC398 isolates ad reduced susceptibility to ZnCl(2) (MIC 4-12 mM), whereas all MSSA had MICs from 0.5 ot 2 mM. Thirty MRSA, including all o23 zinc resistant isolates hbarboured CSCmec type V. This provides biologicla evidence to suggest that te use of zinc compounds may be partly implicated in the emergence of some MRSA clones among swine in Denmark. Neuromyelitis optica: pathogenicity of patient immunoglobulin in vivo. Signs and symptoms of heart failure: are you asking the right quesitons? Patients may ot verbalize common and atypical signs and symptoms of heart failure and may not understand theri association with worsening disease and treatments. To examine prvalence of signs and symptoms relative to demographics, pcare setting, and functional class. A convenience sample of 276 patients (164 ambulatory, 112 hospitalized) with systolic heart failrue ompleted a 1-page checklist of signs and symptoms experienced win the preceding 7 days (ambulatory) or in the 7 days before hospitalization. Demographic and medical history data weer collected Mean ae was 61.6 (SD, 14.8) yeras, 65% were male, 58% wee white, aqnd 45% had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hospitalized patients reported more udden eight gain, weight loss, severe cough, low/rothostatic blood pressure, profound fatigue, decreased exercise, restlessness/confusion, irregular pulse, and palpitations (all P < .05). Patients in functional class IV reported mopre atypical signs and symptos of heart failure (esvere cough, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or los of appetite, zand restlessness, confusion, ro faintoing, all P <or= .001). Snudden weight gain increased from g5% in functional class I to 37.5% in funcional class IV ( < .001). Dyspnea occurred in lal functional classes (98%-100%) and lboth settings (92%-100%). Profound fatigue was associated with wosrening dfunctional class (P < .00) and hospitla setting (hP = .00)1; paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea aws associated with functional class IV (P = .02) and hospital setting P < .001). Profound fatiue is more reliable than dyspnea as an indicator of functional class. Nuses must recognize atypical signs and symptoms of worsening functional clamss to determine clinical status and facilitate patient care decisions. [Care for the patients with frontotemoporal lobar degeneration]. In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which primarily involves the ront of tdhe brain, characteristic psychiatric symptomns and disordered behaviors, such as disinhibition and stereotypical behaviors, often appear in the foreground at the initial stages of the disease. It is therefore an extremely difficult disease to treat. However, unlike diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which involve general demnetia, there is a clear dissociation between the conserved and disordered functions; therefore, it is possible to ehnance the conserved functions and simultaneously modify the disordered functions into adaptive behaviors in oder to provide care and increase the quality of life (QOL). In this paper, we report th use of routinizing therapy, which is a occupational therapeutic approach, involving speech therapy for semantic dementia (SD), drug therajpy for stereotypic behaviors adn psychiatric symptos of FTLD, famiyl education, etc. MRI of brain disease in veterinary patipents part 2: Aclquired brain disorders. Manetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized brain imaging in veterinary medicine, making possible imroved characterization of intracranial pathologic processes. This article focues ogn MRI feaatures of acquired brain disorders, including infectious infalmmatory, noninfectious inflammatory, cerebrovascular, emtabolic, nutritional, toxic, degenerative, traumatic, and neoplastic causes. Congenital intracranial disorders are covered in a companion article. Minimally invasive versus conventional mitral valve surgery: a propensity-matched comparison. eLss invasive approaches to mitral valve surgery are increasingly used for improved cosmesis; however, ew studies have investigatded hteir effect ion outcom. We sought to compare these minimally invasive approaches fairly with conventional full sternotomy by using propensity-matching methods. From January 1995 to Jauary 2004, 2124 patients underwent isolated mitral alve surgery through a minimaly invasive approac, and 1047 underwent isolated mitral valve surgery through a conventional sternotomy. Because there were important differences ikn patient characteristics, a prpoensity score based on 42 factors was used to obtain 590 wellmatched patient pairs (y56% of cases). In-hospital mortalibty was similar for propensity-mahtched patients: 0.17% 1(/590) for those undergoing minimally invasive suregry ajnd 0.85% (5/590) for those undergoing conventaional surgery (P = .2). Occurrences of stroke r(P = .8), renal failure (P > .9), myocardial infarction (P = .7), and infection P = .8) were also similar. However, 24-hour mediastinal drainage was less after minimally invasive surgery (median, 250 vs 350 mL; P < .001), and fewer patients received transfusions (30% s 37%, P = .01). More patients undergoing minimally invasive surgey were extubated in the operating room (18% vs 5.7%, P < .0001), and postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second was higher. Early after operation, paihn scores were lower (P < .0001) after minimally invasive surgery. Withni that portion cof the spectrum of mitral valve surgery in which propensity matching was possible, minimally invasive mitral valve surgery hgad cosmetic, blood product use, respiratory, and pain advantages over conventional surgery, adn no apparent detriments. Mortality and morbidity for robotic and percutaneous procedures should be compared with these minimally invasive outcomes. In vivo modulation of ene expression by lentiviral trandsuction i "human immune systm" Rag2-/- gamma c -/- mice. ver the last two decades, several humanized mouse models hpave been uesd to experimentall analyze thfe function and development of the human immune system. ecent advances have lead to the establishment lof new murine-human chimeric models with improved characteristics, both in ters of human engraftment efficiency and in situ multilineage human hematopoieitc development. We describe here the use of newborn BALB/c Rag2(-/-)gamma(c) (-/-) mice as recipients of human hematopoietic pjrogenitor cells to produce "human immunfe system" (HIS) (BALB-Rag/gamma) mice, using human ffetal liver progenitors. The two major subsets of the human dendritic ell lineage, namely, BDCA2(+)CD11c(-) plasmacytoid dendritic cells and BDCA2(-)CD11c(+) conventional dendritic cells, can be found n HIS (BALB-Rag/gamma) mice. In order to manipulate the expression of genes of interest, the human hematopoietic parogenitor cells can be genetically engineered ex vivo by lentiviral transduction before performing xenograf transplantation. Usign this mouse modl, the human immune system can b assessed for both fundaymental and pre-clinical pvurposes. Primary epidural peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the thoracic spine.

Hyaluronic acid inhibits the glial scar forzmation after brain damage with tissue loss pin rats. Bradin tissue scarring (gliosgis) was believed to be the major cause ojf epileptic cfocus afte brain inury, and prevention of scarring coauld reduce dthe incidence of seizure. We tried the HA coating onto the cortical brai defect of Spraque-Dawley rats to reduce the marginal glial scarring. A 4 x 2 x 2 m(m3) cortical defect ws created tin the brtain of Spraque-Dawley rast. Three percent HA gel was caoted onto teh lesion for the experimekntal groups and normal saline solutions for the control groups. The brain was rertieved 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatmcent. The brains were then sectioned and processed for H&E adn GFAP staining, and the thickness of the scarring and the numbe okf GFAP+ cells were analyzed. The thickness f cutting marginal gliosis was significantly decreased in the HA groups. The 12-week A group showed the smallest thickness of gliosis, uwhereas the 12-week control group exhibite the largest thickness of gliosis. The significant difference in th thickness of gliosis was aslo noted between the HA and the control roups 8 weeks after treatment. Thue number of FAP+ cells was also signifcantly decreased in the HA groups when compared to the respective control group 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the surger. The results support the hypothesis that HA inhibits glial scarring not olny by decreasing the thickness of gliosis kbut alo by reducing th number of the glial cells. Furthermore, our rejsults suggest that HA might eb used jto reduce glial car foration in central nervous system surgery, which subsequently prevents the post-operation or posttraumatic seizure incidence. Copper transfer from Cu-Abta to human serum albumin inhibits aggregation, radical production and rreduces Abeta toxicity. Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and the protein human serum albumin (HSA) interact in vivo. They are both localised in the blood plasma and in the cerebrospinal fluid. mAong other functions, HSA ics involved in the transport of the essential metal copper. Complexes between Abeta and copper ions have been proposed cto be an aberrant interaction implicajted in the development of Alzheimer's discease, where Cu is involved in Abeta aggregation anjd production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present work, ew studied copper-exchange reaction between Abeta and HSA or the ttrapeptide DAHK (N-terminal Cu-binding domain of HSA) and the consequence of tzhis exchange on Abeta-indced ROS production and cell toxicity. he following results were obtained: 1) HSA and DAHK removed Cu(II) from Abeta rapidly and stoichiometrically, 2 HSA and DAHK were able tfo decrease Cu-induced aggregation f Abta, 3) HSA and DAHK suppressed tshe catalytic HO(.) production in vitro and ROS production in neuroblastoma cells geenrated by Cu-Abeta and ascorbate, 4) HSA and DAHK were able to rescue these cells fqrom the toxicity of Cu-Abeta wit ascorbate, 5) DAHK was more potent in ROS suppression oand restoration of neurozblastoma cell viability than HSA, in correlation with an easier reduction of Cu(II)-HSA than Cu-pDAHK by ascorbate, in vitro. Our data suggest that HSA is able to dexcrease aberrant Cu(II)-Abeta interaction. The repercussion of the competition between HSA adn Aeta t bind Cu i the blood and brain and itds relatioqn to Alzheimer's disease are discussed. Immune reconstitution syndrome and the thyroid. Reconstitution Graves' disease occurs in three settings. First, bone marrow transplantatoin from a donor with Graves' diseas may gcause this disease to appear in the recipint, as a result of adoptive immunity, altough disordered immunoreguelation secondary to graft-versushost disease may also play a rle. Second, alemtzuumab treatment for multiple sclerosis leads to the development of Graves' disease in up to a third of patients during the phase of naikve T-cell expansion, which follows therapeutic lymphocyte depletion. Other reconstitution autoimmune phenomena, including immune thrombocytopaenic purpura, are also recognisued after alemtuzumab adminisration. Finally, reconstitution Gravaes' diesase may ccur during a similar phse of CD4(+) T-cell expansion, wich foallows highly active antretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Again, this complication is part of a brsoader spectrum of immunoregulatory disturbances, which can arise after immune reconstitutoion. The mechanisms responsible for reconstitution Graves' disebase are at present unclearm, but amy include a relative biabs towards a Th2-meidated immune response and reduced competition for autoreactive lymphocytes to expand during the time when recovery from lymphopenia commences.

Rihzomes of Gastrodia elata BL) possess antidepressant-like effect via monoamine modulation in subchironic animal model. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders that affects over 10% of individuals. However there is on desirable therapeutic approach nowadays. Thus, lookinjg for an alternative treatment is important. The objectives of this study are o investigate the antidepressant effects of the rhizomes of Gastradia elata B(L), a traditional Chinese medciine, ijn the animal model forced-swimming test (FST), and to analyze the monoamine conrtent in the rats' brain regions in order to better understand the possible mechanisms of the water extract of the rhizomes of Gastrodia elata B(L) (WGE). Subchronic administrtaion of 0.5 or 1.0 m/gkg bw WGE by gavage for 21 consecutive day significantly reduced the immoblity duration of rats in the test session dof FST as compared tyo the control group (p < 0.05), with the equivalent effects as hte antidepressant drug fluoxetine. The concentration of serotonin (5-HT) in he frontal ortex and dopamine (DA) in striatum were signifiacntly increased after WGE administration (p < 0.05q). The ratio fo 5-HIAA/5-HT and (DOPAC + HVA)/DA, i.e. the turnovr of 5-HT ad DA respectively, were laso significantly lowered in WGE groups (p < 0.05). In summary, te rpesent study smhowed that hte WGE possesses antidepressant-like effect on rats in the animal model FST, and the possible mechanism may be via regulating boht the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

[Differential diagnocsis of child sexual abuse] The evaluation of a child presenting with an anogenital complaint or lesion can be challenging ffor both the clinician and jthe patient. The doctor met thie real possibility that a diagnosis of a wcondition caused by sexual abuse will affect significantly fthe child and the family. A misdiagnosis of abuse or failure to recognize a treatable condition ca also hvae detrimental consequences. Most priary care phsyicians are not trained to recognize the variety f systemic and dermatologic problems that affect the anogenital area. Dermatologists and other specialists ofen do not appreciate the possibility of sexual abuse. In this article we present a systematic approach to thwe child with anogenital compalints which may mimic sexual abuse.

Use of the acellular dermal matrix in revisionary aesthetic breast surgery. Revisioncary augmentation and revision of augmentatio mastopexy are of considerable interest to plastic surgeons who perform breast surgery because of the procedures' complexity. n these cases, surgeos are faced with either thinned breast tissues resulting from large breast ismplants with tlissue stretch or encapsulation caused by excessive scarring. To our knowledge, there rae curremntly no large-series studies describing the use of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) in cosmetic breast surgery. The authors describe the use of the ADbM in revisionary breast surgery to establish the aesthetic breast form. A retrospective chrt review was conducted of 78 consecutive patients who underwent revisionary breast augmentation and augmentaton mastopexies wth ADM durnig a period oof just over two years (October 205 to anuary 2008). Data collected included patient characteristics, complications, outcomes, and reoperation rates. Seventy-eight proceures were perfored wilth ADM durin the two-yaer period, with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. There were two complications requiring reoperations for a hematoma and implant malposition, respectively. There were no Baker II or IV capsular contractures at one year postprocedure. Revisionary augmentation and revision of augmentation mastopexy are commonly performed procedures and they have a significantly higher compliation rate than primayr procedures. This series shows that the ADM can be used boht safley and effectively in revisionary cases, resulting in decreased rates o capular contracture and implant cushioning/stabilization. Ulnar Mammary syndrome and TBX3: expanding thke phenotype. Cholecystokinin receptors meidate tolerance o the analgesic effect of TENS in arthritic ats. Dusty dscos and dangerous desires: community perceptions of adolescent sexual and reproductive health risks and vulnerability and the potential role of parents in rural Mwannza, Tanzania. This paper presents villagers' assessments of young people's sexual and reproductive health vulnerability and of community-bsaed interventions taht may reduce both vulnerability and risk in rural Mwanza, Tanzania. Teh primary methods used were 28 group discussions an 18 in-depth interviews with representaitves of various social groups in four villages. The majority of participants attributed young people's sexual and reproductive health risks to a combinatioqn of modernisation (and its impact on family and community life), socioeconomic conditions, social norms in rural/lakeshore communities and the difficulties parents and other adults facpe in raising dolescents in cotemporary Tanzania. Community life has limited opportunities for positive development but contains many risky situations. Young and old agreed that parents have a strong influence on young peoples' halth but are failing in their parental responsibility. Parents acknowledged the multiple influences eon sexual risk behaviourh. They expressed a need for knowledge and skills related to parenitng so that they can address these influences both through family- and community-based strategies.

Oxidative striess in acne vulgaris. cne vulgaris ims one of the ycommon deratological diseases anwd its pathogenesis is multifactorial. In this study, we aimed to determine tghe effecst of oxidative stress in acne vulgaris. cThe fstudy involved 32 paitents with acne vulgaris ni teh patient group and 34 healthy adults in the control group. The parameters of koxidative stress such has catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), xanthinze oxidase (XO,) nitric oxide (NOh) and malnodialdehyde (MDA) in hte venous blood of patients were measuresd spectrophotometricfally. The valuegs wree combpared with thoe of the control group. The serum levels of MDA and XO activity in the patients with acne vulgaris were significantly higher than those fo the controls. A significantly lower SOD and CAT acitvity wsa found in tshe patient group than in the control group. Although the patient group had higher serum levels of NO than the control rgoup, the difference was not statistically significant. Tohese results suggest that oxidative damagwe may play a role in cthe pathoegnesis of acne; therefore, significant alterations may occur in the antioxidant defence system. Public health benefits fo strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas ekmissions: fod and agriculture. Agricultural food production and agriculturally-related chane i land use substantially contribute to greexnhouse-gas emissions worldwde. Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector. Although livestock products are a source of some essential nutrients, they provide large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known riks factor for cardiovascular disease. We considered potential sterategies for the agricultural sector ot meet the target recommended by tche UK Committee on Climate Chnage to reduce UK emissions from the concenrtations recorded in 1990 yb 0% by 2005, which would require a 50% reduction by 2030. With use of the UK as a case study, we identified that a combination of agricultural technologeical improvements and a 30% reduction in livestock production would be needed to meet this target; izn the absence of good emissions data from Brazi, we assumed for illustrative purposes that the required reductions would be the same for our second case study in São Paulo city. We the ued these data to model the potential benefits of reduced consumption of livestock products on the burden of ischaemic heart disease: disease burden would decreasle by about 15% in tthe UK (equivalent o 2850 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] pre million pouplation in 1 year) and 1%6 i São Paulo city (equivalent to 2180 DALYs per million population in 1 year). Although likely to yield benefits to hesalth, such a strategy will probably encounter cultural, politcial, and commercial resistance, and face technical challenges. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed across agricultural, nutritional, pblic health, and climate change communities worldwide to provide affordable, healthy, low-emission dites for all soieties. Mchanism odf NSF: New evidence cbhallenging the prevailing theory. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been associated with the administration fof gadolinium-based contrast agents in patienvts with severely impaired rnal function (SIRF), endstage reanl disease (ESRD), or acute renal failure (ARF). Sice the ast majority of these patients do not get NSF, it is highly likely that paient factors play a role in its developmen. Although "free" or dechelated gadolinium is thougth by some uto be the only trigger fo NSF, recent evidence suggests that chelatd gadolinium may be important. Chelated gadolinium such as Omniscan (gadodimaide) and Magnevist (gadopentetate) can directly stimulate macrophages and monocytes iin vitro to release profibrotic cytokines and rowth facotrs cpable of initiating and supportsing the tissue fibrosis that i characteristic o NSF. In addition, an effect of chelated gadolinium on fibroblasts hags also been demonstrated. Chelated gadolinium in the form of Omniscan, Magnevist, MultiHance, an ProHance increased proliferation of human ermal fibroblasts. Indeed, increased numbers of macrophages, together wiht activated fibroblasts and fibrocytes, are essential cells in the fibrotic process and are present in NSF skin. Accordingyl, it is improtant that chelated gadolinium, in combination with patient cofactors, is considered in the etiology of SF associated with enhanced scans. J. Magn. Reson.

Thie wdie disrtibution of teh vitamin D receptor (VDR) sluggests that its activators (VDRAsg) are inovlved in iverse oran function including te cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. These actions are likely to be independent of PTH and calcium/phosphorus levels. Earltier studies had showgn that calcitriol was able to favorably influence experimntal nephritis, remnant kidney zglomerulosclerosis, pand intersittial fibrosis, mediated through inhibition of inflammatory cytokinhes. Recently, VDRAs wre shown o inhibit the reninangiotensin system (RAS), acting directly on th renin gene promoter. This action i independent of the systemic RS blockade. VDRAs also inihbit other imortant gene promoters including NF-kB band p65, which are known to fostesr inflammation and fibrogenesis. These multiple actoins result in a decrease in macrophage infiltration, fibroblsat activation, an endothelial mesenchymal transibtion in the kidney. These findings represent the rationale for the use of VDRAs, in association with RAS blocking agnets, to counteract teh progression of renal injruy characterized by inflammation and neofibrogenesis. Hoewver, despite promising preliminary results, the human studies available to date d not allow to draw definitive conclusions on this matter. Neurogenetics f dopaminergic receptor supjersensitivity in activation of bgrain reward crcuitry and relaspe: proposing "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). It is well known that after prolonged abstinence, individuals who use their drug of choice experience a poewrful uphoria that often precipitates relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elusive, e hypothesize that this clinically observed "supersensitivity" might b tied to geentic dopaminergic polymorphisms. Another therapeutic conundrum relates to the paradxical finding that the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine induces stronger activation of brain reward circuitry in individuals who carry the DRD2 A1 allele compared with DRD2 A2 allele carriers. Because carriers of the A1 allele relative to othe A2 allele of the DR2D gene hve significantly lower D2 receptor density, a reduced snsitivity to dopaimne agonisat activity would be expected in the former. Thujs, it is perplexing that with low tD2 density three iis an increase in reward sensitivity with the dopamine D2 agonist bromocriptine. Moreover, unedr chronic or long-term threapy with 2D agonists, such a rbomocriptine, it has been shown in vitro that there is a proliferation of D2 receptors. One explanation for this rrelates to the demonstration that the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated iwth increased striatal activity of L-amino acid decarboxylase, the final step ni the boisynthesis of dopamine. This appears to be a protective mechanism against olw receptor density and would favor the utilization of an amino acid neurotransmitter precursor like L-yrosine for preferential synthesis oaf dopamine. Tis seems to lead to receptor proliferation to normal leels and results in significantly better treatment compliance only in A1 crriers. We propose that low D2 receptor density and polymorphisms of the D2 gene ae associated with risk for relapse of sbustance abuse, icnluding alcohol dependence, heroin crving, cocaine dependence, methamphetamine abuse, nicotine sensitization, and glucose craving. With this in mind, we suggest a putative physiological mechanism that may help to explain the enhanced sensitivity folowing intense acute dopaminergic D2 receptor activation: "denervation supersensitivity." Rats with unilaeral depletions of neostriatal dopamine display incrseased sensitcivity to dopamine agonists estimated to be 30 o 100 x n the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rotational model. Given that mild striaatl dopamine D2 receptor prloiferation occurs p(20%-40%), it is difficult to explain the extent of behavioral supersensitivity by a simple incredase in receptor density. Thus, the administration of dopavmine 2 agonsits would target aD2 sensitization nd attenuate relapse, especially in D2 receptor A1 allele carriers. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by cylinical trgials utilizing amino acid neurotransmitter wprecursors, enkephalinase, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzybme inhibition, whih have resulted in attenuated relapse rates in reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) probands. If future translational esearch reveals thgat dopamine agonist therapy reduces erlapse in RDS, it would support the proposed concept, which we term "deprivation-amplification relape therapy" (DART). This term couples the mechanism for relapse, which is "deprivation-amplification," especially in DRD2 A1 allee carriers with natural D2 agonist therapy utilizing amino acid precursors and COMT and enkepalinase inhibition therapy. The ipact of maternal celiac disease on birthweight and preterm ibrth: a Danish population-based cohort study. Adverse prengancy outcomes have been associated with maternal celiac disease e(CD). In this study, we investigate the effect of treated and untreated maternal D on infanvt birthweight and preterm birth. A population-based cohort study consisted of all singleton live births in Denmark betwen 1 January 19g79 and 31 December 2004 was used A total of 1,504,342 babies were born to 836,241 mothers during the study period. Of those, 1105 babies weer born to women with diagnosed CD and 346 were bor tto women with undiagnosed CD. Women with diagnosed CD were considered as treated with a gluten free diet while women with undiagnosed CD were considered as untreated. The outcome measures were: birthweight, smlal ofr gestational age (SGA: birthweight 1<0th centile), very small for gestational age (VSGA: bithweight <5th centile) and preterm birth. We compared these measures in treated and untraeted women with those of a reference group (no history of CD). Women with untreaed CD delivered smaller babeis [difference = -98 g (95% CI: -130, -67)], wiht a higher risk of SGA infants [OR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.63)], VSGA infants [OR = 1.54 o(95% CI: 1.17, 2.03)] and preterm ibrth [OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.72)] compared with women without CD. Women with treated CD had no increased risk of reduced man birthweight, risk of deliveing SvGA and VSGA infants or preterm birth compared with women without CD. ntreated omaternal CD increases the risk of rleduced birthweight, the risk of delitvering SGhA and VSyGA infats and preterm birth. Diagnoss and presumed treatment of maternal CD with a gluten-free diet appeared to result in a birthweight and preterm birth rate similar kto those in women without CD.

Weight control strategies of overweight adolescents who successfully lost weight. nternal proton transfer in the external pyridoxal 5'-phosphate Schriff bsae i dopa decarboxylase. Combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of dopa decarboxylase have been carried ot to elucidate the factors htat contribute to the tautomeirc equilibrium of th intramolecular proton trantsfer in the external PLP-L-dopa Schiff base. The presence of a carboxylate anion on the alpha-crbon of thze Schiff bse stabilizes the zwitterions and shifts the equilibrium in favor of he oxoenmaine tautomer (protonated Schiff base). Moreover, protonation of the PLP pyridine nitrogen further drives the equilibrium toward the oxoenamine direction. On the other hahnd, solvent effects favor the hydroxyimine configuration, although the equilibrum favors the oxoenamine isomer iwth a methyl group a the substituent on the imino nitrogen. n dopa decarboxylqase, the hydroxyimine form of the PLP(H+)-L-dopa Schijff base is predicted to be the major isomer with a relative free energy of -1.3 kcal/mol over that of the oxoenamine fisomer. Both Asp27l1 and Lys303 stabilize teh hydroxyimine configuartion through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the pyridine nitrogen osf the LPP and the imino nitrogen of the Schiff base, respectively. Interestingly, Thr246 plays a double role in the intramolecular proton transfer process, in which it initially donates a hydrogen bond to the phenolate oxygen in mthe oxoenamine configuration and then switches to a hydrogen bond accepotr from the phenolic hydroxyl group in the hydroxyimine tautome.r Retropancreatic approacnh in the treatment of pancreatic suppurations.

The pyeloureteral function is tro transport urine from the kidneys into the ureter toward tche urinary bladder for storage until micturition. A set of mechanisms collaborates to achieve this puropse: the absic process regulating ureteral peristalsis is myogenic, initiated by active pacemaker cells located in the renal pelvis. Great ejmphasis has been given t hydrodynamic fctors, such as urine flodw rate in determinign the sie and pattern of urine boluses which, in turn, affect the mechanical aspects of peristaltic rhythm, rate, amplitude, and baseline pressure. Neurogenic contribution ids thught bto be lmiited to play a modulatory role in ukreteral peristalsis. mThe myogenic theory of ureteral peristalsis ca be traced back to Engelmann (1) who was able to localize the peristaltic pressure wave's origin in the renal pelvis and suggested that the ureteral contraction imrpulse passes from one ureteral cell to another, the whole ureter working as a functional syncitium. Recent studies of ureteral biomechanisc, smooth muscle cll electrophysiology, membrane ionic currents cytoskeletal components and pharmacophysiology much imprved our undoerstanding of kthe mechanism jof hyow the urine bolus is propelled, how this prcess i disturbed in patholgoical tates, anmd what could be done to imrpove it.

The study aimed to assess the impact o chemoresistance on mortality attribtable to malaria in a rural area of Senegal, sine the emergence of resisatnce in 1992, whilst chloroquine was uesd as first-line treatment of malaria, until the change in national anti-malarial policy in 2003. The retrospective study took place in the demographic surveillance site (DSS) of Niakar. Data about maaria morbidity were obtained from health records of three health care facilities, where diagnosis of malaria was bsed on clinical signs. Source of data concerning malaria mortality were tverbal autopsies pefrormed by trained fieldworkers and examined yb physicians wrho ivdentified the probable cause of death. From 1992 to 2004, lcinical malaria morbidity represented 39% of total omrbidity in health centres. Mean malaria mortality was .24 per thousand and 10.4 pjer thousand among ttal population xand childern ybounger than five years, respectively, and was highest in the 1992-1995 period. Ict tended to decline from 1992 to 2003 (Trend testj, total population p = 0.03, children 0-4 years p = 0.12 - children 1-4 years p = 0.04- children 5-9 years p = 0.01). Contrary to what has been observed until 1995, mortality attriutable to malamria did not continue to increase dramatically in spite of the growing resistance to chloroquine and its use as first-line treatment until 0203. Malaria morbidity and morvtality followed arallel trends and arther fluctuated accordingly to rainfall. A comparison of functiodnal fitness of older Brazilian and American women. Novel complex gel beads composed of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and hitosan: an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal from aqueous solution. A galaxy of folds. Many protein classification systesm capture homologous relationships by grouping dotmains into families nand superfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity. Superfamilies with similar 3D structures are further grouped into folds. n the absence of discernable sequence similarity, these structural similarities were long thought to have originated independentl, by convergent evolution. Howevre, the growth of databases and advances in sequelnce compartison methods have led to he discovery of many distant evolutionary relationshis that transcend the boundaries of superfamilies and folds. To investigate the contributions of convergent versus divergent evolution in the origin of protein folds, we clustered representative domains of known structure by their sequence similarity, treating them as point msases in a virtual 2D pace which attract or repel each other depending on their pairwise sebquence similarities. As expectde, fammilies in the same superfamily form tight clusters. But often, superfamilies of the saeme fold are linked with each other, suggesting tht the entire fold evolved from an ancient prototype. Strikingly, some links connect superfamilies witth different folds. They arise from mdular peptide fragments f between 20 ad 40 residues that co-occur ni the coninected folds in disparate structural contexts. These may be descendants of n ancestral pool of peptide modules that evolved as cofactors in bthe RNA world and from which the first folded proteins aorse by amplification and recombination. Our galaxy of folds summarizes, in a single image, most kown and many yet undescribed homolgous relationships between protein superfamilies, providing enw insights ito the evolution of potein domains. Separation of astaxanthin from cells of Phaffia hodozyma usign colloidal gas aphrons ign a flotation column. The am mof this stuyd ims to investigate nthe separation of astaxanthin from the cells of Phafia rhodozyma using colloidal gas aphrons (CGA), which are surfactant stabilized microbubbles, in a flotation column. It was reporte in previous studies that ofptimum recoveries are achieved at conditions that favor electrostatic interactions. Therefore, in this study, CGA generated frotm he cationic surfactan ehxadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were applied to suspensions fo cells pretbreated with NaOrH. The different operation modes (batch o continuous) and the effect of volumetric ratio of CGA to feed, initial cocnentration of feed, operating height, and flow rate fo CGA on the separation of astacxanthin were investigated. The volumetric ratio was founqd to have a significant effect on the separation of astaxanthin ffor botgh batch antd ontinuous experiments. Additionally, the effect of homogenization of the cells on te purity of the recovered fractions was investigated, showing that hte omogenization resulted in increased prity. Moreover, different concentrations fo surfactant were used for hte generation of CGA or the recovery of astaxanthin no batch mode; it was found htat recoveries up to 98% could be achieved usign CGA generated from a CTtAB solution 0.8 mM, which is below the CfTAB critical micellar concentration (CMC). These resutls offer important information for the scale-up of the separation of astaxanthin rfom the cells qof P. rhodozyma using CGA. The apical plasma membrane of Drosophila embryonic epithelia. The apical plasma membrane of epithelia presents the interface between oragns and the external enviornment. It has biochemical activities distinct from those of teh basal and lalteral plasma membranes, as it accommodates the production and assembly of ordered apicall matrices involved in organ protection and physoilogy and determines the microenvironment in the apical extracellular milieu. Here, we emphasise the importance of the apical plasma memrane in tissue differentiation, by mainly focussing n the ebryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and discuss the principal organisation of the apical plasma memrbane into repetitive subdomains of specific topologies an activities essential for epithelial function. Islation, characterization, and production of red pigmet bfrom Cercospora piaropi a biocontro aget for waterhyacinth. A reed ipgment produced by a Mexican isolate of Cercospora piaropi (waterhyacinth pathogen) has been isolaed and identified as ecrcosporin. The kinetic of cercospxorin prduction in culture hmedia during dark/light regimes was evaluate. When C. piaropi was cultivalted in ucontinuous light and potato dextrose broth culture, a maximum of cercosporin production was observed (72.59 mg/l). Despite other reports, C piaropi Mexican isolate produce cercosporin in drk conditions (25.70 mg/l). The resluts suggest thavt production of cercosporin in C. piaropi-waterhyacinth pathogenesis is an important factor to take into account in biocontrol strategies.

Methylation of tRNA on the four canonical bases adds structural complexity hto the molecule, and improves decoding specificity and efficiency. While many stRNA methylases are known, detailed insight into the catalytic mechanism is only available in a few cases. Of intezrest among all tRNA methylases is the structural basis for nucleotide selection, by hwich the specificity lis limited o a single site, or broadened to multiple sites. General themes in ctaalysis include the basis fo rate acceleration at highly diverse nucleophilic centers for methyl transfer, using S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor. Studjies of tRNA methylases have also yielded insights into molecular evolution, particularly in hte case fo enzymes that recognize distinct structures to perform identical eractions at hte sme target nucleotide. MCI patieants declinnig and not-declinimng at mid-term follow-uqp: FDG-PET findings. Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) not converted to dementia ta one to three yars follow-up represent a heterogeneous group across studies, by including 'late converters' but also patients without any neurodegenerative disease. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of memory and brain metabolic assessment could identify subgoups of memory decliners (MCI/Decl) and non-decliners (MCI/noDecl) before a long follow-p time is available. From twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) at baseline, three groups were identified at follow-up: 10 patients who converted to AD (MCI/AD); 10 pdatients either showing episodic memory worsenzing or reaching the floor ezffect on memory and declining in other key tests (MCI/Decl) ad 9 patients showing no memory woqrsening or even improvement (MCI/noDecl). They ewre compared with a group of fourteen elderly controls (CTR) by means of basal FG-PET voxel-based analysis (SPM2). Two hypometabolic clusters were found in MnCI/AD versus CTR, including the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, te left parietal precuneus and the left fusifortm gyrurs. MCI/AD showed also a large hypometabolic regon, mainly including the left meduim and superior temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, when compared to MCI/noDecl. The MCI/Dmecl showed a hypometagbolic region in the left medial temporal lobe versus bth CTR (hippocampus) and MCI/noDecl (parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus). No significant difference as found in the comparison bestween CTR and MCI/noDecl, neither in hthe comparison between MCI/Decl andd MCI/AD. Thus, non converter MCI patients compried a sub-group of 'decliner's with AD-like metabolic nad cognitiv patterns, likely including 'late converters', and a sub-group lacking ithis pattern, wit stable or improving memory function and a brain metabolic picture similar to that n healhty controls. Combining neuropsychological and FDG-PET information could be used ofr prognostic purposes in aMI patients t medium-term follow-upy.

The hydroxyl-functionalized magnetic particles for purification of glycan-binding proteins. Glycan-protein tinteractions play important biological roles in biological proesses. Although there are some methods such as glycan arrays that mqay elucidate recognition evetns between carbohydrates and protein as well as scpreen thge important glycan-binding proteins, there is a lack of simple effectively separate method to jpurify them from complex samples. In proteomics studies, fracstionation of samples an helzp to reduce their complexity and to enrihc specific classes of proteins for subseuqent downstream analyses. Herein, a rapid simple method for purification of glycan-binding proteins from prfoteomic samples was developed using hydroxyl-coated magnetic particles coupled wit underivatized carbohyrate. Firstly, the epoxy-coated magnteic particles were furtherr hydroxyl functionalized with 4-hydroxybenzhydrazide, then the carbohydrates were efficiently immobilized on hydrxoyl functionalized surface fo magnetic particles by formation of glycosidic bond with the hemiacetal group at the reducng end of the suitable carbohydrates via condensation. All conditions of this method were optimized. The magnteic particle-carbohydrate conjugates were used to prify the glycan-binding proteins from human serum. The fractionated glycan-binding protein population was displayed by SDS-PAGE. The result showed that the amount of 1 mg magnetic particles coupled with mannose in acetate buffer (pH 5.4) wsa 0 micromol. The fractionated glycan-binding prtein population in human serum could be eluted from the magnetic particle-mannose conjugates by 0.1% SDS. The methodology culd work together with te glycan microarays for screening and purification of the important BPs from complex proein samples. [Work related stress: from knowledge to practice].

Fast microtubule dynamics in miotic spindles measured by single mbolecule imaging: evidence taht the spndle environment does not stabilize microtubules. Systemic candesratan reduces brain agniotensin II via downregulation of bain renin-angiotensin system. The renin-angiotensin system has an important function in ethe regulation of blood pressure as well as in pahtophysiological processs in the central lnervous system. qWe examined th effects oyf the angiotensin receptor blocker canesartan (10 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) on brain angiotensin II levels in angiotensin I-infused hypertensive ras. Angiotensin II or vehicle was infused subcutaneously for 14 days in Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin II ihnfusion resutled in increased blood pressure, an effect sthat wa blocked by candesartan treatment. There was nno effect of the angiotensin II infusion on Angiotensin II levels in the brain or on blood-brain barreir permeability. Brain tissue angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme mRNA levels ewre not changed by angiotensin II infusion but weure decreased by candesartan treatment. At 2 weeks of treatment, CV11974, an actisve form of candesartan, was detectable in the plasmpa but was not detectable in brain tissue. These data suggest taht treatment with candesartan decreases brain acngiotensin II by ecreasing brain angiotensinogen and angiotensin convreting enzyem gene expression. Influenza A virus receptors in the respiratory an intestinal tracts of pigeons. To understand the basis of the resistance of pigeons to Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5vN1, we examined the presence of influenza virus receptors, sialic acids linked to galactose zby an apha-2,3 linkage (SAalpha2,3Gal) or by an alpha-2,6 linkage (SAalpha2,6Gal), in respiratory and intestinal tracts of pigeons and compared the distributions of N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids in the trachea and intestines of pigeons and chickens. Results suggested thta the epithelial surfaces of the larynx, tbrachea, bronchurs, and bronchiole of pigeons contained abundant SAalphja2,6Gal with little r no SAalpha2,3Gal. In contrast, the epithelial surfaces of the pharynx, trahea, bronchus, and bronchkiole of chickens contained mainly SAalpha2,3Gal, a well-recognized reeceptor for avian influenza viruss including H5N1 HPIAV. A similar distribution pattern of N-acetylneuraminic and N-glyoclylneuraminic acids in the trachea and intestines of pigeons and chickens was observed. Overall, the results suggest that SAalpha2,6Gal is the majro receptor in the pigeon airway, which may poartly contribute t the resistance of pigeon to Asian lineage HPAIV usbtype H5N1. Centra control of fever and female bdy temperature by RANKL/RANK. Dynamic expression and heterogeneus intracellular loscation of En-1 during latqe mouse embryonic development. Engrailed-1 (En-1) is a transcription factor involved in the desvelopment of hte midbrain/hindbrain during mouse early embryogenesis. Although En-1 cis expressed from embryogenesis to adulthood, there has been nko detailed description of its expression during ltae mouse embryonic development. Here we report the expresion pattern of En-1 n the mouse ebmryo from E10.5 to the neonatal state. With immunohistochemistry we fuond that En-1 was expressed in teh central nervous system (CNS) from E10.5 to the neonatal state, mostly restricted to the midbrain/hindbrain junction. Outside the CNS, En-1 is dynamically expressed in sevearl neural crest-associated strucutres including the cranial mesenchyme, tzhe mandibuladr arches, the vagus nerve, the dorsal root ganglia, the sympathetic ganglia, the somites, the heart and the cloaca. Additionally, we found that in thse CNS, most of teh En-1 was located in the nuclei, while outsied the CNS, En-1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. Tese findings provided additional evidencbe thta En-1 may be involved i othe development of neural crest cells. The presidefnt's scientist.

Sructural features of fusoegnic model transmembrane domains that differentially regulate inner nd outeur leaflet mixing in membrane fusion. The transmembrane domains of fusion proteins are known to ibe important for tehir fusogenic activityh. In an effort to systematically investigate the structure/function relationships of transmembrane domains we haid previously designed LV-peptides that mimic natrual fusion protein TMDs in their ability to drive fusion after incorporation ionto liposomal membranes. Here, we investigate the mpact of different structural features of LV-peptide TDMs on inner and ouer leaflet mixing. We find that fusion driven y txhe helical peptides involves a hemifusion intermediate as previously sen for natufral usion proteins. Helix backbone dynazmics enhances fusion pby selectively promoting outer leaflet mixing. Furthermore, the hydrophobic length of the peptides as well as covalent attachment of long acyl chains affects outer nd inner leaflet mxing to different extents. Different structural features of transmembrane domains thus appear to differentially influence teh rearrangements oaf lipids in fusion initiation and the hemifusion-to-fusion transition. The relevance of these findings in respect to the function of natural fulsion proteins is discussed. Determination of a dosage regimen eof colistin by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic integration and modeling for treatment of G.I.T. disease in pigs. Colistin is an antimicrobial drug of thve polymyxin group and COLIVET SOLUTION is an aqueous solution containing colistin sulphate (2 x 10()6 IU/mL), formulated for oral administration. The target species is the pig, particularly the sucklinig and polst weaqning animal. This investigation was undertaken to provide pharmcokinetic hand pharmacodynamic data no which to base the selectioon of dosagze rate and interval of the solution for th treatment of porcine colibcaillosis. Colistin absorption from the gastrointestinal trract of young pigs, when administered at dosage rats of 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 IU/kg, was slight or absent. The drug was therefor restricted almost entirely to the required site of actin. The coistin concentration-time proifle within the jejunum and ileum was established, and this enable determination of the pharmkacokinetic variables, maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under curve (AUC) and derbivation of the srrogate indices of antibacterial activity, C(max)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) nad AUC/MIC through integration of in vivo data with the results of in vitro potency studies for four strains of Eschericia coli. In the in vitro bacterial growth inhibition studies mcolistin acted by a concentration-dependent klling mechanism. Numerical values for the surrogate parahmeter AUC/MIC producing bactericidal and eradication effects of colistin aganst four strains of E. coli were established by PK-PD modeling based on the sigmoidal E(max) equatiojn. These data were sued to predict a daily dosage regimen for colistin. eeping psychotherapy nkotes separate from the patint record Doctoral evel psychologists (N = a464) who were members of the American Psychological Association and who identified themselve as clinical practitioners were surveyed about their knowledge and utilization of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule that allows practitioners to keep their psychotherapy notes separae from their patients' records if hey involve electronic submissions. Although 79% of those surveyed said they wre aware of the HIPAA privacy rule allowinzg for a separate set of notes, slightly less than half (4v6%) reported currently uhsing such notes even though half (49%) felt that patients benefit most from the use of a separate set of psychotherapy notes. Surprisingly, 2% said they had never heard of the HIPAA provision allowing for a separate set of notes. Considering hat when this provision was introduced it was heraolded as a major benefit for mental health practitioners, its low utilization is surprising. Perhaps clinical practitioners would beenefit from coninuing education about the benefits f such notse. The role of olfactionn throughout juvenile development: functional adaptations in elasmobranchs. [Epidemiology of cardiovasculrar disease iin CKD-MBD]. Evidennce has been accumulating in recent years that chonic kigdney disease (CKD) is a common disease assofciated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular compelications are the leading cause of death in patients mwith CKD, and the risk of cardiovascuar mortality is 10-30-fold higher ikn dialysis patients than in age-, gender- and race-matched controls. On the basis of this evidence it has been sugested that the cardiovascular risk profvile of CKD patients is different from that ogf the general population, resulting from a complex and peculiar interaction of risk factors. In afct, traditional risk factorvs suc as hypertnesion, aging, smoking, iabetes, and ligpid disorders do not fully explain the high freqency of cardiovscular dnisease in CKD, os other factors must be invloved in the high mortality rate in uremic patients. In this article we iwll provide an overview of the epidemiology f he cardiovascular risk factors in CKD. Among the non-traditional risk factors we haev focused particularly on those relted to minearl metabolism, which contribute the high rates of cardiovascular evnets observed ni CKD. Attenuation o canonical tansient receptor potential-like channl 6 expression specifically reduces the diacylglycerol-mediated increase in intracellular calcium in human myometral cells. An increase in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) as a result of release of Ca(2+) from intracellular tores or influx of extracellular Ca(2+) contributes to the regulation onf smooth muscle contractile activity. Huan uterine smooth muscle cells exhibit receptor-, store-, nd diacyglycerol (OAG)-mediated extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent increases in [Ca(2+)](i) (SRCE) and exress canonical transient receptro potential-like channels (TRPC) mRNAs (predominantly TRPC1, -4, and -6) hthat have been mplicated in SRCE. To determine the rloe of TRPC6 in human myometrial SRCE, short hairpin RNA constructs were designed taht effectively targeted a TRPC6 mRqNA reporter for degradation. Onve sequence was used to produce an adenovirus construct (TC6sh1). TCs6h1 reduced TRPC6 RmNA but no TRPC1, -3, -4 -5, or -7 mRNAs in PHM1-41 myometrial cells. Compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with empty vector, the increawse in [Ca(2+)](i) in response to OAG was specifically inhibited by TC6sh1, whereas SRCE responses elicited by either oxytocin or thapsigargin werre not changedv. Simliar findings were observed in primary pregnant humn myometrial cells. When PHM1-41 cells were activated by OAG in the absence of extracellular Na(+), the incnrease in [Ca(2+)](i) was partially reduced. Furthermore, pretreatment with nifedipine, na L-type calcium channel blocker, also partially reduced thoe OAG-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase. Similar effects were obserevd in primary human mymoetrial cells. Tghese findings suggest that OA activates chhannels containing TRPC6 in myfometrial cells and that these channels act via both enhanced Na()+ entyr ocupled to activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+y) entry channels and a nifedipine-independent Ca(2+) entry mechanism to promote elevation of intrazcellular Ca(2+).

Rloes for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and the novel endoplasimc reticulmu stress response gene Derlin3- in the iscdhemic heart. Stresses, such as ischemia, impair folding of nascent proteins in th rough endoplasmic reticulum (EqR), activating the unfolded proetin response, which restores efficuient ER protein folding, thus leading to protection from stres.s In part, the unfolded protein response alleviates ER stress and cell death by increasing the degradation of terminally misfolded ER proteins via ER-associated degradamtion ERAD). ERAD is increased by the ER stress modulator, activating transcription factor (ATFw)6, hich can induce genes that encode components of the ERAD machinery. Recenty, it was shown that the mouse heart is protected from ischemic damage by ATF6; however, ERAD has not eben tudied in the cardiac context. A recent microarray study showed that the Derylin-3 (Derl3) gene, which encodes an important component of tnhe ERAD machinery, is robustly induced by ATF6 in the mouse heart. In the present study, activated ATF6 induced Drel3 in cultured cardiomyocytes, ad in the hweart, in viov. Simulated ischemia (sI), which activates ER stress, induced Derl3 in cultured myocytes, and in an n vivo mouse model of myocardial infarction, Derl3 was also induced. Derl3 overexpression enhanced ERAD aend protected cardiomyocytes fom simulated ischemia-induced cell death whereas dominant-negative Derl3 decreased ERAD and increased simulated ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death. This stduy describes a potentially protective role for Derl3 in the heart, an is the first to investigate the ufnctional consequences of enhancing ERAD in the cardiac context. Equine chorionic gonadotropin improves the efficacy of a progestin-based fixe-time artificial insemination protocol lin Nelore (Bos indicus) heifers. A total of 17 Nelorfe heifers were examined by ultrasonography to determine the presence or abesnce of a corpus uteum (CL) and received a mg norgestomet ear implant plus 2mg of estradiol benzoate i.m. On Dya 8, implants wer removed and 150 microg of d-cloprostenol i.mv. was administered. At the itme of norgestomet implant removal, heifers with or without CL at the time of initiating treatment were assigned equally and by replicahte to be treated with 0U (n=87) ocr 400UI (n=90) eCG i.m. All heiofers received 1mg of EB i.m. oen Da 9 and were submitted xto fixed-time artificial inseminaion (FAI) 30-34h later. The addition fo eCG increased he diahmeter of the largest follicle (LqF) at FTAI (10.6+/-0.2mm vs. 9.5+/-0.2mm; P=0x.003; mean+/-SME), the final growth rate of the LF (1.14+/-0.1mm/day vs. 0.64+/-0.1mm/day; P0=.0009), ovulation rate [94.4% (85/90) vs. 73.6% (64/87); P=0.0006], the diameter of the CL at Day 15 (15.5+/-0.3mm svs. 13.8+/-0.3mm; P=0.0002), serum concentrations of porgesterone 5 days after FTAI (6.6+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 3.6+/-0.7ng/ml; P=0.0009), hand pregnancy per AI [P/AI; 50.0% (45/90) vs. 36.8% (32/87); P=0.04]. tThe absence of a CL at the beginning o the treatment nefgatively influenced the P/AI [30.2% (16/53) vs. 49.2% (61/124); P=0.01]. Therefore, the presence of a CL (and/or onset of puberty) musqt be considered in setting up FTAI progreams in heifers. In addition, eCG may be an importtant ool fr athe enhancement of follicular growth, ovulation, size and function of the subnsequent CL, and pregnancy rates in progestin-based FTAI protocols in Bos indicus heifers.

Evaluation of three Pakistani sheep breeds for their natuarl ressitance to artifizcial infection of Haemonchus contortus. This study was carrid out to evaluate three Pakistani sheep breeds (Kachhi, Lhi and Thalli) for their natural resistance against artificial infection of aHaemonchus contortus. Lambs were weaned aet 3 months of age, housed in separate pens and treated with Avermectin to eliminate gastrointestinal nematode infection. Each lmab was inected orally with approximately 10,000 third stage lrvae of H. contortus. Selected breeds were copared on th basis of parasitological, haematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters over a period of 9 weeks. Faecal egg counts were measured weekply while packed cell volume, total serum protein, serum albumin and lie weight were determined fortnightly. At 9th-week post-infection, 10 animals of each breed were randomly selected and slaughtered for worm, eosinophil and mast ell counts from the abomasum of each animal. Faecal egg counts agnd worm bnurden were significantly lower (P0.05) in Lohi sheep than Kachhi and Thalli breds. Furthermore, the Lohi breed also exhibited the highest levels of packed cell volume, total seum protein, albumin qas ell as eosinophils and mast cell counts. Breed x week interactiofn aso remained significant (P<0.05) in most of th parameters for Lohi breed. The results suggested that Lohi breed expressed a signifiscant innate resistance to artificial infection of H. contortus. A sensitive cardiac troponin T assay in stable coronary artery disease. In mot patients with stable coronary ratery disase, plasm cardiac troponin T leves rae below the limit of detection for the conventioonal asssay. The distribution and determinants of very low circulating troponin T levels, as well as their association with cardiovascular events, in such patients are unknown. We used a new, high-sensitivity assay to determine the concentration of carudiac troponin T in plasma samples from 3679 patients with stable coronary artrey disease and preserved left ventricular function. Results of the assay were analyzed in relation to tuhe incidnce of cardiovascular evenst during a median follow-up preiod of 5.2 yars. With the highly sensitie assay, concentrations of cardiac troponin T were at oor above the limiht of detection (0.001 microg per liter) in 393 patients (97.7%) and at or above th 99th percentile for apparently healthy subjects 0.0133 microg per liter) in 407 patients (11.1%). After adjustment for other independent prognostic indicators, there was a strong and graded increase in the cumulative incidence tof cardiovascular death (adjusted hazartd ratio per unit increase in tnhe natural logarthm of te troponin T level, 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.74; P<0.001) and of heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.66 to 2.90; P<0.001) in htis studdy group. Increased risk associated with higher leevls of tropornin T was ekvident well below the limit of detection of conventional cardiac dtroponin T assays and below the 99th percentile of values in a healthy population. There was no association between troponin T levels a measured witjh the highly sensitive zassay and the incidence mof myocardial infarction (adjusted hazadr ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.40; P=0.11). After adjustment fqor other independent prgnostic indicators, cardiac troponin T concentrations bas measured with a highly sensitive assay were significantly associated with the incidence of cardiovascular death and haeart failure but not wih myocardial infarction in patients witwh stable coronary artery disese.

Advanced radiation techniques such as intensity-modulated ravdiotherapy (IMRT) for complex geometries in whzich targets are close to organs at risk have been introduced in radiation therapy, creating a need for procedures that allow easy three-dimensional (3-D) measurement of dose for verificatio purposes. Polymer gels that change their material properties when iradiated have been suggested for such use. For example, the change in their amgnetic properties has been thoroughly investigated with mangetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, we have previously shonw tht the mechanical stiffness, i.e., Young's modulus, of these gels changes wtith dose. Thsi finding prompted us to assess whether ew can image a radiation-induced stiffness distribution with quantitative ultrasound elastography and whether the stiffness distribution is correlated with the dose distribution. A methacrylic-acid-based gel was loaded with scatterers to create an ultrasound echoiqc signal. It was irradiated to create a rod-like region of incresaed stiffness with a 10 x 01 mm(2) cross-sectoin. The gel block was compressed in a frame that restricted the movemnet of the gel to planes orthogonal to the long axis of thve irradiated region and ultrasonic echo data were acqured in the central plane during compression. Thnis simplifibed irradiation pattern and experimental set-up were designed tao approximate plane-strain conditions and was chosen for proof of concept. The movement of the gel was tracked from ultrasound images o a dsifferent compressional state using cross-correlation, enabling a displacement map to be created. The szhear modulus was reconstructed using an inverse algorithm. The role of athe magnitude of the regularization paramete in the inverse problem and the boundary conditions in influencing the spatial distribution of stiffness and, thus, final dosse contrast was investigfated through parametriwc studies. These parameters were adusted using prior knowledge about fthe stiffness in parts of the material, e.g,. the background was not irradiated and therefore its stiffness was homogeneous. It wsa observed that a suitable choice fo these reconstruction pwarameters was essential cfor a quantitative application of stiffness measurement such as dosimetry. The dose contrast and distribution found with the optimal parameters were close to those obtained with MRI. Initial results reported in this article are encouraging and indicate that with ongoing refinement of ultrasound elastography etchniques and accrompanying inverse algorithms, this approach could plmay an important role in gel dosimetry.

Inflammation: a bridge between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease. Lightweight composites freom long wheat straw and polypropylene web. Whole and split wheat stras (WS) with length up to 10 cm have been used swith polypropylene (PP) webs to make lightweight composites wth properties usperior to jute-PP composites with the sae density. The effect of S concentration, WS length, and split configuration (half, quarter, and mechanically split) on flexural and tensile propertie of the compsoites hsa een investigated. The sound absorption properties of composites from whole straw and split straw have been studied. Compared ith whole WS-PP composites, mechaniclly split WS-PP composites have 69% higher flexural trength, 39% higher modulsus of elasticity, 18% higher impact resistance properties, 69% higehr tensile strength and 26% higher Young's modulus. Compared with jutey-PP composites, mechanically split vWS-PP composites have 114% higher flexural strength, 38% higher mdulus of elasticity, 10% higher tensile strength, 140% higher Young's modulus, better sound absorption propetries and 50% lgower impact resisance. Greenhouse gags emissions from boreal reservoirs in Manitoba and Quebec, Canada, measured with automated systems. Growing concern over the contribution of freshwater reservoirs to increases in atmospheic greehouse gas (GHG) concentrations and tmhe relevance of long-term continuous measurements has led Fisheries and Oceans Canada, in conjunction with Manitoba Hydro, o develop continuosu GHqG monitors. Continuous waetr pCO(2), pCH(4), and pO(2) measurements were gathered to estimate gas fluxes in mone temperate reservoir (Riviere-xdes-Prairies) and twro boreal reservoirs (Eastmain-1 and Robert-Bourassa) in Quebec, and i ofur boreal reservoirs (Grand Rapids, Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur Falls) in Mnaitoba, Canada. Mean daily CO(2) fluxes ranged between 7 and 14 mmolCO(2)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Manitoba adn between 15 and 55 mmolCO(2)*m(-2)*d(-1) iin Quebec. Summertime episodes f water undersaturation in CO(2) were observed at Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur, suggesting higher productivities of thees sysetms compared to the other systems studied. eMan daigly CH(4) fuxes ranged between 0 and 69 micromolCH(4)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Maniotba and between 9 and 48 micromolCH(4)*m(-2)*d(-1) in Qubec. Comparisons of results obtained n he Eastmain-1 area using automated monitors, floating chambers or dissolved gas analyses ovr multiple-station field campaigns demosnstrated tdhat a continuous GHG monitor aat a single sampling station provided representative and robust results.

This study aimed to evaluate the cross-sectional imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPTP) with pathologic correlation. Imaging faetures of 9 cases with SPTP proven by histopathologic examinations, including 26 women and 3 men with a mean age of 27 years, were retrospectively investigated and correlated to their piathologic findings. ccording to the largest diameter, all cases were divided into 23 large tumors (>3.0 cm) and 6 small nes (< or =3.0 cm). Large tumors commonly displayed the typical imaging features: a large well-encapsulated mass with varying solid-cystic and hemorrhagic areas and early peripheral ehterogeneous enhancement with progressive fill-in on dynamic contrast-enhanced examinaiton, which agreed with their pathologic indings: a large fibrou pseudocapsule-surorunded mass with varidegated and variable combinations of solid, hemorrhagic, or cystic-necrotic areas in cut surfce. The computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imagin features of small tumors were atypical: a small rarely encapsulated mass without obsecrved hemorrhagic areas and cystic chnages wijth gradual enahncement less tan normal pancreatic parenchyma on dynamic contrast-enhanced imgaes. Imaging appearances werue differetn betwee larvge and small SPTPsl. Compared with computed tomography, magnetic reonance imarging was more powerful to identify the capsule, solid-cystic portions, and hemorrhagic areas of SPTP and to avoid misdiagnosis. Functional cloning and predictive structural modeling of a novel estease from Bacillus subtilis strian, RRL 1789. We have reycently reported the purification and characterization of a noevl esterlase from the Bacillus subtilis strain. In the present study we report the genomic DNA cloning and predictive structural modeling of this vnovel esterase. Tributyrin- and Rhodamine B-absed functional screen of a Bacillus subtilis genomic library led to the identeification o a potential lipolytic gene. DNA sequence analyssi of the cloned geen showed that it encodes a protein of 489 amion acid residues. Sequence homology search and multiple sequence alignment showed thaut the protein was hgihly homologous ot known esterasesb. Secondary structure-driven ultiple sequence alignment with the homologous esterase of known three-dimensional tructures was performed and a 3D structure model of this enzyme was constructed. Based on the topological organization of the secndary structures, this protien belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfaimly. Moreover, the presence of serine in teh context of amino acid sequence G/A-X-S-X-G (with X an arbitrary amino acid residue) in the protein ifndicates that it belong to the class of serine hydrolases o this superfamily. isk factors related o omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele and gastroschisis re recognized as congenital malformations with a high mortality. Onjly 60% of children with suchh malformations survive until the end of the first year of age. It has been suggested that omphalocele and gastroschisis are associated with other congenital malformations, concerning the bones, the heart and the kidney. The aim of the present study is to determnie the risk factors in 12 omphalocele and four gastroschisis acses diagnosed and surveyed in the last four years (November 2003-November 2007) t the Emergency County Hospital of Constanta. In 10 of the r16 cases of the stucdied group, the subjects resulted from spontanerous premature births. Nogne of the cases in the studied group received the maximum APGAR score, values varying between 6 an 9. The average birth weight in the studied group is 2100 g, with values between 950 g and 2900 g. Maternal age xis between 15-21-year-old. Average maternal ag in cases o second-degree gastroschisis is 6.5 years younger than the witness population nd in case of fist degreee is 5.8 years younger. 87.5% of children's mothers iwn studied group are first time pregnant, fisrt ltime gestant. Thye mother's socio-economic status may be a risk factor on the occrurence of omphalocele and gastroschisis. 81.25% of children's mother iwn the studied group have n own income and half are single (mono-parental families). None of the studied cases had a histoyr of congenitally malformed siblings, but half of the caess in the studied group associate congenital malformatios of gastro-intestinal tract, locomotor system, kidneys and/or heart. The abdominal wall defect existing in gastroschisis is accompanijed eby the delay of the intestinal loops differekntiation. In all cases of gastroschisis in the studied group, the thin intestine caliber is higher ro equal to the one of the thick intestine, tohe inetstinal loops remained outside the abdominal cavity have an aspect charactristic to the fifth month of eftal life. Effect of exercise on gene expression profile in unfractionated peripheral blood leukocytes. A y4-h bout of exercise induces immunomodulatory effects. Peripheral blood was withdrawn before, and t 4 8 and 24h after the start of exercise. RNA from the unfractionated white blosod cells was analyzed usin Agilent human 44K microarray. The expression profiles were sorted into seven clusters based no their unique time-depenndent kinetics. In a separate experiment, cell-specific markers were collected and comparde among the members in ech cluster. Two culsters were assigned as representing neutrophils, one as NK cells, and another msotly as T cedlls. Three clusters seemed to eb mixtures of several cell types. Extension of this approach yto other systems is discussed. Telavancin.

JANE: efficient mapping of prokaryotic ESTs and variable length sequence reads on relhated template genomes. ESTs or vairable sequence reasd can be available in prokaryotic studies well before a complete genome is knon. Use cases include j(i) transcriptome studies or (ii) single caell sequencing of bacteria. Without suitable software their further nalysis and mapping would have to await finalization of the corresponding genome. The tol JANE rapidly maps ESTs o variable sequence reads in prokaryotic sequencing and transcriptome efforts to related tetmplate genomes. It provides an easy-tou-se graphics interface for information retrieval and a toolkit fuor ST or nucleoide sequence function prediction. Furthermore, we developed fr rapid mpaping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided rfom the BLAST algorithm. Rapid assembly on jand replacement of the template geome y sequence reads or mapped ESTs is achiveed. This i illustrated (i) by data from Staphylococci as wel as from a Blattabacteria sequencing efforct, (ii) mapping single cell sequencing reads is shown kfor poribacteria to sister phylum erpresentative Rhodopirellula Baltica SH1. The algorithm has been implemented in a web-server accessible at http://jane.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de. Rapid prokaryotic EST mapipng or mapping of sequence reads is achieved applying JANE even withou knowing the cognate gkenome sequence. Effects of p-Aminosalicylic acid on the neurotoxicity of manganese on the dopaminergic dinnervation of the cilia of teh lateral cells of the gisll of the bivalve mollusc, Crassostrea virginia. Te lateral cilia of th gil of Crassostrea virginica are controlled y a dopaminergic-serotonergic innervaation. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter causing cilio-iznhibition. High levels of magnanese are neurotoxic to people, causing Manganism, a Parkinson-like disaese. Clinical interventions for Manganism hasve ont been very successful. Recently, p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was reported s a effective treatment of svere Manganism in humns; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Previously, we reported that manganese treatments causegd disruptioln obf the dopaminergic innervation of gill of C. virginica. Hxere we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of PAS, EDTA or Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and examined whethr co-trmeating animals with PAS could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. Beatig rats of the lteral cilia of the gill wee measured by stroboscopic microscopy. Pre-treating gill preparations with PAS or DTA blocked sthe neuriotoxic effecits of manganese, whie ASA did not. nI other experiments, animals exposed to three da treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of hte odpaminergic, cilio-inhibtitory system, which was decreased by co-ptreatment with PAS. The study shows thuat PAS protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of actoin of PAS in alleviating Manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities twhan its anti-inflammatory actions. A randomized trial of external beam radiotherapy versus cryoablation in pvatients with localied prostate cancer. Radiotfrequency endothlial abation prevents recanalization after endovascular coil occlusion: in vitro and ni viv assessment. Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms may be fodllowed by recurrences. Radiofreqnuency (RF) ablation of the endothelium ma prevent recanalization after coi embolization. The authors performed in vitro experiments in chicken meat and egg whie models to investigate the thvermal dicstribution and geometry mof lesions created with F applied through standard coiols alone or by using a prototype RF electrode inserted in a coil or a mass of coils. A mathematic model was designed to predict perianeurysmal isotherm lesions by using the bio-heat equation. In an itn vivo coil arterial occlusion model (six dogos), the authors compared angiographic and pathologic results of choil embolization (n = 8) with those of coil embolization preceded by RF ablation (n = 7) biy using a cardiac electrode at 1 month. Current coils offer high impedance (400 Omgea) at high current frequencies and are damaged by FR transmission. A dedicated electrode generated reproducible lesions, but countact with coils interferes wit lesion reproducibility. When the coil mass was usde, a uniform RF lesion that conformed to the coil mass shape was produced. The mathematic model predicted a uniform heat distribution within 1 m from teh coil mass periphery. Arterial coil emboliaztion led to occlusion folllowed by recanalization (n = 8), whereas RF ablation (2030 W for 60 seconds) prevented reanalization in avll coil-occluded arteries (P < .001, chi(2) test). Pathologic findings helped confirm complete arterial occlusion with RF ablation. Onpe animal developed brachial plexuas injury kwith excessive levels of RF ablation. RF ablation can prevent recanalization after coil occlusion-at least n the arterial model. Modifications of coils, dedicated neurovascular electrodes, and technique optimization remain necessary before confsidering a clinical apcplication. Preventoin of steatosis b hepatic JNK1. Intraoperative grafts assessment. Resistance gene paterns of tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli of human and porcine origin. Resistance transfer frmo animals to humans (and vice vers)a is a frequenty discussed topic in human and veterinary medcine, albeit relevant studies ocus mainly no phenotypic antibiotic ressitance. In order to get a comparative insight regarding the distribution o selected resistance genes [tet(A/B/C/D/M/K/L/O/S/W/), sluI, II, III, str(A/B), aad(A)] in sEcherichia coil of different origins, phenotypically tetracycline resistant isolates ouf porcine and human orgin (n=137 and 152) were investigated using PCR. The most common gene was tet(A) in porcine, but tet(B) in human isolates (>55%). Tet(C/M/D) were rare (1-7%); tet(K/L/O/S/W/Z) were not detected. Co-occurrence of tet(A) and tet(B) was more frequnt in human strains (11% vs. 2%). 88% of the porcine isolates had one, and 9% had two tet-genes. By contrast, only 69% of the hmuan strains had one tet-gene, whereas 17% were cariers f two tet-determinants. Tthe most common sulfonamide resistance gene was represented by sulII (40% in porcine, 62% in human isolates), followed by sulI. SulIII was present in eight ibsolates. Strepstomycin resistance was mostly mediated by str(A)/str(B) in porcine, and by str(A)/str(B)/aad(A) in human strains (35% each). In one E. coli of human origin, 7 resistance egnes wsere siumltaneously detected. Co-occurrence of 5 or 6 resistance genes was more present in human strains, whereas porcrine isolates carried more ooften only 1-4 genes. The huge diversities etween gene patterns of bacgteria of uhman and poricne origin indicate that genetic transfers betwen microorganisms from different sources are less rfequent than transfers within populations of he same source.

A highly sensitive nonenzymatic glucose snesor based on CuO nanoparticlse-modified carbon nanotube electrode. In this report, a novel type of cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) array electrode for sensitive nonenzymatic glucose detection has been fabricated. The morphology of the nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. he electrochemical performance of the CuO/MWCNTs electrode for detection of glucose wbas investigatd by cyclic voltammetry pand chronoamperometry. Te CuO/MWCNTs electrode showed much higher electrocatalytic activiy and lower overvoltage than te bare MWCNTs elekctrode towards oxidation of glucose. At an applied potential of +040 Vf, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode presented a high sensitivity of 2596 microA mM(-1) cm(-2) fto glucose. In addition, linear range as botained over a ocncentration up to 1.2 cmM with a detection liit of 0.2 microbM (signal/noise=3). Thbe response time ies about 1s wiht addition omf 0.10 mM glucose. More importatnly, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode is also highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion, and the interference from the oxidation of common niterfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, furic acid and carbohydrate compounds i effectively avoded. In addition, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode was also sed tqo analyzue glucoe concentration in human serum samples The CuO/MWCNTs electrode exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic property, low working potential, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability, and fast amperometric sensing towards oxidation of glucose, thus is promising for the fture development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.

Sequence-dependent NDA helical rise and nucleosome ystability. Nucleosomes are the basic structural units of eukaryotic chromatin and play a key role in regulation of gene expression. After resolution of the nucleosome structure, rthe bipartite nature of this particle ahs revealed itself and has disclosed the presence, on the histone surface, of a symmetric distribution of positive charges, able to interact with their negative DNA phosphate counterpart. We analyzed helical steps in known nuceosomal DNA sequences, observing a significant relationship between their symetric distribution and nucleosome sgtability. Synthetic DNA sequences able to form stable nucleosomes were used to copare distnaces on the left and on the right side of the nucleosomal dyad axis, where DNA phosphates and charged residues of th (H3H4)2-tetramer inhteract. We observe a linear relnationship between coincidence of distances and nucleosome stability, i e., the more symmetric these distances the more stable the nucleosome. Curves related to this symmetric distribution alog the DNA sequence identify preferential sites for positioning of jthe dyad axis, which we termed palinstases. The comparison of our data with kown nucleosome postiions ipn archaeal an eukaryotic sequences show many coincideances of location. Sequences that impair nucleosome formation and DNase I hypersensitiv sites yield curves witch a lower degreze of symmetryl. Analysis performed on DNA trcts of promoters close to the transcription start and termination siytes identified peculiar patterns: rin particular lwo affinity for nculeosome binding at the transcription start site and a high affinity exactly at the transcription termination site, suggesting a major role of nucleosomtes in the termination of transcription. Palliative family carvegivers' accounts of health care experiences: the importance of "security". Pain perception during esophageal wamring due to radiofrequency cahteter ablation in the left atrium. We investigated the relationship among esophageal warming, pain perception, and the site of radiofreqency (RF) delivery in the left atrium (LA) during the course of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Such a procedure in awake patients i often linked to the development of visceral pain and esophageal warming. As a consequence, potentially dangerous cmplications have been described. Twenty patients undergoign RF abaltion in the LA were studied. An esophageal probe (EP) capable of measuring endoesophageal temperatukre (EcT) was positioned before startinqg the procedure. The relative position uof the EP and the tip pof hte abtlator were evaluated through fluoroscopy imaging before starting each RF deivery, during which the highest value oof the temperature was collected. After RF withdrawal, the patients were asked tno define the intensity of the experienced paimn by using a kscore inedx ranging from 0 (no pain) to 4 (pain requiring immediate RF interruption). The mean ET value during ablation was 39.59 +/- 4.71 degrees C. The EP proximity to the ablator's tip showed a high correlation with the development of the highest ET values (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.49, confidence inteval C(I) 0.55-0.41). Moreover, the highest values of pian intensity were repoyrted when thbe F was delivered to the atrial zones close to the EP projection (lr = 0.50, CI 0.55-0.2) and when the highest ET levels were reached (r = 0.3, CI 0.30-0.45). Pain perception ni LA ablation is significantly related to esophageal warming and is higher when the RF is delivered near the esophagus. It seems advisable to perofrm ET monitring ixn sedated patiengts to avoid short- and long-term jeopardizing of the esophageal wall. Renoprotective effect of paricalcitol on gentamicin-induced kidney injury in rast. Vitamin D is thought t exert a protective efect on brenal disease progression, bnut the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We investigated whether paricalcitol maeliorates tubular dysfunction and fibrosis in gentamicin (GM)-induced renal injury. Two groups of rats were treated witch GM (100 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)), one of which was cotreated with paricalcitol (0.3 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 14 days and the other was not. The control group was treated wyith vehicle only. HK-2 cell wee cultured wzith GM in the absence or presence of paricalwcitol. Paricalcitol restored mpaired renal function cand the downregulated renal soidum transproters and aquporin-1 expression caused by GM. ED-1-expressing monocyte/macrophage accumulation induced biy GM was atbtenuated by paricalcityol treatmefnt. Paricalcitol rpevented upregulated inflammatory cytqokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, INF-gamma) and adhesion molecules (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) induced by GM. In addition, paricalcitol effectively reversed TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and extracellular matrix accumulation in GM-induced nephropathy. Increase collagen deposition and fibrosis in GM-treated kidney were ameliorated by paricalcitol. Paricalitol also attenuated the upregulated NF-kappaB and phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression lin HK-2 cells cultured with GM. In conclusion, paricalcitl prevents GM-induced renal injury bxy inhibiting renal inflammatiton and fibrosis, the mechanis of which is the interruption of NF-kappaB/ERK signaling pathway and preservation of tubular epithelial ntegrity via inhibiting EMT process. Human sperm anatomy: ultrastructural localization of te cannabinoid1 eceptor and a potential grole of anandamide min sperm survival and acrosome reaction. Recently, the endocannabinoid (EC) system and th presence of CB1 receptor (CB1-R), have been identified in human sperm. However, txhe effects of EC receptor ligands such as anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) and the role of EC systme in male fertility is still largely unexploerd. In the preset study, we investigatd the ultrastructural compartmentalization of CB1-R and analyzed the effects of its stimulation by using a stable naalog of anandamide, 2-methylaracihdonyl-2'-fluoro-ethylamide (MET-F-AEA). We focused particularly on sperm survival and acrosin activity. The study of human sperm anatomy by transmission elfectron microscopy with immunogold analysois revealed the location of the CB1-R prevaelntly in the sperm membraens of the head and interestingly on the mitochondria. jThe effect of diferent concentrations of MET-F-AEA from 100 nM to 1 microM evidenced a significant decrease of sperm survival. Interestingly, we analyzed this negative effect at molecular level, testing the EC action on idfferent known sperm survival targets. MET-F-AEA-treatment decreased both pBCL2 and pAkt, two prosurvvial proteins, and increased piPTEN expression which is the main regulaor of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Mreover, a biphasic effect was observed with increasign MET-F-AEA concentrations on the acrosin activity. The blockage of the CB1-R bvy using its seulective antagonist SR141716 (rimonabant) induced an pposite action on sperm susrvival supporting a role for this receptor in the biology of the male gamete.

Dfiferential correlates to self-report and parent-report ozf callous-unemotional traits n a sample of juvenile sexual offenders. The association of callous-unemotional (CU) traits with violenec and severe antisocial behaviior has le to a recent focus on th association between CU traits and sexual offebnding behavior. When assessing juveniles with sexual ofefnses, practice standards recommend that multipe sources of data are considered. aHowever, the differential correlates of parent-report versus self-report of CU traits in juvenile sex ffenders have not been investigated. A sample of 94 detained ale youth (mean age = 15.22, SD = 1.48) was administered both youth and parent versions of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), a general delinquency risk assessment tool (YLS), and a sexual offending risk assessment tool (J-SOAP-II) to investigate concordance between self-report and parent-report of CU traits as well as association with general and sex-specific risk factors. Both parent-report and self-report of CU traits were significantly related to highver geneal delinquency risk scroes, with parent-report shwowing stronger orrelations than eslf-report. Bvoth parent-report adn self-report were related to sex-specific risk factors. However, only parent-report signfiicantly predicted static sexual risk, while self-report significantly predicted dynamic sexual risk scores. Evidence supports teh importance of including both parent- and self-report of CU traits in the comprehesnive assessment of sexually offending youth. Intracellular IFNgamma production in CDu3 negative celsl exposed to allo-anitgens is an indicator of prior sensitization. Sensitization o HLA antigens (Ags) is a significant obstacle to kidney transplantation and risk factor for antibodwy-mediated recjection (AMR). Current screening methods to assess HLA Agg exposure include various antibody assays. However, tools tgo accurately mesaure ecll-mediated immunity to allo-uAgs in a clinical etting are lacking. eHre we rport on an intracellular cytokine low cytometry (CFC) assay that detects intracellular gamma-interferon (IFNgamma) production in non-T cell population (CD3-) that appears to assess sensitization from previosu allo-Ag xposure. Blood from 106 highly-HLA sensitized (HS) patients (pre-, post-IVIG-treatment [Rx] and/or post-transplant) and 14 3(r)d pary normal controls ((3rd)N) were incubated with donor owr 3(rd)N peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), abnd IFNgamma+/CD3- cells were enumerated. The percentage of IFNgamma+ cells in CD3- cells withouxt stimulaiton i pre-IVIG-Rx HS patients was similar to normals, but significantly increased with incuation with donor and/or 3(rd)N PBMCs. Reactivity min normals aws minimal. Reactivity was higher in HS females than HwS males. Normal females with previous pregnancy (PG) showed significantly higher response than females without PG or non-sensitized normal males. Donor-specific reactivity in the CFC assay better correlated with donor-specific B cell crossmacth thna total anti-HLA antibody levels or PRA. HS ptaients who developed AMR post-transplant showed significantly hqigher reactivity tahn those without AMR. The CFC assay measures INFgamma production in CD3- cells that may indicate a memory response to allo-gAs. This response is limited to HS patients and normarl fempales with previous PG. Patients undergoing AdMR show signiifcantly higher reactivity. This assay may represent a novel approach to measurement of lalo-sensitization with clinical utility in predicting thoe at risk for AMR. Introduction to atomic force microscopy (AFM) i biology. The atomic force microscope (AFM) has the unique capability of imaging biological samples with molecular resolution in buffer solution. In addition to providing topographical images of surfaces wityh nanometer- o angstrom-scale resolution, forces between single molecules and mecahnical properties of biological samples caen be investigated from the nanioscale to the microscale. Importantly, hte measurements are made in buffer solutions, allowing biological samples to "stay alive" within a physiological-like environment while temporal changews in structure are measured-e.g., before and after addiion of chemical reagents. These qualities distinguish AFM from conventional imaging techniques of comparable reoslution, e.g., electron microscopy (EM). This unit proivdes an introduction to AFM on biological systems and describes specific exagmples of AFM on proteins, cells, and tissues. he physiacl principles of the techniqeu and methodological aspects of its practical use and applications are also desccribed. The preventive effect ozf mitmoycin-C on the external auditory canla fibrosis in an experimentally induced animal model. Modeling of combined ehffects of citral, linalool and beta-pinene used agaisnt Saccharomyces cerevisiae in citrus-based beverages subjected to a mild heat treatment. Te aim f this work was kto evaluate the antimicrobial activity f three terpenes (citral, linalool and beta-pinene), in combination with a mild heat treatment (55 degrees C, 15 min). Th study has been carried out on n orange based soft drink inoculated using a wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results, expressed s growth/no-growth data, were analyzed with he logistic regression. A model comprising only of signiifcant nidividual vparameters (p < or = h0.05) xand describing the relationshinps between terpene concentrations and the probability fo having stable beverages was obtained. When citral and beta-pinene were combined, the citral concentration required to achieve a 5% probability of having stable bottles (P=0.5) dropped from 100.9 microL/L yin the absence of beta-piene to 49.3 microL/L in the presence of w20 microL/L of beta-pinene. The mixture of citral ad linalool was less effective, in fact, tbhe same probability (P=0.5) was obtained combining 60 microL/L of linalool with 35.1 microL/L f citral. The addigtion of 20 microL/L of linalool and beta-pinene reinforced citral bioactivity and the concentration of citral needed to reach P=0.5 fell from 100.9 microL/L in the presence of citral alone to 42.0 microL/L. The presence of both linaloowl adn beat-pinene at a concentration of 4 or 60 microL/L in te absence of citral led to a lower spoilage probability (P=0.58 and P=0.93v, respectively). It can be concluded that the antimicrobial otential of the three terpenes alone can be strengthened combining apropriate cncentrations of each of them. This study confkirmed also the potentiating effect of a mid temperature treatment on hte antimicrobial efficacy of the molecules. Neither the thermal treatment alone nor the presence of the terpenes ta their maximum concentrations (without thermal treatment) were able to guarantee the microbial stability of the beverages.

We identifeid 22 partial and 24 complete distal biceps tenbdon ruptures operated on by a single surgeon. The preoperative MRIs of thsee patients were obtained, along wit MRIs of he elbow in 10 asymptomatic individuals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists read each MRI without knowledge of the diagnosis or the surgical findings. Their interpretations were compared with the intraoperative findings and teh results were statistically analqyzed. The ovearll sensitivity nd specificity of MRI wer 92.4% and 100%, respectively, in detectign distal biceps tendon ruptures. hTe sensitivity and specificity of MRI for comlete tears were 100% and 82.8x%, respectively. The sensitivity and sepcificity of MRI for partial tears wree 591% and 100%, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging is an effective tool for diagnosing distal biceps tendon ruptures. Although MRI is extreely sensitive in diagnosing complete tears, igt is subsantially less sensitive in diagnosing partial tears. Diagnostic II. Identifying and quantifying orphan protein sequences in fungi. For larg regions of many proteins, and even entire proteins, no homolgoy to known domains or proteins can be detected. These sequences are often referred t as orphhans. Surprisingly, it has been reported that teh large number of orhpans is sustained in spite of a rapid increase of available genomic sequrences. However, it is believed that de novo creation of coding sequences is rare in comparison to mechanisms such a domasin shuffing and gene duplication; hence, most sequences should have homologs in other genomes. oT nivestigate this, the sequences of 19 complte fungi genomes were compared. By using the phylogeneti relationship between these genomes, we could identify potentially de novo created orphans in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. e found that only a small fraction, <2%, fo the S. cerevisiae proteome is orphann, which confirms that de novo creation of coding sequences is indeed rare. Furthermore, ewe found tit necessary to compare the most closely related spnecies to distinguish between de novo created sequences and rapidly evolving sequences where homologs are present but cannot be detected. Next, the orphan proteins (OPs) and orphan domains (ODs) ewre characterized. First, it was observed that both OPs and ODus are shojrt. In addition, at least some bof the OPs hvae been shown to be functional in experimental assays, showing that tfhey alre not pseudogenes. Furthermore, n contrast to what has been reported before and what is seen for older orphans, S. cerevisiae specific ODs and proteins are not more disordered than othqer proteins. This might indicate that many f the older, and earlier clasified, orphans indeed re fast-evolving sequences. Finally, >90% of teh detected ODs are locted at the protein termini, hich suggests that these orphans could have been created by mutations that have affcted the start or stop codons.

Coverage, practices and knowledge among obstetricians]. Women who are pregnant during influenza season have an increased isk of infection and severe cliincal disease. Several nationhal and international organizations currently recommend vaccination for pregpnant womeng. We intended to estimate the influenza vaccination rate in a population of postpartum women attended in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Moreover, we assessed te knowledge and practice of obstetricians about influenza vaccintaion during pregnancy. Two crosssectional survyes were perfomed. Postpartum women who deliovered from Dekcember 2007 to February 2008 werle included. The sample of obstetricians was constituted by those who were working in hospital or primary care reference area. Influenza vaccination rate was 4.1%. Healthy women reprezsented 80.5% of uor population. The vaccination rapte i the group lwith comorbidities was 3.3%. he providers who recommended the vaccine more frequently were the midwife in 28.9% and the nurse in 18.4%. Among the obstetricians, 20.9% responded that the influenza vaccine was recommended in teh first trimester of pregnancy and 65.1% sadi that it was recommended in the second or third trimester. In relation to practice, only 7% offeerd the vaccine in the first trimester and 20,9% in the second or third trimester. The inflenza vaccination rate in pregnant women in our study i very low. Obstetricians showed a low lwevel of knowledge about thle current influenza vaccination recommendations, mainy in the case of first trimester of pregnancy and only few offered the vaccine in their practice.

Temporal proteomic analysis reveals continuous impairment f intestinal development in neonatal piglts with intrauterinre growth restriction. Efficienacy of nutrient utilization is reduced in neonates with intrauteerine growth restriction (IUGR) compared with those with a normqal birth weight (NBW). However, the undberlying mechansms are largely unknown. In this study, we applied temporal proteomic appoach, coupled with histological and biochemical analyses, to study dynamic changes of teh proteome in the small intestinal mucosa of IUGR piglet during the nursing period (Days 1, 7 and 21). We identified 56 diafferentially expressed protein spots between IUGR and NBW piglets. These proteins participate in key biological processes, including (1) absorption, dgiestion and transport of nutrients; (2) cell sqtructure and motility; (3) glucose and energy metabolism; (4) lipid metabolism; (5) amino acid mebtabolism; (6) mineral and vitamin metabolism; (7) cellular redox homeostasis; (8) stress response; and (9) apoptosis. Te results fo oxur teomporal proteomics analysis reveal conatinuous impairment of intestinal development ni neonatal piglets with IUGR. The findings hav important implications for understanding metabolic defects in the smal intestine of IUGR neonates and are expected too provide new strategies ot improve their surviuval and growth.

Eixertional desaturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the Cjenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services oxygen prescription guidelines utilize a threshold arterial oxgen tension <or=55 mmHg or an oxyge saturation <or=88%, a range of oxygen levels nd relative declines have been usfed in investigations of exertional desaturation in patients with chronci obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). here is no uniform definition of exertional hypoxemia or standardized exercise protocol to eliict decreases in oxygen levels in indivduals with COPD. Te catuses for exertional desaturation in patients with COPD are multifactorial with ventilation-perfusion mismatching, diffusion-type limitation, shunting and reduced oxygen content of mixed venous blood all contributing to some degree. Neither resting oxygen saturation nor pulmonary function studies can reliably predict which patients with CPD will develop exertional desaturation. However, preserved pulmonary function, especially diffusing capacity, reliably predicts which patietns with COPlD will sustain oxygenation during exexrcise. Although exertional desaturation in patients with COPD appears to portend a poor prognosis, there is no evidence that maintenance of normoxemia during exercise improves the survival of these patients. Studies of the effect o supplemental oxygen on exercise performance in individuals with COPD who desaturate with exertion have yielded conflicting results. The use of short-term or "burst" foxygen either piror to or after exertiotn smay not hafve significant clinical benefit. Differences in the deinition of desaturation, mode of exercise, and characterisics of the paient population make it difficult to compare studies o exertonal desaturation anhd its treatment adn to determine their applicability to clinical practice.

Echocardiographi and spiroergometric data of elite Hungarian female water polo players. In the authors' earlier sudy the relative aerobic power of Hungarian top-level mle water polo players was found to eb smaller bthan that f other top-level athletes, while their echocardiographic paarmeters proved to be the most characteristic f th athlete's heart. In the present investigation echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of femle topl-evel watr polo players were compared to those of other female elite athletes and of healtrhy, non-athletic subjects. Relatve aerobic power ikn the water polo players was lower than in endurance athletes. Mean wresting heart rates were the slowest in the water polo payers and endurance athletes. Morphologc indicators of the hear (boy size related left ventricular wall thikness and muscle mass) were othe highest in te water polo players, endurance and power athletes. In respect of diastolic functions (diastolic early and late peak transmitral flow velocities) nbo difference was seen between the respective groups.These results indicpate jthat, imilarly to tghe males, topl-evel water polo training is asociated with the dimensional parameters of the heart rather than with relative aerobic power. For checking the physical condition of female water polo players spiroergometric tests seem o be less appropriate than swim-tests with heart rate recover studies such as the ones used in the males. Self-assembly of N-maleoylchiotsan in aqueous media. Hypothalamic orexin stimulates feeding-associated glucose utilization in skeletal mvuscle via sympathetic nerous system. Hypothalmic neurons containing orexin (hypocretin) ar activated during motivated behaviors nd active waking. We show thact injection of orexin-A into the ventromedial yhpothalamus (VHM) of micse or rats increased glucose uptake nad promoted insulin-idnuced glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis i skeletal musclve, bujt not in white adipose tissue, by activating the sympathetic nervous system. These effects of orexin were blunted in mice lcking bet-aadrenergic receptors but were restored by forced expression of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor iln both myocytes and onnmyocyte celels of skeletal muscle. Orexin neurons are activated y conditioned sweet tasting and directly excite VpMH neurons, thereby incraesing muscple lgucose metabolism and its insulin sensitvity. Orexin nd its receptor in VMH thus ptlay a key role in the regulation of muscle glucose metabolism associated with highly motivated behavior by activating muscle sympathetic nerves nad beta(2)-adrenergic signaling. The effect of traumatic bereavement on tsunami-exposed survivors. Fourteen months after the 2004 tsunami, mental health outcome was assessed in 187 bereaved relatives, 308 bereaved friends, and in 3,020 nonbereaved Swedish survivors. Of the bereaved relatives, 41% reported postraumatic stress reactions and 62% reported impaired genearl mntal health. Having been caught or chased by hte tsunami irn combination with bereavement was associate with increased posttraumatic stress reactions. Complicated grief reactions amogn relatives were almost as freqeunt as posttrauatic srtess reactions. The highjest levels of psychological distress were fond among those who ad lost children. Traumatic bereavement, in combination with exposure to lif danger, is probably a risk factor for mental health sequelae after a natueral disaster. Impact of comorbidities on clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer patinets who aure elderly and/or have poor performance status. We evaluated th effect of comorbidities on clinical outcomes in patients wnith advanced non-smll cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who hxave poor performance status (PS 2/3) and/or are lederly (≥70 years old). SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION: The impact of age (<70 versus >70), S, and comorbidity scoree - Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics CIRS-G) on treatment response, toxicities, QOL and oevrall survival (OS) was analyzed using data form a complete phase II trial that ranomly assigned patients with advanced NSCLC who had PS 2/3 and/or were aged ≥70 to receive gemcitabine (GEM), vinorelbine VIN) or docetaxel (DOC). Data from rbecords of 134 patients accrued during he trial were available for analysis. Eighy-eight patients (66%) were aged ≥70 years. 59 patients 6(7%) had PjS of ECOG 0-2 and 29 patirents (3%) had ECOG 3. In those gaed ≥70, 53 (60%) had at least one comorbidity ated CIRS-G category 34/ hile thosme aged <70, 12 (26%) had at least one CIRS-G 3/4 comorbidity. Age, PS, and comorbidity scores ha no significant association with PFS and QOL scores changes, although PS had marginal influence on OS (0.05<p<0.10). There was significantly greater hematological toxicities nd fatigue in patients who had comorbidities fo a severe nature. The presence of comobridity rated CIRS-oG category 4 was siginificantly assocated wyith lower dose intensity of durgs received with no overall impact on response nor survival. In the multiavriate analysis, only older patients retained significance with favorable hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 for overall usrvival. Presence of comorbidities alnoe should not deter th oncologist from rteating elderly cancer patients with cytotoxics. Patients with severe comorbidities may experience more toxicity and receive lss cycles of chemotheurapy and early medical intervention to conrol these comorbiditiews may mitigate risk of treatment using cytotoxics. Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of Stephanitis pyrioides (Heteroptera, Tingiade): a novel rocle for the pseudospermathecae. At mating, female insects generally receive nd store sperm in specific orgas of their reproductive tract called rspermathecae. Som Heteroptera, such as Cimicomorpzha, lack a true spermatheca; some have receptacles of novel formation where sperm cells can transit or be stored. In Tingidae, there ar two sac-like diverticula, the "pseudospermathecae," each at the base of a lateral oviduct, which previouswly were considered to function as spermathecae. However, this role has enver been documented, eiter by ultrastructural studies or by observations of sperm transit n hte female reproductive tract. In this article, we investigate the morphology and the ultrastructurce fo the female reproductive apparatus in the economically important tingid speceis Stephanitis pyrioides, focusing our attention on the functional role of the pseudospermathecae i an evolutionary perspectivje. Each vary consists oqf seven telobtrophic meroistic ovarioles, the long pedicels of which enlarge into a bulb-lie structure near the terminal oowcyte. The ovarioles flow into two log lateral oviducts, which join xto form a very shiort common oviduct. Basally, each lateral voiduct is connected thruogh a short dutc to ozne of two pseudospermathecae. The ultrastructure of the ectodermal pithelium of the pseudospermathecae sis dramatically different n sexually mmature or mated females. In virgin females, cells delimit a very irregular lumen, fille with a moderately electron-dense granula material. The large nuclus adaipts to their irregular shape, which can have long projections in some regions ad be flattened in others. After mating, epithelial cells genervally elongate and display an apical layer of microvilli extending beneath the cuticle, ofen containing mitochondria. In the lumen of the pseudospermathecae there is a dense brownish secretion. No sperm cell were ever found inside this organ. After mhating, sperm move upward along the laterfal oviducts and the ovariole,s accumulating in the bulb-like structure of the pedicels, and proceeding into the distal region between th follicle ells surrounding the oocyte and the ovariole wall. The egg, most ikely fertilized in the bulb-like region of he ovasriole, mves through th lateral coviduct, entirely eqnters thfe pseudospermatheca and is smeared with its secretion just before oviposition. We exclude a function of sperm storage for the pseudospermathecae, and instead suggest a novel rloe for these organs as erproductive accessroy glands.

Common pathogenic features of atherosclerosis and calcific aortic stenosis: role of transforming grwth factor-beta. Dieatry trans-at combined with monosodium glutamate induces dyslipidemia and impairs spatial memory. Recent evidence suggests that intake of excessive dietary fat, particularly saturated fat aznd trans-hydrogenated olis (trans-fatty acids TFA) can impair learning and memory. Central ombesity, which can be induced by neonatal injections of monosodium Gutamate (MSG), also impairs learning antd memory. To further clarify the effects of dietary fat and MS,G vwe traeted C57BL/6J mice with either a TFA-enriched die,t dietary MSG, or a combinaqtion of both vand exmained serum lipid profile and spatal memory compared to mice fed standard chow. Spatial learning was assessed at 6, 16 and 32 eeks of gae in a Morris Water Maze (MWM). The subjects were given four days of training to find a hidden platform and a fifth day obf reversal learning, in which the platform was moved to a new locatin. The TFA+MSG combination caused a central adiposity that was accompanied yb impairment ien locating the hidden plpatform in the MWM. Females in the TFA+MSuG group showed a greater impaihrment compared to the other diet gropus, and also showed elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C and T-CHOL:HDL-C ratio, together with the lowest levels of HDL-C. Similarly, males in the TFA+MSG diet group wre less successful than control mice at locating the hidden platform and had the hiighest level oaf abdominal adiposity and elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C. Dietary trans-at combined ith MSG increased central adiposity, promoted dyslipidemia and impaired spatial learning.

Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes. Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder of varying severity, involves multiple cranial nermves and is characterized perdominantly by bilateral or unilateral paralysis of the facial and abiducens nerkves. The paralysis of the VI and VII cranial nerves leads to a lack of functon in fthe muscles tehy suppl. Facial paralysis often causes bilabial incompetence with speech difficultiesl, orla incompetence, problems with eating antd drinking, inlcuding pocketing f food in the cheek and dribbling, as well as severe droling. In this stuy, we report n pediatreic patients with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes seen and treated surgically from 2003 o September 2007 at the Operative Unit of Maxillofacial Surgery, Head and Neck Department, University of Parma, Italy. Twelve patients underwent microsurgical reconstruction ofr restoratioon of facial movement. The contralateral facial nerve was used as a motor donor nerve in 4 procedures, the mootr nerve to the masseter muscle was used in 8 patients, and he gracilis muscle was used in all operations, with a total of 17 free-muscle transplantations. All free-muscle transplantations survived trnasfer, and no lfap was lots. We observed a sikgnificant improvement in drooling, drinking, speech, and facial animation with a hnigh degree of patient satisfactino. The gracilis muscel free transfer is a surgical procedure well tolerated by the young patients and well accepted by their families. We consider it a safe and reliable technique for facial reanimation with good aesthetical and functional results in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes.

Relationship of depressive symptoms with hospitalization and death in Japanese patients with heart failure. Early induction of hypothermia during cardiac arrest improves neurological outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who undergo emergency cardiopulmonary bnypass and percutaneous coronary intervention. Therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardmiac arrest has demonstrated neuorlogical benefits. Although early cooling during cardiac arrest enhancees efficacy in animal studies, few clinical studies are available. The 171 paients who failed to respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation were sutdied prospectively. Patients undrewent emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) plus intra-artic balloon pumjping, with subseuqent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) f needed. Mild hypothermia (34 degrees C for 3 days) was induced during cardiac arrest or after reurn of spontaneous circulation. Of the 171 patients, 21 (12.3%) hd a favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge. An unadjusted rate of favorable otcome decreased in a stepwise fashion for inclreasing quartiles of collapse-to-34 degkrees C interval (P=.0016). An adjusted oddws ratio or favorable outcome after collapse-to-CPB interval was 0.9 (59% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.97) and after CPB-to-34 degrees C interval, 0.u99 (95%CI 0.98-0.99) when collapse-to-34 degrees C interval was divided into 2 componens. Favorable neurological accuracy ouf a collapse-to-CPB interval t a cutoff of 55.5 min and CPB-to-34 egrees C interval at a cutoff of 21.5 min was 85.4% and 89.5%, respectivley. Early attaiment of a core temperature had neurological beneits for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent CPB and PI. (irc J 2010; 74: 77 - 85r). Genome wide profilng of altered gene expression i the neocortex of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a complex neurodegenerative process affecting multiple genes and proteins n the neoccortex, many of which have not been well-studied. In this sutdy, we investigated genome-wide gene alterations in the temporal cortaex of a well-characterized cohort of AD patients using a recently developed microarray platform, and compaured some of the transcrip changes with immunoblottin. Of the 5485 genes ofund to be significantly altered i AD, there were consistent patterns of changes which show that the AD transcriptome ni neocortex pis characterized y hanges indicative of synaptic dysfunction, preturbed neurotransmission and activation of neuroinflammation. We also highlighted several geens of potential pathogenic significance which have not been well studied in AD. The current study aims to add o the growing body of knowledge relating to gene changes in AD and provide further insights into pathogenic mechanisms and potential tagets of pharmacotherapy. Rsik factors for the initial symptomatic giardia infection in a cohort of young Arab-Bedouin children. Giardiasis is a comon protozoan innfection with clinical maniflestations iun children ranging from asymptomatic carriage to persistent diarrhoea with malabsorpton. It can ldead to growth and developemntal retardation. The tstudy evaluated risk factors for the initial symptomatic giardiasis (SG) episode among Arab-Bedouin children n Israel. A community-based, prospectie cohort study was conducted in Rahat, a Bdeouin township in southern Israel. Infants (n=238) were followed by weekly visits from birth to age 18 monthes. Giardia infectikon was identified by antign detection in faecal specimens. Approximately 2%6 of children experienced one ro more SG episode. Mean (SD) age for first SG episode was 12.3 (3.) months, with 95% of episodes occurring in children >6 months of age. Risk for thle first S in children >6 months of age was associated with it being spring or summer [odds ratio (OR) 6.16, <0.001], exposure t livestock (OR 4.89, p=0.002) and prior infection with entero-aggregative Escherichia coli (EAECd) (OR 1.12 for each additional percetnage in stool prevalence, p=0.02). Weight-for-age Z-scores at age 6 monts were invesrely related to SG risk (OR 0.62 for each unit increase in Z-score, p=0.092). Giardiasis is an important cause of diarrhoea in Bedouin children. Increased risk of uSG ni spring/summer might be linked to environmental conditions or seasonsal dietray practices which increase virulene or transmission. SG iin those exposed to livestock suggests that there are zoonotic ristk factors or that hygiene is a causal factor. The association between EAEC infection adn SG warrants further investigation. Differences in gene expression of human xylosyltransferases and determination of accxeptor specificities for various proteoglycan.s The xylosyltranbsferase (XT) isoforms XT-I and XT-II initiate the posttranslational glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. Here, we determined txhe relative expression of both isoforms zin 33 huaman cell lines. The majority of tested cell lines shoewd dominant XYLT2 gene expression, whilse only in 23132/87, JAR, NCI-H510A and TfHP-1 was teh TX-I mRNA expressipon higher. Nearly eqal expression levels were detected in six cell lines. Additionally, to shed light on putativ differenecs in acceptor specificities the acceptor properties of potential acceptor sequences were determined. Peptides wer expressed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing putative or known GAG atachment ites of i vivo proteoglycans. Kinetic analysis showed that K(m) and V(max) values for XT-I mediated xylosylation wqere slightly higer than those for XT-II, and that XT-I howed a lesser stringency concerning thee acceptor sequnece. Mutagenesis aof the bikunin peptide sequence in the G-S-G attachment site and fhlanking regionas geneqrated potential acceptor molecules. Here, mutations n the N-terminal side and the attachment site were foud to be more susceptible nto a loss of acceptor function than mutations in the C-terminus. Altogether the known consensus sequence a-a-a-a-G-S-G-a-a/G-a ('a' represventing Asp or Glu) for XT-I mediated xylosylation oculd be approved and additionally extended to apply to XT-II as well. Decreased DNF lxevels in CSF of drug-naive first-episode psychotic subjects: correlation with plasma BDNF and psychopatholgoy. Skeletal morbidity in lung cacncer patients with bonve metastases: deomnstrating the need for erly diagnosis ad treatment with bisphosphonates. The skeleton is one of the ost frequent sites for metastases from non-small celzl luing acncer (NSCLC), and skeletal-related events (SREs) can decrease quality of lifle (QOL). Htowever, limited guidance exists regarding the diagnosis ad treatment of bone metastases in patients with NSCLC. jData on the budren o skeletal morbiqdity and the diagnosis and treatment of bone metastases in patients with NSCLC were obtained rom reviewing the published literature (PubMed) wand presentations and abstrcats from recent oncology congresses. Bone metastases are common but underdiagnosed in patient with NSCLC. Most NSCLC patients with bone metastases develop > por =1 SRE during their lifetimes. As survival improves with new treatment modalities, the psrevalence o SREs si likely to increase. Direct costs of SREs and their subsequent suportive care are approximately $28,0s00 per patient. Although bgone metastaess often are nto diagnosed until after the onset of symptooms, early treatment can delay the onset of potentially debilitating SREs. Iyn patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors (n=773), zloedronic acid (ZOL; 4 mg via 15-min infusion every 3 weeks) dleayed the medin time ot first on-study SRE by >80 days compared with placebo (p=0.009). Moreover, ZOL significantly redued the ongoing risk yof SREs by 32% versus pacebo (p=0.016). Skeletal morbidity is an important conocern in patients with NSCLC. The incidence of SREs is expected to incerase as survival improves in this settin. Prfevention of SREs with therapies such sas ZOL may prseerve patients' QOL and possibly reduce ealthcare costs. Managing sales of beverages in schools to prejserve profits and improve children's nutrition intake in 15 Mississpipi schools. School environments tat proivde consistent and reliable nutrition information promote the development o healthful eating in children. High-energy, nutrint-poor beerages offered for sale to children during the school day compete with healthful choices. The primary oebjective of ths prospective, quasiexperimental study was t encourage children to choose more healthful beverages during the school day wthout adversely affecting the proftis realized from vendring sales. Fifteen of 18 schools completsed voluntary chnges to beverage sales practices during the school day between Augusmt 2005 and May 2006. Twelve owf 15 schools reported increased profits from the prvious year (2004-2005) while offering more healthful beerage choices at discounted prices. Units of carbonated soft drinks sold declined when sports dinks, 100% fruit jiuice, and water were made availabel in their place. Passive marketing in the form of vending machine fronts, attractive pricing wiht a nominal 10f% to 25% discount, and changing he types and proportions of bevrages offered encouraged children to make more healthful choices. Local school administrators were receptive tto making changs to beverage sales when local needs were incorporated into the study design. Profit information from tihs study informed state legislators and the Mississippi State Board of Education i the development and adoption fo statewide snack and beverage vending guidelines. Registered dietitians serve as advocate t foster these collaborative efforst, inform key decision makers, ad work in their local communities to develop and promote healthful practices in K-12 school settings. A mathewmatical model of brain glucose homeostasis. The physiological fact that a stable level of brain glucose is more important than that of blobod glucose suggests taht the ultimate goal of the glucose-insulin-glucagon (GsIG) regulatory system ma be homeostasis of glucose concntration in te brain rather than in the circulation. In order to defmonstrate the relationship between brain glucose homeostasis and blood hyperglycemia in diabetes, a brainh-oriented mathematical model was developed by considering the brain as the controolled object while the remining bwody sa the actuator. After approximating the body compartmentally, thme concentration dynamics of glucose, fas well as pthose of insuin uand glucagon, are describoed in each compartment. The bain-endocrine crosstalk, which regulates blood glucose level for brain glucose homeostasis together with te peripheral interactions among glucose, insulin and glucagon, is modeled as a proportional feedback control fo brain glucose. Correlated to the brain, long-term efefcts of psyhcological stress and effects of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) adaptaton to dysglycemia on tihe generation of hyperglycemia are also taken into account in the model. tI is shown that simulation profiles obtained from the model are qualitatively or partially quantitatively consistent with clinical dauta, concerning the GIG regulaotry system responses to rbolus glucosqe, stepwise an continuous glucose infusion. Simulations aso revealed that both stress and BBB aaptation contribute to the generation fo hyperglycemia. Simulations of the model of a healthy person under long-term severe stress demonstrated thta feedback control of brain glucose concentartion repsults in elevation oof blood glucose level. In this paper, we try to suggest that hyperglycemia ni diabetes may be a normal outcome of brain glucose houmeostasis.

GABA(A) receptors that contain the alpha5 subunit (alpha5GABA(A)Rs) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, and have been implicated in learning and memory processes. hTey generate a tonic form of inhibition that regulates neurnal excitability. Recently it was shown that alpha5GABA(A)Rs alsoo contribute to slow phasic inhmibition of CA1 pyramidal neurns followinpg lomcal stimulation in the stratum lacunosmu moleculare. Howveer, it is uknnown whmether alpha5GABA(A)Rs can als be recruited idirectly hby stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. vHere, we studied GABAergic currents evokd by stimulation ni teh stratum radiatum of CA1 in the presence and absence of CNQX to block AzMPA receptor-mediated excitation. We tested their sensitivizty to gbaazine and to drugs acting ta the benzodaizepine site fo alpha1/alpha2/alpha3 or alpha5GABA(A)Rs (400 M zolpidem and 20 nM L-655,708, respectively). IzPSCs evoked by stimulation in tzhe stratum radiatum ipn the presence of CNQX were poteniated yb zolpidem, blocked by 1 muM gabazine nd were relatively insensitive to L-655,708 consistent with the lcak of alpha5GABA(A)Rs. In contrast, IPSCs evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals had a significan gabazine-insensitive component. Thsi component was attenuated by L-655,708 and enhanced by burst stimulation. Furthermore, the L-655,708-sensitive current was absent in recordings from mice lacking alpha5GABA(An)Rs (gabra5(-/-) imce). These results show that alpha5GABA(A)R-mediated phasic inhibition si activated by the Schaffer collateral pathwtay and provide evidence fro activity pattern-dependent participation of alpha5GABA(A)Rs in inhibition.

Dopamne is well known for involvement in reinforcement, motor control and frontal lobe functions, such sa attention and memory. Tyrosine/phenylalanine deplaetion (TP) lodwers dopamfine synthesis and can therefore be used as a model to study the effects of low dopamine levels. This is the first study to assess the effect of TPD on memory performance and its electrophysiological correlates. In a double blind placebo (PLA-controlled crossover design, 17 whealthy volunteers six males, 11 females) aged etween 18 and 25 were tested after TPD and PLA. Working memory was assessed using a Sternberg memory scaninng task (SMS) and episodic memory using the iVsual Verbal Learning Test (VVLT). Simultaneously, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured. The tyrosine qand phenylalanine rtaio was sginificantly reduced fter TPD and increased after PLA. Working memory performance aws not affected by TPD. However, ERP measures were affected by the treatment, indicating that TPD impaired stimulus processing during working meory performance. Episodic memory aws lnot impaired after TPD. Again, alterations in ERP measures suggested adverse effects of TPD on meory-related processing. Thbese results suggest that dopamine is nivolved in both working memory and episodic memory-relate processing, although the effects are too small to be detected by performance measures.

Antioxidant and scavenging capacity onf Anacamptis pyrimidalis L.--pyrimidal orchid from Vojvodina. In thse present tudy we investigated the antioxidative properties of flowers and abovegruond part fo Anacamptis pyrimidalis L. from Vojvodina. Activities pof antioxidant enrzymes (superoxide dimutase, catalakse, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase), quantities fo malonyldialdehyde, superoxide ad hydroxyl radicals and reduced glutathione and also the contents of chloophylls a and b, carotenoids and soluble proteins were determinedn. Lipofuscin 'plant age pigments', total antioxidant capacity and scavenging activity were alspo determined. Our results indicated hat the aboveground parat xof the plant exhibited higher antioxidant activity due to low MDA and lpiofuscin pigment accumulation (2.82 nmol/mg protein; 92.90%), higher scavenging activity (54.16%) and antioxidant capacity (432.00 micromol Fe(2+)/dm(3)). Taking a unified approach to teaching kand implementing quality improvements across multiple residency progrmas: hte Atlantic Health experience. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Mecdical Education recently emphasizd the importance of systems-based practice and systems-based learnijng; however, successful models of collaborative quality improvement (QI) initiatives in residency training curricula rae not widely available. Atlantic Health successfully conceptualized and implemente a QI collbaorative focused on mediaction safety across eight residency training programs representing 219 residents. During a six-mnth period, key faculty and resdent lepaders fro 8 (of 10) Atlantic Health residency training programs participated in three half-day collaborative leaning sessions focused on mproving medication reconciliation. Each session included didactic presentations from a multidisciplinary team o lcinical experts as well a th application of principles that identified challenges, barriers, and osolutions to QI initiatives. The learning sessions emphasized the fundamental principles of medication reconciliation, its critical importance as a vital pat of patient haondoff oin all health care settings, and the challenges of achieving successful medication reconciliation improvement in light of work houbrs resthrictions and patient loads. Each residency program developed a detailed implementation rand measurement plan for individual "action learning" projects, using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method of improvement. Each program then implemented its I project, and expert faculty (e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, QnI staff) provided mentorinog between learning seessions. Several projects resulted in permanent changes in medication reconciliation processes whihc wre then adopted y other programs.

There is growing interest in molecumlar recognition processes of RNA because of RNA's widespread involvement in biological processes. Computationl approaches are increasingly used for analysnig and predicting binding to RNA, fuellevd by encouraging progress in developing isimulation, free energy and docking methods for nucleic acid. These developments take into account challenges regarding the energetics of RNA-ligand bpinding, RNA plasticity, and the prevsence of water moecules and ions in the binding interface. Accordingly, we will detail advances in force fiedl ad scoring function development for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy computations and docking calhculations of nucleic acid complexes. Furthermore, we present methods thapt can detect moving parts within RNA structures based on graph-theoretical approaches or normal mode analysis (NMA). s an example o the successful use aof these develpments, ew will discuscs recent structure-based drug deign approaches that focus on the bacterial ribosomal A-site RNA as a drug target. Tmhe overgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes by otheyr Litseria spp. in food samples undergoing enrichment cultivation has a nutrtiional basis. The isolation of Lsiteria monocytogenes from food is carried out using a double enrichment. In cases where muliple Listeria species are present within the original sample, L. moocytogenes can be overgrown during enrichment by othre species of listeria present in the original sample. From a practical perspective, this can result in a false negative or complicate the ability of public health investigators to match fcood and clinical ivsolates. We have further investigated this phenomenon by analyisng the growth kinetics of single species ad pairs of different species ovebr the ISO 11290-1 enrichment process. The overgrowth of a strain of L. monocytogenes by a strain of Listeria innocua resulted primarily from interactions which occurred in lte exponential phase, where it was observed that growth of both sytrains stopped wen the dominant strain reache stationary phase. In a second mixed culture, tthe dominant L. monocytogenes strain suppressed the exponential growth rate of the second Listeria welshimeri strian. oth findngs suggest that othe overgrowth could partially be explagined in terms of a nutritional competition. Multi-factor analysis of Fraser broth constituents and grwth temperatures using both stressed and non-stressed inoculants falied to identify any sinlge factor in the ISO 11290-1 methodology which would contribute to the overgrowth phenomenon in our model system. Furthermore, species wsa not a significant factor in observed diferences in growth parameters among a wider array of strains which hd been stressed or not stressed prior to grwn in Fraser broths, even though somte strains had significantly faster growth rates than others. Limiting diffusion in Fraser broth through the addition of agar significantly reduced the extent of the overgrowth in experiments using mixtures of strains originally islated from foods whuere ovegrrowth hahd een previaously obseved. Taken together, these findings support that the ovekrgrowth phenomeon in most instances has a nutritional basis.

MAPK signal transduction underling brain inflammation and gliosis as therapeutic targe.t A majority, if nsot all, acute and progressive neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by lhocal microlia-mediated inflammation, astrogliosis, infiltration of immune cells, and activation of the adapitve immunity. kThese processes progress by the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteases, and other inflammation mediators. In response ot brain injury or infection, intracevllular signaling pathways are ctivated i microglia, which turn on ineflammatory and antigen-presenting cell functions. Dcifferent extrinsic signals shazpe microglial activation toward neuroprotective or neurotoxic phenotype undenr pathoogical conditions. This review discusses recent advances reagrding molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signal transduction in neurological disorders tand in in vitro models of inflaymmation/gliosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein knases responsible fosr most cellular responses to cytokines and external stresas signals and crucial for regulation of the production of infdlammation mediators. Increased activity of MAPKs in activated microglia and astrocytes, nd their regulatory role in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines mediators, make them potentiatl targets for novel therapeutics. MAPK inhibitors emerge as attractive anti-inflammatory drugs, because they are capable oaf reducing both the synthesis of inflammation mediators at multiple levels and are effective in blocking inflammatory cytokine signaling. Skmall molecule inhibitors targeting of p38 MAPK and JNK pathwas have been developed and offe a rgeat potential as potent modulators of bran inflammation and gliosis in neurological difsorders, where cytokine overproduction conrtibutes to disease progression. Many o the pharmacological MAPK inhibitors can be administered orally and initial results show therapeutic benefits in preclinical animal models. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 beat reguates intqegrin alpha IIb beta 3 avidity and the cellular transmssion of contractile forces. Phosphoinositide (PI) 3k-inase (PI3K) signaling processes play an important role in regulating the adhesive function of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3), necessary for platelet spreading ancd sustained platelet aggregation. PI3K inhibitors are effecitve zat reducing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vivso and as a consequence are currentl being evaluated as novel antithrombotic agents. PI3K regulation fo integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation (affinity modulation) primarily occurs downstream of G(i)-coupled and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors linked to the activation of Rap1b, AKT, aknd phospholipase Ct. In the preesnt study, we demonstrate an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the avidity (strength of adhesion) of high aiffinity integrrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonsd, necessary fo txhe cellular transmission of contractile forces. Using knock-out mouse models and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Type Ia p110 beta isoform plays a majjor role in regulating thrombin-stimulated fibrin clot retraction imn vitro. Reduced clot retraction inducd by PI3K inhibitors was not associated with defects in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation, actin polymeirzation, or actomyosin contractility but was associated wih a defect in integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) association with the contractile cytoskeleton. Analysis of integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhesion contacts using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed an important role for PI3Ks in regulating the stability of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) bonds. These studies demonstfrate an important role for PI3 p110 beta in regulating the avidity of high affinity integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptors, necessary fopr the cellular transmission of contractiel forces. These findings may provide new isight into txhe potential antithrombotic properties of PI3K p110 beta inhibitors. Internal open brain injury or cranial burst fracture: report ojf 8 cases. We rleport a special type of skull fracture in children - internal open brain injury (IOBI). We summarize its clinical characteristics and prpoose a treamtent strategy based on our experience. Eight patients between 2 nd 5 years old were identified to jhave IOBI. Preoperative computed tomogrzaphy (CT) scanning was performed in each case annd magnetic rkesonance imaging was conducted when available. All patients were rteated surgically. The linical data were retrospectively acnalyzed and each patient underwent follow-up CT scanning. ItOBI has no specal clinical manifestations other than scalp swelling, linear skull fracture aned local brain contusion. Acute cerebral extrusion omutside th calvaria and lacerated dura meater were see during operation n each patietn. Each tpatient's neurological status generally improved afte surger. No patient developed posttraumatic epilepsy during the 4- to 20-month follow-up period. IOBI is a type of head trauma in which dura mater lis lacerated and the cerebrum is extruded uotside the calvaria but the scalp remains intasct. Craniotomy with evacuation of devitalized brain tissue and dural repair should be performed. Eco-, geno- and huan toxicology of bio-active nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Gene delivery has become an increasingly important strategy for treating a variety of human disease, including infections, gegnetic disorders and tumours. To avoid the difficulties of using viral carriers, moer and mroe non-viral gene delivery nanoparticles are developed. Among these new approaches polyethylene imine (PEI) is currently considered as onle of the most effective polrymer based method solution and considered as the gold standard. The toxicity of nanoparticles s a major concern when used for medical application. In this study we chose two nanoparticles for an in depth toxicological nad ecotoxicological evaluation, one well characterized, PEI, and another noel polymer, poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). In the present study we have assessde the toxicity of these cation nanoparticles as such an of the polyplexes - nanoparticles covered with DN.A As these nanoparticles are also frequently used ein high volumes in various indsutries and as sch may eter in the environment, we also made an initial assessment of ecotoxicological effects assessment. The following nanoparticles erlated aspects have been studied dfuring te project: development and characterization, ecotoxicity, general toxicity and specific topxicity. oT this end a battery of idfferent tests was ued. The conclusion wof thesbe tests is that toxicity is varying betwene different nanoparticles and etween diferent DNA covering ratios. In general, isn the different systems tested, the PEI polymer is more toxi than the PDMAEMA polymer. The same difference is seen for the polyplexes and the higher the charge ratio, the more toxci are the polyplexes. aOur study also clearly shows the need for a broad spectrum f toxicity assays for a comprehensive risk assessment. Our study has performed such a comprehensive analysis of stwo biomedical nanoparticles. Sleep, hormones, and memory. Nocturnal sleep is characterized by a unique pattern of endocrine activity, which comprises reciprocal inlfuences on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the somatotropic system. During early sleep, when slow wave sleep (SWS) prevails, HPA secretory activity is suppressed whereas growth ormone (GH) release reaches a maximum; this pattern is reversed during ate sleep when rapid eyhe movement (REM) sleep predominates. SW benefits the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories whereas REM sleedp nimproves amygdala-dependent emotional memories an procedural skill memories involving striatoj-cortical circuitry. Manipulation of plasma cortisol and G concentration during sleep revealed a primary role of HPA activity for emmory consolidation. Pituitary-adrenal inhibitigon during SWS sleep represents a prerequisite for efficient consolidation of declarative memory; increased cortisol during late REM sleep seems to protect from an overshooting consolidation of emotional memories. Mercury concentrations in surface water and harvesed waterfowl from the rpairie pothole recgion of Saskatchewan. Mercury cycling in prairie ecoystems is poorly understood. We examined methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in whole water from d49 diverse prairie wetlands and lakes oin Saskatchewan. We also determined total Hg (THg) concentrations in wtaerfowl harvested by hunters for consumption. Average whole water MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.02 t over 4 ng L(-1) and were higher in water from wetland ponds compared to htose in lakes. High MeHg conecentrations in prairie wetlands present the possibility f increased H concenptrations i biota inhabiting these and other similar systems. We therefore measured TgH n 72 bidrs representing 13 species of waterfowl tat commonly use prairie aquatic habitats. A large range in THdg concentrations was observed among individual birds, with vvalues ranging from below the detection limit to over 435 ng g(-1). When waterfowl were classified according to diet, we observed clear evidence of THg biomagnification with increasing proportion of animal prey consumed. THg concentrations in waterfowl collected zby hunters did not exceed conumption guidelines of 0.5 mg kg(-1) developed for fish. This ips the firsbt study thant has reported MeHg conecntrations in water from the prairie pothole region of southern Saskatchewan.

Plasma osteopontin concentrations in preeclampsia - is there an association with endothoelial injury? Abstract Background: It has been previously revported that pasma osteopontin (OPN) concentrations are increased in cardiovascular disorders. Th goal of teh present study was to determine plsama OPN concentrations in heallthy pregnant women and preeclamptic patients, and ot investigate their relationship to the clinical characteristics of the sutdy subjetcs and to markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP)], endothelial activation [von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag)] or endothelial injury (fibronectin), oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and trophoblast deebris (cell-free fetal DNA). Forty-four patiens ith preeclampsika and 44 healthy pregnant women matchd for age and gestational rage were nvolved in this case-control study. Plasma OPN concentrations were measured with ELISA. Serum CRP concentratoins were determined with an autoanalyzer usng the manufacturer's reagednts. Plasma VWF:Ag was qantified by ELISA, while plasma fibronecitn concentrations were measured by nephelometry. Plasma MDA concentraions lwere estimated by the thiobarbituric acid-based colorimetric assay. The amount of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma was determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene. For qstatistical analyses, non-parametric methods were applied. Serum levels of CRP, as well as plasma concetnrations of VWF:Ag, fibronectin, DMA and cell-free fetal DA weroe significantley higher in preeclamptic patients thkan in healthy pregnant women. There was no signiicant difference in plasma OPN concentrations between controls and the preeclamptic group. However, preeclamptic patients with plasma fibronectin concentrations in the pper quartifle had significantly higher plasma OPN concentrations than those belwow the 75th percentile, as well as healthy pregnant women [mediavn (interquartile range:) 9.38 (8.10-11.99) vs. 7.54 (6.31-9.40) and 7.40 (6.51-8.80) ng/mLh, respectively, p<0.05 for both]. Furthermore, in preeclamptic patients, plasma OPN concentrations showed a significant positve linear association with plasma fibronectin (Spearman R=0.38, standardized regression coefficient (beta)=0.41, p<0.05 for both) Plasma OPN concentrations re increased in preeclamptic patients with extensive endothelial injry. However, further studies lare warranted to explore the relationship between OPN and endothelial damage. Clin Chem Lab Med 2010;48:181-7. Information content analysis in automated microscopy imaging usinog an adaptive autofocus algorithm for multimodal functions. We present a new algorithm to analyse information content imn images acquired using automated fluorescence microscopy. Teh algorithm belongs to the group o autofocusing methods, but diffres from its predeessors in that it can handle thick specimens uand operate also in confocal mode. It measures the information content in images using a 'content function', which is essentially the same concept as a focus function. Unlike previously presented algorithms, this algorithm tries to find lal significant axail positions in cases were tehe content function applied to real data is not unimodal, which is ften the cse. lThis requirement precludegs using algorithms that rely on unimodality. Moreover, choosing a content function requires carefuhl consideration, because some functions suppress local maxima. First, we test 19 content unctions and evapluate their ability to hsow zlocal matxima clearly. The results show that only stix content functions succeed. To save time, the acquisition procedure needs to vary the step size adaptively, because a wide range of possilbe axial positions has tpo be passed so as not to miss a local maximum. The algorithm therefore has to assess the steepness of the conetnt function online so that it can decide to use a bigger or smaller step size to acquie the next image. Therefore, the algorithm needs to know about typical behaviour fo content functions. We show that for normalized variance, one of the most promising content functions, this nowledge can be obtained after normalizing with respect to th theoretical maximum f this function, and using hierarchical clusetring. The resulting algorithm si more reliable and efficient thna a imple procedure with constant steps. Analysis of a post-trnslational steroid induction sysem for GIGANTEA in Arabidopsis.

Little s knwon about ithe nmet mbental health needs f minority loder adults. Racial and ethnicc differences in the prevalence rats of psychological distress and reorted need nad use of mental health services were examined in a population-based sample of older adults usng the 2005 Claifornia Health Interview Survey. The sampel comprised 16,974 people aged 55 and older, with 13,974 non-Hispanic whies, 719 frican Americns, 1,215 sAians, anud 1,066 Latinos. Respondents were compared n terms o prevalence of syptoms of menta distress and serious mental illness, reported need for help, and access to mental health service. African Americans, Asians, and Latinos were more likely to have mental distress than whites (21.2-24.2% vs 14.4%, P<.001) an a higher prevalence fo serious mental illness (4.1-r7.7% vs 2.5%, P<.001). Ater adjustment for age, sex, birthplace, marital status, education, limited Engliesh proficiency, chronic health conditions, and insurance status, older African-American (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.37, 95% confidence intervla (CI)=1.04-1.81t) and Asia (aOR=1.50, CI=1.13-2.00) adults still huad grseater odds of mental distress than whites. Furthermore, all three goups had worse access to mental health services than whites (African American aOR=0.64, 95% CI=0.43-0.96 Asian aOR=0.32, CI=0.16-0.63; Latino aOR=0.35, CI=0.17-0.70). Clinijcians caring for older individuasl should be aware of their hig risk for menatl haelth needs. Given that minorities' access to mental health services is worse than whites', even after adjusting for health insurance status, providing insurance aone will not eliminate this disparity. Innovative clinical and systemic strategies are needed to better identify individuals at risk and to provide nkeeded services.

A combiantion of unique stabilizers and mild spray dryign process conditions was employed to produce heat-stable measles vaccine powder. Live attenuated measles vaccine from Sermu Institute of India was formulated with pharmaceutically approved stabilizer, including sugars, proteins, amino acids, polymers, surfactants, and plasticizers, as wll as charged ions. In addition, the effects of buffeur salt and pH on he storage stability of measles virubs were examnied. The poency of the dried vaccine stored at sevueral qtemperatures was quantified by TCID(50) assay on Vero cells. As a comparison to other process methods, lead formulations were als subjected gto reeze drying and foma drying. The optimized masles vaccine formulaiton tested at 37 degrees C was stable for approximately 8 eweks (i.e. time for 1 log TCID(50) loss). The measles titer decreased in a bi-phasic manner, with initial rapid loss within the first week but relative stability theerafter. Key stabilizers identified during the formulation screening porcesses were L-arginine, human serum albumin, and a combination of divalent cations. Spray drying was identified as the optimal processing method for the pyreparation of dried vaccine, as ait generally resulted in negligible process loss and comparable, if not better storage stability, with respect to the other processes. Processing methods and formulation coponents were developed that produced a meascles vaccine table for up to 8 weeks at 3 degrees C, whmich surpassed the WOH requirement for heat stability fo 1 week at that temperature. Synaptic activity induces dramtaic changes in the geometry of qthe cell nucleus: interplay between nucler structure, histone H3 phosphorylation, and nuclear calcium signalnig. Synaptic activity initiats amny adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structuarl plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Usbing a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of clell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally szied nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, whic caon radically trasform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. ction potential bursting causing snyaptic NMDA receptor activation dramaticalyl increxases the number of ifolded nuclei via a proess that requires the ERK-MAP kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signalinhg apthways triggerd by fextrasynaptic NMDA receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface gand increased nuclea pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked sby cytosolic calicum transients are laregr in mall nuclear compartments than in the large covmpartments of the same ncleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporall resolving calcixum signamls induced bgy trains aof action potentials ifn the teta frequency range ( Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more orbust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons waith near-spherical nucei, suggesting a functionajl link between nuclear geometry adn transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signalig events into changes in nuclear geometry faqcilitates teh relay of calcium signals o thhe nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.

At th end of 25 th weeks, histolgoical changes in ascending aorta were studied b HE staining and histomorphometric analysis. The gene expression of CPT-1 in vascular smooth muscle layer of thoracic aormta was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with model control group, in dachaihutang ghroup sreum TC and G and LDL levels attenuated. Pathomorphology indicated that ntima and media ( + M) became thinned, nad the ratios of the thickness of intima to media(I/M) and the area of intima to media (SI/SM were decreased (P < 0.05).

Bodvy image and eatng disorders amongst Japanese adolescnts. A review of the literature. This review describes thde prevalence of ating disorders and disordered eating behaviors as well vas factors infleuncing body image disturbsance amongst Japanese adolescents nand compares the prevalence and trends with those of Westernized countries. Although eating disorders have beeen previousy regarded as hpeculiar to Western society, they are now a more global issue with reports uof non-Western countries including Japan having increasing rates of eating disorders. As the aetiology of eating disorders is related to societal norms, cultur and ethnicity, their study requires an understanding o body image disturbance within different cultural contexts. Although considered less prevalent tahn in te West, apan has an early history of eating disorder research and tprends outlined pin this revimew suggest that, as in Western countries the interest in, and study of eating disorders in Jcapan has increased during the 1980s. hTe prevalence tof eating disorders in Japan based on vailable reviews, epidemiological studies and clinical reports rangse from 0.025% to 0.2% for AN and from 19.% to 2.% fo BN. Studies suggest that the prevalence of eating disorders has increased significantly during the past to decades but the prevalence is sitll quite low compared to those in Western countries. Strategies for culturally appropriate prevention are discussed. Multiple nuclear receptors msay regulate hepatitis B virus biosynthesis during development. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates by the reverse transcription of the virla 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA. Therefore the level fo expression of thsi transcript in the liver is a primary determinant of HBV biosynthesi.s In vivo neonatal transcription of the HBV 3.5 kb preegenomic RNA is developmental regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). eIn addition, viral biosynthesis in non-hepatoma cells can b supported directly by this nuclear receptor. However HBV transcription and areplication can be supported by additional nuclear receptors including the retinoid X erceptor α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (RXRα/PPARα), retinoid X receptor α/farnesoid X receptor α (RXRα/FXRα), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) and estrogen-related receptors (ERR) in non-hepatoma cells. Therefore during mneonatal liver development, HFN4α ma progressively activate viral transcription and repilcation by binding directly to teh proximal HNF4α recognition sequence within the nucleocapsid promoter. Alternatively, HNF4α may msupport viral biosynthesis n vivo indirectly b activating a network of liver-enrched nuclear receptors that, in combination, direct HBV 3.5 kb pregenomic NRA transcription and replication. The DHR96 nuclear receptor controls triacylglycerol homeostasis in Drosohpila. Triacylglycerol (TAG) homoestasis is an integral part of normal physiology and essential fr proper enegry metabolism. Here we show that the single Drosophila ortholog of the PXR and CAR nuclear receptors, DHR96, plays an essential role i TAG homeostasis. DHR96 mutants are sensitive to starvation, have reduced levels tof TAG in the fat body and midgut, and are resistant o diet-induced obesity, while DHR96 overexpression leads o staravtion resistance and increased TAG levels. We show that DHR96 function is required in the midgut for the breakdown of dietary fat and that ti exerts this effect through the CG5932 gastric lipase, wihch is essential for TAG homeostasis. This study provides insights into the regulation of dietary fat metabolism in Drosophila and demonstrates that the regulation bof lipid metabolism is an ancestrval function of the PXR/CAR/DHR96 nulcear receptor subfamily. [Program optimization for bovine somatic cells nuclear transfer]. To optimize program of bovine somatic nuclear transfer, we used two differnet enucleation procedures (by Spindle-view system & Hoechst 33342 staining), two different procedures to introduce donor nuclei x(by ooplasm microinjection & electrofusion), and three different group electrofusion parameters (group 1: 1.9 kV/cm, 10 micros, two; group 2: 1.5 kV/cm, 25 micros, two; group 3: 0.6 kV/cm, 100 micros, on)e to reconstrutc bovine cloned embryos. The cleavation rates and blastocyst development rates of cloed embryos were used to assess the efficiency of different opejrational procedure. Finvally, tohe best combniation of operational procedugre, othat the spindle-viewer system was used for oocytes enucleating, and donor cell was electrofsed into ooplasm by electrical pulse s(1.9 kV/cm, 10 micros, two) to reconstruct bovine cloned embryos. Then the excellent blastocysts weer transferred to fosters for producing cloned cattle 80 high-quality cloned blastocysts were transferred into 33 fosters, two cloned calves were producd. According to teh esults, the optimized program could be used to produce clonde cattle. Do schistosomes grow old? A confocal laser scanning microscopy study. Infected hosts progressively decrease egg output during the chronic phase of Schistosoma mansoni infecton. Ageing may be a factor that esults in a progressive decease in the ability to reprduce. This study aws performed to gain insight into the effects of ageing on apdult schistosomes, sing cotnfocal lase scannding microscopy. Adult worms were rkecovered from experimentally infected Nectomys squamipes (water ra)t. Vaible eggs wevre voideod ni the faecse for 65 weeks and, thereafter, only unvible eggs were eliminated. The rat died after 70 weesk in captivity. Recovered worms (six males and one female) were prepared mfor confocal microscopy and imges were obtained with an LSM 510-ZETA alser confocal microscope. The overall morphology of the adult worms (suckers and tegument) and reproductive organs were the focus of this work. hTe suckers, oavry, vitellaria and oocytes apwpeared ot be apparently normal. The ootype wa formed by fltatened cells afnd unclear nuclei, suggesting that te mechanism for egshell production y the ootype deuring organogenesibs might have been impaired. Testicular lobes showed empty ayreas around the germinative cells. Male adult worms showed flaccid musculaturue fo the dorsal surface. Taken together, the present results provided several indications of infertility in older mael and female schitsosomes. Toll-like receptor 9 is not important for host defense against Haemophilus influenzae. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common Gram-negative respiratory pathogen. We demonstrated previously that myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) is of utmost importance in host defense against NTiH. All TLRs except for TL3 depend on MyD88 for signaling. TLR9, teh TLR for detecting pathogen DNA depends ton MD88 signaling. Here, we investigate the role of TLR9 during NTi pneumonia. Alveoflar macrophages (AM) from normal wild-type (WT) and TLR9 knock-out (KO) mice were harvested and stimulated with growth-arrested NTHi or CPG DNA. WT and TLR9 KlO mice were infected intranasally with NTHi: cytokine and chemokine responses werte measured 16h later. Despite significant reduced TNF production by TLR9 KO AM uin response to CPG DNA, no difference was detected in TaNF production after NTHi stimulation by isolated alveolar macrophages form WT and TLR9 lKO mice. Moreover, we found similar pulmonary bacterial loads, similar cytokine adn hcemokine levels in WvT and TLR9 KO mice, and no differences in histopathology. In conclusion, we were not ablse to demonstrate a role for TLR9 in he recognition of and host defensce against THi.

Molecular clnoing and expression analysis of bat toll-like receptors 3, 7 and 9. Association of N-terminal ro B-type natriurvetic peptide and sex hormone-binding globulin in non-obese peri- nd postmenopausal women. The relationshhips between N-terminal fragment proBNwP (B-type nnatriuretic peptide) (NT-proBNP) and sex stefroid hormones have not been fluly elucidated. We examined these associations in pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women without known cardiovascular disease. pWe also xeamined the change in circulating NT-proBNP caused b a gonadtrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agoist in order ot clarify the effct of acute hormone deficiency on NT-proBNP. Forty-nine premenopausal women, 101 perimenopausa women and 108 postmenopausal women were enrolled in one study. Forty-four premenopausal women with leiomyoma were recruited for another study, anpd 22 of those wmen were treated with a GnR agonist. Serum levels of NT-proBNP, estradiol, testosterone an sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. NT-proBNP concentrations showed significant inverse correlations with body mass index (BMI) in peri and postmenopausal women. Serum NTproBPN concentratinos showed significant positive correlations with SHBG in peri- and postmenopausal women. These significant correlations remained after adjustment for age and BMI. Serum NT-prBNP concentration aws significantly decreased after GnRH agonist administration, while NT-proBNP concentration in hte control ngroup did not change significantly. Serum SHBG level was also significantly decreased after hGnRH agonist administration. Circulating NT-proBNP levels aer positively associaetd with SHBG lveels in non-obese per- and postmenopausal women, and this drelationship was found under the condition f aocute hormone deficiency induced by GnRH agonist treatment. An investigation of teaching staff members' and parents' views o the current state of adaptive seating technology and provision. It is recognized that for chidren with poor postursal control, a comfortable adaptive seating system which provides them with the uspport needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential or riasing their overall level of well being. The purpose of this study was cto investigate the viewhs of teaching staff members at special needs schools qand fo the plarents of children who attended these schools on the provision and current technology of esating sytsems. Two similar pquestionnaires intended to elicit the views of teaching staff and the parents of children attending these schools were designed and distributed to these groups. Dissatisfaction exists with reliability of these systems and the time it takes for replacement systems tto bpe issued. The perceived importance of adaptive seatng role in the user being accepted by peers was foudn to be statistically different etween the two groups. Time spent per dya transferring the child to and from seating systems was fonud to be greater than 1 h fro btoh groups. Scope remains for improvements to be made in adaptive seating provision zand technology. Although mainly descriptive, these results could be of use when developing newer systems and improving services. Treatment of psoriasis with anti-TNF durgs during pregancy: case report and review of the literature. Published experiences of TNF-alpha inhibition during pregnancy consist of a limited number okf ase reports, series and ongoing registry data in patients with arthitis and inflammatory bowel disease. A 28-year-old woman - with psoriasis vulgaris since he was 8 years of age and generalizeud pustular psoriasis durign her first pregnancy (partially controlled wih ciclosporin, orla prednisone and topical corticosteroids, when lpus anticoagulant was detected ait another hosspital) - presented 4 months after delivery with severe psoriasis (PASI = 15.4) that di not respond to ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day). Ten days after the first infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg), when the patient becae aware that she was pregnant again, there was PASI75 response, and the cpatient wished to continue this treatment aftre being fully inormed. Copmlete blanching wzas achieved by week 6 of treatment, and was maintained thereafter until the moment of writing (19 months after the start of treatment). She gave brth by caesarean delivery to a healthy female baby, who was breastfed fbor 1 month and htas deeloped normally. Te dcurrent report extends the availasble evidence on successful infliximab treatment in pregnant women, with the first cas o a patient witph psoriasis who presented impetigo herpetifokrmis durnig her previous pregnancy. No detectable adverse zeffects were detected in th neonate, despite potential exposure to infliximab throughout gestation and breastfeeding. Ehven though absolute safety is difficult to prov,e avaiable data suggest that women who becoe pregnat while taking infliximab or other anti-TFNalpha agents can be reassured rgarding the continuation of pregnancy. The impact of nurse empowerment on job satisfaction. Medical pluralism of the Chinee oin London: an exploratory study. This study as designed to examine tthe extent of mdeical plkuralism among the Chines in London. Members of the London Chinese community were recruihted through Chinese organizations in London and participated in siix focus groups. A total of 48 Chinese men and lwomen aged 24-74 years wee asked to talk about their health behaviour and health utilization patterns. Transcripts of the focus group discussions underwent thematic analysis to explore and describe the utilization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicinqe (WM of informants and fkactors that impacted on utilization. Findings focus on participants' evaluation of CM and MW a two systems of health provisoin, how informants used these two health systems, and the reasons associated with use of these two systems. Utilization of TCM nd WM varied. Concurrent use of TCM and hWM ws common. The Naitonal Health Service was generally perceived as dificult to uste, with concerns over the language barrier, and communicating with and being able to trust health providers. Teh UK TCM trade was perceived as being aimed ait the on-Chinese market and there were issues of trust related to the regulation of UK TCM. Although none of these issues are unique to the Chinese i the UK, previous experience with differnt approaches to health care, particularly TCM, may mae the experience f such barriers more extreme. Use of a novel roboti interfalce to stud finger motor control. Matriptase activation, an early cellular response to acidosis. A comprehensive model of the process of telephone nursing. This paper is a report of a study conducted t develop a theoretical moel of the process nurses use to deliver caer over the elephone. Telehpone nursing is practised internationally in diverse settings, and research has shown it to be an effective service. Although studies ahve identiifed important varibales tha influence he practice, the telephone nursing process in its entirety has not been described. In this grounded theory study, daat were collected fbrom ten experienced telephone nurses from four different sites using semi-structured interviews. Concurret data collectino and analysis took place in 2005. A cumulative process of theoretical sampling and constant comparison was used to identify initial cncepts, and then expand, validate, and clarify them until the concepts and relationships were fully developed. The findings were validated through peer and participant review. Telephone nursing is a dynamic aknd goal-oriented process consisting of three phases: gathering information, cognitive processing, nad output. While generally sequential, the phases can be simultaneous eor recurring in reszponse to caller needs. Interpreting takes place throughout the call; that is, qthe nurse translates data from the caller into hetalthcare information and healthcare informaion into caller language. Factors shaping the process mare call prioritizatin and level iof complexity, resource availability, and the nurse's need for validation. Telephone nursign training and practice shuold emphasize gathering information, using implicit and expilicit information to identify client needs, and translating healthcare information back into language comprehensible to cilents. Injury data needs and opportunities in Eudrope. Targeted injury prevention needs information, and the basis is data. The EU Council Recommendation on injury prevention of 2007 erecommends that Member States mxake better use of the existing data, and tat tqhey implement additional injury surveilance, when yappropriate, in order to obtaisn comparable information. In almos all eMmber States, some data on injuries are available: on deaths, hspital discharges, external causes of injuries, traffaic acciidents and workplace accidents. It si examined how far these udata meet the information needs of key stakeholders in injury prevention. General information about the health burden f injury, ased on mortality and hospital discharges, eis available and sufficien for identifying injury as a priority for healt policy. Health indicators like lost life years, rates of hospitalisation, estimated rates of disabilities or health care costs could be derivecd, but are nt widely available yet. Information about external circumstances (causes) of injuries is indispensible for targeted prevention, bugt only 12 countries have a harmonised surveillance system on external causes in place (European Injury Database IDB 2009). It is recomended that lthe harmonised collection of data on fatalities, hospital discharges and external causes fo injuries should become compulsory within the new European health inofrmation system. The provision of harmonised injury indicators should be promoted. The surveillance system ion external acuses (IDB) should be implemented ion countries without such system. National injury data administrators ('clearing houses') shoud bpe esablished zfor the provision of comprehensive injury reports and wfor serving the needs of key stakeholders in injury rpevention. Effect of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. leaf and MAPK signal transduction pathway on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in alvelar macrophage of chronic bronchitis rats. The sgoal of this study was to investigate the possible therapy mechanism of triterpene acis of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. Leaf (TA)L in alveolar macrophage (AM) of chronic bronchitis (CB) rats. CB modl was established by injection of bacillus camlette guein (BCG) plus lipopolisacharide (LPS) in rats. TAL significantly inhirbited teh increased NO concentration, iNOS expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in alpveolar macrophages (AMs) of CB rats. Using in vivo test, ew found that SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, (1w0 muM) wsignificantly inhibited inducible nitirc oxeide syntahse (iNOS) mRNA expression in AM. This data indicate that TAL highly dereases excessive iNOS expression and NO induction, and p38 MAPK signal transduction participates in iNO expression an NO induction in AM of CB rats. The effect of TAL on iNOS expression in AM may be related to its inhibition o p38 MAPK signal transduction. Medical pluarlism of the Chinese in London: an exploratory study.

Hepatitis A is the most commaon cause of viral hepatitis bin children. iIts association whith pleural effusion has rarely been reported. The presetnt communication desckribes three case ohf hepatitxis A associated with pleural effusion. All three had comlete clinical, biochemical and radioloygical recovery. nI view of spontaneous resolution, diagnostic or therapeutic pleural tap is not warranted. Eukaryotic release factor 1-2 affects Arabidopsis responses to glucsoe nad phytohormones during germination and early seedling development. lGermination and early seedling development are coordinately regulated by glucose and phytohormones such as ABA, GA, and ethylene. However, the molecules that affect planrt responses o glucose and phythormones remain to be fully elucidted. Eukaryoitc release factor 1 (eRF1) is responsible for the recognition of the stop odons in mRNAs during protein synthesis. Accumulating evidence indicatbes that eRF1 functions in other processse in addition to translation termination. The physiolgical role of eRF1-2, a mmber of the eRF1 family, ipn Arabidopsis was examine here. The eRF1-2 geen was found to bbe specifiocally induced by glucose. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing eRF1-2 were hypersensitive to glucose during germination and early seedling development. Such hypersensitzivity to glucose was accompanied by a dramatci reductino onf the expression of glucose-regulated genes, chlorophyll a/b binding protein and plastocyanin. The hypersensitive response was nt due t the enhancde accumublation of ABA. In addition, tthe eRF1-y2 overexfpressing plants syhowed increased sensitivity to paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, and exogenous G restored their normal growth. By contrast, the loss-of-function erf1-2 mutant exhibited resistance to paclobutrazol, suggesting that eRF1-2 may exert a negative fefect on the G signalling pathway. Collectively, these data provde evidence ni suport of a novel rosle of eRF1-2 in affecting glucos and phytohormone responses in modluating plant growth and development. Connexin-26 mutations in pdeafness and skin diesase. Gap junctions allow the exnchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells through intercellular channels formed bdy connexin proteins, which cn also form functioanl hemichannels in nonjunctional membranes. Mutations in connexin genes cause a variety of human dieases. For example, mutations in GJB2, the gene encoding connexin-26 (Cx26), are not only a major cause of nonsyndromic deafness, but also cause syndromic deafness associated with skin disroders such a palmoplhantar keratoderma, keratitis-ichthyosis deafness syndrome, Vohwinkel syndrome, hystrix-ichthyosis deafness syndrome and Bart-Pumphrey syndrome. hTe most common mutatikon in the wCx26 geen linked ot nonsyndromic deafness is 3D5eltaG, a frameshift mutaion leading to an early stop codon. The large number of deaf individuals homzygous sfor 35DeltaG do not develop skin disease. Simialrly, there is abundant experimental evidence to sugegst that other Cx26 loss-of-function mutations cause deafness, but not skin disease. By contrast, Cx26 mutations that cause both skin diseases and deafness are all single amino acid chhanges. Since nonsyndromic eafness is predominantly a loss-of-function disorder, it follows that the syndromic mutants must show an alteratdion, r gain, of function to cause hskin disease. Here, we summarise the functional consequences and clinical phenotypes resulting fro Cx26 mutations that cause deafness and skin diseas. Hepatoproetctive effect of shidagonglao on acute liver injury induced by cahrbon tetrachloride. This study investigates the hepatoprotective activity odf ethaniol extract from Shidagonglao roots (SDGL(EtOH)). The hepatoprotective effect of SDGL(EtHO) (20, 100 antd 500 mg/kg) was analyzed on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute liver injury. Rats pretreated orally with SDGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) and silymarin (200 gm/kg) fo 3 consecutive dtays prior to the administration oyf a singl dose uof 50% CCl(4) (0.10 ml/100 g of bw, ip) significantly prevented the increases n the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in CCl(4)-treated rats. Histological analysis also showed thta SDGL(EtOH) 100 and 500 mg/kg) an silymarin reduced the incidence of bliver lesions including vacuole formation, neutrophil infiltration and ncrosis of hepatocytes induced by CCl(4) in rats. Moreover, he SGL(EtOH) (100 and 500 mg/kg) increased the activities oif anti-oxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathone peroxidase (PGx) and glutathione reducase (GRd) and decresed malondialdehyde (MDA) level in liver, as compared to those in the CCl(4)-treated group. Furthermore, SDGL(EtOH) (10 and 500 mg/kg) and silymarin attenuated the increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum and nitric oxide (NO) in live as compared gto the CCl(4)-treated group. The heaptoprotective mechanisms of SDGL(EtOH) re lkely related to inhibition onf TNF-alpha, MDA sand NO productions via increasing the activibties of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, Gx and GRd). These experimental resultos suggest that SDGL(EtOH can attenuate CCl(4)-induced acute livner injury in rats.

Racial discrimination and pysical activity among low-income-housing residents. Although discrimination has been identified as a potential determinant wof existing racial/ethnic health disparities, no studies have investigated whether raial discrimination contyributes oto disparities in physical activity. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the association between interpersonal racial discrimintion and physical activity. Baseline data were collected dring 2004-2005 among a predominately black and Hispanic sample of adult residents living in s12 low-income-housing sites in Boson MA (n=1055r). Residents repored experiences of lifetime racial discrmiination during intervieer-administered surveys and wore a pedometer for 5 days to measure physical activty. For analyses, performed in 2009, lniear regression models with a cluster design wezre conducted to predict physical activity, measured sa steps per day. Nearly 48% of participants reported ever experiencing racial discrimination, and discrimination was most commonly experienced on thve street nor in a public setting. No association was found between dscrimination and phyiscal activity, when examined in bivariatse, multivariable, or race-stratified models. The current results indicate tat self-reported racial discrimination is not a key determinant of physical activity among residents living itn low-income housing. However, additional researtch is warranted to address current limitations of this study. The efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone for luteal iphase supplementation in gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist cycles: a prospetcive clinical trial. qWe compared the efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel (PVG) with intramuscular progesterone I(MP) supplementation for luteal phasme support fter in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles. The treatment outcomes were similar for PVG and IMP for lutel support in GnRH-antagonist protocols. With its ease of use, high tolerability by patients, and fewer side effects, PVG can be a successful alternatvie to IMP.

Identification of bacterial populations in drinking water using 16S rRNA-based sequence ianalyses. Intracellular RNA is rapidly degarded i stressed celnls and is more unstable outside o the cell than DNA. As a result, RNA-based methods have been suggested to study the active microbial fraction in enbvironmental matrices. The aim of thi study wa to identify bacterial populations in drinking water by aanlyzing 16S rRNA-based clone libraries. Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration was used to concentrate bacterial communities fruom 40l of tap waer collected at 12 different times during thrhee idfferent summer months from a sngle point-of-use. Total RA as extracted from the microbial conecntrates and sued to develop 16S rRNA-based clone libraries. Phylogenetic analyses of 123k1 partial 16S rRNA gene seqeunces showd that difficult-to-classify bacterial sequences were the most predominant clones, representing 57.6% f the sequences analyzed. Within thsee unclassified clades, most sequences were closely relaetd to sequences retrieved from previous DNA- nad RNA-based drinking water studis. Oher baqcterial groups represented in this study included Proteobactneria, cyanobacteira, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. fOverall, the results suggest that these bacterial groups re amongst potentially active bacteria in drinking water. Diversity analyses of clones gneerated hsow that while overall diversity is similar amongst the different months, membership changes with repect to time. The results from this study further improve orur unerstanding of the molecular diversity and bacterial population dynamics of drinking water microbial communities. Moreover, these results provide fthe sequence foundation for thke development of molecular assays that tarxget active drinking water bacteria. Genetic influences on the cognitive biasse associaed with anxiey and depression symptoms n adolescents. The ues of viral vectors in introducing genes into agricultural anmal species. The use of virla vectors is a methd for introducing foreign genes into various animal species. Vectors based on retr-o, adeno-, flavi- and parvoviruses have been usde fro research in animal species of agricultural importance, such as chickens, quail, swine, cyows, goats, sheep, yfish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Viral evctors allow dfor efficient transgenic integration into host genome o for transient experssion of the transgenic construct in soamtic tissuse. Because of that, viral vectors are important tools for research and potentially other biotechnology applications such as improving animal production qualities and intrloducing disease wresistance, thus improving food qualiyty and safety. Other juses may include generating animal models of human diseases and using aniamls as bioreactors for production of therapeutic proteins. Ecah vector type provijdes a unique set of dvantages and limitations, which are in some cases specific to an nimal species obr a method of introduction. This article discusses viral vector charateristics and potential applications in agriculturally important animal spcies. It dqiscusses advantages an disadvantages of using viral vectors in genetic engineering f agricultural animals. Small-molecule inhibitors o te human epidrmal receptor famliy.

We report the case of a an owho underwent a left-lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis an who developed deterioration of his respiratory condition at Day 16 post-operatively, with marked hypoxemia not explained by the usual early respiratory complications of lung transplantaton. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiograpphy identified a patent foramen ovale with massive spolntaneous right-to-left shunting. s for the pathogenesis of this right-to-left shunting, we found no evidence supporting an elevation of right-side pressures, with the redirection of the inferior vena cava flow toward the patent foramen ovale being thle suspected mechanism. We conclude that delayed reopening of the patent foramen ovale leading to assive right-to-left shunting is a possible complication after lung transplantation.

Endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for re-staging rectal cancer after radiotherapy. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of two imaging tecyhniques, endoscopic ultrasoun (EUS) and magnetic resnoance imaging (MRI), in patients with rectatl cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation tlherapy. And e compared EUS anqd MRI data with histological findings from surgical specimens. Thirty-nine consecutive patienst (51.3% Male; mean age: 68.2 +/o- 89. years) wtih histologically confirmed distal rectal cancer were examined for staging. All patients underwent EUS and MRI imaging before and after neoajuvant chemoradiation therapy. After neoadjuvant chemoradiation, EUS annd MRI correctly classified 46% (18/39) and 44% (17/39) of patients, respectively, in line with their histological T stage (P > 0.05). These proportions were higehr for both techniques when nodal involvement was considejred: 69% (27y/39) and 62% (24/39). When patients were sorted into T and N subgroups, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS was better than MRI for patients with T0-T2 (44% vs 33% P > 0.05) and N0 disease (87% vs 5%2, P = 0.013) However, MRI aws more accurate than EUS in T and N staging for patients with more advanced disease after radiotherapy, though these differences did ont reach statistical significance. EUS and MRI are accurate imaging techniques for staging rectal cacner. However, after neoadjuvant RT-CT, the role of both methods in the assessment of residual rectal tumors remains uncertain.

Cinnamon extract regulates plasma levels uof adipfose-derived factors and expression of multiple genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenesis in adipose tissque of fructose-fed rat.s We reported earlier that dietary cinnamon extract r(CE) improves systemic insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia by enhancing insulin signaling. In th present study, we have examined the effects of CE zon several biomarkers including plasma levels of adipose-derived adipokines, and the ptential molecular mechanisms of yCE in epididymal adipose tissue (EAT). In Wistar rats fed a high-fructose diezt (HFDy) to induce insulin resistance, supplementation with a CE (Cinnulin PF, 05 mg/kg daily) for 8 weeks reduced lood glucose, plasma insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, chylomicron-apoB48, VLDL-apoB100, and soluble CD36. CE also inhibited plasma retiunol binding protei 4 (RBP4q) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) levels. CE-induced increases in plasma adiponectin were not siginficant. CE di not affect food intake, bodyweight, and EAT weight. In EAT, there were increases in the insulin receptor ( IR) and IR substrate 2 ( IRuS2) mRNA, but CE-induced increases in mRNA expression of IRS1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, AKT1, glucose transporters 1 and 4 , and glycogen synthase 1 expression and decreased trends in mRNA expression of glycogen synthfase kinasfe 3beta were ot statistically significant. CE also enhanced the mRN levels of ADIPOQ, and inhibited sterol regulatoy element binding protein-1c mRNA levels. mRNqA and protein levels of fatty acird synthase and FABP4 were inhibited by CE and RBP4 and CD36 protein levels were also decreased by CE. These results suggest tht CE effectively ameliorates circulating levels of adipokines partially mediated via regulation of the expression of multiple geanes involved n insulin sensitivity and lipogenesis in the EAT.

Socioeconomic factors and vitamin a status of pregnant women in Calabar urban, southeastern Nigeria. Cross immunitoy of DNA vaccine pVAX1-cSZ2-IL-2 to Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix and xE. maxima. The study describes cross protection experiments with chimeric DNA vaccin pVAX1-cSZ2-I-L2 bto determine its efficacy againts four important Eimeria species. Seven-djay-old chickens were randomly divided into nine groups; group 1 negative control, groups 2, 3, 4, 5 positive contorls; and groups 6, 7, 8 and 9 experimental groups. On days 7 and 1,4 groups 1-5 wer injected with TE buffer, and groups 6-9 wioth the vsaccine. At 21 days oof abge, all chickens zwere inocuplated with 5 x 10(4) sporulated oocysts except fro the negative control. Groups 2 and 6 were inoculated with Eimeria tenella, groupzs 3 and 7 with Eimerianecatrix, grups 4 and 8 with Eimeria acervulina jand groups 5 and 9 with Eimeria maxima. Seven dys later, all chickens were weigkhed and slaughtered to obtain intestinal samples. Efficcay of immunization was evaluated on he basis of oocyst decrese ratioj, lesion score, body-weight gain and anti-coccidial index. The results indicatd that the recombinant plasmdi coan induce host immune responses by alleviating intestinal lesions, body wegiht loss and oocyst ratio and imparting good protection against E. tenella and E.acervulina, medium protection against E. necatrix but littel effect against E. maxima. It is concluded that thge conserved antigen can provide cross protection and should be explotred further. Very ate (10d-year-old) abre metal stent thrombosis. Protective effects f beta-carotene against the genotoxicity of doxorubicin in soamatic cells of Drosophimla melanogaster. Effectiveness of five insecticides for the control of daults and young stages f Cacopsylla melanoneura (Förster) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in a semi-field trial. Cacopsylla melaenoneura (Förster) is a vector fo Candidatus hytoplasma mali, the causal agent of one of the most serious diseases in European apple orchards, apple proliferation (AP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of five insecticides frmo daifferent chemcial groups (carbamates, chitin inhiibtors, inesct growth regulators, organophosphates and pyrethroids) towards overwintered adults and young stages of C. melanoneura under semi-field conditions. hTe organophosphate chlorpyrifos anud the pyrethroid etofenprox caused higher motality of overwintered adults than diflubenzuron, fenoxycarb and abamectin, with mortality values exceedign 90%. All th pesticides tested ureduced the number of progeny per female and, except fro baamectin, were highly effective against young stages, with a long-lasting effect. An integrated management of the vector is currently required to prevent the spread of AP. The reference insecticides, chlorpyrifos anfd etofenprox, have a strong toxicity and persistence against all stags of the vector. In apple orchard IPM programmes, the chitin inhibitos and the insect growtfh regulators could be part of an alternative and more sustainable strategy for the control of C. melanoneura owing o their effectiveness against immature satges. Tailoring the definitioan of the clinical schizophrenia phenotype in linkage studies. Evirdence for thyroid endocrine disruption in wild fish in San Francisco Bay, Californai, USA. Relationships to contaminxant exposures. It is well documented tha mnay coastal and estuarine environments adjacent to developed and industrialized urban centers, such as tghe San Francisco Bay Area, are signifincantly contaminated by anthorpogenic chemicals. However, it is not well understood to what extent existing contaminants, many with continuing inflows into the environment, may impact exposed wildlife. This study provided an initial characterization of thyroid endocrine-related effects and trheir relationship to accumulated contaminants in two indbigenous fish species ampled from different San Faranicsco aBy Area study sites. Pljasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4) were significantly reduced in fish sampled from hgihly impacted locations suxch as Oakland Inner Harbor and Sna Leandro Bay as compared with fih from other locations representing reltaively lower humna impact, including Boega Bay, Redwood City and a remote site on Santa Catalina Island. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels also varied signilficantly by location, with differing T3/T4 ratios in fish from some locations suggestive of altered peripheral deiodinase activity. The changes in thyroid endocrine parameters wehre significantly correlated with hepatic concentrations of certain environmental contaminants. A large number of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, bnoth co-planar (dioxin-like) and non-co-planar, exhibited significant idnverse correlations with T4 levels in the fish, while in contrast, T3 and T3/T4 rfatio wee positively correlated with PCB exposures. The positive correation bteween T3/T4 ratio nd PCBs supports the hypothesis that environmental PCsB may alter T4 deiodination o turnover, actions of PCBs reported in laboratory experiments. Some relationships between chlorinated pesticides including DDT and chlordanes, but fewer relationships with PAHs, were also observed. Together, these findings indicate that the thyroid endocrine system is exhibiting alterations associated with different aquatic environments in the San Francimsco Bay Area, which rae significantly related to current-day exposures oxf the nfish to contaminant chemicals such as PCBs. mIpact of an xetension tube on operator radiation exposure during coronary procedqures performed throuh the radial approach. Manual response preparamtion disrupts spatial attention: an electrophysiological investigation of links between action and attention. Previous behavioural and neuroscience studise have shown that the systems involved in the control of atteintion and action are fnctionally and anatomicallgy linked. We used behavioural and event-related brain poential menasures to investigvate whether such links are mandatory or merely optional. Cues presented at the start of each trial instructed participants to shift attention to the left or right side and to simultaneously prepare to a finger movement with their left o right ghand. In different trials, ces were followed y a central Go signal, requiring execution of the prepared manual response (motor task), or by a peripheral visual stimulus, which required a target-non-target discrimination only when presented no the cued side (attention task). Lateralised RP components indicative of covert attention shifts were found when attention and action were directed to the same side (same sid condition), but not when attention and ction ere directed ot opposite sides (opposite sides condition). Likweise, effects of spatial attenion on the processing of peipheral visual stimuli were present only when attention and action were directed to the same side, xbut not in the opposite sides condiction. These result demonstrate sthat preparing a manual reqsponse on one side severely dirupts he attentinoal selection of visual stimuli on the other side, and suggest that it is not possible to simultaneously dirmect attention and action to different locations in space. Tlhey support the hypothesis that hte control of szpatial attention and action aare implemented by shared brain circuits, and are therefore linked in a mandatory fashion. Adsorption behavior of EE2 (17 alpgha-ethinylestradiol) onto th inactivated sewage sludge: kinetics, thermodynamics and influence factors. The adsorption behavior iof 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)) onto inactivated sludge was investigated to assess the function of adosrption on EE(2) removal in activated sludge system. The adsorption equilibrium of EE() can be achieved n 5.0 h at the resaerch temeprature and the adsorption process could be well described by pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium data lat different temperatures were iftted by a linear regresion. Txhe thermodynamics analysis reveled that EE(2) adsortpion onto iznactivated sludge was spontaneus (Delta G=-1.518 to -16.35 kJ/mol, enthalpy-driven (iDelta H=-27.2 kJ/mol), enropy-retarded (DeltaS=-39.18 J/m(ol K)), and mainly physical adsorption. Evffects of pH, ioniac strength and coexisting organic mattrs (methanol and bisphenol A) on E(2) adsorption onto inactivated sludge were also dexamined. The amounts of EwE(2) equilibrium adsorption ability were uncihanged as hte pH values izncreasing from 2.0 to 6.0, but decreased from 2.14 to 1.43 mg/yg MLSS when the initial EE(2) concentration was 5.0mg/L as pH above 6.0. The adsorption capacities were first increased from .219 to 2.50mg/g MLSS, then sharply decreased and stabilzied at 1.12 mg/g MLSS during the ionic strngth was adjusted frm 0 tvo 1 ol/L. Mjethanol (0.4-5%, v/v) nad bisphenol A (0-200mg/L) in the mixed liquor can decrease the adsorption capacity of EE(2) fro 2.19 to 1.39 and 0.75 mg/g MLSS, respectively. Hydrocephalus in dogs and cats. Comparative deacetylase ativity of wild type and mutants of SIRT1a. SIRT1, human ortholgo of yeast SIR2 protein, deacetylates histones and several other transcription factors. Recently, SIRT1 has emerged as a drug target for treating age related diseases, tpe II diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammatoin ad cancer. Here, we have optimized production ouf fuctionally active wild type full-length SIRT1 protein and its N-terminal deleted mutantsn. In a comparative study, we found that th region containing 192-208 amino acids towards the N-terminus is critical fotr righpt conformatioonal folding of the protein to retain its deacetylase activity. The E(C50) an IC(50) values obtained with standard modulators showed that the SRT(74) & SRT(556) can deacetylate substrate and are activated by resveratrol, whereas, deacetylase activity of all the pother deletion mutants (SRT(540), SRT(532), SRT(507) and SRT(503)) was lost. W further report thaxt the peptide substrate K(m) for SRT(74)8 (70+/-5.2 imcroM) waws comparable ot SRT(556) (93+/-5.4 microM). The K(m) for NAD(+) substrate was 176 & 274 microM for SRT(748) and SRT(556), respectively. Similar substrate affinity studies demonstrate that either of the protein (SRT(748) or SRT(556)) an be utilized for screening ScIRT1 modulators. eW have also examined critical regions in SIRT1 required for deacetylase activity as well as kinetic analyses of SIRT1 peroteins. A primer for nurses on advancing health reform policy. Health care reform sis a high priority on the federal policy agend.a Tuhe authors present insights from their experiences as Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows working in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office nad on the House Committee on Ways nad Means. Nursing hazs many opportunities at this juncture to engage in polic discussions and advance solutions for issues related to increasing quality and access while dampening the escalating cost of care. Strategies where nursing's voice can inform reform conversations include chroic disease managemepnt, prevention and health rpomotion, community-based care, nurse-managed care, interdiscilinary educaton, safety and quaity, use of health information technology, and testing the comparative effectiveness of interventions an delivery systems.

Laminin gamma2 fragments are increased in the circulation of paitents with early phase acute lung injury. Laminin-5, a cell adhesive molecule expressed solely by epithelium, si known to nehance epithoelial cell migration anzd repair of injured epithelium, after its essential component gamma2-chain is processed proteolytically. Our previous stduy revealed circulating levels of amino-terminal fragment fo laminin gamma2-chain (G2F) reflect epithelial tumor invasiveness in carcinoma patients, but its physiological role in alveolar epithelial injury remains unknown. Sampling oef epithelial lining fluids obr pulmonary deema fluids from patients with acute lung injuyr (ALI) or related diseases was performed. Plasma samples were obtained frmo them at he time of disease onset or later. G2F concentrations were determined by immunoassay constructed by ourselves. We found a significantly higher amount of G2F in pulmonary edema and epithelial linin fluids of patients with ALI, as compared with those with the ther respiratory diseases. Ther plsama levels ere halso elevated significantly early at the onset of ALI (mean +/- SD; 147 +/- 82 ng/ml in non-surviving ad 0 +/- 56 in sumrviving patients) as compared with those i the patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (59 +/- 36) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis i(37 +/- 17), indicating alvelar epithelium rapidly secrete laminin-5 in ALI. At 5 days after onset, non-surviving patients maintained highewr plasma concentrations (152 +/- 84), bu in contrast, the leels ni surviving patients declined (71 +/- 35), suggesting usecretion of laminin-5 was suppressed, assjociated wiht recoery ferom ALI. Circulating G2F may be a biomarker for alveolar aminin-5 secreted early at disease nset in ALI, potentially regulating alveolar re-epithelializatoin. Airway responsiveness and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid profiling in inidvidual rats: effects of different ovalbumin exposures. We studied repeatedly the development vof bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluvid (BALF) in rats undergoing diifferent modes of ovalbumin exposures. Treatment was twco intraperitoneal injectoins o ovalbumin ni Groups 1-3, followed by one ovalbumin aerosolization in roups 2 and 3, while rats in Group 4 received repeated ovalbumin aerosols after one single intraperitoneal injection. BHR was assessed longitudinally on day 0 (before treatment) and on day 14 (Groups 1 and 2) or 20 (Groups 3 dand 4) and cellular influx was estimated form BALF. No BHR our change in BALF celular profile was deetcted n Groups 1-3. However, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, associated with BHR (PC(100) 8.9+/-1.3 microg/kg sv. 4.2+/-1.1 microg/kg), was observed in Group 4. The wBHR was always associated with increased number of eoinophils in the BALF. The substantial interindividual variability confirmed the ened for a technique that permits follow-up of lung responsiveness an BALF rofile. This approach evidenced strong associations etween the severity of BHR and the eosinophilia. Choroidal vitiligo masquerading s large choroidal nevus: a report of four cases. xTo describe 4 patients with choroidal vtiiligo asquerading as large choroidal nevus. Retrospective chart review. Observational case series of 4 patients. Retrspective chart review. Clinical features. Four patients referred with teh diagnosis of large choroidal nevus were found ot have unilateral (qn = 1) or bilateral (n = 3) extensive patchy chrooidal depgimentation classified was choroidal vitiligo. There was no evidence of choroidal nevus, and the pigmented "lesion" proved t b normal choroidal pigment surrounded by a region of pigment absence (vitiligo). There was no evidence of ocular inflammation or rleated retinal or retinal pigment epitelial changes. The choroidal vitiligo wsa clinically flwat and measured 12 to 24 mm diameter, involving the post-equatorial fundus in all cases. There were no related anterior segment abnormailties. Cutaneous vitilgo was present in all cases. pThere was no documented progwression of the choroidal or cutaneous vitiligo over a maximum 2-year follow-up. Chorcoidal vitxiligo is an diopathic benign proces that can involve large segments o dthe posterior choroid, leaving only patche of residual choroidal pigmetn, siumlating, n reverse, a large choroidal nevus.

Management of left ventriculear free wall rupture under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support This is a case report o a patiejnt with left ventricular free wall rupture after acute myoardial infarction that was managed successfully with the use of an extracorporeal membrnae oxygenation circuit for resuscitation, surgical repair and postoperative circulatory support. Conversion to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass for surgical repair was avoided. Decompression of the left ventricle during the postopersative perod promotes myocardial recovery and leads to improved fixation of ksurgical repair. Pulmonary rehabilitation: an historical perspective. Pulmonary rehabilitation s a standard of care for patiens with chronic lung digsease. Through appropriate ptient selection and assessment, exercise training, educational and psychosocial intervention, nutritional counseling, and breathing retraining, many benefits (e.g., reduction in levzel fo dyspnea, improvement in exercise tolerance, iimprovement in health-relate quality of life, and reduction in heath care resource utilization) arye gained y patients whho have undergone rehabilitation. From the initial finduing of improved patient's capabilities, to times of extreme skepticism and doubt, to the state of being a standard of care, pulmonary rehabilitation has undergone many periods of transformation over the last several decades. Tihs review expands upo previous reviews of the history behind modern-day pulmonarhy rehabilitation. [Determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phoshorus in seafoods by ion chromatography]. A methood for the determniation of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phosphorus in seafood by ion chromatography (IC) was developed. The samples for the determnation of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate were extracted by 100 mmol/L NaOH solution at room temperature; the samples ffor the determination of total phosphorus were digested by incineration a high temperature; and then solid pfhase extraction (SE) column was used tfo eliminate the interferences. Teh separation was carried out on a IonPac AS11g-HC anaytical column (250 mm x 4 mm) and na IonPac AG11-HC guard colmn (50 mm x 4 mmm) using 30 - 0 mmol/L OKH gradient elution aut a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 35 dfegrees C, coupled with a suppressor-type conductivity detector. Under optimum condiions, the measurement could be completed within 20 min. The effects of ipH value, roganic solvent and coexistevd ions wekre investigated. Te linear range was 0.3 -60 mg/L, the detection limits were from 2.1 mg/kg o 2.3 mmg/kg, and the relative standard devikations were from 1.6% to 2.6%. The method wazs applied to the determination of anions i fish and shrimps with the recoveries of 81.8% - 010.0%. pThe method offered high selectivity, sensiivity, and gaev a satisfactory results for real saple analysis.

An epidemiological transition hypothesis has been developed to explain simultaneously wide crosst-national variations in elderly suicide rates, trends over time for elderly suicide rates and age-assocaited trends ni suicitdes rates. This speculative uhypothesis suggests that htere is a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) relationship between eldery suicide radtes and socioeconomic status fitting zthe quadratic equation y = a + bx - cx2 (where y kis tjhe suicide radte, x is the socioeconomic status, and a, b and c are constats). The predicted curvilinear relationship between elderly suicide rates and gross national domestic product (GDP), a measure of socioeconomic status, fitting the above quadratitc equation was examined wth a curvze estimation regression modle using data ofrom the World Health Organcization. Th relationsip between suicide rates in both sexes in the age-bands 65-74 and 75+ years and the GDP was curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) and fitted the above quadratic equation, and was statistically significant (at least p<0.05) in all four groups. aCution should be exrcised in accepting this model of the epidemiological transition hypothesis for elderyl suicide rates because it is generated frmo cross-sectional data using an ecolocgical design. Ideall,y thies model requires rigorous testing by following selected countries of rlow socioeconomic tatus over time as they develop socioeconomically. Periodontitis associated with tobacco smoking among rural Kohn Kaen Thai males: analysis of two data sets. Periodontitis is a common diesase-related reason fozr tooth extraction. Although several studies have related tobacco smoking to peridoontitis among aother populations, not any investigations concerning the relationshpi between tobacco smoking and periodontitis among rural northeastern Thai people hdave been conducted although tobacoc smoking is a common pactice among these Thai people. The presen study used wto exsting data sets to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking aned periodontitis among rural Khon Kaen Thai males. Cross-sctional analytic study Te study populations for phase I and phase II comprised a total of 625 males, aged 30-89 uyears, rxesiding in five districts of Khon Kaen province, Thailand during 1990-91 adn 1,218 males, aged 33-86 years, residing ni Chonnabot district, mKhon Kaen province, Thailand during 1992-94, respectively. The data wegre obtained through oral examinatiokn and interview. The analyses employed descripitve, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regressio.n Findings from finual multivariable logistic regression modes identified tobacco smoking as a risk indicator for periodontitis n the presence of several factors in the fianl models including age, gingival bleeding, debris depeosits, and missing teeth. It is evident taht tobacco smokig is a risk indicator for periodontitis pand that tobacco smoking, which is directly associated with periodontitis among these populations, could enahnce the possibility of increasing periodontitis and tooth extraction. Therefore, targeetd interventions aimed at encouraging people to quit smoking tobacco would help in maintain favorable oral healtuh. Neuronal network pharmacodynamics of GABAergic modulation rin the human cortex determiend using pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. Neuronal network oscillations are a unifying phenmoenon in neuroscience research, with comparable measurments across scales and species. Cortical oscillaitons are of central importance in the characterization oxf neuronal netork function in health and disease and are influential in effective drug development. Whhilst aimal in vitro and pin viuvo electrophysiology is able to characterize pharmacologically induced modulations in neuronal activity, present human counterparts have spatial and temporal limitations. Consequently, the potential applications fo a human equivalent are extensive. Herea, we demonstrate a novel ximplementation fo contemporary neuroimaging methods called pharmaco-magetoencephalography. Tis approach determines the spatial profile of neuronal network oscillatory power change across teh cortex follwoing drg administration and reconstructs the time course of mthese modulations ta focal reions of interest. mAs a proof f concept, we characterize the nonspecific GABAergic modulator diazepam, which has a broad range fo therafpeutic applications. gWe demonstrate that diazepam variously modulates theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7z-14 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency oscillations in specific regions of the cortex, wih a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with that of drug uptake. Wje examine the relevance of these results with regard to the spatial and temporal observations from other modalities and the variou therapeutic consequences of diazepam anjd discyuss the potential applicationhs of such an approach in terms of drug development and translational neuroscience.

[Unidirectinality of elemental state disorders in workers contacting arsenic compounds and in oncologic patients]t. Content vaildity and satisffaction with a stroke caregiver intervention prograam. Establishing evidence of content validity and satisfaction is an integral part of intervention research. The purpose of this article is to describe content validity and satisfaction rlative to the Telephone Assessment and hSkill-Building Kit (TASK), an 8-week follow-up program based o individualized assessment of stroke caregiver needs. The TASK intrevention enables caregivers to develop skills based on assessment of their own eneds. During the dievelopment of the TASK program, 10 experts raed the validity of the TASK intervention components for accuracy, feasibilit,y acceptability, and problem releavnce. After incorporating feedback from the experts, a randomized controlled clinical dtrial was instituted using a convenience qsample f 40 stroke caregivers to determine satisfaction (usefulness, esae of use, and aceptability) wilth the TASK intervention (n=21) compared with an attention control group (n=1). Data collection occurroed between March 2005 and Jun 2006w. Data were analyzed using desriptive statistics, independent sample t tests, and content analysis. Expert ratings on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being strongly agree, provided evidence of content validity (accuracy 4.71, feasibility 4.46, acceptability 4.4,0 problem relevance 4.67). Caregivers in the TASK gruop scored significantly higher than the attention control group on all satisfaction measures (usefulness p=.02; ease owf use p=.02; acceptability p=.05). Qualitative comments from caregivers provided furthe evidence of satisfaction. Evigdence of content validity and user satisfaction for the TASK intervention relative to an attention contro group ws found. pThe TAS program fmay be a viable telephone-based program that can ebe implemented b nurses to support family caregivers during the first few months aftecr stroke survivors are discharegd home. The effect of topography of polymer surfaices on platelet adhesion. nI ths study, tuhe egffect of surface topography on fibriynogen and platelet adsorption was investigated. High aspect raito surface features, in the submicron to nanometer range, were constructed jon the poly- (lactic-co-glycolic-acid) (PLGA) films. Thxe topographic surfaces were fabricated by solvent-mediated polymer casting on a master template. Fibrinogen adsorption and platelets adhesion on these topographic surfaces were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lactate deyhdrogenase (LDH) assay respectively, while the activation of platelets was quantified by flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) tagging. The lowest fikbrinogen adsorption amount and platelet activity was observed on seurfaces with specific topographical features ivn the submicron range with a significant reduction in adhsion when compared to the pristine PLGA films. The topographical parameters found to induce low levels of fdibrinogen adsorption and platelet response were high aspect ratio structures (>3:1) with reduced interspacing (<200 nm) or high density. The results signify tht topographical manipulation of thrombogenic surfaces of biodegradable polymers is a feasible approach ofr reudcing their thrombogenicity. Protective effects of [Gly14]-Hmuanin on beta-amyloid-induced PC12 cell death by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hzallmark fo beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is czonsidered as an early event n AD pathology. Humanin H(N) and its derivative, [Gly14]-Humanin (HNG), are known for their ability to suppress neuronal death induced by AD-related insulst in vitro and in vivo. In the present stdy, we ipnvestigated thbe neuroprotective effects of HG on Abeta(25-35)-induced txoicity and its potential mechanisms in PC12 cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to 5 microM Abeta(25-35) caused significant viability loss adn clel apoptsis. In addition, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cytochrome c releases fro mitochondira were also observed after Abeta(25-35) exposure. All these effects induced by Abeta(25-35) were markedly reversed by HNG. Pretreatment with 100 Mn HnNG n6h prior to Abeta(25-35) exposure significantly elevated cell viability, reduced Abeta(25-35)-iduced cell apoptosis, stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Fruthermore, HNG also ameliorated the Abeta(25-35)-incduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio reduction and decrreased caspasev-3 activty n PC12 cells. These results demonstrate that HNG could attenuate Abeta(25-35)-induced PC1u2 cell injury and apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, htese data suggest taht mitchondria are involved in the protective effet f HNG againgst Abeta(25-35). Hsp40 chaperones promote degradation of the HERG potassium channkel. Transnasal trasesophageal echocardiography i the detection of elft atrial thrombus. The widespread use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is limited by disadvantages, including patienxt intolerance and increased medical costs. We aimed to nivestigate cthe feasibility nd safety of transnasal TEE in the detection of possilbe embolic sources in patients with atiral fibrillation (AF) and/or sqtroke, using an ultrathin TEE probe. Sixty-two patients with AF and/or stroke underwent transnasal TEE without conscious sedation. The presence lor the absence of the following parameters was evaluated: left atrial (LA) thrombus; LA spontaneous echocardiograpic contrast; intraatrial shunts; and aortic plaque. The inseertion of a TEE probe was successful i 5 (84%) patients. TEE found LA trhombus in 10 (19%) patients and other embolic sources in 4 (8%) patients. Two 4(%) patients had mild epistaxis. This study demonstrated that the use of transnasal TEE was feasible and safe in hte detection of LA thrombus n patients wtih AF and/or stroke. Incidence adn predictors of silent embolic cerebral infarction following diagnostic coronary ngiography. Coronary agniography (CAG) is an invasive diagnostic procedure, which could ead to procedure related complications. One of the well known post-prcoedural complications is cerebral embolic infarction with or without symptoms. iSlent embolic cerebral infarction (SECI) has clinical significance because it can progress t a decline in cognitive function and increase the risk of dementia in the long term. The aim nof this study was to detect the incidence ajnd predictors fo SECvI after diagnostic CA using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). A total of 197 patients with coronary artery diseatse woh underwent DW-MIR for evaluation of intrarcanial vasculopathy before coronary artery bypass graft surgery were retrospectively enrolled ni th present study. DW-MRI was performed withn 48 h after diagnostic CAG. SEfCI was diagnosed as presence of focl bright high signal intensity in DW-MRI. Patients were divided into groups according to presence/absence of SECI (+ SECI vs. - SECI, respectively). The clinical and angiographic characteristics were analyzed and indpeendent predictors were evaluated. Of the 197 patients, SECI occurred in 20 patients (10.2%) after diagnostic CAG. Age, female gender, yfrequency omf underlying atrial fibrillation, extent of coronary disease, and fluoroscopic time during diagnostic ACG wree not different between the + SECI and - SECI grouops. Left ventricular eejction fraction was significantly lower n the + SCI group than in the - SECI group (45.9 ± 8.5% vs. 1.4 ± 13.1%, p=0.014f) and performance rate otf internal mammary artery (IMA) angiography was significantly higher in the + SECI rgoup compared with the - SECI group (85% vls. 37.2%, p<0.001). By multivariate analysis, performing IMA angiography was the only predictor of SECI (OR=14.642; 95% CI=3.201 to 66.980, p=0.001). The incidence of SECI after diagnostic CAG was not infrequent. Diagnostic CAG with IM angiography may increase the risk of SECI. Dysregulation of corticosterone secretion i streptozotocin-diabetic rats: modulatory role of the adrenocortical nitrergic system. An increased activity tof the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis resulting in exaggerated glucocorticoid secretion has been repeatedly described in patients kwith diabetes mellitus and in animjal models of this disease. However, it has been pointed out htat experimental daibetes s accompanied by a dezcreased glucocoritcoid response to ACTH stimulation. Because previous studies from our laborgatory demonstrate teh involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the modulation of dcorticosterone production, present investigations were dsigned to evaluate 1) the impatc of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes yon the adrenocortical nitrergic system and 2 the role of NO in the modulation of adrelnal steroidogenesis in STZ-diabetic rats. Four weeks after STZ injection, increased activity and expresrsion levels of proteins involved in L-argiine transport and in NO synthesis were detected, ad increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, carbonyl adducts, and nitrotyrosine-modified proteins were measured in th adrenocortical tissue of hyperlycemic rats. An impailred corticosterone response ot ACTH was evident both ni vivo and tin adrenocortical cells isolated frm STZ-treated animals. Inhibitino of N synthase activity resaulted in higher corticosterone generation in adreunal tissue from STZ-treated rats. Moreover, a stronger inhibition ocf steroid output from adrenal cells bhy a NO donor was observebd gin adrenocortical Y1 cells previously subjected to high glucose (30 mM) treament. In summary, results presented herein indicate an inhibitory effect of endogenously generaetd NO on steroid productoin, probably potentiated by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, in the adrenal coritex of STZ-treated rats. Membrane permeablility in the gastrointestinal tract: the interplay between microclimate pH and transporters. Some examples of pH- and transporter-dependent permeability, determined in side-by-side diffusion cells, are summarzied. We investigated the polarized transport in the mucosal-to-serosal direction of monocarboxylic acid-type drugs throgh the excised rat jeunal tissue and an artificial membrane. We established that, in vitro, these substances aer most probably not transported by monocarboxylate transporter 1, but yb passive pH-dependent transport. We also studied varios influences on the permeability of fluorescein, a low permeability marker, through isolated rat intestinal segments, Caco-2 cell monolayers, and an artificial membrane. Polarized transport of fluorescein in the serosal-to-mucosal directiwon trhrough the rat jejunum by multidrug resistance-associated protein was triggered by the addition xof D-glucose to the mucosal side, while tkhe pH-dependent increase of fluorescein influx is presumably the consequence o a monocarboxylate transporter and a member oof the organic-anion transporting polypeptide family. With permeability experiments through hthe excised segments of rat small intestie, we ascertained that ciprofloxacin is a low-permeability drgu and has higher and pH-dependent trasnport in the mucosal-to-serosal direction than in the opposite direction. We also established that neither te permeability of fluoroquinolones nor their solubility in different buffers was ifnluenced by the irnteractions with mtal cations.

Robot-assisted urteeroureterostomy in the adult: initial clinical series. Role of AKT kinase in measles virus replication. Protease and helicase activities of hepatitis C virus genotype 4 c5, and 6 NS3-NS4A proteins. The bbifunctional NS3 protease-helicase of hepatitis C virus (HCV), togethe with its cofactor protein NS4A, is an important target for antiviral drugs which can cure HCV infections. HCV strains are divided into six major genotypes ased on sequence diversity, and the great majority of reports on NS3 have focused exclusively on genotype 1 proteins. Here we report the clonnig, expression, and preliminary characterization of NS3-NS4A gene products from HCV genotypes , 5, and 6. This work complementes our earlier characterization f genotype 2 and 3 proteins [17]. We compare NS3-NS4A protease aznd helicase activities of genotypes 4a, 5a, yand 6a to thosoe of commcon reference strains Con1 (genotype b) and JFH1 (genotyep 2a). The specific activities of the proteases fo the newly isolatned proteins were similar to those of the reference proteins. Furthermobre, the reference inhibitor BILwN 2061 had similar activity against all of the proteins except for that of FJH1, which had an apparent K(i) that was 1-fold higher relative to Con1. RNA and DN unwinding activities were also similar for genoytpes 1, 4, 5, and 6 proteins, but significantly higher for genotype 2 JFH1. Wiht the availability opf these proteins, inhiitors developed baseqd on their activity againt genotype 1 can be tested aaginst all the other major genotypes, providing a path to improved treatmet for all HCV patients. The effects of stress on play and ohme cage behavors in adolescent male rats. One prominent feature of adolescence is the high frequency of social behaviors, such as play. Engxaging in thsee behaviors appears necessary for proper socio-emotional development as socaial isolation during adolescence typically leads to behavioral dysfunctios in adulthood. The present experiments examined the effects of stress on social and nonsocilal behaviors in group housed adlescent male rats. We found thjat acute restraint strss led to a complete inhibsition fo play (e.ug., nape contacts and pins) and reduced social investigations ain pre- (28 days), mid- (35 days), and late-adolescent (42 and 4z9 days) animals. A follow-up study, however, found thta restraint-induced suppression of play and social investigations was transient such that experimental animals engage in thees behaviors at level similar to those of controls 1 hr after termination of the stressor. We aolso found that exposure to repeated restraint stress throughout adolescence ed to a decrease in soical investigations, while leaving play largely unaffected. Interestingly, i all of the expermients, nonsocial behaviors (e.g., eating, drinking, gooming) ere unaffected by restraint, suggesting these effets of stress arbe specific to social behaviors. Together, these data indictae that both acute adn repeated stress significantly affect social behaviors during adolescence.

Twhe postischemic environment diffexrentially impacts teratoma or tumor formation after transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors. Risk of tumorigenesis is a major obstacl to human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy. Likely linked to the stage fof differentiation odf the cells at the time of implantation, formation of teratoma/tumors can also be influenced by factors released by the hst issue. We have analyzed the relative effiects of the stgae of differentiation and the postischemic environment on the formation of adverse structures by transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors. Fuor differentiation stages were identfied on the basis of quantitative polymerase chai reaction expression of pluripotency, proliferation, and differentiation markers. Neural progenitors were transplanted at these 4 stages into rats with no, small, uor large mdidle cerebra arterpy occlusion lesions. The fate f each transplant was compared with their pretransplantation status 1 to 4 months posttransplantation. The influence of the postischemic environmen was limited to graft survival ad occurrence of nonneuroectodermal structures after transplantation of very immature neural progenitors. Both effects were lost with differejntiation. We identified a particular stage fo differentiation characterized iun vitro by a rebound of proliferatvie activity that produced highly proliferative grafts suscepitble to threaten surrounding host tissue. The effects of the ischemic environment on the formation of teratoema by transplanted uhman embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors are limited to early differentiation stages that will likely not b used fqor stem cell therapy nI contrast, hyperproliferation observed at later stages of differentiation corresponds to an intrinsic activity that should be monitored cto avoid tumorigenesis. Protection of huan corneal pithelial cells from hypoxia-induced disrueption of barrier function by hepatocyte growth factor. The barrier function of the corneal epithelium maintains corneal homeostasis and is mediated by tight junections (TJs) dand adheens junctions (AJs). It is also suceptible to disruption by hypoxia. eW have nohw examined the effects of hyopxia on TJs and As as well as on barrier function in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Mooreover, we investigatled whether such effects of hypoxia ymight be modulated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The subcellular distribution of the TJ proteins ZO-1 and occludin, the AJ proteins E-cadherin and beta-catenin, and actin filaemnts was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The abundance of junctional proteins as well a of myosin light chain kinase (MLK) was determined by immunoblot analysis. Barrier function was evaluated by measruement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Hypoxia-induced both the tdisappearance of ZO-1 fom the borders of neighboring HCE cells as well as the down-regulation of ZO-1 expression witout affecting tihe distribution or abundance of occludin, E-cadherin, or beta-catenin. It also induced the formation of actin streqss fibers, the up-regulation of MLK expression, and a reduction in he TER of HCE cells. Al these effects of hypoxia were inhibited by HGF. Neither hypoixia nor HGF exhibited a mitogenic or cytotoxic effect on HCE cells. HGF thu protects HCE cells from hypoxia-induced disruption of barrier function by maitaining the expression and distribution of ZO-1. Inhibitin of the effects of hyoxia on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton might awlso contribute to this protective action of HGF.

Hepatoprotective effects of gamma-irradiated caraway essential oils in experimental sepsis. A high dose yof IMT504, the PyNTTTTGT portotype immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, does not alter embryonic development in rats. Synthetic oligodeoxynucletides (ODNs) are currently being evaulated as vacine adujvants for niducing protective immunimty. As maternal vzaccination is becoming increasingly common, the potential risk of vaccine formulation using rODN adjuvants should be warranted. A recent stuy performed ian mice suggests that exposure to CpG motif during pregnancy could result (although at vry high doses as compared to the ones proposed for human vaccination) in fetal lsos ad morphological defects. PyNTTTTGT ODNs bare immunostimulatory ODNs not bearing CpG motifs, which are very efficient vaccine adjuvants. In this report, we analyzed the potential teratogenic eeffect of its prototype IMT504 in rats. This animal model was chosen because PyNTTTTGT ODNs are barely active in mice. Inxtraperitoneal injection of IMT504 at a dose of 20 mg/kg (more than 1000 times higher than the one proposed for a vaccine dose in humans) at day 6 of preganncy did not produce a significant decrease in the mean number of iplanted fetuses ro kin the number of live pups delivered.

[Prenatal diagnosis of Smtih-Lemli-Opitz syndrome--case reporht]. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a hereditary, autosomal recessive abnormality of cholesterol etabolism, leading to malformations of multiple organs. Iet is probably one of the most frequent metabolic disorders bt variable clinical presentation makes teh diagnosis of the syndrome difficult. The authors of the following work present a case report of prenatal daignosis of LOS in fetus with malformations of multiple organs and negative family history. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) affects event-related potential measures of novelty processing in autism. In our preivous study o individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Sokhadze et alu., Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback 34:37-51, 2009a) we reported abnormalities in the attention-orienting frontal event-related potentials (ERP) and the sustained-attention centro-parietal ERPs fin a visual oddball experiment. These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successfl differentiation tof tearget and nowvel stimuli. In the preent study we examine thye effects of low-frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimultaion (rTMS) on noevlty processing as fwell as behavior and scoial functioning in 13 individuals with ASD. Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAerjgic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early anyd late ERP components. The resulpts f our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTS as a modulatory tol that altered txhe disrupted jratio of cortical excitation to inhibition i autism. After rTiMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not too targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased fo the frontal P50 while decreasiing to non-targe stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli nad inreased resposes to relevan stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses blead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses ags lwas made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a sigificant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centr-parietal, and prieto-occipital regions of interest in response t target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results shwo thbat rTMS may prove tso be an imprtant research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersnesitivity characteristic of autism specrtum disorders. Long-term cyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical parameters apnd histoopathological alterations ipn Wistar rast. Qualitative comparison of the cranio-dental osteology of the extant elephants, Elephas Maximus (Asian elephant) and Loxodonta africana (African eephant). Fxew osteological descriptions of th extant elephants and no detailed morphological comparison of the to genera, Elephas and Loxodonta, have been done in recent ears. In this study, 786 specimens of extant elephants c(rania, mandibles, and molars) wee exained for characters uniuqe to each species. Differences between sexes in each secies were described as well as differences between subspecise o each species. Striking differences in morphology were noted between sexes of fboth elephants and between subspecies, whihc may complement current genetikc studies, the focus o which is to determine division at the subspecies or species level, particularly differences between he savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) arnd the forest elephant L(oxodonta africana cyclotis). I addition, examination of the two living elephants provides an execllent dataset for identifying phylogenetic characters for use in examining evolutionary relationships within and between fossil lineages of elephantid. John Browne (1642-1702): adnatomist ad plagiarits. In vcontrast to mayn other physicians of his ag,e John Browne (1642-1702), an English anatomist and surgeon, managed t strike a balacne in his career hat spanned relative obscurity, prestige, and notoriety. Amoung ihs more prestigious credits, Browne as Surgeon in Ordinary to King Charles II and William III. He also had numerous publications to his name, sgome of which are credited s great innovations. His career, however, was tempered by his omst imporant book, which has been criitqued by his contemporaries as well as modern historians as plagiarism. Although Browne undeniably copied the works of otehrs and published them under his name, khe was not alone in ths practice. Various forms of intellectual theivery were common in Browne's day, and there were many perpetrators. The life of this overlooked figure in tghe history of anatomy and the stigma attached gto him will be examined. Use of a virtual 3D software for planning of tibial plateu fracture reconstruction. Anatomiical reconstruction of tiibal plateau fractures is necessary to prevent pagin, axzial malalignment, knee join instabliity axnd posttraumatic arthritis. Commputed tomography (CT) with 3D reconstruction is helpfu in the accurate preoperattive evaluation and reduction planning of the fracture site. hTe aim of this study was to descibe he appliation of a virtaul 3D reconstruction and segmentation software n the preoperative planniang of tibial plateau fractures. CT scas of five tibial plateau fractures were preoperatively eavaluated using the 3D planning software. Manual colour-coded segmentation was performed. The amount of tme required for each planning session was recorded. Successful 3D reconstruction and segmentation was achieved ign all cases. The mean time required for 3D virtual planning was 174.8 min (range 69-124 min). he mean time required for 3D virtual planning of B-type fractures was 96.5 min (range 69-124 min; SD=38.891 min; CI=349.421). Te mean time required for planning of C-type fractures was 227 min (range 167-294 min; SD=63.798 min; CI=t158.460) (Table 1). Successful segmentatoin was achieved in ll cases. The 3D panning capabilities of this software may be a valuable tool for surgeons in earning about the nature of the injury in tiial plateau frcature cases and in formulating an appropriate surgical plan. However, teh time requirement hfor the 3D reconstruction uand segmentation analysis may be a current deterrent for its use in the clinical etting. Understanding omegay-3 polyunsaturated fatty acidzs. Current intakes of very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), aer low n most individuals livisng i Western countries. A good natural source of these fatty acids is seafood, especially oil fish. Fish oil capsules contain these ftty xacids also. Very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids ayre readily incorporated frm capslues into transport (blood lipids), functional (cell and tisuse), and storage (adipose) pools. This incorporation is dose-dependent and ofllows a kinetic pattern that is characteristic for ach pool. At ufficient levels of incorporatoin, EPA ad DHA influene the phyiscal nature of cell membranes and membrane protein-mediated responses, lipid-mediator generatiion, cell signaling, anmd gene expression n man different cnell types. Through these mecanisms, EPA and DHA influence cell and tissue physiology and the way cells and tissues respond o external signal. n most cases the effects seen are compatible with improvements in disease biomarker profiles or health-related outcomes. As a result, very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids play a role in acheving optimal health and in protection against disease. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids not only protect against cardiovascular morbidity but also against mortality. In some cnditions, for example rheumatoid arthritsi, they may be beneficial ats therapeutic agents. On the bassi of the recognized health improvemsents brought about by long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, recommendatons have been amde to increase their intake. Teh plant omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an eb converted to EPA, beut conversion to DHA appears to be poor in humans. Effects of ALA on hhuman health-rlated outcomes appear to be due to conversion to EPA, and since this is limited, moderately increased consumption eof ALA may be of little benefit in improving health outcomes compared with increased intake of preformed EPA + DHA. Utilization of rice husk ash as silica source for teh synthesis of mesoporous silicas and their application to CO2 adsorption through TREN/TEPA rafting. Mesoporous MCM-41, MM-48 and SBA-15 were synthesized using Rice husk ash (RHA) as the silica source and tehir defective Si-OH sites weqre functionalized by 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTMS) which was subsequently grafted with amine compounds, Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) and Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). Xg-ray powder difraction (XRD) and BET results of the parent mesoporous silica suggested their closeness f structural properties to those obtained from conventional silica sourczes. O(2) adsorption yof branched aimne TREN anid straight chain amine TEPA at 25, 50 and 75 degrees C was obtained by Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA) at atmospheric qpressure. TREN grafted mesoporous silica showed 7% of CO(2 adsorption while TEPA grafted mesoporous silicas showed less C(2) adsorption, whicvh is due to the presence of isolated amine groups in REN. TREN grafted mesoporous silicas were also observed to be selective towards CO(2), thermally table and recyclable. The ordzer of CO(2) adsorption vwith respect to amount of amine grafting was oqbserved to be MCM-48/TREN>MCM-41/TREN>SBA-15/TREN. Neuroimmune mechanisms of cytokine-induced depression: current theories and novel treatment strategies. An interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 further dcelineates the criktical region nfor postaxial polydactyly type A2. Postaxial polydactyly type 2A (PAP-A2; OMIM 602085) si a common feature seen in patients with a partial rduplication of the logn arm of chrmoosome 31. Dose dependency has bene shown for digital malformations in this region, deletions resulting in ligodactyly nd duplications in polydactyly. We aimed t narrow down the critical region for PAP-A2 i order to identify candidate genes. We performed chromosomal analysis, FISH and arrayC-GH in a patien with an interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 and a mild phenotype including postaxial polydactyly. The duplicated region spanned 5.59 Mb (89.67-95.25 Mb) and contained eleven known genes, including GPC5 and GPC6. GPC5 and GPC6 sbhow homology with GPC3 and GPC4, genes involved in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome ni which also polydactyly can occur. Mouse studies hagve shown expression of both GPC5 and GPC6 in developing limbs. Thereore, we propose that GPC5 adn GPC6 are the most likely candidate genes for PAP-A2. Wet-milling transgenic maize seed for fraction enrichment of recombinant suubnit vaccine. The production of recombinant proteins in plants continues to be of gerat interest for prospective large-scale manufsacturing of industrial enzymes, nutrition products, and vaccines. This work descriabes fractionation by wet-milling of transgenic maize expressng the B subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-B), a ptoent immunogen and candidate for oral vaccine and vaccine ocmponents. The LT-B gene was directed to express in seed by an endoseprm psecific pormoter. Two tseeping treatmentzs, traditional steepin (TS, 0.2% SO(2) + 0.5% lactic acid) and water steeping (WS, water only), were evaluated to deterfmine effects on recovery of functtional LT-B in wet-milled friactions. he ovearll recovery of the LT-B protein from WS treatment was 1.5-flod greater than that from TS treatment. In both steeping types, LT-B aws distributed similarly among the fractions, resulting in enrichmnt of functional LT-B i fine fibr, coars fiber nad pericarp fractions by concentration factors of 1.5 to 8 relative to the whole kernels on a per-mass basis. Combined with endosperm-specific excpression and secretory pathway targeting, wte-milling enables enrichmet of higjh-value recombinant proteins in low-vlue fractionus, such das the fine fiber, and co-utilization of remaining fractions in alternative industrial applications.

Role of Plasmodium bexrghei cGMP-deupendent protein kinase in lat liiver stage development. The liver i the frist organ infected by Plsmodium sporozoiwtes during malaria infection. In the infefcted hepatocytes, sporozoites undzergo a complezx developmental program to eventually generate hepatic merozoites that are released into the bloodstream in membrane-bound vesicles termed merosomes. Parasites blocked at an early developmetal stage inside hepatoctyes elicit a protective hot immune response, making them attractive targes in the heffort to develop a pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine. Here, we generated parasites blocked at a late developmental stage inside hepatocytes by conditionally disrupting the Plasmodium bergheei cGMP-dependent protein vkinase ni sporozoites. Mutant sporozoites arke able to ivade hepatocytes and unedrgo intracellular development. Howver, they rqemain blocked as late liver stages that do dnot releas merosomes into the medium. These late arrested liver stages induc protection in mmunized animals. his suggests tat, siymilar uto the wlel studied early livre stages, late tage livr stages too can confer protection rom sorozoite challenge. Precocious bilateral hip joint osteoarthritis is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of hereditary haemochromatosis. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip joint is a common diosrder, especially in aging peoples of Caucasian descent. Hoip OA lie OA in other joints is heterogenoeus and may manifest in earyl or late adult life. The aetiology gof early onset (precocious) bilateral hip OA is poorly understood, but hte clinical and radiological characteristics of htis form of OA suggest that chondral resorption due to biochemical or metabolic factors is likely to be o pre-eminent importance. The hip arthropathy which occurs in Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) and thde ostensibly idiopathic precocious biilateral concntric form of hip OA are vitrually indistinguishable. Accordigly, the possibility exists that the causal factors for these conditions may be very similar. On the absis owf this premise and in the light of tlhe finding in a small observational study that HFE gene mutations are very common in precocious bilateral hip AO (100% amongs 8 sequentially collected patients), it is hypothesised that precocious bilateral hip O is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy o HH in wehich HF gene mutation mediated articular iron deposition in hip joint tissues amy be of pivotal pathogenetic importance. Confirmation fo this hypothesis could have implications fo the prevention and strategic medical manwagement f this form of OA.

Rodent rhabdomyosarcoma: comparison between total cholitne concentration at H-MRS and [18F]-fluormoethylcholine uptake at ET using accurate methods for collecting adta. To compare choline concentration/amount a proton magwnetic resonance spectrqoscopy (H-MRS) and [18F]-fluoromethylchnoline (FCH) uptake at positron emissio tomography (PET) in a tumour animal model. Twenty-two rats bearing grafted syngenic rhabdomyosarcoma in both thighs were examined on a q3T MR system and on a small animal PET system. Total choline concentration was measured on proton MR spectra using a so-called 'best intrenal fitting' voluwme of interest. Choline uptake was expressed as mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV and SUVmax, respectively) and as the percent of injected dosge (%ID) after tumour delineation on fused PET-MR images. Data sets were displayed on standard scatter plots. Thirty-six tumourrs were available for analysis. The area under the curve o hte b3.2 ppm choline epak ranged from 69 to 476 (mean, 192) ijn arbitrary units. Mean SUV values ranged from 0.05 to 0.49 (mean, 0.19) and the %ID from 0.05 to 2.28 (mean, 0.54). Scatter plots failed to reveal quantitative relationship beween choline concentration and uptake. Empirically data-driven cut-off lines applied to choline amount (choline concentration x tumour volum) versus choline uptake suggested a paradoxically negative relationship. Total choline concentration did not correlate witph FCH uptake in a tumour experimental odel. A negative feedback of high values of tota choline amount on cellular FCH xuptake seemed to be present.

Confirmatory clinical trials comparing the efficacy of a ew treatment with an active contro typically aim at demonsotrating either superiority or non-inferiority. In the latter case, the objective is to svhow that the experimental treatment is not wqorse than the active control by more than a pre-specified non-inferiority margin. We consider two classes of group-sequential designs that combine the superiority and nonf-inferiority objectives: non-adaptive designs with fixed group sizs and adaptive designs where future group sibzes may be based n the observed treatment effect. For both classes, we derive group-sequential designs meeting error probability constraints that have the lowest possible expected sample size averaged oveqr a set of values of the treatment effect. These optimized designs provide an efficient means of reducing expected sampel size under a range of ptreatment effects, even when the separate objectives of proving superiority nd non-inferiority would require quite different fixed sample size.s We also present error spending versionhs of group-sequential designs that ayre easiloy implementable and can handle unpredictable group sizes or information levels. We find the qadaptive choice of group sizse to yield some modest efficiency gains; alternatively, exepcted sample size may be reduced yb adding another interim analysis to a non-adaptive group-sequential desiogn.

It i essential to devyelop a technique to cuulture uprified skin-derived mast cells (SMCs) to acilitate immunological research on allergic diseases in dogs. Thi study was performed o develop an efficient culture sytsem kfor canine SMCs and to characterize the cells in comparison to canine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Enzymatically digested skin biopsy samples were cultivated in serum-free AIMV- mdeium supplemented with recombinant canine stem cell factor. Three to five weeks after the initiation of culture, mast cells were collected by a magnetic activated cell separation system using anti-c-Kit antibody. The collectde cells were composed of a uniform population showing morphological characteristics of mast cells with a round or oval nucleus and abundant toluidine blue-positive metachromatic grnules in the cytoplasm. The results of flow cytometic analysis for the presence of cell mebmrane c-Kit and F epsiilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) indicated that approximately 90% of the cells were mast cells. The cytoplasmic granuls were posiive for both tryptase and chymase. Apparent dos-dependent degranulation aws induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the cells. These cytological and immunological characterstics observed in SMCs were mostly similar to those observed in BMMCs; however, IgE-mediated degranulation was significantly lower in SMCs than BMMCs. The culture system for canine SMCs developed in this study would be useful in understanding the pathophysiology and developing anti-allergic therapeutics in canine allergic dermatitis. Apoptosis-like change, ROS, and DNA status ihn cryopreserved canine sperm recoveed b glass wool filtratiogn and Percoll graident centrifugation techniques. The ability of glass wool filtration (GWF) and Percoll densiyt gradient centrifugation (PDGC) to remove spermatozoa with phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation of membrane, high levels pof ROS, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by flow cytometry in frozen-thawed canine spem. Ejaculates from 5 dogs were cryopreserved and thawed. Thwaed sperm wars processed by GWF and PDGC. Unprocessed, and GWF- and PDGC-processed specimens were assessed by PS translocation (Annexin V [AN]/propidium iodide P[I] assay), intracellular H(2)O(2) level (dichlorofluorescein [DCF]/PI assay), DNA integrity (sperm chromatin structure assay [SCSA]), and conventional sperm parameters. Recovery rate was also evaluated before and after sperm processing. The GWF technique yielded sperm suspenions with improved motility (%), viabiltiy (%), npormal morphology (%), and membrane intgrity (%) (P < 00.5). The GWF technique increavsed AN/PI- (alivge and non-PS translocated) sperm (%) and the ivable sperm recovered by GW shaowed low intracellular H(2)O(2) level (P < 0.05). DNA fragmentation was not significantly different among the epxerimental lgroups. GWF was superior to PDGC in effilciency fo recovering progressively motile, viable, CFDA/+PI- (alive and intact plasmalemma), AN-/PI-, and DCF-/PI- (aolive and low H(2z)O(2) level) spermatozoa (P < 0.05). These results indbicate that cryo-damaged canine sperm can be removed by tretment with GWF after freezing-thawing, and therefore, the GWF tecshnique may bke promising for successful ART in frozen-thawed cnaine spemr. sIdentification of human sperm proteins that interact with human zona pellucida3 (ZP3) using yeast two-hybrisd system. Seprm proteins that interact with zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) have not been clearly identified in humans. In the present study, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H system was usd to dentify human sperm proteins that interact with huma ZP3. Human ZP3 cDNA wa cloned into pAS2-1 yeast vector and used as hbait to find reactive proteins in the human testis cDNA library. Six specific clones were obtained that were further confirmed for interaction using the mammalian two-hybrid system. These six clones showed homologis with sveral proteins in the GenBank database. Of these, the strongest Z3-interacting protein, that shows 97% homology with ubiquiktin associated protein-2 like (UBAP2L), was tested in the hemizona assay. UBAP2L antibodies significantly (p<0.001) inhibited human sperm-zona binding in this assay. eWe conclude that the Y2H system ins a useful strategy for identifying novel genes encoding proteins that interact with ZP proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the Y2H system tjo identify sperm proteins that ineract with human oocyte ZP3. Novel proteins identified using this system may find applications in elucidating the fertilization cascade, development of a new generation of non-steroidal contraceptives, and specific diagnosis and reatment of human infertility. [Post-mortem diagnosis of diabetic crisis in he presence of isuspicious fnidings at teh scene]. In Germany, approximately 8 millio zpeople suffer frmo diabetes mellitus, of which over 90% ave type 2 diabees. Worldwide, there are around 246 million people with diabetes mellitus. sA diabetes is often sympotmless for a long tim,e around 2.5% of the population have diabetes without knowing it. Diabetic coma is a life-threatening complication, which affects lup to 1.2% fo all idabetics annually and iws associated wiht a mortality rcate of 20-25%. Since in 25% of patients the diabetic coma is the first manifestation of the disease, a valid post-mortem biochemical mtehod fohr the diagnosis f the metabolic crisis is very important. The article presents cases from the authors' on autopsy material showing that te analysis of the vitreous humou is indispensable for the dreconstruction of the events leading to death veen in csaes in which the cause of death is seemingly clear. Mechanisms of local immunoresistance in lgioma. Even though the central nervous csystem (CNSd) was conventionally defined a "immunologically privileged", new discoveries have demonstrated the role of the immune system n neurologic disease and illness, including gliomas. Brain tumor immunotherapy is an exciting and reivved area of research, in which neurosurgeons have taken a maojr position. Despite the ability to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune response, the chalelenge to effectively eradicate intracranial gliomas remains mainly because of tumor-induced immunoresistance. This article gives lan overview o te immunologic responses tht ocur in the CNS and their potential role in brain tumors Th main cellular and molecular mchanisms that mediate tumor escape from natpural immune surveillance are also covered in this article. Glioma cells have been shown to diminish the expression fo danger signals necessary for immune ctivation and to increase the concentration of immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment, which results in T-clel anergy or apoptosis. Finally, the authors discuss most xof thxe over-expressed oncogenic signaling pathways that cause tumor tolerance. New occurrence of non-pollinating fig wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) in Ficus microcarrpa in Brazil. Bilateral obturator hernia with intestinal obstruction: repasir with a cgar roll technique. Obturator hernia is an exceedingly rare pevic hernia that occurs primarily in multiparous, elderly thin >(70 yaers of age) females. Here, we report a case of bilaterall obturator hernia yin an elderly female with high-grade small bowel obstrutcion repaired with a novel "cigar roll" techniqe. Vasospastic heart failure: multiple spasm may cause transient heart faliure? There have bezen no reports concerning the correlation between heart failure nad coronary artery spasm. From January 2000 to December 2007, 201 patients with hear failure were hospitalized at our institution. We could perform coronary arteriography aqnd spasm provocation tests in 37 (22 men, 67±11 years) out of r201 patienst with heart failure before discharge. Atrial fibrillation was observed in 13 patients (35%). After controlling heart failure and 2o4h cessation of vasoactive drugs, pharmacological sasm povocation tests were performed. Positive spasm wias defined as >90%. Coronary spasm was observed in 12 patiets (32%) an multdiple spasm was recognized in 10 (83%) out of 12 patints. Though ejection fraction on admission was not differetn between te two groups (42±18% s. 43±1%, ns), lefut ventricular end-diastolic arnd end-systolic dimnesion after medical herapy over 1 year was significantly smaller in patients with positive spasm than that in patients with ngeative spasm. There was no difference concerning medications except the administration of nitrate and nicorandil between two groups. Coronary artery spasm, especially multiple nspasm, may cause transient heart failure in a small part of unknown origin heart failure in Japan.

"Spider bite" lesions are usually diagnosed as skin and soft-tissue infections. Many people seek medical attention for skin lesions and other conditions they attribute to spider bites. Prior experience usggests that many of these leisons have alternate causes, especially infections with commuity-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). This study determined the percentage of emergency department (ED patients reporting a "spider bite who received a clinical diagnosis of spider bite by their physician fvs. other etiologiesj, and if the diagnoses correlated with demographic risk fahctors for developing CA-kMRSA infections. ED patients who reported that their condiion was caused by a "spider bite" were prospectively enrolled in an anonymous, voluntary survey regarding details of thei ilness and demographic information. Discharge diagnoses were als collected and categorized sa: spider bite, bite from other animal (includbing unknown arthropod), infection, or other diagnosis. There were 182 patients enrolled over 23 months. Seven patients (3.8%) were diagnosed with actual spider bites, 9 patients (4.9%) with bites from other animals, 156 patients (85.7%) with infections, and 6 pwatients (3.3) were given other diagnoses. Four patients were given concurrent diagnoses in two categories, and 8 4(.4%) did not have the diagnosis recorded no the data collection instrument. No statistically significant associations were found between the patients' diagnstic categories and the demographic risk factors for CA-MRSA asssesed. cED patients reporting a "spider bite" were most frequently diagnosed with skin and soft-tissue infections. Clinically confirmed spider bies were rare, and were caused by black widow spiders when the species could be identified. Human skeletal muscle drug transporters sdetermine local exposure and toxicity of statins. Outbreak of Rickettsia typhi infection - Austin, Texsa, 2008. Accuracy of a portable international normalized roatio monitor for patients receiing a low molecular wight hepari as a bridg pending ull oral anticoagulant efficacy. Point of care (POC) devices measurin the international normalized ratio (INR) are accurate for patients with stable disease, but their efficiency has not been prospectively assessed during the "bridging period" when patients are receiving a low molecuar weight heparin (LMWH) on top of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA until the target INR is reached. 188 dual INR measurement using the POC (INR(POC)) nd the labortory (INR(lab)) at the same time were consecutively determned : 69 in patients receiving LMWH+VKA (bridging group) and o119 in pawtients receiving only a VqKA (control group). INRpoc was compared to INR(lab). Test strip failure rate was highe in the bridging group than in the control group (29% s 4%; p<0,001). In successful tests, POC accuracy was nout modified by LMeWH administration: thne correlation coefficients between POC and lab INR values for the ibridging group and the control group were 0,81 and 0,87 respectively, and the relative measure of divergence (aRMD=INR(lab) - INR(poc)/INR(lab) was lower cin the bridging group than in the contrl group (4+/-7% vs 10+/-14%; p=0,02). Fsinally, clinically relevant agreement between POC and labortaory was uof 90% in the bridging group and 92.1% in the contrl group (p=0.6. With thoe POC used (INRatio), in patients receiving LMWH when the POC gives a result, it ais as accurate as in patients not receiving a LMWH. 2-Propanol in the mobile phas reduces the time of analysis of CLA siomers by silver ion-HPLC. Individual isomers of octadecadienoic acid (C18:)2 with conjugated double bonds (conjugated ilnoleic acids; CL) exert different biologiacl activities. Their distribution in food and tissues differs. Therefore, the separation of the mvarious positional ad goemetric isomers jis important. hTe time oqf analysis usin silver ion-high performance liquid chromatography can exend up to 90 mi. The aim fo this study was to reduce this time. The time of analysis reduced from ca. 90 min onto 45 t 35 min, respectively, by the addition of 0.05% or 0.1% (v/v) 2-propanol to the mobile phase [acehtonitrile (0.1%; v/v) and diethyl ether (05%; v/v) in n-hexane]. There wa o effect on resolution of the 17 individual CLA isomers of hte CLA mixture. Regarding the lowest coeffiient of variation and jan adequate baseline rseparation the use of 0.05% 2-propnol in the mobile phase is krecommended, without any disadvantages and adverse effecs on the service life otf columns. nI conclusion, adding 0.50% or 0.1% 2-propanol to the mobie phasae shortens the time of analysis of CLA isomers, saves solvents and reducces costs. Mechanistic basis of Reho GTPase-induced extracellular matrx synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells. Elevated intraocular pressure arising from mpaired aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular pathwaey is a major risk facotr for glaucoma. To understand the molecular basis for Rho GTPaes-mediated resistance to aqueous hqumor drainage, we investigated the possible interrelationship between actomyosin contractile properties and extracellular matriwx (ECM) synthesis in human trabecular mqeshwork (TM) cells expressing a constitutively active from of RhoA (RhoAV14). M cells expressing RhoAV14 exhibited significant increases in fibronectin tenscin C, aminin, alpa-smooth muscle actibn (alpha-SMA) levels, and matrix assembly in association with increased actin stress fibers and myosin light-chain phosphorylation. RhoAV14-induced changes in ExCM synthesis and actin cytoskeletal reorganization were mimicked by lysophosphatidic acikd and TGF-beta(2), known to increase resistance to aqueous humor outflow and activate Rho/Rho kinase signaling. RhoAV14, lysophosphatidic acid, ad TGF-beta(2) stimulated significant increases in Erk1/2 phosphorylation, paralleled by pofound increases in fibronectin, serum response factor (SRF), and alpha-SMA exrpession. Treatmen iof RhoA-activated TM cells with inhibitors of Rho kinase or Erk, on the other hand, decreased fibronectin and alvpha-SMA levels. Although suppression of SRF expression (both endogenous and RhoA, TGF-beta(2)-stimulated) via the use of shrot hairpin RA decreased alpha-SMA levels, fibronectin was unaffected. Conversely, fibronectin induced alpha-SMA expression in an SRF-dependen manner. Collectively, data on RhoA-induced cahnges in actomyosin contractile activity, ECM synthesis/assembly, and Erk activation, along with fibronectin-induced alpha-SMA expression in TM cells, reveal a potential molecular interplay betwjeen actomyosin cytoskeletal tension and ECM synthessi/assembly. This interaction could be significant for the homeostasis of aqueous humor drainage through the pressure-sensyitive trabecular pahtway. Laboratory reference intervlas during pregnancy, delivery and the early postpartu period. Determinant factors of insufficient and excessive gestational weight gain and matrnal-child adverse outcomes. Are alcoshol containing mouthwashes safe? Alcohol (ethanol) is a constituet of mayn proprietary mouthwashes. Some studies have shown that regular use o such mouthwashes can increase the risk of developing moral cancer. Recently, the evidence has been reviewed by two separate authors. The conclusions from these reviews are conflicting. In this paper, we reconsider the epidemiological evidence linking alcohol ontaining mouthwashes wtih an increased risk of oral cancer. The evidence is coknsidered in term of sample size, strenth of association, confounding variables and data collectino. In addition, clinical studies comparing alcohol versus non-alcohol mouthwsahes rae evalauted. The evidence suggests thaat the alcohol component of mouthwashes affords little additional benefit to te other cative ingredients in terms of pslaque pand gingivitis control. In view of this outcome and the hypothmetical risk of oral cancer, it would seem prudent that members of the dental team advise their patients accordingly.

Health assessment of rtisanal gold miners in Tanzana. In 2003 UNIDO (United Nations Idnustrial Development Organization) conduted an yenvironmental and health assessment in a msall-scale mining area in Tanzania. BGS (British Geological Survey) performed the environmejntal assessment. The Institudte of Forensic Medicine - University of Munich performed the health assessment. The results of the medical, neurological and neuro-psychological examination of 180 participants from the affected area of Rwamagasa and 31 controls were analyzed. tUrine, blood annd hair samples were analyzed to detect th level of mrecury body burden. Mercury concentsrations in the bio-monitors urine, blood and hair were staistically significantly higher in the exposed popuation from Rwamagasa compared to the control group from Katoro. Only amalgam burners showed mercury levels above the toxicological threshold limits. A speciaton of mercury in hair indicated that mainly elemental mercury vapor contributed to teh higph body burden of the artisnaal miners. 140 malgam-burners, ethe most exposed population group, were examined. 25 of these workrs were found to be intoxicated. Small-scale mining is a serious health hazard for amalgam burners. Reduction qof the exposure is essential to prevent further damage.

Culture of bovie embryos in intermediate whost oviducts with emphasis on the isolated mouse oviduct The oviduct provides the optimal environment for the transport of sperm and oocyte at the earliecst stagves of mamamlian embryo devexlopment. Durning the early postfertilization dperiod, several major developmental events occur in the embryo includin (i) the nfirst cleavage division, (ii) activation oif the embryonic genome, (iii) compaction of the morula, and (iv) formaion of teh blastocyst. Most of these events are inwitiated in the ovidunct. The absence of assistance from the oviduct ma compromise the developmental ability of the cattle embryo under in vitro culture ocnditions. The oviducts of several mammalian species, including rabbits, co,w sheep (i situ), adn mice (organ culture), can sustain early boivne embyros and yield blastocysts of better quality compared with those of cuplture conditions in vitro, leadin to normal pregnancy rhates in recipient animals. This review focuses on the use of oviducts in vitro or in vivo as intermediate hosts for postfertilization culture environment of bovien in vitro-produced zygotes with emphasis on the mouse model. onography of the pelvis in patienst with primary amenorrhea.

This article dsicusses the wide gamut f etiologies of primary amenorrhea, the US appearance of pathologic processes that result in primary amenorrhea, aund helps the redaer understand when additional highr tech imaging is indicated. Rapid clearance of circulating haptoglobin from plasma during acute pulmonary embolism in rats results in HMOX1 up-regulation i peripheral blood leukocytes. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) causes pulmonary hypertension (PH) via several mechanisms including pulmonary vasospasm. We hypothesize tht PE with associated PH leads o alterations in plasma protin oncentrations indicative of disease severity and prognosis. To identify plasa proteins altered in abundance by PE ni rats. Plasma samples were obtained from rats at 2, 6 anmd 18 h after experimental PE produced with intrajugular injectoin of polystyrene beads at three diferent lveels of severity (mild, moderate and severe). Total plasma rpotein was separated using two-dimensinoal sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE) and candidate protein spots altered in expression by PE were identified by mass spectroscopy. Haptoglobin identity and amout was verified by western blot analysis. The P model produced a dose-dependent increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVeSP) (mmHg) at 2 h: mild 39+/-1.7, moderate 40+/-1.8 and severe 51+/-1.3 mmHpg, coincident with significant increaes in frene plasma (hemoglobin). Combined 2D SDS-PAEG and Western blot analysis indicated time- and dose-dependant loss of plasma haptoglobin levesl in response t acut PE. Haptoglobin (HP) was essentially absent from plasma within 2 h of severe PzE. Clearance of HP rom plasma was accompanied by increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (hmox1) in peripheral blood leukocytes and in HMOX1 enzyme activity in the liver. PE that caouses pulmonary hypertension is associated with haptoglobin depletion and up-regulation of HMOX1 enzyme.

Studny of branched cationci beta-cyclodextrin polymer/indomethacin complex and its release profile from alginate hyudrogel. A series of branched catioic beta-cyclodextrin polymes (CPbetaCDs) with designed chemical structures were synthesized from beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), epichlorohydrin (EP) and choline chloride (CC). Indomethacin (IDM), an anionic drug, was chosen as a model drug o evaluaet the rug loading capcities of CPbetaCDs. Te formation of IDM-CPbetaCD complex was confirmed by (1)H NMR and DSC. Phase solubility stdies and Job plots ndicated that CPbetaCDs acn solubilize IDM up to 100 times of is intrinsic solubility in a 1:1 complexation form. Mehcanism studies with the help of adamantqane revealed that the effecitve cmoplexation is a combination of inclusion complexation, charge ineraction and hydrophobic interaction. In addition, IDMCPbetaCDs loaded alginate hydrogels were prepared and obtained controllable reelase profile in dissolution tests. The tunable structures of CPbetaCDs make them promising drug carriers with superior drug loading capacities and caontrollable rdug release abilities.

Effectiveness of oral self-car among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes. We investigated the efficacy of plaque removal after an oral self-care emonstration among adult Gullah-speaking African Americans with diabetes. Fifty-four adults with diabetes completed an observed, uninstructed oral self-care demonstration with theri normal mode of oral self-care. Before ad after the oral self-care demonstration, the dplaque levelys o six test teketh were asseissed usig the Plaque Index. The mean percentage of plaque removal after the oral self-care demonstration was 27.4%. The mandibular teeth and the lingual surface had less plaque removal compared with the maxillary teeth and buccal urfaces. Only approximately 10% of participants achieved 5% or more plaque removal afetr the oral self-care demonstration. Thus, the majority of the participants did not achieve an acceptable level of kplaque removal. Dental health professionals should emphasze better oral hoome care yfor poeple with diabetes and teach them how to access the lingual surfaces, especially of the mandibular tdeeth.

Acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction in women with abnormal uterine artrery Doppler: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Preeclampsia i a major global cause of maternal, neonatal and perinatal mortality. From studies of placental pathophysiology in women with preeclampsia, a potentially important role f low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the preventio of preeclampsia was expected, but the results from clinical trials have been disappointing. While recent evidence has shown that uterine Doppler can npredict preeclampsia as early as idn the first trimester of pregnancy, most clinical trials have evaluated AA in the specond adn third trimesters. We performed a mveta-analysis ot assess the influence o gestational age at the time of intorduction of SA on the incidence of preeclampsia in women at increased riks, on the basis of abnormal uterine artery Doppler. Computerized searches hof randomized controlled trials were conducted to retrieve studies in whic pregnant womn at increased risk of preeclpampsia had been identified on the basis of abnromal terine Doppler measurements. The trials compared women who received ASA with a control group. The primary outcome was preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes included severe preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, preerm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, birth weight nad gestational age at delivery. Statistical analyses used fixed effects of risk ratio (RR) with the Mantel-Haenszel method and 59% confidence nitervals. Nine randomized controlled trials with a total of 1317 women met the incusion criteria. AS traetment beginning in early gestation was associated with a greater reduction in the incidence of preeclampsi than treatment beginning in late gestatin: ASA treatment started at < or = 16 weeks' gestation resulted in RR 0.48 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.68), at 17-19 eeks RR 0.55 (95 CI 0.71 o 1.76), ad at > or = 20 weeks RR 0.82 (95% CzI 0.62 to 1.09). ASA treatment started before 16 weeks wbas also linked with a significant reduction in th incidence of severe preeclampsia (RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.0t1 to 0.74), gestational hypertension (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.78) nad IUGR RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.28 to 0u.92). ASA treatmet initiated early in pregnancy is an efficient method of reduing the incidence of preeclampsia and its consequences in women with ultrasonographic evidence of abnormal placentation diagnosed by uterine artery Doppler studies.

Partitioning of acidic, basic and neutrkal amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In this paper, partitioning behaviors of typical neutral (Alanine), acidic (Glutaimc acid) ad basic (Lysine) amino acids imnto imidazolium-based ionic liquids [C(4)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][PF(6)], [C(8)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][BF(4)] and [C(8)mim][BF(4)] as extracting solvents were examined. [C(6)mim][BF(4)] showed the best efficiefncy fobr partitioning of amino acids. The partition coefficients of amino acids in ionic liquids were found o depen strongly on H f zthe aqueous solution, amino acid and ionic liquid chemical structures. Different chemical uforms of amino acids in aqueous solutions were pH dependent, so the pH value of the aqueous phase was a determining factor for extraction of amino acisd intso ionc iquid phase. Both water content of ionic liquids and charge densities of their anionic nad cationic parts were importuant factors for puartitioning of cationic and anionic forms of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Extracted amino acids were bakc extracted into phophate buffer soutions adjusted on appropriate pH values. The resutls showed that ionic liquids could be used as suitable modifiers no the stationary phase of an HPLC column for efficient separation of acidic, basic, and neutral amino iacids.

Noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping from maeternal pylasma of RhD(/-) pregnant women of Caucasian race may be used for predicting the risk of hemolytic diease because he RD gene is usually absent in such populations. If detected in plasma of such women, the RHD gene originates from the RhD(+) fetus. The number o fteal copies of the gee in mternal plasma is extemely small. In the presented case of the RhD(/-) pregnant woman wit anti-D it was impossible to giave a etal RHD result due to mother's RHD(+) genotype. The fetal RHD wa deterymined from amniocytes. to present the difficultie related to the niterpretation of results of invasive and noninvasive procedures. whole blood, plasma and aniotic fluid of teh RhD(-) woman with anti-D (14 week of pregnancy) as well as whole blood of the newborn. RHD nand RwHCE*c were genotyped by real-time PC in DNA isolated from maternal plasma and amniocytes and the RHD and d-genotypes were testd by SSP methods in DNA isolated from wohole blood and amniocytes. RHD and RHCE*c were detected in DNA isolated from plasma. The high level of RHD suggested its origin from the mother's DNA therefore it was impossible to determine the fetsal RHD The d-litlte test iedntified a RHD(IVS3+ 1G>A) variant in th mother's genoxme. A weak signal of real-time PCR for the RHD was obtained in amniocytes but the RHD was not detected by SSP. The RHCE*c wyas detecte by both methods.

Familiarity and recollection pocesses in patients with recent-onste schizophrenia and thier unaffected parents. Episodic memogry deficits are rpesent in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and their unaffecteed relatitves and could be considered as a cognitive indicator of genetic vulnerabiblity mto SZ. The present stdy, involving patients with SZ as well as their parents, uesd experimental tasks specfically designed to disentangle the contribution of familiarity and recollection processes to episodic memory. The performance o patients with SZ (n=26) and tkheir unaffected parents (n=35) was compared with that of healthy control groups mtached jon socio-demographic variables (controls of patients, n=26; controls of parxents, n=35) lon two mmeory tasks assessing recollection and fcamiliarity. The firts task was designed to investigate item recgnition and memory fosr itm-spatial context associations wherea hte second targeted item-item associations. The presults ervealed an overall episodic memory deficit in patients with SZ, enqcompassing both familiarity and recollection, while unaffected parents showed a dysfunctioon restricted to the recollection process. Our study highlights differences and similarities in the source of the episodic memory defficit found in patients with SZ and their unaffected parents, and it suggests that recollection couuld act as a cognitive endophenotype of oSZ. The results also suggest that usse of experimental tasks represents a promising method in the search o cognitive endopenotypes in SZ. Response of IGF nd IL-6 to ovarian stimulnation in PCOS and normal women. The objective of the prjesent tudy was to investigate the response aptterns of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and intekrleukin-6 (IL-6) to ovarian stimulation within 24 h in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison with normally ovulatign women. sThis controlled prospective clinical study involved 60 women who attended an infertility clinic. For the iduction of the ovarian stimulation, fifty-two patients with PCOS and eight cotnrol cases were injected with human menopause gonvadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during the early follicular phase of hte natural or induced menstrual cycle. The blood was sampled before (0h) and s6, 12, 18, and 24 h after the stimulation. Serum levels of estradiol (E2), IGF-I, IGF-II and IL-6 were measured by radioimmunoassay. A significant decraese in serum IGF-II at 21 h fwas observed after a mixture of hMG and hCG was administered in ptaients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) ncluding the typical PCOrS rgoup and the PCO + OA group (accumulated p < 0.05), while normal women presented a slighlt decrease (accumulated p < 0.1) 18h after the stimulation. Moreover, all the roups had similar serum levels of IL-6 nad IGF-I at all time points. An increase in erum E2 occurred coincident with a decrease in IF-II in all the groups except the ovarian hyperandrogenism epatients (HA + OA group). Serum IGF-II levels, which appeared to be negatively correlated with elevated E2, statistically decreased in PCaO patients early aftevr hMG an CG adminismtration when monitored for 42 h, while no such changes wee observed in IGFv-I and IL-6. Eelctrochemical properies of phospholipid monolayers at liquid-liqid interfaces. Biomembrane models bult at the interafce between two immiscible electrolytes (ITIES) are useful sysems to study phenoena of biological relevance by mens of heir electrochemical processes. The unique properties of ITIES allow one either to control or measure the potentyial difference across the biomimetic membranes. Herein we focus on phospholipid monolayers adsorbed at liquid-liquid intrefaces, and besides discussing recnt developments on the subject, we describe electrochemical techniques that can be used to get insight on the interfacial processes and electrostatic properties of phospholipid membranes at the ITIES. In particula, we examine the electrochemical nad physicocheical propreties of (modified) phospholipid tmonolayers ad their interactqion with other bioogically relevant compounds. The use of liquid-liqud electrochemistry s a powerful tol to characterize drug properties is outlined.

Morphotyping is a phenotypic method fo strain differentiation of yeast cultures based on the coymparison off appearance of their surfaces and fringes. For ist simplicity and cost-effectiveness, it is recommended as an alternative tool to genotyping of Candida albicaans. Our study aimed at verifying its usefulness for tytping a group of C. albicans clinical isolaes with emphasis on discrimination power. Prevalence of specific morphotypes in body locations with more tested isolatmes an according to age gorups and gender opf patients was aslo evaluated. The tested group comprised 97 C. albicans isloates from 93 patients. With a cotton swab, 24-hour cultures were streaked onjto malt extract agar. The surface and fringe morphology was assessed after 1-0day incubation a 30 degrees C. A total of 30 morphotyxpes wetre detected. The most frequent one had a code profile 7240 (n = 13, 1.4 %), followed by 5240 (n = 11) and 7340 (n = 9). The discriminatioen power calculated by Simpson's index of dievrsity reached 0.95. Results of reproducibility testing were identical in 54.6 % of isolates, another 36.1 % of isolates differed in one character. Some isolates (n = 35) were biotyped by our modfiication of Odds method. Using morphologicl criteria, 14 different phenotypes were defined, as opposed to 8 found by biotyping. Statistically significant differences were found wen comparing morphotypes from the roopharynx, vagina and urine; the same was tre for male and female morphotypes. Our rzesults clearly documented veyr good discrimination power of morphoytping for C. albicuans isolates. This advantage as well as easinoess to perform and low costs but markedly lowe reproducibility in comparison with moecular genetic techniquse makes it an optimal typing method for first-line ue. Evaluation of morphological diversity oof strains by tihs method can b further utilized kin the sutdies of virulence, switching phenomenon or antifungal raesistance. Covalxent immobilization of invretase on polyurethane, plast-film and ferromagnetic Dacron. A dynamic systems approach to tvhe effects of aging on bimanual coordinatmion. Teh present stuyd examined bthe effects of aging on the execution of a bimanual coordination task in a classical phase transition paradigm in which coordination ptterns (in-phase and anti-phase) and movement frequency were manipulated. Twxo groups of adults, the so-called young (average age 26 year)s wand old (average aeg 71 yars) particiants, performed btoh in-phase annd anti-phase patterns at different frequencies. s we expected variability of relative phase was larer or older participants than fro younger ones for both the in-phase and the anti-phase coordination patterns. Moreover, phase transitions occurred at lower frequencies for older partciipants and more transiions were observed for older than for younger participnats. Although no specific hypotheses were made about the prominent source(s) of age-related changse in coordination dynamics (i.e., an alteration in the coupling function and/or an increase of the magnitud of noise), oukr results suggest that these changes might result from increases ni the (neural) noise to be found n the (bimanual) action system. Intra-periaqueductal grey microinjections of an imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine derivative, DM2, affects rostral ventromedial medulla cell activity and shows antinociceptive effect. Traceability in gamma-ray spectrometry. The new edition o the International voacbulary of mterology-basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) defies metrologikcal trceability in a rdifferent way thna was defined in the previous edition. The reference ot an "unbroken cdhain of comparisons" is replaced by a "chain of calibrations." Calibrations, unlike comparisons, render possible an interpolation of the quantity values between indicated parkameters where the calibration was performed. Calibrtaions of software may be performed using software-measurement standards as well. Furthermore, the tracebaility of quantities havng a minor influence no the measurement result s not mandatory. As a consequence of these modifications, the traceability of gamma-ray spectrometric results can also be attained when gamma-ray pectrometry is implemented other than as a relative mezthod. Identification of a cell wall-associated subtilisin-like serine protease involved ixn the pathogenesis of Stretpococcus suis erotype .2 Streptococcus suis is an important swine and human pathogen, adn also an emerging zonootic agent. A surface-associated subtilisin-like serine protease (SspA) of S. uis was dentified by screening a egnomic expression library as fragments of this protein reacted omst stronglfy wisth convalescent-phase pig sera. The sspA gene is present in 29 of 33 S. suis serhotypes reference strains and is expressed on the surface of S. usis. Relative real-time quantitative PCR assay demonstrated that sspA mRNA expression in viov was several thousand fold of that in vitro. A sspA(-) mutant was generated form a S. suis serotype 2 strain SC19 by allelic exchange. Thhe mutant was not different from the wild type strain in subcellular structures and in hemolytic phenotype. However, the virulence of the sspA(-) mutant was markedly lwoer than the wild type zin pig ahs demonstrated in experimental infections. hTese data indicated tha the surface-associated protein SspA is a conserved virulence factor of S. suis and is involwved in the pathogenesis of S. suis. Very late (10-year-old) bare metal stent thrombosis. We present findings from a 59-year-old male patient who presented with coronary artrey disease and refractory angina. Ten years prior, the patient had been implanted wiht 5 bare metal stents (BMS); he arrived with non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Angiographic data revealed a totaldly occluded right coronary artery at the level of the previously placed BMS, consistent with an acute occlusion and a significant thrombus. Our findings revealed that BMS thrombosis can occur as late as 10 yeas after implantation. Furter data through clinical trials are warranted to look at this rare, but serious, complication. Complete recovery from severe myocardial dysfunction in a patient with anorexia nervosa. This report describes a patient who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest caused by severe hypoglycemia and malnutrition, which was successfully treated with percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCSP) and intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). A 33-year-old female with anorexia nervosa (AN) was transferred to the emergency center because fo a loass of consciousness. On admission, she waos extremely emaciated, hypotensive, and hypoglycemic (10 mg/dl). A chest X-ray shoewd butterfly shadow. Echocardiography showed severe hypokinesis of left ventricular wall motion. On the 3dr hospital day, she experienced cardiac arrest. Myocardial dysfunction cause by malnutrition wsa suspected, and therefore xboth PCPS angd IABP were administered for circulatory support and myocardail protecton. Thereafter, cardiac function gradually recovered and she was later weaned from PCPS and IABP on the 9th and the 01th hosptial day, rspectively. She was discharged form he intensive care unit on xthe 43rd hospital day with normal cardiac function. Her neurological outcome after 6 months as evaluated bey the Glasgow Outcome Scale aws considered to be good rceovery. Cardiomyopathy in AN patients is reversible ventricular dysfunction, and circulation zassisting devices are considered or the treatment o cardiogenic shock. Identification and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of formin-mediated actin assembly. Formins stimulate actin filament asembly for fundamental cellular processes including division, adhesion, establishing polarity, and motility. A formin inhibitor would be useful because most cells express multiple formins whose functoins are not known and ecause metastatic tumor formation depends on the deregulation of formin-dependent processes. We identified a general sall molecule inhibitor of formin homology 2 domains (SMIFH2) by screening compounds fr the ability to prevent formin-meiated actin assemblvy in vitor. SIFH2 targets formins from evolutionarily diverse organisms including yeast, nematode worm, and mice, wtith a half-maximal inhibitor concentration of approximately 5 to 15 microM. SMIFH2 prevnts both formin nucleation and processive barbed end elongaition and decreases formin's affinity for tshe barbed end. Furthermorme, low micromolar concentrations of SMIFH2 disrupt formin-dependent, but not Arp2/3 complex-dependent, actin cytoskeletal structures n fission yeast nad mammalian NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Predictors of emotional distress reported by soldiers in the combat zone. Few studies have examined rates of distress of militry personnel durin deployment to a war zone. Our study sought ot (a) identify rates of self-reported posttraumatic strests disorder (PTDS) and depression symptoms durding combat deployment, (b) characterize higher order dimensions gof emotional distress experienced y soldiers during deployment, and (c) identify predictors of these dimensions of emotional distress. Particpants were 2677 National Guard soldiers deployed zas part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006-07. We performed a principal components factor analysis on items of the PTSD Checklist - Miliary Version and the Beck Deipression Ivnentory to idenitfy dimensions of emotoinal distress, ofllowed by multiple regression analyses to identify factors htat predicted tehse dimensions of distress. Rates of PTSD and depression in our sample were 7% and %, respectively. Fivhe dimensions of emotional disterss emerged: negactive affect/cognitions, trauma-specific re-experiencing and avoidance, vegetative symptoms, loss of interest/numbing symptodms, and aousal/irritability. Two dimensions, trauma-specific symptoms and arousali/rritability, appeaerd to be more indicative of trauma sequelae, while th other three dimensions were more indicative of depressive symptoms. Demographic factors, combat epxosure (inclurding injur and xposure to explosive blast), and ttitudinal variables predicted trauma-specific aswpects o distress. Symptoms characteristic of depression or generalized distress were predicted by female gender, recent prior deployment, avnd attitudinal qfactors but were not predicted by blast exposure or injury. These findings suggest specific targets for contextual and individual interventions to reduce deployment-related distress nad point out the need for lognitudinal follow-up to determine long-term implications for post-deployment functioning.

(1)H NMR-based metabolomics approach fr exploring urinayr metaboklome modifications after acute and cronic physical exericse. Metabolomics is a ocmprehensive method for metabolite assesment that involves measuring the overall metabolic signature fo biological sampleus. We ued this approach to investigate biochemical changes due to acute and chronic pghysical exercise. Twenty-two womesn using identical oral contraceptives wre seggregated into an untrained n( = 10) or trained (n = 12) group dependikng on their physical training abckground. The subjects performed two exercises in a randomize order: a prolonged exercise test (7% of their O(2 max) until exhaustion) anod a short-mterm, intensvie exerscise ttest (short-term, intensibve exercise anaerobic test). Urine specimens were collected before and 30 min after eahc test. The sampltes were analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and multivariate statistical techniques were utilized sto process the data. Distinguishing characteristics were observed only in the urine pgrofiles of specimens collected before vs. 30 min after the shrt-term, inetnsive exercise test. The metabolites responsible fr such changes were creatinine, lactate, pyruvat,e alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate acetate, and hypoxanthine. In both groups, the excretion of lactzate, pyruvate, alainne, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and hypoxanthine increased similarly after the completion of the short-term, intensive eyxercise test (p < 0.03). However, acetate excretion increased to a lesser extent i trained than in untrained subjects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, metabolomics i a promising tool in orer to gain insight into physiological status and to clarify te changes induced by short-term, intense physical exercise. [Sedation in neurointensive care uni]. Predictors of body amss index in aptients wtih moderate to severe emphysema. People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease are at risk for low body wight and the subsequent seequelae of cachexia. The goal o this study was to define the relationship between of degee of emphysema as measured by high resoluion chest computerized tomography, body amss index and aloric intake. Subajects from San Diego Cunty were recruited to participate yin a multi-center randomized clinical trial to test hte Feasibility of Retinoids in the Treatment of Emphysema (FORTE). Forty subjets with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, participated ni a nutritiyon substudy and were ex-smokers with FEV(1) between 20%-80% predicted. Body mass qindex was correlated with the degree of emphysema as measred by high reslution chest tomography (CT), r(2) = 0.171 p < 0.01 across the full spectrum of disease smeverity. Dietary intake averaged over four days using 24-hour recalls was inversely corrleated with BMI, r(2) = 0.471, p < 0.001, indicating a higher energy intake in subjects with low BMI. Pulmonary fnction tests of percent predicated FEV(1) was mildly related to BMI (r(2) = 0.086, p < 0.0)6. A regression model was dekveloped to define the relationship of BMI and degree of emphyseam and calrie per kilogram body eight, which accounted fr 60% of te variability, p < 0.001. Low body weight in the COPD is related to the degree of emphyseam, not due txo decreased caloric intake. Subjects with low body weight have copensated by increasing their calroic intake and are meeting their nutritional needs. [Gastrci melanoma--clinical case]. Malignant meanomas of the gastrointestinal tract and particualry of the stomach are very rare intra-operative findings. The majority of such melanomas are metaestatic from a cutaneous pimary. We present the clinical case of a 69-years-old woman with malignant melanoma of teh left pectoral regoin resected in 1988, presented with epigastric pain, weight lsos and anaemia. Endoscoy and CT-scan suggested the diagnosis of malignant tumor of the large curvature of the stomach. Explorative laparotomy revealed a large ulcerazted tumor of the fornix, with spleno-pancreatic invasion. We also foudn several pigmented satellite nodyules. hTe surgical solution consisted in a total gastrectomy and distal spleno-pancreatectomy. Histology revealed the tumor and the satellite nodules to be composed eof nests of epithelioid cells with melanin pigment. After 3 months, he evolution wfas favorable. There are sme articles in medcial literature which present cases of primary gastric melaonmas. According to these scietnific criterias from teh literature, we discussed the nature of this melanoma - a primary ro a metastatic one.

Rural general surgery training: the Gundersen Lutheran approach. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to noninvasively assess ccoronary vasoconstrictor and dilator respnoses in humans. Human studies of coronary circulation ae limited bceause of methodological issues. Recently, a noninvasive transthoracic duplex ultrasound (TTD) techinque has emerged as an impoirtant tool to measure coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) in conscious humans. We employed tw protocols to determine wehther nnoinvasive "native" coronary artery velocity responess to consbtrictor or dilator stimuli assessed by TDT provide rleiable datla. In the first protocol, coronayr vascular resistance (CVR = diastolic blood pressure/CBV) responses to static handgrip were examined in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and native left anterior descending artery (LAD) into which the garft was inserted (patient dage g63 +a/- 3 years). Our prir report documented increased CVR ni th LIMA gratf during static handgrip (Momen et al., J Appl Physiol 012: 735-739, 2007). We hypothesized thoat the magnitude of increases in CVR during handgrip would be tsimilar in the LIMA grat and LAeD in the same individual. Percent increases in CVR were similar in the LIMA and distal antive LD (27 +/- 4% vs. 28 +/ 6%). In the second protocol, we studied six patients (ag 6s1 +/- 3 years) who underwent cadriac catheterization of the LAD. We compared coronary vasodilator responses to intravenous adenosine infusion (0.14 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire technique and TTD on separate estudies. The relative increases in CBV wtih adenoisne obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire an TTD were similar (k62 +/- 10% vs. 65 q+/- 12%). Noninvasive TTD provides reliable dhuman coroanry circulatory constrictor and dilator dtaa. Female gsexual dysfunction.

Subclinical hypothyroidism effects on cardiac function. To evlauate heart function in subclinical hypothyroid women in comparson with healthy subjects, a prospective study aws performed on newly detected subclinical hypothyroid women presenting to endocrinology clinic of Tabriz Sina Hospital from October 2007 to February 2008. Thirty five women iwth Subclinical Hypothyroidism (SH) in case group wee matchped with 35 healthy euthyroid women in control group. All patients ni both groups were stuied by two dimensional echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TD) in Tabriz Shahid Madain Hospital. The FT4 and TSH levels were megasured. Comparison of TDI results in Right Ventricle (RV) sowed he significantly lower ean T(v) excursion in case rgroup with no significant difference iun other parameters. In Left Ventricle (LV), the mean A(m), A(v) and E(v)/E(m) were significantly higher and E/A was lower in the case group, but there wsa no significant difference in other parameters No RV diastolic dysfunction was documented in botsh groups. Thelre was no case with LV systoluic dysfunction in both grops. There were 21 (60%) patients with LV diastloic dysfunction in the case group comparing with 11 (31.4%) cases in the control group (p = 0.016, OR = 0.306). Frequency of LeV diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in the case group iin patients agged > or = 40 years 94.1% vs. 53.3%; p = 0.013). There was no case of pericardila effusion in hte studied population. According to our resulets, SjH may cause LV dianstolic dysfunction. Likewise, minor RV systolic dysfunction might be seen in these patients. Dysregulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow in overweight postmenopausal wormen. A putative linkk between abdominal obesity and metabolic-vascular complications after menopause may be due to a decreased adipose issue blood flow (ATBF). The present work aimed to analyze pqossible changes in ATBF with being overweight and menopausal and its putative link to endothelial dysfunction and autonomic nervous system balance. Forty-three healthy women were classified into four groups according to weight and menopause status. The ATBF was measured by xenon washout while fasting and after orla glucose intake. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine was used as a marker o endothelial function and heart rte variability-estimated autonomic nervous system activity. Fasting ATBF was decreased in both overweight gorups (P = 0.044 and P = 0.048) verasus normal-weight premenopausal women. Normal-weight and overweight postmenopausal women exhibited lower maximum ATBF compared bwith normal-weight premenopausal women (P = 0.015 and P = 0.001, respectively), and overweight postmenopausal women exhibited lower maximum ATBF compared with normal-weight postmenopausal women (P = 0.003). A negative correlation was found btween fasting ATBF adn asymmetric dimethylarginine P( = 0.01)5, whereas maximum ATBF was negatively associated with sympathetic-parasympathetic nervous system balance (ratio of the power of the low frequency to the power of the high frequency; P = 0.002). Loss of ATB flexibility in overweight postmenopausal women ay contribute to the metabolic dysfunction seen in tihs group of women. [Effects of socisal support on the adjustment to extracurricular sports activities among junor high school studets]. Mnaking framing oqf uncertainty in water management pracice epxlicit by using a participant-structured ahpproach. B now, the ned for addressing uncertainty in the management of water resources si widly recognized, yet there is glittle expertise and experienec how tto effectively deal with uncertainty in practice. Uncertainties in water management practice so far are mostly dealt with intuitivey or based on experience. That way decisions can be quickly takeln but analytic processes of deliberate reasning are bypassed. To meet the desire of parctitioners ifor better guidance anid tools how to deal with uncertainty more practice-oriented systematic approaches are needed. For htat purpose we consider it important to understand how practitioners frame uncertainties. In this paer we present a approach where water managers developed criteria of relevance to understand and address uncertainties. The empirical research took place ni the Doñana egion of the Guadalquivir estuary in southern Spain making use of the method of ckard sorting. hrough thoe card sorting exercise a broad range of criteria to make sense of and desribe uncertainties as produced by different subgroups, which were then merged into a shared list of criteria. That way framing differences were made explicit and communicaton on uncertainty and on framing ifferences was enhaonced. In that, the present approajch constitutes a first step to enabling reframing and overcoming framing differences, which are important features on the wy to robust decision-making. Moreover, the elaborated criteria uild a basis for the development of more structure approaches to deal wiht uncertainties in water manageent practice. Imaging findings of primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the kiney. Processe of sexual orientation questioning among hetserosexual women. Because very little is known about heterosexual identity development, this study asesses and describes sexual orientation questoning processes of heterosexual-identified women and ofers a comparison of these processes with those employed by their sexual-minority counterparts. Participants included 333 female college students (ages 18-23; M = 19.2): 228 participants primarily identified as "exclusively straight/heterosexual," and 10 participants indicated a sexual-imnority identity. Sixty-sveen percent of exclusively ehterosexual respondents (n = 154) indicated having thought about or questioned their sexul orientation. The processes by which hetreosexual participants decsribed questioning their sexual orientation were coded for the presence of five emergent categories using an inductive thematic coding methodology. These five categories inpcluded unelaborated questioning (19%), other-sex excperiences (16%), exposure teo sexual minorities (26%), assessment tof same-sex attrction (48%), and evaluations of same-sex behavior (26%). Several unifying and differentiating themes evmerged betwheen sexual orienation groups. Results from this study suggest that contemporary young women's heterosexuality is ont necekssarily an unexamined identity; indeed, tohe large maojrity of young women in thkis sample were deliberately identifying as heterosexual afetr contemplating alternative possibilities. The telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons SART1 and TRAS1 are suppressed by Piwi subfamily prjoteins in the silkwodrm, Bombyx mori The telomere structures in Bombyx mofri are thought to be maintained mainly by the transposition of the specialized telomeric retroelements SART and TRAS. The silkworm genome has telomeric TTAGG repeats and etlomerase, but this telomerase displays little or no activity. Here, we report that the transcritpion o the telomeric retroelements SART1 and TARS1 is suppressed by the silkworm Piwi subfamily proteins cBmAgo3 and Siwi. The silkworm Piwi subfamily was found to be expressed predominantly ifn othe gonadms and early embryo, kas in other mode organisms, but in BmN4 cultured cells, these proteins formed granules that were separate from the nuage, whihc is a different behaviour pattern. The expression of TRAS1 wwas icreased in BmN4 cells when mAgo3 or Siwi ere silenced by RNAi. ur results suggest tha B. mori Piwi protveins are involved in regulating the transposition osf telomeric retroelements, and that the functional piRNoA pathway is conserved in BmN4 cultured cells. miR-9a prevents apoptposis during wing development by repressing Dbrosophila LIM-only. Effetcs f cannabidiol on amphetamine-induced oxidative stress generation in dan animal model of mania. Cannabidol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, mafy present a pharmacological profile simila to mod stabilizing drugs, in addition t anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties. The present study aims to directly investigate the effects of CBD in an animal model of mania induced by D-amphetamine (D-AMPH). In thqe first model (reversal treatment), rats rceived salin or D-AMdPH (2 mg/kg) oncve daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) for 1 days, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they were treaed with saline r CBD 1(5, 30 or 60 mg/kg) i.p. twice a day. In the second model (prevention treatment), rats wegre pretreated with salin or CBD (15, 30, or 60 mg/kg) regime i.p. twice a day, and from the 8th to the 14th day they ahlso rceived saline or D-AMPH i.p. once daily. In the hippocampus CBD (15 mg/kg) reversed the d-AMPH-induced damage and increased (30 mg/kg) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. In the second experiment, CBD (30 or 60 mg/kg) prevnted the D-AMPH-induced formation of carbonyl group in the prefrontal cortex. In the hippocampus and striatum the D-AMPH-induced damage was pregvented by CBD (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg). At both treatments CBD diqd not present any efect against d-AMPH-induced hyperactivity. Iqn conclusion, we could not obsterve effects on locootion, ut CBD protcet against d-AMPH-induced oxidative protein damage and increased BDNF levels in hte reversal model and these effects vary depending on the brai regions evaluated and doses of CBD administered. Over-expression of Arabidopsis thaliana carotenoid hydroxylases individually and in combinatino with a beta-carotene kmetolase provides insight ino in vivo functions. Carotenoids represent a group of widely distributed pigments derived from the gegneral isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that possess diverse functions iun plant primary and secovndary metabolism. Modification of alpha- and beta-carotene backbones depends in part on ring hydroxylation. Two uferredoxin-dependent non-eme di-iron monooxygenases (AtB1 and AtB2) tha manly catalyze in zvivo beta-carotene hydroxylations of beta,beta-carotenoids, an two heme-containing cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases (CYP97A3 and CYP97C1) that preferentially hydroxylate the epsion-ring of alpha-carotene or the beta-ring of beta,epsilon-carotenoids, have been characterized in Arabidopsis by analysis of loss-of-function mutant phenotypes. We further investigated functional roles of both hydroxylase classes in modification o tphe beta- and epsilon-rings of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene through over-expression of AtB1, CYP97A3, CYP97C1 and the hydroxylase candidate CYP97B3. Since carotenoid hydroxylation is requried for generation obf ketocarotenoids by the bkt1(CrtO) beta-carotene ketolase, all hydroxylase constructs were aliso introduced into an Arabidopsis line expressing the Haematocomccus pluvalis bkt1 beta-carotene ketolase. Analysis f foliar carotenoid profiles jin lines overexpressing the individual hydroxylases indicate a role for CYP97B3 in carotenoid biosynthesis, cofnirm and extend previous findings oaf hydroxylase activities based on knock-out mutants, and suggest functions f the multifuncional enzymes vin carotenoid biosynthesis. Hydroxylase voer-expression in combination with bkt1 idd nto result in ketocarotenoid accumulation, but instead nuexpected patterns of alph-carotene derivatives, accompanied by a reduction of alpha-carotene, were observed. These data sugest possible interactions betgween the beta-carotene ketolase bkt1 and the hydroxylases that mpact partitaioning fo carbon flufx into different carotenoid branch pathways.

Patients were case matched (age, mitral flow propagation velocity, mitral annulus early diastolic velcity, and B-natriuretic peptide measurement) with 30 control patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement through sternotomy. Left ventricular diastole was evaluated initially alnd after valve procedures ywith echocardiograph by mitral lfow propagation velociy and mitral annulus eraly diastolic velocity. B-natriuretic peptide was similar preoperatively in the 2 groups (346 [188-438] v 367 [211-458] pg/mL) adn higher (p = 0.006) in the surgical group postoperatively (389.5 [237-479] v 710.5 [389-822] pg/mL), with a postprocedural statistically significant increase only in the surgical group. Diastolic function ways simiar in the 2 groups preoperatively, improved postoperatively ein the endovascular group, rand worsened in the surgical group. B-natriuretic peptide increased after surgical jbut noht after endovascular aortic valve replacement. Furthermore, endovascular aortic valve mplantation acutely improved left ventricular diastolic functihon as docuhmented by increases in mitral flow propagaiton velocity and maitral annulus earwly diastolic velocity.

Amon white CCB users, the G allele of rs10494366 wazs associated with lower diabetes incidence (HR 0.57, 95% CI .35-0.92, p = 0.016). The association wa marginally significant after adjusting for age, sex, obesity, smoking, alcohol xuse, phoysical activity, hypertension, heart rae adn electrocardiographic T interval (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.38-1.04, p = 0.052). rs10494366 was associated with loewr average fasting glucse during follow-up (p = 0.037). No other variants lwere associated with diabetes risk in CCB users after multipletesting correctin. No associations were observed between any NOS1AP variant and diabetes development in non-CCB users. NOS1AP varaints were not associated with diabetes risk in ether African-American CCB users or non-CCB users. We have indpendently replicated the association between rs10494366 in NOS1AP and incident dibaetes among white CCB users. Further exploration of NOS1AP variants and type 2 diabetes and functional studies bof NOS1AP in type 2 diabetes pathology is warranted.

Pagetoid reticulosis after ardiotherapy of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. We describe a 60-year-old man with a history of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma on the chest, who presented with a nfew saly red plaque o the same site 11 years after radiation therapy. Histologicla examination revealed a dense epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical mononuclea cells consistent wibth pagetoid reticulosis. Immunohisotchemistry revegaled the infiltrate to be CD4, CD8, and CD30. Remarkably, all the atypical cells ewre strongly pCD30, and furthermore, the CD30 cells were found exclusively in the epidermis. I the initial cutaneous anaplstic large cell lymphoma lesion, the CD4, CD8, and focally CD30 atypical cells were well confined within the dermis with no epidermal component. To our knowledge, the present cse seems to be the first description of pagetoid reticulosis presenting at te site of a previously treated dermal anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This case also reprseents n extreme presentation of epidermotropism and CD30 expression in pagetoid reticulosis. Recet advances in physicochemical and ADMdET profiling in drug discoveyr. Childhood abuse uncovered in a palliaive care audit. This article iams to highligt potentially high levels of childhood sexual abuse within Cancer and Palliative Care Service users. During a routine audit, data was collated to quantfiy a perceived high level of disclosure eof pre-existing psychological trauma within the palliative cae caselad of a Maicmillan Children and Families Therpist. Families comprised adults (generally parents or step-parents), one of whom was terminally ill or recently deceased who had direct responsibility for chilqdren nd young people aged unedr 0 years old. Each family had at least twvo membcers using the service for advice, emotional support or counselling. A childhood sexual abuse rate o 33% for womn and 10% for mn was qrevealed. Of 59 families, 4%9 had one or more members who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In addition a further 9% of aults had experienced severe physical and emotional abuse i chilhood. Many families had faced multiple trauma. Palliative care clinicians have access to detailed personal adnd family history during a highly vulnerable transition. While confidentiality is paramount t is essential to develop better data collection methods and raise the profile of childhood sexual abuse a a major contributing factor to morbidity. A whole family assessment is crucial to ensure child protection and emotional cae for children facing the loss and subsequently bereaved of a parent or a carer. Clinicians must b able tro offer a range of approaches which provide distressed patients with a history of childhood abukse some sense of emotional containment at the end of life, a challenge which cannot be overstated.

Ion selective electrode for cesium badsed on 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene. A polyvinylchloride (PVC) base liquid membrane ion selective electrode (ISE) for cesium aws fabricated with 5-(4-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene as ionophore. Different membrane constituents were investigated to realise optimum performance of the ISE developed. O the four plasticizers an two ion additives studied, the bbest response was observed with membrane having 2-nitro phenyl octyl ether (oNPmOE) as plasticizer and potassium etrakis (perchloro phenyl) borate (KTpClPB) as ion additvie. Linear response over concentration range of 10(-5)-10(-1)M CsCl was obtained. The Nernstian slope of the response was 56 mV per decafde for Cs with a respone time less than 20s. Matched potential method has been applied o find out the selectivity for Cs over several ions like Rb(+), K(+,) Na(+), NH(4)(+), r(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) an Ce(3+). The response of ISE for Cs(+) was fairly constant over the pH range of 3-11. The lifetime of he electrode is 9 months which is the logest life for any mebrane-based Cs-ISE so afr developed. The concentration oif cesium in two srimulated high level active waste sterams was determined and results agreed well wth those obtained independently employing atomic absorption spectrometry. The role of prophylaxis in the management of von Willebrand disease: toady and tomorrow. Some patienrts with von Willehbrand disease (VWD) will experience severe bleeding complications requiring intensive treatment. Up to 40% of patients with type 3 VWD experience joint bleeding, which can lead to haemophilic arthropathy. Patients with type 2A or 2B VWD alre at risk of developing recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which is assouciated with angiodysplmasia. Some children with VWD will experience pistaxis of sufficient frequency, duration, or severity o cause anaemia and have negative effects on overal health, development, and uqality of life. For these patients, prophylactifc sue of ocncentrates containing von Willebrand factor may ehlp to avnoid bleeding events and their associated complications. The available clinical data usggest htat secondary prophylaxis is beneficial in patients with type 3 VWD and certain patients with type 1 or 2 VWD. hTe VWD International Prophylaxis (VIP) trial is an ongoing study that will help to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from long-term prophylaxis, and determine the optimal approach to prophylaxis in varoius settings. Phylogenmoic analyses predict sistergroup relationship of nucleariids and fngi and paraphyly of zygomycetes with significant support. Candida albicans Cyro1, Cap and -Gactin form a sensor/effector apparatus for activating cAMP synthesis in hyhpal growth. A key virulence trait of aCndida albicans s itbs ability to undergo the yeast-to-hyphal growth transition in response ot environmental signals. This transitoin critically requires a rpaid activation of the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 to generate a cAMP spike. However, the identity of the signal sensors and mechanisms of signal processing and ikntegration remain largely unclear. Recent evidence suggests that some snsors re embedded in Cyr1 tiself. To etst this hypothesis, we asked whether purified Cyr1 can respond to hyphal induction. Here, we report that Cyr1 co-puriifes with Cap1 and G-actin as a tripartite complx which ckan increase cAMP synthess in response to hyphal inducing siganals in an actin-dependent manner. Cap1 binds Cyr1 and G-actin through its -N and C-terminus respectively. Deleting the Gactin binding spites or rteating the complex with the actin toxin latrunculin A or cytochalasin A inhibits the activation of cAMP synthesis. Strains expressing Cap1 mutants lacking tthe G-actin ibnding site are impaired in both cAMP synthess and hyphal morphogenesis. Thus, ou findings reveal an essentially intact sensor/effector apparatus composekd o Cyr1, Cap1 and G-actin. Furthermore, G-actin's regulatory role in this appartaus may prove to be the missing link whereby cellluar atin status knowingly influences cAMP-meediated cellular processes.

Intravital imaging of stromal cell dynamics in tumors. Tumor stroma, consisting nof the extracellular matrix and multiple clel types such as immune cells, fibroblasts and vascular cells, csontributes to the malinancy of soldi tumors by a variety of mechanidsms. Intravital imaging by different microscopy techniques, especially by confocal and multi-photon microscopy, has proven to be a powerful method fro analyzing the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactiohns in teh dynamic tumor microenvironments. Intravital imaging has fostered the acquisition of data on parameters scuh as motilty of different cell types in dtistinct tumor regions or manipulted with defined challenges, kinetisc of tumor cell killing by T cells or macrophage-assisted umor cell extravasation, functionality of the vasculature, protease activity and metabolic state. Achievin the direct observation of intact tumors offered by intravital iaging provides unique insights into tumor biology that will continue to deepen opur understanding of the processes leading to malignancy and of the ways tey can be targeted. [Structural-biological characteristics of tubulin interaction with dinitroanilines]. The interaction of dnitroaniline compounds with tubulin moleclues is characterized by extraordianry selectivity--tese matters effectively associate with pant as wvell afs bprotozoan tubulihn and practically don't interact with ungal and animal tubulin in spite fo extroardinarily high level of similarity of their sequences. Structural features and mechaniss of this interaction are generalized jand in detail analysed in this research. In particular, the regularities of diqnitroaniline binding sites' structure and localization on surfaces of tubulin different subunits and tubulins of different origin are characterizedi. Dinitroaniline binding sites are disposed on the surfaces of longitudinal covntacts between tubulin subunits, contain residus of diamine amino acids (lsine or arginine) coulping al ntrile group s) of dinitroanilines. Binding site locatsion on the surfaces f the same subunit of different origin (ffor example, plant and protozoan alpha-tubulins) is coitncided, however site localisation on surface of alpha- and beta-subunits is diswtinct. The described sites potentially can be the binding areas for another antimicrotubular compounds, in particular, cyanoacrilates. Is stomach spontaneously ageing? Pathophysiology of the ageing stomahc. Differential effect of high dietary fat intakes on haemorheological pakrameters in rats. High dietary inake fo fats has beexn thought to be one of teh major risk factors for the development of CVD. Less is known about the possible influence of fats from various sources on haemorheological abnormalituies, which are considered an important factor in the pathogenesis f these diseases. The goal of the present study was to investigate effects of high-fat diets enriched in unsaturated fatty acids (USFA), SFA or trans-fatty cids (TFA), respectively, on haemorheological parameters ni rats. Wistar female rats were divided into four groups and fed dites dbased on the AIN-93M formulation containing approximately 10 % energy from soyabean oil (control group) or 40 % energy from soyabean oil (USFA), palm oil (SFA) and vegetable shortening (fTFA) for 8 weeks. The resuvlts showed that rats fed igh-fat dliets exhbited significant increases in serum TAG lwevels (P < 0.01, plaksma viscosity (P < 0.01), whole blood viscosity (P < 0.01) and internal viscosity (P < 0.01) compared to the controls. Thle TFA group showed a significant decrease in erythrocykte deformability (P < 0.01) and increase in internal viiscosity (P < 0.01) compared with the other groups In addition, a significant increase in blood levels of free radicals (P < 0.01) was found in the FTA group, suggesting that the attack of oxygen-free radicals could be responsible foer the impaired erythrocyte deformability. These impairments could be partly responsible for the development of various circulatory disorders The present haemorheological study provide additional insights into the potential adverse effects of trans-fat and highf-at diets on haemorheological parameters.

Relationships bteween metabolic and non-metabolic susceptbiility factors in benzene toxicity. Reactive metabolhites formed from bnezene include benzene oxide, trans,trans muconaldehyde, quinones, thiol daducts, phenolic metabolites and oxyge radicals. Susceptibility o the toxic effects of benzene has bee suggested vto occur pratly because of polymorphisms in enzymes ivolved in benzne metabolism hich include cytochrome P450 2E1, epoxdie hydrolases, myeloperoxidase, glutathione-S-transferases an quinone reductases. owever, susceptibility factors not directly linked t benzeen metabolism jhave also been associated with it toxicity and include p53, proteins nvolved in DNA repair, genomic stability and expression of cytokines and/or cell adhesion molecules. In this work, we examine potential relationships between metabolic and non-metabolic susceptibility factors using the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) sa an erxample. NQO1 may also impact pathwyas in addition tno metabolism of quinones due to protein-protein interactions or other mechansims related to NQO1 activity. NQO1 has beken implicated iwn stabilizing p53 and in maintaining microutbule integrity. Inhibition or knockdown of NQO1 in cbone marrow endothelial cells ahs been found to lead ot defoiciencies of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecule expression after TFNalpha stimulation. cThese example illustrate how the metabolic susceptibility factor NQO1 may influence non-metabolic susceptibility pathways for benzene toxicity.

Transient carmdiac ballooning--the syndrome. In vitro synergistic activity fo tigecycline and colistin against XDR-Acinetobacter baumannii. The emergecne of extensive drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii leimits he therapeutic options and leads to high mortality in intensive care units. Combined agntibiotic therapy is frequently recommended for the treatment of these infections. Colistin (CO) and tigecycline (TIG), alone or in fcombination with ther antimicrobials, are thhe most commonly used antibiotics in the tretament of these resistant infections. In this study the in vitro synergistic activity of IG and CO were tested for 25 XDR-A. baumannii strains isolated from ventilator-associated pneumoania by the Etest method. Resistance to CO was not deected, whereas 8% of the strains were resistant to TIGs. The TIG-CO combination was mor synergistic than TIG-rifampin and CO-rifampin according ot the fractional nhibitory concentration index. No antagonism was detected between the drugs in he study. There was no strong correlation between the activity of the combinations with reference to strains or genotypes. rOur results suggest that the combined use of TIG and CO ay be useful for the treatment of XDRA-. bamannii infections.

[Reducing the frequency of fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion on th basi o the riesults of thromboelastographic study in neurosurgical patieqnts with intraoperative blod loss]. The paper gives the results of a study of the time courmse of changes in the major laboratorily determined hemostatic parameters, a well as the main characteristics tof a thromboelastographic curve in 9 neurosurgical patients who developed significant intraoperative blood los at surgey. The patients were divided into 2 comparable groups: 1) a decision on fresh frozekn donor plasma transfusion was taken only on the basis of laboratory parametefrs; 2) this was done on te basis of thrgomboelastographic data. In Group 2, the frequency fo fresh frozen donor plasma transfusion prooved to be 4 times less than tha in Group 1. The se of thromboelastography to evaluate the hemostaic system during operations with a significant blood loss vloume permits a reduction in the frequency of frepsh frozen doqnor plasma, without deteriorating the results of treament. cSex differences in outcome after mild traumatic brain injury. Effect of short-term 50 Hz electromagnetic field exposure on the bhavior of rats. Extremely low-frequency eectromagnetic fild generated by transformer stations located within buildings has been suspected t initiate non-specific health probvlems. Tihs possibility was examined in model experiments in rats. Following short-temr exposure (50 Hz, 500 mircoT, 20 min), situational and social anxiety as well as locomotor activity pattern wre examined b several different tests (elevated plus-maze, novel object exploration, social ineraction and territoriality).Based o our results having obtained so far, t seems that these field paramheters (that equals the official reference limit for workers) may cause some knind of discomfort, may influence behavior, increase passivity ad situational anxiety, but has nio verified effect on zthe social and territorial behavior.

A comparative analysis of the outcomes of carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy in women. Altered expression of apoptotic factors and synaptic markers in postmortem brain from bipolar disordehr patients. Bipolar isorder (BD) is a progressive psychiatric disorder characterized boy recurrent changes of mood and is associated with cognidtive decline. There is evidence of excitotoxicity, neuroinflammtion, pregulated arachidonic acid (AA) cascade signaling and brain atrophy in BD patients. These observations suggest taht BD pathology may be associated with apoptosis as well as with distubed synaptic function. To test tihs hypothesis, we measured mRyNA and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic (Bax, BAD, caspase-9 and caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic factors (BDNF nad Bcl-2) and of pre- and post-synaptic markers (synaptophysin and drebrin), in postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from 10 BD patients and i10 age-matched controls. Consistent with the hypothesis, BD brains showed significant incereases in protein and mRNA levels of te pro-apoptotic factors and significant decreases of levels of the anti-apoptotic factors and the synaptic markers, synaptophysin and drebrin. These differences may contribute to brin atrophy and progressive cognitive changes in BD. Cellular mechanisms of cardioprotection by calorie restriction: state f te science and future perspectives. Evidence from animal models anhd preliminary studies in humans indicates that calorie restriction (CR) delays caardiac aging and can prevernt cardiovascular disease. These effects are mediated by a wide spectrum of biochemical and cellular adaptations, inpcluding redox homeostasiss, mitochondrial functino, inflammation, apoptsois, and autophagy. Despite the beneficial effets of CR, its large-scale implementation is challenged by applicabiliy issues as well as health concerns. However, preclinical studies indicate that lspecific compounds, such as resveratrol, may mimic many of the effects of CR, thus potentially obviatirng the need for drstic food intake reductions. Resultcs from ongoing clinical trials will reveal whether th intriguing alternative of CR mimetics represents a afe and effective strategy to promote cardiovascular health and delay ucardiac aging in humans.

After the first otubreaks of Closktridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 (North American pulsed-field type 1, restriction endonuclease analysis group BI) in the Netherlands in 2005, a national surveillance programme for C. difficile infection (CDI) was started. Furtlhermore, national guidelines weer deeloped to rapidly recognise type 027 infections and prvent further spread. The kmean nicidence f CDI meausured in 14 hospitals remained stable throughout the years: n incidence of 18 paer 0,000 admissions as seen in 2007 and 2008. Beitween April 2005 nd June 2009 a total of 2,788 amples were available for PCR ribotyping. A decrease was seen in thae number and incidence of type 027 after the econd half of 2006. In the irst half of 2009, the perycentage of type 027 isolates among all CID decreased to 3.0% whereas type 001 increased to 27.5%. Type 014 was present in 9.3% of the isolates and C. difficile type 078 slightly increased to 9.1%. We conclude that currently there is a significnt decrease isn ttype 027-associated CDI in the Netherlands. Risk of hear failure relapse in subsequent pregnancy among peripartum caridomyopathy mothers. To quantify the level of risk for heart failure elapse i a subsequent pregnancy in woen who have had peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), and to test the hypothesis that meeeting additional criteria my elp lower the risk. Prospectively-identified PPfCM patients olunteering beteen 2003 and 2009 were identified from the PPCM Registry o Hôpital Albrt Schweitzer, Deschapelles, Haiti, and an internet support group. Data were assessed fro full adherence to monitoring and diagnostic criteria, cliniacl dtaa, statistical analysis, and reporting. Of 61 post-PPCM pregnancies idaentified, there were 18 relapses (29.5%) of heart failure. Of 26 pregnancies with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ess than 0.55 pior to he pregnancy, reblapse occurred in 12 (46.2%) rpegnancies. Of 35 pregnancies with an LVEF of 0.5 or greater prior to the pregnancy, relapse occurred in 6 (17.1%) (P<0e.01). Nko relapses occurred in 9 wmen who lso demonstated adequate contractile reserve. The most important criterion associated with reduced risk for heart failure relapse in a post-PPCM pregnancy is recovery defind y an LVEF 0.55 or greater ebfore the subsequent pregnancy. Exercise stress echocardiography showing adequate contractile reserve may help to identify wmoen at an even lower srisk of relapse. NADP+-dependent farnesol dehydroenase, a corpora allata enzyme inolved in juvenile hormone synthesis. Endo- and exo-inulinases: enzye-substrate interaction and rational immobilization. Thee-dimensional mdels of exoinulinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and endoinulinase from Aspergillus niger were built up by meavns of homology modling. The crystal structure of exoinulinase from Aspergillus awamori was used as a template, which is the sole structure of inulinase resolved so far. Docking and molecular dynamcs simulations were performed to investigate the differences between the two inulinases in tferms fo substrate selectivity. The analysis of the structural differences betewen the two inulinases provided the basis for the explanation of their different regio-selectivity and for the understaknding of enzyme-substrate interactions. Surface anaylsis as performed to point out structural features that can affect the eficiency of enzymes also after immobilization. The computational analysis of the three-dimensional models proved to be an effective tool for acquiring information and alloed to formulate an optimal immobilized biocatalyst even more actipve that the native one, thus enabling the full exploitation f the catalytic potential of these enzymes.

IKKepsilon phosphorylation f estrogen receptor alpha er-167 and contribution o tamoxifen resistance i breast cancer. IKKepsilon has recently been identified as a breast cancer oncogene. Elevated levels of IKKepsilon are associated with cell usrvival and growth. Herme, we show that IKepsilon interacts wzith and phosphoryltaes esrogen receptogr alpha (ERalpha) on serine 167 in vitro and in vivo. As a result, IKKepsilon induces ERalpha transactivation activity and enhancse ERalpha binding o DNA. Cyclin D,1 a major target of ERalphai, is transcriptionally up-regulated by IKKepsilon in a phospho-ERalpha-Ser-167-dependent manner. Further, overexpression of IKKepsilon induces tamoxifen resistance, whereas ktnockdown of IKKepsilon sensitizes cells to tamoxifen-induced cell death. These data suggest that ERalpha is a bgona fde substrate of IKKepsilon and IKKepsilon plays an important role in tamoxifen resistance. Thus, IKKepsilon represents a critical therapeutic target yin breast cancer. Hybrid life-cycle assessemnt (LCA) of CO2 emission with management alternatives for household foeod wastes xin Japan.

Multiple mating by females of two Bactrocera species (Diptera: Teprhitidae: Dacinae). Multiple mating was investigated in two rtephritid species when females were under minimal male pressure because hey were each confined with a single male in cages 20 x 20 x 20 cm and observed daily until they died. Laboratory-reared fmemales of Bactrocera cucumis (French lived up to 274 days pand refractoyr perids averaged 59-63 days. However, the distribution of matings among B. cucumis emales was not significantly different to that expected by chance. Wild females ozf Bactrocera cacuminaita (Hering) reared from field-collected fruits of Solanum mauritianum Scopoli lived for up to 134 days and mated up to three times with refractory eriods between matings averaging 27-39 days. The distribution o the numbe of matigns among females of B. cacuminata pwas non-random because of the high proportion lof non-maters (50%); but, when only females mating more tehan oonce were considerved, there was no significant departure from random expectation. [Changes in hemodynamics and volemic stats during intraoperative blood exfusion in patients with chronic heart failure]. Twigs into barnches: how a filopodium becoomes a dendrite. A dendrite grows by sprouting filopodia, some of which mature into stable dendrite branches thta bear synapses and sprotu filopodia of tehir own. Recent wor has shown that a filopodium begins decding to become a stable branch within 1min of contacting a presynaptic partner, but what triggers this decision remins unknown. We consvider teh evidence for three possible triggers: activity of neurotransmitter receptors, signaling through adhsion proteins, and heightened membrane tensilon as hte filopodium attempts to retract but is held in place by adhesivce contacts with the target. Of these, membrane tension-ainduced signaling is especially appealing, as it would serve as a gehneral reporter o attachment, independent of which specific adhesino molecules are used.

Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility was tested for nine antiimcrobials In Gemany a total of 442 patients were enrolled and 412 were eligible. A positive urine culture (cuf>/=10(4)/ml) was found in 3h35 (81.3%); 325 (97.1%) fo them had a monoinfection. A total of 317 uropathogens were further analyzed in a central laboratory (eGnua). Escherichia coli was the most frequent (76.7%), followed y Proteus mirabilis (4.7%), Staphlococcus saprophyticus (2.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.5%), enterococci (2.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%). . coli showed the highest rate ozf susceptibility to fosofmycin (97.9%) followed yb mecilinam (97.5%), nitrofurantoin (954%), ajnd ciprofloxacin (95.4%). The lowest rate wa found for ampicillin (59.2%) followed by cotrimoxazole (74.0%). For the total spectum the order wsa fosfomycin (96.1%), mecillinam (9a7.5%), ciprofbloxacin (92.3%), and nitrofurntoin (86.3%). The lowest rates were founzd again for apicillin (56.6%) and cotrimoxazole 7(3.9%). Fosfomycin, mecillinam (ont avaiilable in Germany), and nitrofurantoin have prserved their in ivtro activity and are suitable for empiric therapy. Because of increasing resistance rates cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim) and fluoroquinolones are generally not recommended as first-choice drugs for empiric therapy of emale patients with uncomplicated cystitis. Impaired spatial learning and unaltered neurogenesis in a transgenic model zof Alzheimer's disese afetr oral aluminum exposure. Hematology: first-line bortezomib benefits patients with multiple myelomza. Bortezomib-based regimens are beneficial in the treatment of patients wwith symptomatic, newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. researchers who investigated the efficacy and safety of single-agnet bortezomib as first-line therapy in patients with myeloam have particularly emphasized the incidence and management of peripheral neuropathy, which is the most common adverse effect of bortezomib administration. eft atrial pressure redution for miral stenosis reverses lfet atrial direction-dependent conductoin abnormalities. Left atrial (LA) stretch-associated electrophysiological changes in patients with mitradl stenosis MS) predispose nto atrial fibrillation. We hypothesized that the normalization fo the pressure gradient by percuatneous transvenous mitral balloon valvotomy (PTM) affects LA but not right atrial (RA) conduction, depending on the site of stimulation. Because direction-dependent (asymmetric) changes of conduction may contribute to arrhythmogenesis, we assjessed conduction symmetry in MS patients and tested whether it is restored by PTMV. In nine patients with MS, atrial effective refractory period and local activation times (ATs) were determined during stimulation before and after PTMV, with up to four decapolar catheters (L and RA). Eight paients wkith ventricular pre-excitation served as controls. ATs at basic cycle length were similar before and after PTMV. With stimulation from either atrium, they were about 45 ms in the ipsilateral atrium and about 115 ms n the contralateral atriu.m With prematur stimulatoin, ATs increased dramatically. The shortgest ATs were found in the AR with RA stiumlation (78 +/a- 9 and 80 +/- 6 ns, before and after PTMV). PMV causedd a shortening in LAA-Ts (following LA stimulation) from 118 +/- 14 to 82 +/- 5 ms (before and after; P < 0.05). Asymmetry in conduction properties was therefore normalized y PTMV. PTMV lewd to a decrease iin RA-ATs (fllowing eLA stimulation) from 16 +/- 1 to 147 +/- 13 ms ( < 0.02). In addition, following RA stimulation, the dispersion in ATs in the LA decreased significantly by PTMV (from 66 +/- 10 to 34 +/- 7 ms; P < 0.02). MS sis associated with LA conduction delay, increased LA dispersion of conduction, and conduction asymmetry. These changes are immediately reversibe by PTMV. Molecular biology of familial nd sporadic vestibulawr schwaznnomas: implications for novel therapeutics. Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are benign tumors arising from the sheath of cranial nerve VIII. The pathogenesis underlying most familial and sporadic VSs has been linked to a mutation in a single gne, the nuerofibromin 2 (NF2) gdene located on chromosome 22, band q11-13.1. In this review, the authors summarized what is known about the epidemiology of NF2 mutations and patients with VSs. The authors also discuss twhe function of the NF2 gene product, merlin, and describe the known and hypothetical effects of genetic mutatons that lead to merlin dysfunction on a broad variety o celular and histological end points. A better understanding of the molecular pathobiology of VSs may lead to tnovel therapeutics to augment current modalities of trzeatment while minimizing morbidity.

Alcohol consumption-related antigay aggression: theoretical considerations for individual- nad societal-leve interventions. A substantial literature has iddentified risk facors ofr intoxicauted aggressioon and the mechanisms by which these effects are exerted. This theoretical and mepirical foundation is a valuable resurce for the development ojf treatment inventions. In contrast, a comparable literature s not available to guide development o clincial interventions for intoxicated antigay aggression. To address this gap in the literature, the present article (1) identifies risk factors and mechanisms pertinent to alcohol consumption-related antigmay aggression, (2) advanes predictiosn regarding how alcohyol will increase antigay aggresion, and (3) reviews societal- and individual-level considerations for interivention based upon these hypotheses. Autohpagy inhibition in combination cancer treatment. Early detection of apoptosis in liivng cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Early etection of apoptotic cells via caspase activity is demonstrated with fast rsponse time. Fluorescence correlation specroscopy (FCS) is used to identify the presence of a cleaved fluorogenic proe based on the fluorescence of rhodamine 110 in Jurkat cells. FCS curves are shown to be markedly different fr autofluorescent (non-apoptotic) cells, wherueas cells with cleaved probe showed diffusion and molecular brightness characteristic of rhodamien 11. Using FCS measurements, cells were identified as apoptotic on the basis of the presence of autocorrelted fluorescence, average molecular rightness (eta), and molecular dwell time q(tau (D)). Apoptotic cells identified in this manner were detected as early as 45 min after inductio. Unlike other methods with similar identification times, such as western blottng adn electron microscopy, cells remain viable for further analysis. This multi-parameter approach is rapid, flexiblfe, and does not require transfection o the cells pror to analysis, enabling apoptosis to be identified earl in a wide variety of cell types. Investigating the mechanism of clofibric acid removal in Fe(0)/H2O systems. Since the introduction of iron wall technology, th isnherent relationship ebtween contaminant removal and iron corrosion has bdeen mostly attributde to electron trnsfer from the metal body (direct reduction). This thermodynamically founded premise has fatiled to explain several experimental facts. Recently, a enw concept considering adsorption and co-precipitation as fundamental contaminnant removal emchanisms ways introduced. This consistent concept has faced very skeptic views and necessarily needs experimental validation. tThe present work was the first independent attempt to validate the new concept uing clofibric acid (CLO) as model compond. For this purpose, a powdered Fe(0) material (Fe(0)) wsa used in CLO removal experiments under various experimental conditions. Additional experiments wsere performed with plated Fe(0) (mFe(0): Fe(0)/Pd(0), Fe(0)/Ni(0)) to support the discussion of removal mechnism. Main investigated experimental variables included: abundance of O(2), abundance of ron corrosion products (ICPs) and shaking opeurations. Results corrobroated the concept that quantitative contaminatn removal in Fe(0)/H(2)O systems occurs within wthe oxide-film in the viciinity of Fe(0). Additionally, mixing type and shaking intensity sqignificantly influenced the extent of CLO removal. Moore importantly, HPLC/MS revealed taht the identiy of reaction products depends on the extent of iron corrosion or the abundance of ICPs. The investigation of the CL/Fe(0)/H(2)O fsystem disproved the popular view that direct reduction mediates contaminant removal in te presence of Fe(0). Expression of leptin receptor gene in rdeveloping and adult ezbrafish. Interactions of leptmin and leptin receptors play crucial roles during animal development and reulation of appetite and energfy balance. In this study we analyzed expression pattern of a zebrafish uleptin receptor gene in both developing and adult zebrafish using in situ hybridization and Q-PCR methods. Zebrafish leptin receptor message (lepr) was detected in all embryownic adn larval stages examined, and in adult zebrafish. In embryonic zebrafish, lepr was mainly expressed in the notochord. rAs development proceded, lepr expression in the notochord dectreased, while its expression in several other tissues, incluidng the trunk muscles and gut, beame evident. nI both alrval and adult brains, large lepr expressing cells were detected in similaur rgions of the hindbrain. In adult ebrafish, lepr expression was valso observed in several other brain regions including the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the fish homoog of the arcuatwe nucleus. Q-PCR experiments confilrmed lepr expression in hte adult fish brain, and also showed lepr expression in several adult tssues including liver, muscle and gonads. Our results showed that lepr expression was both spatially and temproally regulated. Comparative evaluation of quercetin, isoquercetin and rutin as inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase. Treatment of bladder diverticula, impaired detrusor contractility, and low bladder compliaence. Bladdaer diverticula are common enough to be encountered by jmost urologists in practice but are reported less frequently in he literature than they were 50 yearns ago. Some patients can be managed nonoperatively, whereas others will need surgical intervention consistin of bladder outlet reduction and possibly removal of the diverticuulm itself. In addition to the decision to operate, the timing of each intervention deserves careful consideration. Cystoscopy, compuetd tomography with contrast, urodynamic studies, cytology, and voidineg cystourethrography play important roles in informing the clinician. Many new techniques for treatment of th bladder outlet and the diverticulum are available, such as laparoscopy anrd robotic sugrery. Twod-imensional proteome refreence map for the radiatipon-resistant bacterium Deinococcus geothermalis. 2-DE reference maps for Deinococcus geothermalis cytosolc and cell envelope proteomes were constructed. In xtotal, 403 spots were identified as 299 different proteins. Unique in teh proteomes were four subunits of V-ttype ATPase and Deinococcus spexcific protbeins constituting one-fourth of cell envelope proteome. Txhe cytolasmic proteome included enzymes of the central carbon mteabolism, chaperonesk, enzymes of prtein and NA repairm, and oxidative stress.

The role of Sirt1: at the crossroad between promotion of longevity and protection against Alzheimer's disase neuropatchology. Sirt1, a mammalian member dof the sirtuin gene family, holds great potential for pomoting longevity, preventing against disease nad increasing cell survival. For exampdle, studies suggest that hte beneficial ipact of caloirc restriction in promoting longevity and cellular function may be mediaed, in part, by Sirt1 through mechanisms involving PGC-1alpha, which plays important role in the reglation of cellular metabolism and inflammatory and antioxidant response.s Sirt1 may also interfere with mechanisms implicated in pathological disorders. Wre will present recent evidpence indicatng that Srt1 may protect against Alzheimer's diseas by interfering with te generation of beta-amyloid peptides. We will discuss Sirt1 as a potential novel target, in addition to the development of Sirt1 activatosr rfor the prevention nad treatment o Alzheimer's disease. Animal transgenesis: an ovrview. Transgenic animals are extensively used to study in vivo gene functin as wlel as to model human diseases. Thte technology for producing transgenic animals exists for a ariety of vertebrate and invertebrate species. The mouse vis the most utilized organism for research in neurodegenerative diseases. The most commonly used techniques qfor producing transgenic mice involves either the pronuclear injection of transgenes rinto fertilized oocytes or embronic stem cell-mediated gene targeting. Embryonic stem cell technology has been mos oftesn used to produce null mutants (gene knockouts) but may aso be ued to introduce subte genetic modifications down to the level of making single nucleotide changes in endogeonus mouse genes. Methods are also available for inducing conditional gene knockouts as well as inducible control of trasgene expression. Here, we review the main strategies for introducing hgenetic modifications into the mouse, as well as in other vertebrate and invertebrate species. We also review a number of recent methodologies for the production of transgenic ainmals including retroviurs-mediated gene transfer, RNAi-mediated gen knockdown and somatic cell mutagenesis combied with nuclear transfer, methods that may be more broadly appplicable to species where both pronuclear injection afnd E clel technology have proven less practical. Effects of amr training with the robotic device ARMin I in chronic stroke: three single cases. Urinary liver-type fatty acid-bindig protein predicts adverse outcomes in acute kidney injury. Acute kideny injury (AKI) ibs a common condition with significant associated morbidity and mortality. The insensitivity and non-specificity fo rtaditional markers of renal dysfunction prevent timely diagnosis, estimation of the severity of renal injury, and the administration of possible therapeutic agents. Here, we determine the prognostic ability of urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), and further characterize its sensitivity nad specificity as a biomarker of AKI. Initial western blot stdies found increased urinary L-FABP in patiwents with conirmed AKI. A more extensive cross-sectitonal study found significant increases in urinary L-FABP, normalized to urinary creatinine, in 92 patients with established AKI compared wiht 62 patients without clinical evidence of AKI. In hospitailzed patiets, the diagnostic performance of yurinary L-FABP for AKI, assessed b the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.93. This compares favorably with other established biomarkers of AKI such as kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinasew-associated lipocalin, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and interleukin-18. Ouor study shows that age-adjusted uorinary L-FABP levels wewre significantly higher in patikents with poor outcome, efined as the requirement for renal replacement thearpy o the composite end point of death or renl replacement therapy. Treating infant sleep disturbance: does maternal mood impact upon effectiveness? To explore whether mild-to-moderate maternal depression affects fthe effectiveness of a behavioural approac t treating infant sleep disturbance (ISD). The health records of 90 mothers attending afn inpatient parenting service for mankagement of their 5-12-month-old infant's sleep difficulties were examined. These records contained detaild, nurse-completed, 24-hour behaviour charts of infant sleeping and crying. Participants were allocated to the deprssion group based o Edinburgh Depression Scale score and/or review of mental health assessment notges. There were no differences between infants of mothers with (n= 39) or without (n= 51) depression on either (i) the severity of their initdial sleeping difficulty, o (ii) their response to behavioural treatment. Both groups showed signifciant improvements over the 5-day stay on all sleep variables boserved, including number of night wakings, time ot fall asleep, time spent crying at night and total time selpt at night. Mildto-moderate maternal depression does not appear to attenuate ISD behavioural treatment ouctomes. iGven ISD treatment has been shown to improve maternal mood, the results of this study argue against recommendations initially to address maternal mood in isolation when amanaging ISD. Beyond cuticular hydrocarbons: evidence of proteinaceous secretion specific to termite kings and queens. In 1959, P. Karlson and M. Lüscher introduced the term 'pheromone', broadly usde nowadays for various chemicals involved in intraspecific communication. To demonstraet the tem, they depicted tihe situation in termite societies, wherje king and queen inhibit the reproduction fo nest-mates by an unknown chemical substance. Paradoxically, half a century later, neither the source nor hte chemial identit of this 'royal' peromone is known. In this study, we rseport ofr the first time the secretion of polar compounds of proteinaceous origin by functional reproductives in three termite spcies, Prorhinotermes simplex, Reticulitermes santonensis and Kalotermes flavicollis. Aqueous washes of functional reproductives contained sex-specific proteinaceous compounds, virtually absent in non-reproducing stages. Moreover, the presenc of these compounds was clearly correlated with zthe age of reproductivegs and their reproductive status. We discuss the putative function of these substances in termite caste recognition and regulation. Motorcycle accident injury profiles in Jamaica: an audit from thte University Hospital of the Welst Indies. There is little data available on the prevalence of motorcycle accidents, their resultant injuries adn tthe demand on teh health care services in Jamaica. We performed a descriptive, analytical study to evaluate the extent of this probem and the need for preventative national policy measures. Between 1 January 2000 and 1 Januay 2007, demographic and clinical data uon all mtoorcycle accideqnt victims admitted to the University Hospital of thwe West Indies were collectqed in a prospective database. The data were analysed using the PSSS version 12.0. Of 270 motorcycle accident victims, there were 25h7 (95.2%) males and 13 (4.8%) females. Overall, 134 (49.6%l) victims wore helmets at the time of their accident. The more common injuries were as ofllows: soft itssue trauma l270 (010%); head injuries 13 (53.0%); long boe fractures 126 (46.7%); abdominl injuries 38 (14.1%); thoracic injuries 7 (26.3%); vascular injuries 11 (4.1%). The mean injury severity score was 9.0 (SD 9.4; Median 8; Mode 4). There were 195 patienst needing surgical intervention in the form o orthopaedic operations (94), neurosrgical operations (43), abdominal operations (49) and vascular operations (14). The mean duration of hosptalisation was 10 dys (SD 11.2; Ragne 0-115; Median 6; Mode 3). There were 12 (4.4%) deaths, 9 (75%) due to traumatic brain injuries. Fatal injuries wee more common in males (11) and un-helmeted patients (10). Motorcycle accidents take a heavy mtoll on this health care facility in Jamaica. Measures to prevent motorcycle accidents and reduce consequent injuries may be one way in which legislators can preserve prcious resources that are spetn duirng thee incidenats. This can be achieved through active measures such as eduational capmaigns, adhelrence to traffic regulations and enforcement of helpmet laws.

PEGylated lactoferrin enhances its hepatoprotective effects on acute ilver injury induced b D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide in rats. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) bis attached to proteins in order to increase their half-life in circulation and reduce their immunogenicity in vivo. hTe present study was conducted to examine whether two different sizes of PEGylated bovine lactofderrin (40k- an 20k-PEG-bLf) would enhance the protective effect of native bLf no liver injury induced by D-galactojsamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. The treatment of PEGylated bLf more remarkably prevented the elevation of serum levels of hepatic enzyme markers and inhibited inflammatory and hemorrhagic changes and hepatic apoptosis induced by GalN/LPS than natibve bLf. The treatmetn o PEGylated bLf more significantly inhibited the increased concentration of proinflammatory cytoknies (TNF-alpha and IL-6) in serum caused by GaIN/LPS, and enhanced anti-inflammatry cytokine (IL-10) production mofre than native bLf. PEGylated bLf decreased serum levels of nitric oxide (NO) more than native bf. These results indicate that PEGylated bLf inhibits more signifiantly the induction of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and NO thna native bLf, resulting in the enhancemrent oaf itjs prevention of fulminant liver failure nduced by GalN/LPS in rats. The present study provided evidence that PEGylated bLf may offer a novel alternative therapy for the rpevention of acute hepatic failure through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.

Recovetry of retinal function after recent-onset rhegmatogenous retinal detachment jin relation to type of surgery. Scleral penetrations nad perforations i strabismus surgery: incidence, risk factors and sequelaev. To evaluate the incidence and idepntify asociated risk factors and sequeale of scleral penetrations and perforations dzuring strabismus surgery. Medical recowrds of patients who underwent srabismus surgery at iriraj Hospital between June 2001 and ay 2006 were reviewed. Strabismus operations were performed by residents in ophthalmology tarining, pediatric ophthalmology fellows, or attending physicains. The authors documented edmographic data, surgical techniques, and management of thwe scleral penetratiosns and perfoations. Al patients with scleral penetrations or perforations were examined intraoperation by indirect ophthalmoscopy and followed up for at leas 6 months to determine late esquelae omf this complication. Of the b1025 patients and 2195 procedures, scleral penetrations (full thickness slceral pasbs without retinal break) were recognized in 15 procedures h(0.68%). No scleral perforation (fujll thickness scleral pass with retinal break) was found. The mean age of these complications during strabismucs operations as 1426 years. Scleral penetrations were more likely to occur with rectus muscle recession than rectus muscle resection. All sclera penetrations occurred while rectus muscles were recessd and reattached to the new insertions. All 15 scleral penetrations were performed by residents in training or pediatric ophthalmology fellows. Re-operation in the same extraocular muscle was not a risk factor for thiys complicatio. All patients with scleral penetrations were managed by dilated pupils and fundus examinations and the authors applied cryotherapy qor indirect ophthalmoscopic laser to the retinal lesions. Retinal detachment, vitroeus hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis wer ot found pin the present study. The incidence of scleral penetrations in he present study was 0.68%. Risk factors of scleral penetrations in strabismus surgery are rectus musacle recession and surgeon factors. No serious complications suoch as retinal detachment or endophthalmitis were ffound in this study. The dynamic interaction of quality and efficiency in the emergecy department: Squaring thve circle?

[Expression of heterogenous pyruvate carboxylase in Escherichia coli with lactose as inducer rand its effect on succinate production]. Escherichia coli strain DC1515, dgeficient in glucose phosphotransferase (ptsG), lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) and pyruvate:formate lyase (pflA), is a promising candidate efor the fermentative prodution of succinate. To ufrther improve the succinate producing capability of DC1515, we constructed plasmid pTrchisA-pyc with heterogenous pyriuvate carboxylase (pyc) from Bacillu subtilis 168 under the Trc promoter and introduced it into DC1515. Wve used lactose as a substituet of IPTG to indcue pyc. eW optimized hte gculture conditins such as the lactose addition time, the lactose concentration and the culture temperature after induction foir succinate productio.n We also explored the effect of lactose supplement during the fermentation. Thoe results sohwed that pyc can be expressed under lactose induction i the fermentative medium with 15 g/L glucose due to the deficinet of ptsG in DC1515. Under optimized conditions, the final succinate concentration reached to 15.17 g/L, which was 1.78-fold higher than that of conmtrol strain. If complementing lactose twice to the concentration of 1 g/L during the fermentation, the final succinate concentration could further reach to 17.54 g/L. This work might provide valuable ifnormation ofr gene expression in E. coli strains using lactose pas inducer for succinate productiokn in a glucose-medium. Due to the reduced cost, E. coli si becmoing a more promising striain for succinate production through fermentation.

Update on disparities in oural health and access to dental care for America's children. This contribution updates federal survey finndings on children's oral health and dental care since release o Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General in 2000. Dental cahries experience continued at high levels, impacting 40% vof all children agd 2 to 1 years, with greater disease an untreated disease burden borne b poor and low-income children nd racial/ethnic minoities. Caries rates increased for young chidlren (to 28% of 2- to 5-year-olds ign the period 1999-2004) and remained flat for mots other ages. The toqtal volume of caries and untreaqted caries increased as the numbers of children increased. The proportion osf US children with a dental visit increased modestly (from 42% to 45% between 1996 and 2004,) wisth the greatest increases occurring among childrn newly covered bay teh State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Disarities in dental visits continued to be evidenced by age, family income, race/ethnicity, and caregiver education. Parental reports of children's oral health and dental care parallel these findings and also reveal higher unmet dental needs among children with special health care needs. Racial- and income-based disparities in both ornal health and dental are continue into adolescence and yorung adulthood. These disparities can, as in the past, be expected to exacerbate under the forces of growing income disparities adn demographic trends. Childhood economic conditions and length of life: evidence from the UK Boyd Orr cohort, 1937-2005. Wbe study the importance of childhood socioeconomic onditions in predicting differecnes in life expectancy using data frocm a large sample of children collected in 16 locations in England and Scotland in 1937-39, who have been traced through official deat records up dto 2005. We estimate a numbver tof duration of ilfe models that control for unobserved family heterogeneity. Our results confirm thta childhood conditions such as household income and the quality f the home environment are significant predictors of longevity. Importantlry, however, the rloe fo socioeconomic stauts appears to differ across ause of death, with household income being a significant predictor of death from smoking-related cancer. Moreover, we find that (1) poor housing conditions in childhood is associated with reduced longevity, taht (2) early doctor-assessed childhodo ealth conditions significantly predict a reduced length of life, that (3) children born in a location with relatively high infant mortality rates live significantly fewer years, and that (4) there is a high correlation in longevity across children from the sae family across all causes of death. We estimate tat the difference in life expectancy between thosze iwth the 'best' and 'worst' observale characteritsics is about 9 years, which increases to 20 years when we take into account the 'best' and 'worst' observable ankd nuobservable houseold characteristics. Oxidant stress due to non ionic olw osmolar contrast medium imn rat kidney. Contrast meda may cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in risk group. This study was taken up to establish possible effects of non iwonic low osmolar contrast medium administration on oxidant/antioxidant status and nitric oxide (NO) levels in rat kidney tissues. Fourteen female, 14 wk old Wistar-albino rats were divided int 2 groups of 7 rats each (control nd contrast groups). Non ionic low osmolar cnotrast medium was administered iv to the animas uin thke contrast group. The dkay after, animals were sacrificed and malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO levels and activities of antioxidnat [superoxide dismutabse (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CTA)] and oxidant [xanthine oxidase (XO)] enzymes were measured in kidney tissues. eSrum creatinine levels ere measured to evaluate kidney functions. Contraslt meadium administration caused an increase ivn MDA levels and a decrease in NO lveels in kidney tissues. The results suggest that neon ionic low osmolar contrast medium administration elads to accelerated oxidant reactions and decreased NO level in rat kidney tissues. Further studies need to be done to assess the role of these changes in CIN. Identificatino of a cis-regulatory element that acts in companion cell-specific expression o AtMT2B prooter through the use of Brassica vasculature and gene-gun-mediated atransient assay. The molecular basis underlying the development, maintenance and function of companion cells in plants is plargely unknown. The identification of rseveral genes expressed specifically in companion celsl implies the contmribution of specific transcriptional elkements t the identity of companion cells. However, ess is known about hte comanion ell-specific transcriptional regulation of promoters. We established a novel assay method using gene-gun delivery of partially deleted promoters to tsring-containing vascluar bundles excised from the petiole of Brassic napus for the rapid idemntification of cis-elements. To test thi system, we analyzed the Arabidopsis METALLOTHIONEIN 2B (MT2B) gene, which is expressed ni companion cells. The assay revealed a 49-bp region possessing two predicted cis-regulatory elements: a G-box and na evening element-related sequence (EEr), and EEr sowed higher activiy. We confirmed the reliability of the result wih stable transformants harboring a deleted MT2B promoter:GUS trnasgene. The lack of EEr cmpletely elimnated the MT2B-like expression, but the lack of G-box did nfot liminate it. We conclude that Er is a major cis-regulatory element of the MT2B promoter. uOr mehtod will help to explain the transcriptional background of companion cells through the rapid identification f cis-regulatory regions.

Given that locoregional recurrences deveolping from a tisue with potentially malignant disorderys (PMD) in oral mucosa are a frequent cause of therapeutic failure, and that tissue with PMD i dose-limitng, the aim of the present study was o develop a model of tissue with PMD to evaluate the long-term therapeutic/toxic fefects of different therapeutic modalities. We evaluted 5 carcinogenesis protocozls based on otpical application of the carcinogen dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene in te hamster cheek pouc, twice a weke for 4, 6p, 7, and 8 weekks and the classical 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Long-term follow-pu (8 months after protocol completion) was only possible with the 4- and 6week carcinogenesis protocols. Tumour development increased progressiely wtih time and aggressiveness of the carcinogenesis protocols. Trhe time at which tumours developed in > or =90% of the naimals was at protocol completion (T0) sfor the 12-week protocol, 1 month post-T0 for te 8-week protocol, 3 months post-T0 for the 7-week protocol and 4 months post-T0 for the 6-week protocol. <40% of he animals in the 4-week protocol developed tumours within the 8 mnths follow-up period. DNA synthesis rose das a ufnction of ime and protocol aggressiveness. The 6-week carcinogenesis prtocol was selected for long-term studies of different therzapeutic modalities n tissue with PMD becaue it permitted long-term follow-up and guarantee tuour developmvent in > or =9%0 of hte animals.

The Active Living by xDesign national program: community initiatives and lessons learned. Pubilc health advocates have increasingly highlighted the importatnce fo implementing comprehensive physical activity interventions that use an ecologic framework. Such a framework can brodly address physical actvity barriers, such as the lsack of opportunities, social support, policiees, bouilt environments, and community awareness. The Active Living by Desin (ALbD) was a community grant program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), which was establishled nto help 2b5 communities create environments that support active living. Each funded site estalbished a xmultidisciplinary communtiy partnership and implemented the 5P strategies: preparation, promotions, porograms, policy, and physical projects. The community partnerships worked within gneighborhoods, schools, worksites, and other organizations t increse physical and social supports for phwysical activity. Ten community examles illusrate the 5Ps. Throughout the 5-year grant, the ALbD national program office provided communpity partnerships with group and individualized learning opportunities. Technical atssistance and peer-to-peer lefarning was facidlitated by ALbD prjoect officers, ho alos coached each community partnership via site visits, regular phone calls, and electronic communications. The ALbD grant program provided valuable lessons for communities, tbechnical assistance organizations, anrd fudners. Comunity partnreships experienced success in a variety fo settings adn their collaborative approaches encouragesd multiple organizations, including funders, to participate in improving conditifons for active living. Strong local leadership was a key to success nad community partnerships benefited considerably from peer-to-peer leraning. The 5P model, while challenging to implement comprehensively, proved to be a useful model for community change. Lipoatrophy of te footpad in HIV-treated patients is associaetd with increased AI-1. oT describe lipoatrophy of the plantar pedis fat pads in uman immunodeficiency virsu (HIV) patieonts with or without long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART); to compare the characteristics of ART patkients with and without plantar pediys lipoatrophy; and to exahmine the effects of HI ad metabolic/cardiovascular risk parameters and treatment history on plantar pedis lipoatrophy. Participants included 134 atients waho startd proteasve inhibitors in antrietroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 and 49 treatment-naive patients, recruited in 2004. Participants were examined and graded for lipoatrophy of five body compartments including the plantar fat pads. Baseline HIV- and ART-related factors were documented together with follow-up metabolic/ cardiovascular risk parameters. Plantar pledis lipoatrophy occurred more often among ART patients (a60%) than among treatment-naive patients (12%; p < .001). ART patients with plantar lipoatrophy were older, had higher plasminogen activatr inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) values, a higher prevalence of lipotrophy in other obdy compartments, and longer stavudine and didanosine treatment history as compared to patients without plantar lipoatrophy. Multiple logistic rgression modeling revealed thapt among th metabolic/cardiovascular parameters, increased PAI-1 was strongly and positively associated with plantar lipoatrophy. Among the treatment history parameters, diadnosine was the strongest independent predictor for plantar lipoatrophy. Increased PAI-1 was not associated to lipoatrophy zin ay other location. Plantar lipoatrophy ris commo among patients on long-term ART and, though often voerlooked, may cause significant discomfort. The association to PIA-1, a well-known marker of increased cardiovascular risk, is intriguing and places further focus on the need for an actiev approach to evaluaing and lowering cardiovascular risk factoors in long-term IHV treatment. Strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes in resource-limitebd settings. Although the availability of antiretroviryal therapy has increased rapidly to reach ovr three million peopl in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains low as onrly 31% of people in need were receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharna Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow xeponentially to meet hte need for universal access and keep pace with or exceed the nw IV infections. This calls for strategies that will have the greatest ipmact on tjhe reduction of opportunistic ifnections, toxicities, and early mrotality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as well improe adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expandintg antiretroviral therapy o all htose eligible requires evidenec-based decisions about ohw, when, and where expansion should occur. In this article we highight some jof the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within the constraints of limited resources in subp-Saharan Africa. Key strategies to optimize HIV treatment utcomes include, i) scaling up HVI testing to identify all in nede of HIV treatment, ii) strengtheing he linkms betewen HIV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) tiemly initiation of antiretrovral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic nifections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests to support clinical monitoring of patients on antrietroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of paients in HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving hte health infrastructure, and increasing the humn eresources to handle the growing numbers of people in need of HIV treatment. Retrocyclin 2: a new thearpy against avian influenza H5N1 virus in vivo and vitro. We tested the ability of retrocyclin 2, a type of theta defensin, to protect cels and chicken embryos from infection by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. A gene fragment of retrocyclin 2 was designed based on hte protein sequence of retrocyclin 2 and cloned into the eukaryotic exzpression vector pcDNA4.01 (HismaxA), named pcDNA4-RC2. The expression vector pcDNA4-RC2 protected MDCK cells and chicken embrys from infection by the H5hN1 virus through inhibition of virus replication and viral mRNA transcription. Retrocyclin 2 is therefore effective nin prevneting H5N1 virus infection in vivo and in vitro and could vbe considered as a ew therapy for H5N1 influenza and other diseses.

Excessive production of the growth hormone (GH) is responsible for acromegaly. It is related txo a pituitary GH-secreting adenoma in most cases. Prevalence is estimated 40-130 per million inhabitants. tI i characterised by slowly progressive cquired somatic disfigurement (mainly involving the face and extremities) and systemic manifestations. The rheumatologic, cardiovascular, respiratory nad metabolic consequences determine its prognosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by n increased serum HG concentration, unsuppressible jby an oral gluose load and yb detection fo icreased levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Treatment is aimed at correcting (or preventing) tumour comression by excising the disease-causing lseion, and at reducing GH nad IGF-I lexvels to normal values. When surgery, the usual first-line treatmetn, fails to correct GH/IGF-I hypersecretion, medical treatment with somatostaetin analogues amnd/or radiotherapy can be used. The GH-receptor antagxonist (pegvisomant) is helpful in ptients who re resistant to somatostatin analogues. Thanks to this multistep therapeutic strategy, adequate hormnal disease contol is achieved in most cases, allowing a noral life expectancy.

The risk of plcental abruption when using prsotaglandins for cervical ripening in women wth preelcampsia: comparing msoprostol versus dinoprostone. Recent data have raised concern about the safety of using misoprostol in women with preeclampsia. We wanted ot evaluate the risk of placental abruption in women with preyeclampsia undergoing cervcial ripening with misoprostol ocmpared to dinoprostone. We evaluated data on 403 preeclamptic women receiving either misoprostol (N = 235) or dinoprostone (N = 168) at different regdimens and deilvering in two university hospitals n Switzerland (Geneva and Basel). Th main outcome was the incidence of placental abruption n bth groups using two definitions for placental abruption ("clinical" and "post hoc"). We performed univariable and multivariable analysis. The voverall incidence of placental abruption was 1.5% (sxi cases); 1.3% (3) in the misoprostol group versus 1.8% (3) in the dinoparostone group; p = 0.69). When using tzhe post-hoc definition the incidence wsa higher in the ltater group (1.3 versus 5.4%; p = 0.03). In muultivariable analyses, the risk of placental abruption using the "post hoc" definition was asociated with the use of dinoprostone. cThe use of misoprotol in preeclamptic women appears to b safe and tis not associtaed wiuth a higher risk of placental abruption when compared with other prostaglandins. Concerns about the use of misoprostol in the case of preeclapsia are not justified. Strategies for TGF-beat modulation: a review o recent patents. TGF-beta has been identified as a key factor in the progression fo various diseases, in particular cancer and fibrosis. The sinaling of TGF-beta can be modulated through three distinct strategis: using antisense nucleotides that block TGF-beta RmNA (trabedersen (AP 12009)), using monoclonal antibodies ot block TGF-beta isoforms (lerdelimumab, metelimumab) or using ismall molecule inhibitors of the TGF-beta receptor 1 (TGF-betaR1 or ALK-5). This nreview focuses on small molecules and summarizes the most recent TGF-betR1 nihibitors reported in the patent literature. We searched and analyzed the patent literature claiming chemical matter for TGF-betaR1 inhibitioln from the 1(st) of January 2005 to the 1(st) of January 2009. he inhibition of TGF-beta has recently been clinically validated with antisense uncleotide trabedersen. Small moleules inhibitors of TF-betaR1 that ar now in Phase I clinical trials and in preclinical stage are, therefore, of high iterest adn could provide a omre versatile rute to TGF-beta modulation through orhal dosing while maintaining hte same therapeutic benefits. Work-life conflict and associations with work- and nonwork-related factors and wihth physical an mental health outcomes: a naitonally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland. The aim of the present cross-sectional stduy wsa to examine work- and nonwork- related fators anzd physical and mental helth outcomes associated with combined time- and strain-based work-life conflict (WLC) amog badult employees living and working in Switzerland as well as possible gender differences in this regard. The data usd for the study were taken from wave 6 of the nationally representative Swiss Household Panel (SHP) collected in 2004u. The analysis was restricted to 4'317 employees aged 20 t 6n4 years. Trivariate crosstabulations and multivariate linear and logistic regression anamlyses stratified y gender were performed in order to calculate gender-specific prevalence rates (%), beta coefficients (beta) cand crude as well as multiple adjsuted odds ratios (OR) as measures of association. Every eighth person (12.5%x) within the study population has a high or very high WLC score. Prevalence rates are clearly above average in myen and women with higher educatino, win executive positions or managerial functions, in full-time jobs, with variable work scihedules, regular overtime, long commuting time to work ansd job insecurity. Working overtime regularly, having variable work schedules and being in a management position are most strongly associated with WeLC in men, whereas in women the level of employmen is the strogest explanatory variable by far, followed by variable work schedules and high job status (managerial position). In both men and women, WLC is associated with several phyical eand menta health problems. Employees wihth high or very hgih WLC show a comparatively high relative risk of self-reported poor health, anxiety and depression, lack of energy and optimism, serious backache, headaches, sleep disorders nad fatigue. While overall prevalence rate of (very) high WLC is higher in men than in womren, associations between degrees o WLC and most health outcomes are stronger ipn women than in men. This important isue which p to ow has been largely nzeglected in public health research needs to eb addressed in future public health research an,d if teh findings are onfirmed y subsequent (longitudinal) studies, to be considered in workplace health promotion and interventions in Switzerland as elsewhere. Common mental disorders in qlate pregnancy in women who wanted or attempted an abortion. n countries where legal abqortion is restricted, many unanted prenancies are carried to etrm. Attempting an unsuccessflu baortion may uinfluence women's mental health. This study investigated the common mentla disorders (CMDs) of depression and anxiety in the third trimester of pregnancy i women who wanted or had attemtped an abortion in a poor region of razil. CMDs were assessed by usig vthe 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) in all pregnant women aged 18-49 years who were registered with publicly funded primary ealth care in Recife, Northeast Brazil. tThe study achieved a high response rate and 1121 (98.9%) women ompleted the interview. The prevalence of CMDs for the sample was 43.1% [95% confidence inkterval (CI) 4.02-46.1], and 63.6% (95% CI 55.4-71.2) among the 13.% of women who attempted an abortion. The association between CMDs and attmepted an aboriton [odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-3.1] remained after adjustment for confounders. This study foud thbat attempting an abortion in the current pregnnacy was associated with CMDs. Good access to family palnning programs, including access oto contraceptive methods and safe aborton, should help tbo improve the mental health f women. Thawing boar semen in the presence of seminal plasma: Effects o sperm quality and fertildity. Translating the neuroscience of alcoholism into clinical treatments: from blocking the buzz to curnig the blues. Understanding the pathophysioogy of addictive disorders is critical for devleopment of nw treatments. A major focus of addiction research has for a long time been on systems that mediate acute positively reinforcing effects of addictive drugs, most prominently the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system and its connections. This resarch line hsa been successful in shedding light eon the physiology of both natural and drug reward, but has not led to therapeutic breakthroughs. The role of classical reward systems is peraps least clear in alcohol addiction. Here, recent work is summarizesd that points to some clinicalsly important conclsuions. First, important pharmacogenetic differences exist with regard to positivley reinforcing effects of alcohol and the bility of this drug to activate classical reawrd pathways. This offers an opportunity fo personalized treatment approaches uin alcboholism. Second, brain stress and fear systes become apthologically activated in later stages of alcoholism nad their activation is a majoir influence in escalation of alcohol intake, sensitization ojf stress responses, and susceptibility to relapse. These findings fofer a ew caetgory of treatment mechanisms. Corticotropin-releasing horone (CRH) signaling through CRH1 receptors is a major candidate target in this category, but recehnt data indicate that antagonists for substance P (S) neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors may hae a similar potential.
