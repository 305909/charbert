A nationwide survey of oncologists regarding treatment-related infertility and fertility preservation in female cancer patients. To survey oncologists regarding their knowledge and practice patterns concerning fertility preservation for female cancer patients. An online survey was sent to oncologists at cancer centers ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Oncologists who treat women of reproductive age at academic medical centers. None. None. Counseling and referral practices of oncologists regarding fertility risks among young women with cancer. Most (95%) of the 249 responding oncologists routinely discuss a treatment's impact on fertility; 1,701 surveys were sent. Although 82% have referred patients to reproductive endocrinologists, more than half rarely refer. When planning treatment, 30% rarely consider a woman's desire for fertility. Gynecologic oncologists were more likely to routinely consider fertility compared with other oncologists (93% vs. 60%). Gynecologic oncologists also were more likely to provide a less effective regimen to better preserve fertility (61% vs. 37%). Most oncologists (86%) would be willing to sacrifice less than a 5% reduction in disease-free survival if a regimen offered better fertility outcomes; 36% felt patients would be willing to sacrifice >5%. Although most oncologists at academic medical centers discuss the risk of infertility with female patients, referrals to reproductive endocrinologists are rare. Gynecologic oncologists may be more likely than others to consider modifying treatment to preserve fertility. According to oncologists, patients may be willing to sacrifice more in survival than they would.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of rapid yeast detection kits. To determine the cost effectiveness of the utilization of over-the-counter yeast infection detection kits in the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis. A cost-benefit analysis based on a group of 70 adult women from a previous prospective study who presented with vaginitis symptoms. By constructing two decision trees, one in which the kits are an option to the women and one in which they are not, we predict the cost for diagnosing vaginal candidiasis in this group of women. For a group of 70 women presenting with vaginitis symptoms, the total cost of diagnosing their infections without the use of kits is predicted to be 7,051.10 dollars. For the same 70 women, the total of cost of diagnosing their infections with the use of kits is predicted to be 5,941.02 dollars. We conclude that the use of yeast infection detection kits could reduce the cost of diagnosis by 16%. The introduction of kits could save patients the time, money, and other resources involved in visiting a physician to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover, the sensitivity of yeast kits is superior to the traditional wet mount (77% vs. 52%), so there may be a role for the kits in the physician's office as well.

Effects of aging and every-other-day feeding on the levels of oxygen radicals in rat brain slices. Caloric and food restriction attenuate oxidative stress. The effect of aging and every-other-day (EOD) feeding on oxygen radical-dependent chemiluminescent intensity was examined in ex vivo brain slices from Fischer rats during oxygenation and hypoxia-reoxygenation with lucigenin, a chemilumigenic probe used for detecting superoxide anion radicals. The chemiluminescent intensity increased during reoxygenation after hypoxic treatment, and the chemiluminescence in the brain slices at the baseline and during reoxygenation increased with age. However, no difference was observed in the superoxide-dependent chemiluminescence between brain slices prepared from the aged rats fed EOD and those fed ad libitum. Our results indicated that age-dependent increases in superoxide production might be associated with enhanced oxidative stress in aged Fischer rat brains. However, the present study newly indicated that decreased superoxide production might not be a major causal factor in caloric and food restriction attenuated oxidative stress.

Influence of a vaccination schedule on viral load rebound and immune responses in successfully treated HIV-infected patients. Vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected patients. Transient increases of viral load (VL) and risk of developing resistance to HAART have been described. In addition, VL rebounds could increase HIV-specific immune responses. Twenty-six successfully treated HIV-infected adults were randomized to receive a vaccination schedule or placebo during 12 months. Afterward, HAART was discontinued. Influences of vaccination over VL, genotypic mutations, different T cell subsets, and HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated. Patients did not present any secondary effect. No differences in incidence of detectable VL determinations were detected between groups [relative risk 0.54 (95% CI 0.23-1.26)]. No relevant resistance mutations were detected. The vaccinated group showed a significant drop in CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.046) associated with increases in activated T cells. HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses increased more in the vaccinated group during the vaccination period. Viral rebound dynamics after interrupting HAART were similar in both groups. A vaccination schedule in successfully treated HIV patients was safe, was not associated with an increase in detectable VL, and did not increase the risk of developing resistance mutations. However, it induced an increase in T cell activation and a drop in CD4(+) T cells, although these changes did not influence the VL rebound dynamics after HAART interruption.

A negative regulatory pathway of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocyte: new function of RIP140 in the cytoplasm via AS160. Receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140), a nuclear receptor corepressor, is important for lipid and glucose metabolism. In adipocytes, RIP140 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C epsilon (PKCvarepsilon), followed by arginine methylation, and exported to the cytoplasm. This study demonstrates for the first time a cytoplasmic function for RIP140: to counteract insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) membrane partitioning and glucose uptake in adipocytes. Cytoplasmic RIP140 interacts with the Akt substrate AS160, thereby impeding AS160 phosphorylation by Akt; this in turn reduces GLUT4 trafficking. This signal transduction pathway can be recapitulated in the epididymal adipocytes of diet-induced obese mice: nuclear PKCvarepsilon is activated, cytoplasmic RIP140 increases, and GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake are reduced. The data reveal a new, cytoplasmic function for RIP140 as a negative regulator of GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake, and shed insight into the regulation of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by a nuclear-initiated counteracting mechanism.

Design and development of nanovehicle-based delivery systems for preventive or therapeutic supplementation with flavonoids. To date more than 4000 compounds are recognized to belong to the class of flavonoids. These natural phenolic drugs are poorly soluble in water and are rapidly degraded and metabolized in the human body, but nevertheless are very promising for their potential contribution to the prevention and therapy of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In recent years a number of flavanols (e.g. catechins), flavonols (e.g. quercetin, myricetin) and isoflavones (e.g. genistein, daidzein) have been confirmed to possess strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-aging activities. Incorporation into lipidic or polymer-based nanoparticles appears to markedly help the oral delivery of flavonoids, as these particles can protect the drug from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and, by virtue of their unique absorption mechanism through the lymphatic system, also from first-pass metabolism in the liver. In addition, both oral and parenteral administration of flavonoids exploits a pharmacologic delivery route that guarantees sustained release of the active principle at the desired site of action. A comprehensive review of studies currently available on the in vitro and in vivo experimental administration of flavonoids by means of nanovectors may be of use as a foundation for the development of advanced delivery systems for these powerful compounds, in view of their adoption in primary and secondary disease prevention.

Interacting coexistence mechanisms in annual plant communities: Frequency-dependent predation and the storage effect. We study frequency-dependent seed predation (FDP) in a model of competing annual plant species in a variable environment. The combination of a variable environment and competition leads to the storage-effect coexistence mechanism (SE), which is a leading hypothesis for coexistence of desert annual plants. However, seed predation in such systems demands attention to coexistence mechanisms associated with predation. FDP is one such mechanism, which promotes coexistence by shifting predation to more abundant plant species, facilitating the recovery of species perturbed to low density. When present together, FDP and SE interact, undermining each other's effects. Predation weakens competition, and therefore weakens mechanisms associated with competition: here SE. However, the direct effect of FDP in promoting coexistence can compensate or more than compensate for this weakening of SE. On the other hand, the environmental variation necessary for SE weakens FDP. With high survival of dormant seeds, SE can be strong enough to compensate, or overcompensate, for the decline in FDP, provided predation is not too strong. Although FDP and SE may simultaneously contribute to coexistence, their combined effect is less than the sum of their separate effects, and is often less than the effect of the stronger mechanism when present alone.

Incarcerated herniation of the cervical spinal cord after laminectomy for an ossification of the yellow ligament. A 74-year-old man showed a spastic gait and myelopathy in both the hands. Computed tomography revealed an OPLL on C3 and C4, bony spurs on the dorsal side of C4-C6, and an OYL on C3 and C4. We scheduled a two-stage decompression for both the OPLL and OYL. First, we performed laminectomy on the C3-C6 segments and resected the OYL. We did not observe any dural tear or CSF leakage in the dura. The patient's neurological symptoms improved. After the laminectomy, his myelopathy recurred. Postoperative MRI showed a spinal cord herniation. We had the C3/4 anterior cervical disectomy and fusion as we planned. In addition, we performed a surgery to repair the damaged dura mater at the site of spinal cord herniation at the same second surgery. The integrity of the arachnoid membrane was preserved. The patient's myelopathy gradually improved. There have been no reports on postoperative neurological deterioration caused by spinal cord herniation associated with a dural defect at the laminectomy site, without dural tear in the surgery after the resection of a posteriorly located cervical OYL. The possibility of a dural defect in OYL cases should be considered when planning a laminectomy for the resection of the OYL.

Ca2+ dependence of the binomial parameters p and n at the mouse neuromuscular junction. The Ca(2+) dependence of synaptic quantal release is generally thought to be restricted to probability of vesicular release. However, some studies have suggested that the number of release sites (n) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is also Ca(2+) dependent. In this study, we recorded endplate currents over a wide range of extracellular Ca(2+) concentrations and found the expected Ca(2+) dependency of release. A graphical technique was used to estimate p (probability of release) and n using standard binomial assumptions. The results suggested n was Ca(2+) dependent. The data were simulated using compound binomial statistics with variable n (Ca(2+) dependent) or fixed n (Ca(2+) independent). With fixed n, successful simulation of increasing Ca(2+) required that p increase abruptly at some sites from very low to high values. Successful simulation with variable n required the introduction of previously silent release sites (p = 0) with high values of p. Thus the success of both simulations required abrupt, large increases of p at a subset of release sites with initially low or zero p. Estimates of the time course of release obtained by deconvolving evoked endplate currents with average miniature endplate currents decreased slightly as Ca(2+) increased, thus arguing against sequential release of multiple quanta at higher Ca(2+) levels. Our results suggest that the apparent Ca(2+) dependence of n at the NMJ can be explained by an underlying Ca(2+) dependence of a spatially variable p such that p increases abruptly at a subset of sites as Ca(2+) is increased.

Applicability of common reference intervals for serum creatinine concentrations to the Croatian population. In accordance with an ongoing activity for worldwide harmonization based on traceability in laboratory methods, the goal of this study was to validate the applicability of recommended "common" reference intervals for serum creatinine concentrations using a specific enzymatic method to the Croatian population. The reference group consisted of 240 healthy subjects (120 males and 120 females), between 18 and 74 years of age (median 57 years), who were selected in accordance with the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) recommendations. Creatinine in serum was measured using the creatinine enzymatic assay (Olympus OSR61204) that was standardized to the isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 967. In addition, creatinine was measured using a kinetic Jaffe method (Olympus OSR6178) standardized to NIST SRM 909b level 2 standard. Method comparison between enzymatic creatinine (x) and the Jaffe kinetic method (y) gave the following P/B equation for the entire group (n=240): y=1.00x+17.00; r=0.968. Reference intervals for serum creatinine (central 95th percentiles) obtained using the enzymatic creatinine method ranged from 54 to 107 micromol/L for males and from 50 to 93 micromol/L for females. The IFCC recommended common reference intervals for global applications are 64-104 micromol/L and 49-90 micromol/L for males and females, respectively. Comparability of obtained results confirmed the applicability of recently recommended "common" reference intervals to the Croatian population for all laboratories measuring serum creatinine concentrations using enzymatic methods traceable to the IDMS method and NIST SRM 967.

Sharp force injuries in "clinical" forensic medicine. In general, the forensic evaluation of sharp force injuries in living and dead individuals follows the same morphologic principles. Still, there are some special features of sharp force injuries in the clinical context, which have to be considered as examination findings on the living are interpreted to differentiate between accidental origin, self-infliction or homicidal assault. These include the frequency and localization of defence injuries, injuries of the perpetrator, and artificial injuries, especially those inflicted for the purpose of insurance fraud. Characteristics and differential diagnoses of "clinical" sharp force injuries are surveyed in this article.

The impact of chronic inflammation on the growing skeleton: lessons from interleukin-6 transgenic mice. Chronic inflammatory diseases in children are associated with impairment of linear growth and bone mineral accrual. In addition to poor nutrition, reduced mobility and glucocorticoid treatment, several observations in patients suggest that inflammation itself may have a direct detrimental effect on the growing skeletal system. Among the various inflammatory cytokines produced during the inflammatory response, data in animals suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6) may mediate the effects of inflammation on the developing skeleton. Mice overexpressing IL-6 during the prepubertal stage show stunted growth, abnormalities of the insulin-like growth factor I system, defective growth plates, delayed development of ossification centres, uncoupling of osteoblast and osteoclast activity and defective ossification. These changes appear to mirror the features observed in children with chronic inflammatory diseases. The tissue, cellular and molecular abnormalities reviewed provide a rationale for therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting the detrimental effects of inflammation on the developing skeletal system.

[Emergency and elective cesarean section and selected elements of immunological system of full-term neonates]. To define a relationship between emergency and elective indications for cesarean section and quantitative changes of percentage and quantity of T and B lymphocytes and their subpopulations in healthy full-term neonates. The study included 43 healthy neonates born in the years 1998 - 2003 in the Department of Perinatology and Gynecology of Silesian Medical University in Zabrze, Taking into account operative delivery, a group of 43 full-term neonates born by cesarean section were examined, including 25 neonates with elective indications [Ibe] and 18 with emergency indications (Ibn). Immunological studies included evaluation of the percentage of T and B lymphocytes and of their subpopulations in umbilical blood. Our study applied a method of umbilical blood sampling with the following red blood cells lysis. The study showed that mean number of CD3+, CD23+, CD25+ lymphocytes and mean percentage and number of CD8+ lymphocytes in full-term neonates born by elective Cesarean was statistically significantly lower than in neonates born by emergency Cesarean section. No statistically significant differences were found in mean values of other parameters among the study groups. Cesarean section performed in a mother with emergency indications can favor an increase of mean quantity of T lymphocytes, cytotoxic - suppressor T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, B CD23 lymphocytes in full-term neonates.

Electrocatalytic activity of salicylic acid on the platinum nanoparticles modified electrode by electrochemical deposition. Platinum nanoparticles (PNP) were deposited on the Pt disk electrode by electrochemical deposition, it was found that salicylic acid (SA) had good electrocatalytic oxidation response at the prepared Pt nanoparticles modified Pt disk electrode (PNP/Pt). Then the modified electrode was used to detect SA in weak alkali condition, it was found that the response current was 9.2 times that of bare Pt disk electrode, and the linear range of detection was 2.0x10(-5) to 5.0x10(-4)M. After that, the electrode was adopted to detect the SA in Zuguangsan, one kind of Chinese medicine, the results showed that the PNP/Pt electrode has low detection limit, high repeatability and stability as SA sensor, could be applied in the detection of SA reliably.

Negative correlation between neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein concentration and adiponectinemia in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease obese adolescents submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary therapy. The complexity pathogenesis in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involves an interplay between adipokines and neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance, including the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) system. The first aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term interdisciplinary intervention on NAFLD in obese adolescents, and the second objective was to establish the relationship between NPY/AgRP ratio and adiponectinemia. Fifty-five postpuberty obese adolescents were submitted to interdisciplinary intervention. The group was divided between subjects with and without NAFLD (n = 19 and 36, respectively). Blood samples were collected to measure glycemia, hepatic transaminases, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and sensitivity. Adiponectin, NPY, and AgRP concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Food intake was measured using 3-day diet records. It was observed at baseline that important clinical parameters including body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hepatic transaminases were more altered in NAFLD patients. After the intervention, these parameters, total energy, and macronutrient intake were reduced significantly in both groups. The most important finding was the positive correlation between AgRP and visceral fat in all patients and the negative correlation between NPY/AgRP and adiponectinemia only in NAFLD obese adolescents. The NAFLD patients presented more altered clinical parameters than the non-NAFLD subjects, including the negative correlation between adiponectinemia and NPY/AgRP. These results suggested that NAFLD obese adolescents presented an inflammatory profile that can influence the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance, suggesting an additional impairment in the weight loss therapy.

Terpenoid content of Valeriana wallichii extracts and antidepressant-like response profiles. Three extracts of Valeriana wallichii DC (Valerianaceae) rhizome and fluoxetine were studied for antidepressant-like activity in two behavioral models, namely the forced swim test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). Fluoxetine as well as methanolic and aqueous extracts of V. wallichii induced monophasic dose-related decrements in immobility times in both tests. However, the aqueous-ethanolic fraction induced a biphasic dose-response profile since it produced a graded effect up to 200 mg/kg but the highest dose (250 mg/kg) was inactive in the FST. This extract also exhibited significantly reduced activity at 200 mg/kg compared to lower doses in the TST. The highest doses of aqueous-ethanolic extract also reduced locomotor activity which will have led to a negative functional interaction with antidepressant-like effects. Qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed that the aqueous-ethanolic extract of V. wallichii was the only separated rhizome fraction containing terpenoids. Furthermore, since the methanolic and aqueous extracts were active in the tests, it is suggested that the antidepressant-like action of this herbal plant is not contingent upon its terpenoid constituents.

General surgery contributes to the financial health of rural hospitals and communities. Rural hospitals and communities often profit from the ability to provide surgical services. There can also be substantial financial costs for individuals, hospitals, and communities associated with not having access to surgical care in rural areas. Despite these advantages, limitations that include a shortage of rural general surgeons and other surgical staff and financial constraints prevent some rural institutions from offering surgical services. Few concrete data are available on this subject, and more research is needed to confirm anecdotal reports regarding the positive economic impact derived from general surgical services. It is especially important to examine and quantify the direct and indirect financial contribution that a general surgeon makes to a rural hospital and community.

Conscious worst case definition for risk assessment, part I: a knowledge mapping approach for defining most critical risk factors in integrative risk management of chemicals and nanomaterials. This paper helps bridge the gap between scientists and other stakeholders in the areas of human and environmental risk management of chemicals and engineered nanomaterials. This connection is needed due to the evolution of stakeholder awareness and scientific progress related to human and environmental health which involves complex methodological demands on risk management. At the same time, the available scientific knowledge is also becoming more scattered across multiple scientific disciplines. Hence, the understanding of potentially risky situations is increasingly multifaceted, which again challenges risk assessors in terms of giving the 'right' relative priority to the multitude of contributing risk factors. A critical issue is therefore to develop procedures that can identify and evaluate worst case risk conditions which may be input to risk level predictions. Therefore, this paper suggests a conceptual modelling procedure that is able to define appropriate worst case conditions in complex risk management. The result of the analysis is an assembly of system models, denoted the Worst Case Definition (WCD) model, to set up and evaluate the conditions of multi-dimensional risk identification and risk quantification. The model can help optimize risk assessment planning by initial screening level analyses and guiding quantitative assessment in relation to knowledge needs for better decision support concerning environmental and human health protection or risk reduction. The WCD model facilitates the evaluation of fundamental uncertainty using knowledge mapping principles and techniques in a way that can improve a complete uncertainty analysis. Ultimately, the WCD is applicable for describing risk contributing factors in relation to many different types of risk management problems since it transparently and effectively handles assumptions and definitions and allows the integration of different forms of knowledge, thereby supporting the inclusion of multifaceted risk components in cumulative risk management.

[Application of near infrared spectroscopy in quality control of excipients of traditional Chinese medicine]. To apply the near infrared spectroscopy in quality control for excipients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). A new type of transmittance and reflectance integration sphere accessory and a transmittance accessory were used to collect the spectra of processed honey and rice wine, respectively. Determination method of reducing sugar and ethanol in processed honey were established with partial least squares (PLS). The correlation coefficients (r), the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the proposed models were 0.9593, 1.00% and 1.19% for reducing sugar; 0.9529, 0.17% and 0.24% for ethanol. The proposed method is fast, non-destructive, simple and accurate, and can be applied to at-spot detection,

[Computed tomography investigation of temporomandibular joint in surgery of dento-maxillary anomalies]. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the temporomandibular joint morphology, regarding the relation between mandibular condyle and fossa, after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy in Angle class III dentomaxillary anomalies. Preserving the preoperative position of the condyle during sagittal split osteotomy is considered important to obtain skeletal and occlusal stability. Cone-beam computed tomography of 20 class III patients with mandibular prognathism were assessed before and 6 weeks after operation to evaluate changes of the condylar position. We propose a protocol for head posture and computed tomography investigation, which makes possible the comparison between cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in different moments at the same patient. There are no significant changes after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy regarding joint relations.

Plasma granzyme B as a predicting factor of coronary artery disease--clinical significance in patients with chronic renal failure. To elucidate the role of granzyme B in coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that granzyme B plays an important role in the formation of coronary artery lesions in patients with CKD. We studied 141 patients (116 men and 25 women; mean age, 64.2±9.6 years) and 16 control subjects. Diagnosis of CAD was confirmed by selective coronary angiography. CKD was defined as a sustained decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) over 3 months. We assigned patients to three groups: CAD without CKD (CAD group, n=46), CKD without CAD (CKD group, n=18), and CAD with CKD (CAD/CKD group, n=77). Plasma granzyme B was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Factors contributing to the severity of CAD were analyzed by multiple regression analysis in patients with CAD. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and granzyme B in the CAD/CKD group were significantly higher than in other groups. A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma hs-CRP and granzyme B levels. A significant negative correlation was observed between eGFR and granzyme B levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed that granzyme B and hs-CRP levels were independent predicting variables of the number of stenoses in major coronary arteries. These results indicate that granzyme B might be a novel risk factor for the formation of coronary atherosclerosis by inducing apoptosis of vascular tissues in patients with CKD.

Cellular uptake and biological activity of peptide nucleic acids conjugated with peptides with and without cell-penetrating ability. A 12-mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) directed against the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor mRNA was disulfide bridged with various peptides without and with cell-penetrating features. The cellular uptake and the antisense activity of these conjugates were assessed in parallel. Quantitation of the internalized PNA was performed by using an approach based on capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF). This approach enabled a selective assessment of the PNA moiety liberated from the conjugate in the reducing intracellular environment, thus avoiding bias of the results by surface adsorption. The biological activity of the conjugates was studied by an assay based on the downregulation of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CM). Comparable cellular uptake was found for all conjugates and for the naked PNA, irrespective of the cell-penetrating properties of the peptide components. All conjugates exhibited a comparable biological activity in the 100 nM range. The naked PNA also exhibited extensive antisense activity, which, however, proved about five times lower than that of the conjugates. The found results suggest cellular uptake and the bioactivity of PNA-peptide conjugates to be not primarily related to the cell-penetrating ability of their peptide components. Likewise from these results it can be inferred that the superior bioactivity of the PNA-peptide conjugates in comparison with that of naked PNA rely on as yet unknown factors rather than on higher membrane permeability. Several hints point to the resistance against cellular export and the aggregation propensity combined with the endocytosis rate to be candidates for such factors.

Depressive symptoms among HIV-positive pregnant women in Thailand. To examine predictors of depressive symptoms among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, pregnant women in Thailand. Correlational, cross-sectional study. Data were collected at prenatal clinics in five hospitals in Thailand from January 2004 to January 2006. One hundred twenty-seven HIV-positive pregnant women completed questionnaires in Thai on depressive symptoms, self-esteem, emotional support, physical symptoms, and demographics. Simultaneous multiple regression was used to analyze predictors of depressive symptoms. Seventy-eight percent of the 127 participants reported depressive symptoms to some degree. Physical symptoms (beta= .192, p<.05) were positively associated with depressive symptoms, but self-esteem (beta=-.442, p<.001), emotional support (beta=-.193, p<.01), and financial status (beta=-.209, p<.01) were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. The study results have added new knowledge about depressive symptoms and their predictors in HIV-positive pregnant women in Thailand. Depressive symptoms have been associated with faster progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome among HIV-positive individuals. The high rate of depression in our study suggests that HIV-positive pregnant women in Thailand should all be screened for depressive symptoms. Causes of physical symptoms should be identified and treated. Emotional support and self-esteem should be strengthened for HIV-positive pregnant Thai women.

Vascular insulin resistance in prehypertensive rats: role of PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS signaling. It is well known that systemic insulin resistance is closely associated with the metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, it remains unclear whether vascular insulin resistance acts as an early etiologic factor for the development of hypertension. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 5 weeks (young) and 15 weeks (adult) were studied and vascular insulin resistance was assessed as the function of isolated aortic vasodilatory response to insulin in vitro. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, adult SHRs exhibited significant hypertension with significantly decreased aortic vasodilatation to insulin, whereas young SHRs had normal blood pressure but exhibited similar vascular insulin resistance. Both young and adult SHRs showed significant downregulated expression of PI3-kinase and decreased insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of Akt and eNOS in vascular tissues. Treatment with rosiglitazone (RSG), an insulin sensitizer, for 2 weeks increased vascular PPARgamma expression and restored PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS-mediated signaling pathway only in young SHRs. More importantly, this treatment improved aortic vasodilatory response to insulin in young but not in adult SHRs. In summary, vascular insulin resistance, characterized by the impairment of PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS-mediated signaling in vascular endothelium, may play important roles in endothelial dysfunction and subsequent development of hypertension in normotensive young SHRs.

Gender-related dissociation in outcomes in chronic heart failure: reduced mortality but similar hospitalization in women. The impact of gender on major natural history endpoints in heart failure (HF) has not been examined in a propensity-matched study. Of the 7788 chronic systolic and diastolic HF patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group trial 1926 were women. Propensity scores for female gender were used to assemble a cohort of 1669 pairs of men and women who were well-balanced on 32 measured baseline characteristics. Matched hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes associated with female gender were calculated using stratified Cox regression models. All-cause mortality occurred in 36% (rate, 1256/10,000 person-years) and 30% (rate, 1008/10,000 person-years) of matched men and women respectively during 5 years of follow up (HR when women were compared with men, 0.82, 95% CI, 0.72-0.94, P=0.004). Female gender was also associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality (matched HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.99, P=0.037) and a trend toward reduced non-cardiovascular mortality (matched HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00; P=0.053). All-cause hospitalization occurred in 67% (rate, 4003/10,000 person-years) and 65% (rate, 3762/10,000 person-years) matched male and female patients respectively (HR for women, 1.03, 95% CI, 0.93-1.15, P=0.538). Female gender was not associated with cardiovascular or HF hospitalization but was associated with hospitalization due to unstable angina pectoris (matched HR, 1.38; 95%CI, 1.11-1.72; P=0.003) and stroke (matched HR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.46-0.92; P=0.014). In patients with chronic HF, female gender has a significant independent association with improved survival but has no association with all-cause, cardiovascular, or HF hospitalizations.

Evaluation of an error-reduction training program for surgical residents.

Nephronectin promotes osteoblast differentiation via the epidermal growth factor-like repeats. We found that nephronectin was significantly down-regulated by TGF-beta1. To determine the function of nephronectin in osteogenesis, we generated various constructs to produce stable MC3T3-E1 cell lines, expressing and secreting nephronectin protein, including full-length (Npnt), lacking EGF-like repeats (Np-MAM), and lacking RGD and MAM domains (Np-EGF). We demonstrated that nephronectin promotes differentiation during osteoblast differentiation and the EGF-like repeats were essential. Lack of these repeats resulted in inhibiting the change in morphology. Over-expression of nephronectin results in earlier formation of bone nodules than the vector control. ERK activation is essential for nephronectin-induced osteoblast differentiation.

Anterior cruciate ligament deficiency causes brain plasticity: a functional MRI study. The mechanoreceptors located in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) constitute an afferent source of information toward the central nervous system. It has been proposed that ACL deficiency causes a disturbance in neuromuscular control, affects central programs and consequently the motor response resulting in serious dysfunction of the injured limb. The objective of this study was to investigate whether chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury causes plastic changes in brain activation patterns. Case control study; Level of evidence, 3. Seventeen right leg-dominant male participants with chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and 18 matched healthy male participants with no special sport or habitual physical activity participated in this study. Patient selection criteria comprised a complete right unilateral anterior cruciate ligament rupture > or = 6 months before testing. Brain activation was examined by using functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (1.5-T scanner). Results show that patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency had diminished activation in several sensorimotor cortical areas and increased activation in 3 areas compared with controls: presupplementary motor area, posterior secondary somatosensory area, and posterior inferior temporal gyrus. The current study reveals that anterior cruciate ligament deficiency can cause reorganization of the central nervous system, suggesting that such an injury might be regarded as a neurophysiologic dysfunction, not a simple peripheral musculoskeletal injury. This evidence could explain clinical symptoms that accompany this type of injury and lead to severe dysfunction. Understanding the pattern of brain activation after a peripheral joint injury such as anterior cruciate ligament injury lead to new standards in rehabilitation and motor control learning with a wide application in a number of clinical and research areas (eg, surgical procedures, patient re-education, athletic training, etc).


Pyomositis: a report of three cases.

The effect of ethylene oxide, glow discharge and electron beam on the surface characteristics of poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) and the corresponding cellular response of adipose stem cells. Bioabsorbable polymers are increasingly being used in tissue engineering strategies. Despite the knowledge that some sterilization techniques may affect the physical properties of these polymers, this aspect is often overlooked. We speculate that the type of sterilization method used may influence cellular responses by altering the surface characteristics. We cultured adipose stem cells on bioabsorbable poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) sheets, sterilized using either ethylene oxide (EO), argon glow discharge (aGD) or electron beam (e-beam). Significantly higher values for surface roughness in the order EO>aGD>e-beam and significant differences in contact angles (EO>e-beam>aGD) and surface energies (aGD>e-beam>EO) were observed. Increased cell attachment and proliferation rates were observed with lower contact angles. The alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher for the ethylene oxide sterilized PLCL sheet. In conclusion, the type of sterilization for bioabsorbable polymers should be considered in the design of new scaffolds, since it might affect, or can be used to enhance, the outcome of the tissue engineered construct.

Control of branchial artery tone in fish: effects of environmental temperature and phylogeny. Branchial artery vasoreactivity and nerve density were measured in teleosts of different phylogenetic relatedness from cold (-1.86 degrees to +1 degrees C) and temperate ( approximately 13 degrees C) environments. Polar Notothenia coriiceps and temperate Paranotothenia angustata are closely related Southern Hemisphere nototheniids, and polar Boreogadus saida and temperate Myoxocephalus scorpius are Northern Hemisphere species that are phylogenetically distant from each other and the nototheniids. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was used as a temperate comparison of different activity patterns. Cumulative dose-response curves for efferent branchial arteries (EBAs) revealed a lack of alpha-adrenergic (noradrenaline [NOR]) vasoactivity in M. scorpius and a lack of cholinergic (carbachol [CARB]) vasoactivity in B. saida, while responses in N. coriiceps and P. angustata were irregular. Oncorhynchus mykiss vessels were responsive to both constrictors, suggesting either receptor absence or spatial heterogeneity among species. The sensitivity (pEC(50)) of NOR or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) vasoconstriction showed little interspecific variation, while maximal tension varied among species for NOR but not 5-HT. Acute cooling did not affect agonist-independent vascular contraction induced by KCl or in response to NOR or 5-HT. The CARB sensitivity of EBAs increased with cooling in P. angustata alone. Each species possessed a unique pattern of innervation on both branchial arteries, distal and proximal to their respective aortas, that partially differentiated between nototheniids and nonnototheniids. We conclude there is little evidence for cold adaptation of branchial artery contractility, and mechanisms of vascular control likely reflect phylogeny rather than thermal history.

Switching from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors for adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer. The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), including anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, have demonstrated improved efficacy versus tamoxifen for the adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. AIs can be used in several adjuvant endocrine settings: as upfront therapy, switch to an AI after 2-3years of tamoxifen or extended therapy following 5years of tamoxifen. In the switch setting, two different types of study designs have been utilized. One is a late randomization design which randomizes patients who are disease-free after 2-3years of tamoxifen to receive an AI versus continuation of tamoxifen. In contrast, an early randomization design randomizes all patients immediately after primary treatment and prior to starting tamoxifen. Efficacy benefits with AIs have been shown in several trials evaluating the late randomization strategy, including the Intergroup Exemestane Study, the Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole trial and the Anastrozole-Nolvadex 95 trial. Similarly, early randomization studies, including the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group-8 and the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial, have demonstrated the effectiveness of receiving an AI after tamoxifen. Two trials are assessing an early switch strategy versus upfront AI therapy: the BIG 1-98 trial and the ongoing Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre trial are assessing switching from tamoxifen to an AI after 2-3years versus upfront AI therapy. This paper reviews studies that have investigated a switch strategy with AIs and considers the implications of these data on treatment choice for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Trends and determinants of pregnancy-related domestic violence in a referral center in southern Nigeria. To describe the trend and identify associated risk factors for pregnancy-related domestic violence. In a cross-sectional study of 502 women attending the sixth week postnatal clinic in a tertiary hospital in urban Nigeria, participants completed semi-structured questionnaires on experience of domestic violence before and during pregnancy, and in the puerperium. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors associated with experiencing violence. The prevalence of domestic violence was 43.5% during the 12 months before the pregnancy, 28.3% during the pregnancy, and 4% in the puerperium. Psychological violence was the commonest form of violence experienced. All forms of violence were least common in the puerperium. Experience of violence in the 12 months before pregnancy (P<0.0001, odds ratio 274.34 [95% CI, 66.4-1133.8]), HIV seropositivity (P=0.02, odds ratio 2.81 [95% CI, 1.2-6.5]), and regular alcohol intake (P<0.0001, odds ratio 11.60 [95% CI, 3.8-35.1]) significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence. Pregnancy-related domestic violence is an important health problem in this community in southern Nigeria. Experience of violence before the pregnancy, HIV infection, and regular alcohol consumption are risk factors.

Targeted delivery of daunorubicin to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by aptamer. Application of daunorubicin in treatment of leukemia has been limited for its side effects like cardiotoxicity. Specific delivery of chemotherapy drugs is an important factor in decreasing their side effects. In this study, sgc8, an aptamer for protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7), was used for specific delivery of daunorubicin to Molt-4 cells (PTK7(+)). Flow cytometric experiments showed that aptamer-daunorubicin complex was internalized effectively to Molt-4 cells (PTK7(+)), but not to U266 cells (PTK7(-)). This fact was confirmed by less cytotoxicity of aptamer-drug complex in U266 cells in compare to daunorubicin alone. No significant change in viability between daunorubicin and aptamer-daunorubicin complex treated Molt4 cells was observed. In conclusion, sgc8-daunorubicin complex is introduced as a simple and efficient system for targeted delivery of drug to acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cells.

In vivo morphological changes in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's-like disease: MRI approach. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only noninvasive technique that provides structural information on both cell loss and metabolic changes. After reviewing all the results obtained in clinical studies, reliable biomarkers in neurological diseases are still lacking. Diffusional MRI, MR spectroscopy, and the assessment of regional atrophy are promising approaches, but they cannot be simultaneously used on a single patient. Thus, for further research progress, reliable animal models are needed. To this aim, we have used the clinical MRI to assess neurodegenerative processes in the hSOD-1(G93A) ALS rat model and in the trimethyltin (TMT)-treated model of Alzheimer's-like disease. T2-weighted (T2W) hyperintensive neurodegenerative foci were found in the brainstem of the ALS rat with apparent lateral ventricle dilation (T1W-hypointensity vs. T2W-hyperintensity). Degenerative processes in these areas were also confirmed by confocal images of GFAP-positive astrogliosis. MRI after i.v.i. of magnetic anti-CD4 antibodies indicated an accumulation of inflammatory cells near dilated ventricles. TMT-treated rats also revealed the dilation of lateral ventricles. Expected deterioration in the hippocampus was not observed by clinical MRI, but immunocytochemistry could reveal significant redistribution of macro- and microglia in this structure. In both models, Gd-DTPA contrast revealed a compromised blood brain barrier that may serve as the passage for inflammatory immune cells in the vicinity of dilated lateral ventricles. Moreover, in both models the midbrain region of the dorsal hippocampus was the target of BBB compromise, thus revealing a potentially vulnerable point that can be the primary target of neurodegeneration in the central nervous system.


Idiopathic epilepsy in dogs and cats.

Study of an unusual paratyphoid epornitic in canaries (Serinus canaria). High mortalities in 17 canary flocks from different regions of Tehran, Iran, were reported. Necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed necrotic hepatitis and overall congestive septicaemia in carcasses. Salmonella enterica was isolated from 34 examined samples, two samples from each flock, including visceral organs of carcasses and droppings of live diseased birds. All isolates were typed as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by conventional serotyping. Antibiotic resistance profiling using 33 antibiotics and random amplification of polymorphic DNA differentiation by three primers were performed and showed an identical clonal relationship between these isolates and S. Typhimurium isolated from a sample of feedstuffs. Changing the feed ingredients along with antibiotic therapy via the drinking water by enrofloxacin solution controlled the outbreaks, and mortalities ceased. The zoonotic nature of S. Typhimurium and close contact of bird owners with pet birds in the home environment made the case significant in relation to public health.

A rapid and sensitive method to detect siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage in vivo using 5' RACE and a molecular beacon probe. Specific detection of mRNA cleavage by 5'RACE is the only method to confirm the knockdown of mRNA by RNA interference, but is rarely reported for in vivo studies. We have combined 5'-RNA-linker-mediated RACE (5'-RLM-RACE) with real-time PCR using a molecular beacon to develop a rapid and specific method termed MBRACE, which we have used to detect small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced cleavage of ApoB, RRM1 and YBX1 transcripts in vitro, and ApoB in vivo. When RNA from siRNA-transfected cells was used for 5'-RLM-RACE and a cleavage site-specific molecular beacon probe was included in subsequent real-time PCR analysis, the specific mRNA cleavage product was detected. Detection of siRNA-mediated cleavage was also observed when RNA from mouse liver following administration of ApoB-specific siRNA was analysed, even in cases where ApoB knockdown measured by real-time PCR was <10%. With its sensitivity and specificity, this variation on the 5'RACE method should prove a useful tool to detect mRNA cleavage and corroborate knockdown studies following siRNA use in vivo.

Improving compound quality through in vitro and in silico physicochemical profiling. Many compounds entering clinical studies do not survive the numerous hurdles for a good pharmacological lead to a drug on the market. The reasons for attrition have been widely studied which resulted in more early attention to compound quality related to physical chemistry, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and toxicology/safety. This paper will briefly review current physicochemical in vitro assays and in silico predictions to support compound and library design through to lead optimization. The most important physicochemical properties include lipophilicity (log P/D), pKa, solubility, and permeability. These drive key ADMET properties such as absorption, cell penetration, access to the brain, volume of distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism, and toxicity, as well as biopharmaceutical behavior. Much data are now available from medium- to high-throughput physchem and ADMET in vitro assays, either in the public domain (see, e.g., PubChem, PubMed) or in drug companies' in-house databases. Such data are increasingly being computer-modelled and used in predictive chemistry. New pipelining technology makes it easier to build and update QSAR models so that such models can use the latest available data to produce robust local and global predictive in silico ADMET models.

Molecular characterization of a balanced rearrangement of chromosome 12 in two siblings with Noonan syndrome. The etiology of Noonan syndrome (NS) has been greatly elucidated with the discovery of the disease causative genes PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1, all involved in the RAS/MAPK-signaling cascade. Given that overall mutations are identified in about 70% of patients, identification of other NS associated genes remains a high priority to fully understand the etiopathogenesis of the condition. We report two affected siblings with an apparently balanced rearrangement of chromosome 12 ins(12)(q12p11.2p12.3) which segregates with the Noonan phenotype. The rearrangement was inherited from the phenotypically normal mother who had mosaicism for the derivative chromosome 12. There were no mutations of PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, or RAF1 genes detected in the probands. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis we identified the three breakpoints involved at 12p12.3, 12p11.2, and 12q12. By microarray analysis, there were no gains or losses near the breakpoints. Neither, the PTPN11 or KRAS region on chromosome 12 was involved in the rearrangement. We hypothesize that other NS candidate gene(s) may be located in the breakpoint regions of chromosome 12 causing the Noonan phenotype in both of these children.


Validation and normative studies of the Brazilian Portuguese and American versions of the Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R).

Aging alters the perception and physiological representation of frequency: evidence from human frequency-following response recordings. Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing sensitivity, have auditory perceptual deficits relative to their younger counterparts. This difficulty may in part, be related to a decline in the neural representation of frequency. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of age on behavioral and physiological measures of frequency representation. Thirty two adults (ages 22-77), with hearing thresholds 25 dB HL at octave frequencies 0.25-8.0 kHz, participated in this experiment. Frequency discrimination difference limens (FDLs) were obtained at 500 and 1000 Hz using a two-interval, two-alternative forced choice procedure. Linear regression analyses showed significant declines in FDLs at both frequencies as age increased. Frequency-following responses (FFRs) were elicited by 500 and 1000 Hz tonebursts, as well as at frequencies within and outside those FDLs. Linear regression of FFR phase coherence and FFR amplitude at frequencies at and slightly below 1000 Hz showed significant decreases as age increased. Therefore, pitch discrimination, as measured by FDLs, and neural representation of frequency, as reflected by FFR, declined as age increased. Although perception and neural representation concurrently declined, one was not predictive of the other.

[Rabdocoetsin B, a diterpenoid isolated from Isodon coetsa, is a potential proteasome inhibitor and induced apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia cells]. Effects of Rabdocoetsin B (Rabd-B), a diterpenoid extracted from Isodon coetsa, on t(8;21) leukemic cells was tested by CCK-8 assay and Flow cytometry. The A549 cells stably expressing pGC-E1-ZU1-GFP were treated with Rabd-B for 4 h, and the accumulation of GFP was detected by fluorescence microscope. Using Western blotting, we investigated the expression of Casp-3, PARP, S6', which is a subunit of the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome, and cellular ubiqutinated proteins. We found that Rabd-B induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In Kasumi-1 cells treated with 2.5 micromol/L Rabd-B for 24 h, pro-caspase-3 was processed into its active form. The substrate of Casp-3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), was cleaved with generation of an 85 kD fragment. The increased GFP fluorescence intensity, cleavage of S6' and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were found in Kasumi-1 cells treated with Rabd-B. These results suggested that Rabd-B is a potential proteasome inhibitor which induces programmed cell death of t(8;21) cells. Further study might provide evidence for employing Rabd-B in treating human t(8;21) leukemia.

Role of striatum in updating values of chosen actions. The striatum is thought to play a crucial role in value-based decision making. Although a large body of evidence suggests its involvement in action selection as well as action evaluation, underlying neural processes for these functions of the striatum are largely unknown. To obtain insights on this matter, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in the dorsal and ventral striatum of rats performing a dynamic two-armed bandit task, and examined temporal profiles of neural signals related to animal's choice, its outcome, and action value. Whereas significant neural signals for action value were found in both structures before animal's choice of action, signals related to the upcoming choice were relatively weak and began to emerge only in the dorsal striatum approximately 200 ms before the behavioral manifestation of the animal's choice. In contrast, once the animal revealed its choice, signals related to choice and its value increased steeply and persisted until the outcome of animal's choice was revealed, so that some neurons in both structures concurrently conveyed signals related to animal's choice, its outcome, and the value of chosen action. Thus, all the components necessary for updating values of chosen actions were available in the striatum. These results suggest that the striatum not only represents values associated with potential choices before animal's choice of action, but might also update the value of chosen action once its outcome is revealed. In contrast, action selection might take place elsewhere or in the dorsal striatum only immediately before its behavioral manifestation.


The medical risks of obesity.

Small animal zoonoses and immuncompromised pet owners. This review is a general discussion of common zoonotic infections of companion animals in the United States. Microbes, routes of transmission, and risks to immunocompromised persons are discussed. The primary focus of this article is dogs and cats, although zoonoses of avian, rodent, and rabbit companion animals are discussed in brief. An awareness of zoonoses will allow veterinarians and physicians to collaboratively prevent transmission and treat clinical disease in both human and veterinary patients.

[Peritoneal metastasis of breast cancer]. By this paper we present a clinical case of a multiple abdominal metastasing, occuring after 5 years fom a right mamary neoplasm, diagnosed at c-level T2N1M0 treated multidisciplinarily, conservatively operated, sector with axilar ganglionar evidation. Histopathological type of the tumour was invasive lobular mamary carcinoma, weakly differentiated (G3). The prognosis factors for the 2nd generation were negative: the receptors Her2-neu-negative, EGFR negative. The main factors of unfavourable prognosis, in this case, were the differentiating grading G3, the metastasis of the regional limphatic ganglions (2 out of 10 axilary ganglions invaded) knowing that the prognosis would worsen if the number of the axilary ganglions positive was over 3. The peculiarity of the case lies in locating the metastasis at the level of peritoneum with secondary intestinal interest, at a distance of 5 years without the illness. In the mamary cancer, the secondary lesions manifests itself at the osseous, pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral levels.


Testicular contrast harmonic imaging to evaluate intratesticular perfusion alterations in patients with varicocele.

The Relationships Between Loss of Standard CD44 Expression and Lymph Node, Liver Metastasis in T3 Colorectal Carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the standard CD44 (CD44s) expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) with invasion to the subserosal layer (T3), its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics, and its potential metastatic significance. CD44s expression was measured on immunohistochemistry in tumors from 65 patients with primary colorectal carcinomas. CD44s expression was estimated at the deepest invaded area of the tumor in subserosal layer. CD44s was demonstrated in 35.4% (23/65). CD44s expression showed no significant relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics such as age, gender, tumor location, tumor size, and macroscopic/microscopic classification. However, the CD44s expression showed significantly adverse relationship with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05) and liver metastasis (p < 0.01), respectively. The loss of CD44s expression in cancer cells in the deepest invaded area is a good marker for predicting potential metastasis to lymph nodes and liver in T3 CRC.

Quantifying electrosurgery-induced thermal effects and damage to human tissue: an exploratory study with the fallopian tube as a novel in-vivo in-situ model. To develop a human in vivo in situ model for analyzing the extent and the basic mechanisms of thermal spread and thermal tissue damage. Prospective, open, uncontrolled, nonrandomized, single-center exploratory study. University hospital. Eighteen adult patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy for benign disease. Unilateral fallopian tube tissue desiccation (10 seconds) with a laparoscopic bipolar clamp at routine settings. Deep tissue temperature (thermal probe), tissue surface temperature (thermal camera), and gross and histologic assessments of lesions with a newly developed composite scoring system. Fifteen specimens from 18 patients were evaluated. Lateral thermal damage (LTD; determined by lactate dehydrogenase staining), was strongly correlated with maximum desiccation temperature. Deep tissue LTD and surface LTD were linearly related. Histologic and macroscopic criteria for thermal effects and damage and the corresponding scores proved functional and strongly correlated with LTD. Measurement of deep tissue and tissue surface temperatures consistently yielded complete temporal and spatial temperature distributions that were describable by the heat equation. Our novel in vivo in situ model allows standardized, reproducible, quantitative assessment of electrosurgery-induced thermal effects and damage in human tissue. It will likely provide further insight into the underlying biothermomechanics and may prove useful in the development of safety guidelines for laparoscopic electrosurgery.

Rapid culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on blood agar in resource limited setting.

Investigation on the occurrence of Echinococcus multilocularis in Central Italy. Recent studies on geographic distribution of Echinococcus multilocularis in Europe show that it has a wider range than previously thought. It is unclear, however, if the wider distribution is due to its recent spreading or to a lack of previous data from the new areas. Italy, previously considered E. multilocularis-free, is now part of these new areas: infected foxes (the main definitive host of the tapeworm) have been observed in a Northern Alpine territory. Thus, more surveys need to be done in other Italian regions in order to monitor the spreading of E. multilocularis. The aim of the present study was to look for this parasite in 283 foxes collected in an Apennine area of Central Italy by different diagnostic methods. The foxes were heavily parasitized by 11 helminthic genera, but none of the animals was infected by E. multilocularis neither by E. granulosus (harboured adult worms or their DNA). Low specificity was observed in commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of E. multilocularis antigens in the faeces. Molecular diagnostics were sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of tapeworm eggs in faeces, but less sensitive, although specific, to adult tapeworms in the intestinal content. Preliminarily, we can say that no E. multilocularis could be found in the study area. These data will enable us to follow temporal changes of the spatial distribution of the parasite in the study area of the Central Apennines. Due to its low specificity the ELISA kit for E. multilocularis coproantigens is not suitable for epidemiological surveys, whereas molecular diagnostics applied to faecal samples give useful results. Finally, absence of E. granulosus in foxes living in the endemic areas studied confirms the thought that this tapeworm prefers a different definitive host.

Imagining reproduction in science and history. Reproduction is at the core of many aspects of human existence. It is intrinsic in our biology and in the broad social constructs in which we all reside. The introduction to this special issue is designed to reflect on some of the differences between the humanities/arts and the sciences on the subject of reproduction now and in the past. The intellectual/cultural distance between humanists and reproductive biologists is vast, yet communication between the two cultures has much to offer in guiding future research, pedagogy, and social policy. The challenges to communication include differences in methodology,professional protocols, specialization, and the increasing speed with which reproductive technology advances. The solutions require a new kind of student who can learn and adapt the approaches from both sides of the disciplinary divide to create new ways of understanding how our current and future concepts of reproduction may be informed by the past. This co-authored introduction reviews the range of interests represented in the essays and represents first steps of a dialogue between a humanist and a reproductive biologist who chart some of the possibilities on what the future of the subject might hold.

Electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping of speech cortex during an awake craniotomy: case report. Traditional electrocortical stimulation (ECS) mapping is limited by the lengthy serial investigation (one location at a time) and the risk of afterdischarges in localizing eloquent cortex. Electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping (EFAM) allows the parallel investigation of many cortical sites in much less time and with no risk of afterdischarges because of its passive nature. We examined its use with ECS in the context of language mapping during an awake craniotomy for a tumor resection. The patient was a 61-year-old right-handed Caucasian male who presented with headache and mild aphasia. Imaging demonstrated a 3-cm cystic mass in the posterior temporal-parietal lobe. The patient underwent an awake craniotomy for the mapping of his speech cortex and resection of the mass. Using a 32-contact electrode array, electrocorticographic signals were recorded from the exposed cortex as the patient participated in a 3-min screening task involving active (patient naming visually presented words) and rest (patient silent) conditions. A spectral comparison of the 2 conditions revealed specific cortical locations associated with activation during speech. The patient was then widely mapped using ECS. Three of 4 sites identified by ECS were also identified passively and in parallel by EFAM, 2 with statistical significance and the third by qualitative inspection. EFAM was technically achieved in an awake craniotomy patient and had good concordance with ECS mapping. Because it poses no risk of afterdischarges and offers substantial time savings, EFAM holds promise for future development as an adjunct intraoperative mapping tool. Additionally, the cortical signals obtained by this modality can be utilized for localization in the presence of a tumor adjacent to the eloquent regions.

Effects of alpha-asarone on the glutamate transporter EAAC1 in Xenopus oocytes. The major excitatory neurotransmitter transporter EAAC1 in the mammalian central nervous system is considered a possible target for Chinese herbal medicine. Extracts of Acorus tatarinowii (Schott) were tested for their effects on EAAC1 activity. XENOPUS oocytes with heterologously expressed EAAC1 were used as the model system. Rate of glutamate uptake was determined by means of the isotopic tracer technique. Glutamate-induced current was recorded under a two-electrode voltage clamp. As a highly effective component, alpha-asarone was identified. The rate of glutamate uptake was stimulated by 200 microM of alpha-asarone by about 15 %. In contrast, the same concentration reduced the EAAC1-mediated current by about 35 % at a holding potential of - 60 mV; half maximum inhibition was obtained at about 60 microM. Our experimental data suggest that both stimulation of glutamate uptake and inhibition of EAAC1-mediated current by alpha-asarone could contribute to reduced excitatory activity.

Improving therapeutic engagement with adolescent sexual offenders. This article reports a test of multisystemic predictors of therapeutic engagement (TE) with adolescent sexual offenders (ASOs), and an evaluation of clinical efforts to improve TE with this client group. First, clinicians rated their TE with 105 Australian court-referred male ASOs (M = 15.53 years; SD = 1.30 years), who participated in treatment between 2001 and 2005. For this cohort, correlation analysis showed impulsivity/antisociality, negative peer relationships, and indigenous race to be associated with poorer TE. Multiple regression analysis identified impulsivity/antisociality and indigenous race as significant unique predictors. Clinical efforts subsequently focused on improving TE, particularly with higher-antisocial youth and with indigenous youth and their families. Clinicians then rated TE with a second, independent cohort of 54 court-referred male ASOs (M = 15.44 years; SD = 1.22 years), who participated in the modified treatment between 2006 and 2009. A two-way ANCOVA, controlling for impulsivity/antisociality, indicated significant improvements in TE for both indigenous and non-indigenous ASOs. Despite these general improvements, indigenous ASOs remained comparatively less engaged than their non-indigenous counterparts.


How people understand their world: perceived randomness of rare life events.

The development of gyrification in childhood and adolescence. Gyrification is the process by which the brain undergoes changes in surface morphology to create sulcal and gyral regions. The period of greatest development of brain gyrification is during the third trimester of pregnancy, a period of time in which the brain undergoes considerable growth. Little is known about changes in gyrification during childhood and adolescence, although considering the changes in gray matter volume and thickness during this time period, it is conceivable that alterations in the brain surface morphology could also occur during this period of development. The formation of gyri and sulci in the brain allows for compact wiring that promotes and enhances efficient neural processing. If cerebral function and form are linked through the organization of neural connectivity, then alterations in neural connectivity, i.e., synaptic pruning, may also alter the gyral and sulcal patterns of the brain. This paper reviews developmental theories of gyrification, computational techniques for measuring gyrification, and the potential interaction between gyrification and neuronal connectivity. We also present recent findings involving alterations in gyrification during childhood and adolescence.

Protective effects of early CD4(+) T cell reduction in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. CD4(+) T cells contribute to disturbances of liver microcirculation after warm ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The aim of this study was to investigate a possible protective role of FTY720 (Sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor agonist) in this setting. In an in vivo model (42 Wistar rats), ischemia of the left liver lobe was induced for 90 min under anesthesia with xylazine/ketanest. Sham-operated untreated ischemic and treatment group with FTY720 (1 mg/kg body weight intravenous) were investigated. The effect of FTY on I/R injury was assessed by in vivo microscopy 30-90 min after reperfusion (perfusion rate, vessel diameter, leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, T cell infiltration), by measurement of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), and by histological investigation. After 30 min of reperfusion, the number of T cells in sinusoids was increased four-fold. In the FTY group, the number of T cells was reduced to an half of the number of the ischemia group. Likewise, the number of adherent leukocytes in sinusoids (150.8 +/- 10.9% of s.o.) was reduced in the treatment group (117.3 +/- 12.2%; p < 0.05 vs ischemia), leading to an improvement in perfusion rate in this group (85.0 +/- 4.6% of sham group) compared to nontreated animals (57.5 +/- 10.8%; p < 0.05). According to improved microcirculation, AST/ALT values and histological tissue damage were reduced in the therapy group. RT-PCR revealed an increased expression of IL-2, IL-6, and TLR-4 in the nontreated ischemic group. This expression was clearly reduced in the treatment group. In conclusion, FTY720 ameliorates the microcirculatory, biochemical, and histological manifestations of hepatic I/R injury by preventing T cell infiltration. These results indicate that T cells are pivotal mediators in hepatic I/R and may have important implications early after liver transplantation and in warm ischemia.

Inactivation of environmental mycobacteria by free chlorine and UV. The resistance of environmental mycobacteria (EM) against chlorine and ultraviolet (UV) was evaluated for determination of the Ct value and UV dose to inactivate EM. Chlorine disinfection experiments were done on Mycobacterium fortuitum in oxidant demand-free buffered water at the worst condition (pH 8.5, 4 degrees C) and normal condition (pH 7.0, 20 degrees C). The Ct value for 3log inactivation of M. fortuitum was 600 times greater than that of Escherichia coli. UV experiments were performed for various species of Mycobacterium avium, M. fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium lentiflavum. A UV collimated beam device was used for irradiation of four species suspended in phosphate buffered saline with doses of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100mJ/cm(2). UV sensitivity of mycobacteria was species-specific. More than 3log of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. lentiflavum could be inactivated at 20mJ/cm(2), whereas M. fortuitum was so resistant that 3log inactivation required a dose of more than 50mJ/cm(2). Mycobacteria were found 2-10 times more resistant to UV than E. coli for 3log inactivation. There was no significant difference in the inactivation of mycobacteria with either low-pressure or medium-pressure UV irradiation.

Prevalence of temporomandibular disorder signs in patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) signs in a group of institutionalized patients with schizophrenia. Three hundred thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia were examined and compared with 107 age-matched and gender-matched control subjects. TMD signs were evaluated according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria to assess temporomandibular joint pain to palpation, limitation of maximum mouth opening, alteration of mouth opening pathway (deviation/deflection) and temporomandibular joint noises. In addition, tooth wear was recorded for the assessment of bruxism. The prevalence of any TMD signs was observed higher (P = 0.001) in the patients with schizophrenia (284/339, 83.7%) than in the controls (72/107, 67.3%). The prevalence of more than one TMD sign was also significantly higher (P = 0.03) in the patients with schizophrenia (131/339, 38.6%) than in the controls (29/107, 27.1%). Significant differences between the two groups were apparent for joint pain on palpation (P = 0.006), deflection (P = 0.006) and joint sounds (P = 0.002). Severe tooth wear was evident in 39.2% of the patients with schizophrenia compared with 21.2% in the control group (P = 0.001). The finding of the present study showed that, compared to control population, chronically hospitalized patients with schizophrenia seem to be more prone to the development of TMD signs and severe tooth wear and bruxism.

Comparison of early and long-term results of percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, complicated or not by cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock (CS) still remains one of the most important factors affecting the mortality rate of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the data with follow-up longer than 1 year are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and long-term treatment results of patients with STEMI, complicated or not by CS, who underwent percutaneus coronary interventions. A retrospective registry included data of all patients with STEMI admitted to our centre from January 1999 to December 2001. One thousand three hundred and eighty-five patients with STEMI were hospitalized and 1237 of them were treated with immediate percutaneus coronary interventions. Among this subpopulation, 117 (9.5%) patients were with STEMI complicated with CS on admission (group I) and 1120 (90.5%) patients were with STEMI without complications from CS on admission (group II). The groups differed significantly with regard to baseline clinical characteristics, angiographic picture, and in-hospital course. A total of 38.5% of patients with myocardial infarction complicated by CS and 2.5% of patients without shock (P<0.001) died during hospitalization. At the 5-year follow-up, 58.1% of group I patients and 14.8% of group II patients (P<0.001) died. A significant difference in the 5-year mortality rate was also observed in patients who survived the in-hospital period (31.9 vs. 12.6%; P<0.001). CS continues to be closely connected with a very high mortality rate both in the hospital and in the long-term, also among patients who survived the in-hospital period.

Monitoring bacterial indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot waste by real-time PCR. Quantitative microbial health risk assessment requires accurate enumeration of pathogens in hazard-containing matrices as part of the risk characterization process. As part of a risk management-oriented study of cattle feedlot waste contaminants, we investigated the utility of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for surveying the microbial constituents of different faecal wastes. The abundance of Escherichia coli and enterococci were first estimated in five cattle feedlot waste types from five localities. Bacteria were quantified using two culture methods and compared to the number of genome copies detected by qPCR targeted at E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial numbers detected in the different wastes (fresh faeces, pen manure, aged manure, composted manure, carcass manure compost) ranged from 10-(7) to 10(2)g(-1) (dry weight). Both indicator groups were detected by qPCR with a comparable sensitivity to culture methods across this range. qPCR measurements of E. coli and E. faecalis correlated well with MPN and spread plate data. As a second comparison, we inoculated green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled reference bacteria into manure samples. GFP labeled E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes were detected by qPCR in concentrations corresponding to between 18% and 71% of the initial bacterial numbers, compared to only 2.5-16% by plating. Our results supported our selection of qPCR as a fast, accurate and reliable system for surveying the presence and abundance of pathogens in cattle waste.

Identification of glycosyltransferase 8 family members as xylosyltransferases acting on O-glucosylated notch epidermal growth factor repeats. The epidermal growth factor repeats of the Notch receptor are extensively glycosylated with three different O-glycans. O-Fucosylation and elongation by the glycosyltransferase Fringe have been well studied and shown to be essential for proper Notch signaling. In contrast, biosynthesis of O-glucose and O-N-acetylglucosamine is less well understood. Recently, the isolation of the Drosophila mutant rumi has shown that absence of O-glucose impairs Notch function. O-Glucose is further extended by two contiguous alpha1,3-linked xylose residues. We have identified two enzymes of the human glycosyltransferase 8 family, now named GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 (glucoside xylosyltransferase), as UDP-d-xylose:beta-d-glucoside alpha1,3-d-xylosyltransferases adding the first xylose. The enzymes are specific for beta-glucose-terminating acceptors and UDP-xylose as donor substrate. Generation of the alpha1,3-linkage was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Activity on a natural acceptor could be shown by in vitro xylosylation of a Notch fragment expressed in a UDP-xylose-deficient cell line and in vivo by co-expression of the enzymes and the Notch fragment in insect cells followed by mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments.

Genomic and proteomic analysis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis is defined as an inflammation of the myocardium that results in injury to the cardiac myocytes. Myocarditis is also thought to be a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) from evidence of viral persistence in the myocardium in patients with idiopathic DCM. Genome and proteome screening techniques that do not require mechanistic knowledge of disease pathogenesis have recently begun to reveal disease-specific profiles. These studies are now yielding novel mechanisms, biomarkers, and potential therapeutic targets. This article reviews several examples of noncandidate genomic and proteomic screening, as well as the potential strengths and pitfalls of these strategies for the evaluation of myocarditis and nonischemic DCM.

Use of a nonnegative constrained principal component regression chemical mass balance model to study the contributions of nearly collinear sources. In this study, a nonnegative constrained principal component regression chemical mass balance (NCPCRCMB) model was used to solve the near collinearity problem among source profiles for source apportionment. The NCPCRCMB model added the principle component regression route into the CMB model iteration. The model was tested with the synthetic data sets, which involved contributions from eleven actual sources, with a serious near collinearity problem among them. The actual source profiles were randomly perturbed and then applied to create the synthetic receptor. The resulting synthetic receptor concentrations were also randomly perturbed to simulate measurement errors. The synthetic receptors were separately apportioned by CMB and NCPCRCMB model. The result showed that source contributions estimated by the NCPCRCMB model were much closer to the true values than those estimated by the CMB model. Next, five real ambient data sets from five cities in China were analyzed using the NCPCRCMB model to test the model practicability. Reasonable results were obtained in all cases. It is shown that the NCPCRCMB model has an advantage over the traditional CMB model when dealing with near collinearity problems in source apportionment studies.

The anorectic and obese adolescent. In view of the menstrual disturbances involved, gynaecologists frequently come into contact with girls suffering from eating disorders that can rapidly evolve into anorexia nervosa. The ability to make a precocious diagnosis of the severity of both physical and psychopathological involvement, to offer clear explanations of the links between reproductive function and energy availability and to motivate psychotherapy can be of paramount importance for the prognosis. Similarly, obese adolescents might require counselling for menstrual disorders or alleged endocrine dysfunction. Knowledge of the markers of metabolic impairment and of the possible therapeutic approaches to essential obesity is a necessary complement to the management of the more usual conditions related to overweight, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Presented here is an overview of recent evidence on the pathogenesis, endocrine profile, short- and long-term health repercussions, therapeutic strategies and clinical trials regarding these two opposing pathologies, both related to unhealthy eating behaviour and also to psycho-relational problems.

The linker connecting the tandem ubiquitin binding domains of RAP80 is critical for lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin-dependent binding activity. The tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) domain located at the N-terminus of Receptor Associated Protein 80 (RAP80) plays a crucial role in ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response. RAP80 translocates to sites of IR-induced DNA damage through interaction of its UIM domain with ubiquitinated H2A and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The exact mechanism, however, through which RAP80 associates with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains is not clear. Here, we show by in vitro GST-pull down assays that modifying the linker region between the tandem ubiquitin binding domains of RAP80 changes the binding affinity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains and affects translocation to sites of DNA breaks. Based on these findings, we suggest that the length of the linker region between the tandem ubiquitin binding domains of RAP80 may be a key factor in the binding of RAP80 with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains as well as in the translocation of RAP80 to DNA break sites.

[Genetics of mental retardation]. Mental retardation affects nearly 3 % of the population. The causes of these disorders are various and are often not identified. Recent advances focused on the molecular basis of mental retardation. Nearly half of mental retardation syndromes have a genetic origin and the description of molecular, cytogenetic and metabolic alterations in these disorders led to the development of diagnostic tools. Indeed, identifying the precise origin of the mental retardation allows to improve patient care and to refine the prognosis. Moreover, these molecular tools will help the geneticist to evaluate the recurrence risk in the family in the genetic counseling step. On a fundamental point of view, the knowledge of molecular basis of mental retardation will help to understand the biological pathway which constitutes the first step before therapeutic strategies. Every patient with mental retardation should be investigated for causal origin of the disease. We will detail the diagnostic methods necessary to investigate a patient presenting with mental retardation. Then different examples of syndromes including a mental retardation will be chosen to illustrate different clinical situations.

[High cell-density fermentation of shark hepatical stimulator analogue in Escherichia coli]. The potential effects of recombinant shark hepatical stimulator analogue (r-sHSA) in liver disease have been revealed in our previous studies. In order to further evaluate its clinic application, we carried out high cell-density fermentation in 5 L fermentor to get enough products. Based on the trials in shaking flask, we optimized the parameters for 5 L fermentor, including medium composition, medium supplement, inducer concentration and induction time, etc. In detail, the improved LB medium (0.97% glycerol, 0.91% yeast extract, 0.72% tryptone, 0.782% KH2PO4, 0.267% K2HPO4.3H2O, 0.062% MgSO4.7H2O, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0) is chosen to cultivate the engineering bacteria with the constant fermentation condition (pH 7.0, and the dissolved oxygen concentration is about 25%-30%). When bacterial culture reaches exponential phase, the modified feeding medium (620 g/L glycerol, 94.8 g/L tryptone, 3.3 mL/L trace elements, and 7.5 g/L MgSO4.7H2O) is then supplied through the method of exponential fed-batch mode. After the optical density (OD600) of engineering bacterial culture reaches to 23, the ultimately concentration of 0.5 mmol/L IPTG is added to induce the expression of r-sHSA for 6 h. Results show that the amount of r-sHSA production is (2.662 +/- 0.041) g/L, which is about 13.7 folds of the one optimized before.

Liver resection and cryotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Previous studies suggest that surgical treatment of metastatic melanoma in carefully selected patients does improve survival. This paper assesses the survival of melanoma patients with hepatic metastases who underwent surgery in our unit. Fifteen (0.64%) patients had hepatic melanoma metastases. Seven patients underwent curative surgery. Surgical intervention included curative as well as palliative control of hepatic disease. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Median survival for the 15 patients was 7 months. Median survival time in the curative surgical group and the palliative/nonsurgical group was 22 and 6 months, respectively. Patients with ocular primary, single lesions, and unilobar disease had a better outcome. Those who were selected and underwent surgery had a better overall survival compared with patients who are treated nonoperatively. Resection of hepatic melanoma metastases has a role in selected patients.

A comprehensive neuropsychiatric study of elderly twins: the Older Australian Twins Study. The Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) was recently initiated to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their associations and interactions in healthy brain ageing and ageing-related neurocognitive disorders. The study extends the classic MZ-DZ design to include one or two equivalently aged siblings for each twin pair and utilizes the rich resources of the Australian Twin Registry. The study has a number of distinguishing features including comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, a longitudinal design and links with a brain donor program. The study measures many behavioral and environmental factors, but in particular lifetime physical and mental activity, physical and psychological trauma, loss of parent early in life, later losses and life events, early-life socioeconomic environment, alcohol and drug use, occupational exposure, and nutrition. It also includes comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, blood biochemistry, genetics and proteomics. The socio-demographic and health data on the first 172 pairs of twins participating in this study are presented. Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is 12.8% and of dementia 1.5% in the sample. The target sample size is 1000, with at least 400 pairs of twins aged 65-90 years. The cohort will be assessed every two years, with in-depth assessments being repeated. OATS offers an excellent opportunity for collaboration with other similar studies as well as researchers who share the same interests.


Effect of exercise on gene expression profile in unfractionated peripheral blood leukocytes.

Hippocampal volume deficits and shape deformities in young biological relatives of schizophrenia probands. Hippocampal volume decrement may be one of the changes that most closely pre-date schizophrenia onset. Studying hippocampal developmental morphology in adolescent or young adult biological relatives of schizophrenia probands has the potential to further our understanding of the neurodevelopmental etiology of schizophrenia and to discover biomarkers that may aid its early identification. We utilized an artificial neural network segmentation algorithm to automatically define and reliably measure MRI hippocampus volumes. We compared 46 young, nonpsychotic biological relatives of probands against 46 healthy controls without family history of schizophrenia and 46 schizophrenia probands (age range=13 to 28 years). We further contrasted hippocampal shape differences using spherical harmonic functions and assessed how obstetric complications (a trigger for aberrant in utero neurodevelopment) may contribute to hippocampal abnormalities. Similar to schizophrenia probands, unaffected biological relatives of probands had significantly smaller hippocampus volumes than controls; which correspond to inward displacements in shape deformities principally in the anterior hippocampal subregions. Examination of hippocampus volume-age relationships indicate that hippocampus volume normally decreases with age during late adolescence through early adulthood. In contrast, relatives of probands did not show these age-expected changes. Deviant hippocampus volume-age relationships suggest aberrant hippocampal neurodevelopment among biological relatives. Relatives with a history of obstetric complications had significantly smaller left and right hippocampi than relatives without obstetrics complications, including a dose relationship such that greater number of birth complications correlated with smaller hippocampus. Similar hippocampal volume deficits-obstetric complications relationships were observed among schizophrenia probands. Hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenia are likely to be mediated by different neurobiological mechanisms, including factors associated with obstetric complications which occur during early neurodevelopment. Other brain maturational anomalies affecting the hippocampus in schizophrenia may manifest closer to illness onset in adolescence/early adulthood.

Cryopreservation of feline epididymal spermatozoa from dead and alive animals and its use in assisted reproduction. Cryopreservation of gametes is an important tool in assisted reproduction programmes; long-term storage of oocytes or spermatozoa is necessary when in vitro fertilization (IVF) or artificial insemination is to be performed at a future date. Cryopreservation of epididymal spermatozoa offers a potential tool for rescuing genetic material from males of endangered populations. The objectives of this work were to: (1) examine sperm motility, viability, abnormality and acrosome integrity of frozen-thawed domestic cat epididymal spermatozoa; and (2) evaluate the same cryopreservation method on wild feline spermatozoa, needed to preserve their genetic resources. Epididymides were collected from 20 domestic cats during routine neutering procedure and from two wild felines at autopsy. The sperm samples, diluted with 4% glycerol/Tris/egg yolk, were loaded into 0.25 ml mini-straws, exposed to nitrogen vapour and stored in liquid nitrogen. After 4 weeks, samples were thawed and re-evaluated. The quality of each fresh and frozen-thawed sperm sample was tested by determining the motility (54.7 +/- 11.3% and 32 +/- 13.1% respectively for cat spermatozoa; 38.3 +/- 18.7% and 21.5 +/- 16.8% respectively for tiger spermatozoa), viability (74.3 +/- 8.6% and 45.2 +/- 9.4% respectively for cat spermatozoa; 42.4 +/- 14.5% and 33.5 +/- 12.9% respectively for wild felid spermatozoa), morphology and acrosomal status. The present study showed that feline epididymal spermatozoa can be frozen in egg-yolk extender with 4.0% glycerol in 0.25 ml straws. The procedure used in the present study for epididymal cat sperm cryopreservation may be applied to bank the genetic resources of wild felid species.


Hepatoprotective effect of shidagonglao on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride.

Optimization of analytical and pre-analytical conditions for MALDI-TOF-MS human urine protein profiles. Protein analysis in biological fluids, such as urine, by means of mass spectrometry (MS) still suffers for insufficient standardization in protocols for sample collection, storage and preparation. In this work, the influence of these variables on healthy donors human urine protein profiling performed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was studied. A screening of various urine sample pre-treatment procedures and different sample deposition approaches on the MALDI target was performed. The influence of urine samples storage time and temperature on spectral profiles was evaluated by means of principal component analysis (PCA). The whole optimized procedure was eventually applied to the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of human urine samples taken from prostate cancer patients. The best results in terms of detected ions number and abundance in the MS spectra were obtained by using home-made microcolumns packed with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) resin as sample pre-treatment method; this procedure was also less expensive and suitable for high throughput analyses. Afterwards, the spin coating approach for sample deposition on the MALDI target plate was optimized, obtaining homogenous and reproducible spots. Then, PCA indicated that low storage temperatures of acidified and centrifuged samples, together with short handling time, allowed to obtain reproducible profiles without artifacts contribution due to experimental conditions. Finally, interesting differences were found by comparing the MALDI-TOF-MS protein profiles of pooled urine samples of healthy donors and prostate cancer patients. The results showed that analytical and pre-analytical variables are crucial for the success of urine analysis, to obtain meaningful and reproducible data, even if the intra-patient variability is very difficult to avoid. It has been proven how pooled urine samples can be an interesting way to make easier the comparison between healthy and pathological samples and to individuate possible differences in the protein expression between the two sets of samples.

Therapeutic effects of magnetic and copper bracelets in osteoarthritis: a randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial. To test the effectiveness of a typical magnetic wrist strap for reducing pain and stiffness, and for improving physical functioning amongst patients with osteoarthritis. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16-week period. Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap. Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P=0.025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard magnetic wrist strap, than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. However such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope.

[Magnetic resonance imaging for frontotemporal lobar degeneration]. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has been clinically categorized into 3 subtypes: frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and progressive nonfluent aphasia. The histological subtypes of FTLD are Pick disease, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with grain, dementia with ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia. In this paper, I briefly describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in Pick disease, progressive nonfluent aphasia, semantic dementia, and dementia with grain. In Pick disease, so-called knife-blade atrophy is seen in the frontal and temporal lobes at a relatively early stage of the disease. In progressive nonfluent aphasia atrophy is seen in the upper part of the left frontal lobe. Marked atrophy in the left temporal pole is observed in patients with semantic dementia, and asymmetrical atrophy around the ambient gyri is detected in patients who have dementia with grains. Although such focal atrophy can be observed on routine MRI, it is more easily detected on voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer disease (VSRAD).

Modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 release by berberine: in vivo and in vitro studies. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic gut hormone released from intestinal L cells. Our previous studies showed that berberine increased GLP-1 secretion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether berberine affected GLP-1 release in normal rats and in NCI-H716 cells. Proglucagon and prohormone convertase 3 genes regulating GLP-1 biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-PCR. Effects of pharmacological inhibitors on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release were studied. In vivo, 5-week treatment of berberine enhanced GLP-1 secretion induced by glucose load and promoted proglucagon mRNA expression as well as L cell proliferation in intestine. In vitro, berberine concentration-dependently stimulated GLP-1 release in NCI-H716 cells. Berberine also promoted both prohormone convertase 3 and proglucagon mRNA expression. Chelerythrine (inhibitor of PKC) concentration-dependently suppressed berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. Compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) also inhibited berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. But only low concentrations of H89 (inhibitor of PKA) showed inhibitory effects on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release. The present results demonstrated that berberine showed its modulation on GLP-1 via promoting GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 biosynthesis. Some signal pathways including PKC-dependent pathway were involved in this process. Elucidation of mechanisms controlling berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion may facilitate the understanding of berberine's antidiabetic effects.

Acute care nurse practitioners in oncologic critical care: the memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer center experience. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly being used to fill the physician-staffing void in intensive care units. This article describes the initiation and role development of our collaborative physician-NP critical care medicine (CCM) program at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The challenges that our program encountered with recruiting, training, transitioning, collaborating, communicating, and addressing end-of-life issues are detailed in this article. Finally, we delve into the emotional impact NPs have on this new role and propose future directions to strengthen the CCM NP model. We hope that this descriptive article of the development of our CCM NP group will allow others who are seeking to cultivate their own CCM NP teams to benefit from our experience.


Subclinical hypothyroidism effects on cardiac function.

GM-CSF-secreting vaccines for solid tumors. Whole tumor cells that secrete GM-CSF have been tested in clinical trials and have demonstrated early evidence of safety and clinical activity. The intradermal administration of these cells induces a massive infiltration of dendritic cells, which process and present tumor antigens to activate tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. However, trial design flaws limit the phase III evaluation of this vaccine platform. Preclinical and clinical data suggest the development of GM-CSF-secreting tumor vaccines should be continued in combination with drugs that enhance vaccine activity by mitigating immune tolerance or augmenting costimulatory pathways of T-cell activation.

Outcomes following surgical decompression for dysthyroid orbitopathy (Graves' disease). Graves' disease is a multiorgan autoimmune disease of complex pathophysiology that primarily affects the thyroid gland and orbit. The ophthalmic manifestations of Graves' disease may vary from mild proptosis which causes minimal cosmetic embarrassment to subluxation of the globe, exposure keratitis, corneal abrasion and even blindness. This article focuses on outcomes following orbital decompression. Surgical techniques have evolved with improved understanding of sinonasal anatomy and being technology-driven with the use of the fiberoptic endoscope and image guidance. The most common surgical outcome reported in the literature is reduction in proptosis, followed by visual acuity and intraocular pressure. Quality-of-life assessments are not routinely measured. There are a myriad of surgical techniques currently in practice which underscores the fact that no single technique is clearly superior to another. Endoscopic decompression results in a mean reduction of 3.50 mm and is associated with a low complication rate. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that the best techniques are likely to be multiwall approaches such as combined medial and lateral wall decompression. Management of dysthyroid ophthalmopathy is clearly multidisciplinary. Future studies should consider a minimum data set for reporting outcome measures which should include a quality of life tool.


Surveillance approaches among colorectal cancer survivors after curative-intent.

Two adults with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with mild mental retardation, glaucoma, normal growth and skull circumference, and camptodactyly of third fingers. The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS; OMIM 180849) is a well-defined mental retardation/multiple congenital anomalies (MR/MCA) syndrome characterized by postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, specific facial features, broad thumbs and halluces, and MR of variable degree. Ten percent of patients with RTS have a microdeletion 16p13.3, 40-50% carry a mutation of the CREBBP gene and another 3% have a mutation in the EP300 gene. In the remaining patients with clinically suspected RTS no mutation can be detected. Here we describe two patients with an RTS phenotype, one with a mutation in the CREBBP gene and the other without a detectable CREBBP or EP300 mutation and without a chromosomal imbalance on high-resolution arrays. Both patients present with the characteristic facial RTS phenotype, broad thumbs and big toes, mild MR, formation of keloids and glaucoma, but without postnatal growth retardation or microcephaly. In addition, they have both congenital camptodactyly of third (and fourth) fingers, which has not reported in RTS previously. We suggest that they represent a clinical subtype of RTS.

Genetic and epigenetic characteristics of gastric cancers with JC virus T-antigen. To clarify the significance of JC virus (JCV) T-antigen (T-Ag) expression in human gastric cancer. We investigated the relationship between T-Ag detected by immunohistochemistry and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, microsatellite instability (MSI), and genetic and epigenetic alterations in gastric cancers. Mutations in the p53, beta-catenin, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Allelic losses were determined by PCR at 7 microsatellite loci. Aberrant DNA methylation was analyzed by MethyLight assay. JCV T-Ag protein expression was found in 49% of 90 gastric cancer tissues. T-Ag positivity was not correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. T-Ag expression was detected in a similar percentage of EBV positive cancers (4 of 9, 44%) and EBV negative cancers (35 of 73, 48%). T-Ag expression was detected in a significantly lower percentage of MSI-H cancers (14%) than in non MSI-H cancers (55%, P = 0.005). T-Ag expression was detected in a significantly higher percentage of cancers with nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin (15 of 21, 71%) than in cancers without (42%, P = 0.018). p53 mutations were detected in a significantly lower percentage of T-Ag positive cancers (32%) than in T-Ag negative cancers (57%, P = 0.018). T-Ag positive gastric cancers showed a significant increase in the allelic losses and aberrant methylation compared with T-Ag negative gastric cancers (P = 0.008 and P = 0.003). The results suggest that JCV T-Ag is involved in gastric carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic alterations.

Correlates of gender dysphoria in Taiwanese university students. There have been no published reports regarding the epidemiological and psychiatric features of gender dysphoria in non-clinical young adults. The current study aimed to investigate the demographics, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and perceived parenting style and family support in Taiwanese young adults with gender dysphoria. The sample consisted of 5010 university freshmen (male, 51.6%) with a mean age of 19.6 years (SD = 2.7) from a national university in Taiwan. The questionnaires used for this university-based survey included the Adult Self Report Inventory-4 for psychopathology (including gender dysphoria), the Parental Bonding Instrument for parenting style, and the Family APGAR for perceived family support. Results showed that gender dysphoria was more prevalent in females (7.3%) than males (1.9%). Young adults with gender dysphoria were more likely to meet a wide but specific range of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. The most significantly associated symptoms for males were agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, manic episode, and pathological gambling, and for females dissociative disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. Both males and females with gender dysphoria perceived significantly less support from their families and less affection/care from both parents. Findings suggest that gender dysphoria, associated with a specific range of psychopathology and family/parenting dissatisfaction (with both similar and dissimilar patterns between sexes), is not uncommon in Taiwanese university students, particularly in females. This implies the importance of attention and specific measures to offset psychiatric conditions and to promote mental well-being of this population.


A modified thrombin generation test for investigating very low levels of factor VIII activity in hemophilia A.

Identification of amino acids within the second alpha helical domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu that are critical for preventing CD4 cell surface expression. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes for a Vpu protein, which interacts with CD4 resulting in its degradation. In this study, we examined the role of the 10 amino acids within the predicted second alpha-helical domain of the subtype B Vpu cytoplasmic tail in CD4 down-modulation using a VpuEGFP reporter system. Our findings indicate that the invariant leucine at position 63 and, to a lesser extent, the valine at position 68 were required for CD4 down-modulation. Mutation of analogous L63 in Vpu proteins subtypes A2, B(YU-2), C, D, and H also abolished CD4 down-modulation from the cell surface. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that L63A and V68A mutants were capable of binding CD4 and still retained the ability to interact with h-beta-TrCP1. Taken together, these results indicate that amino acid substitutions in the second alpha-helical domain that retain the predicted structure and binding to h-beta-TrCP1 can influence Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation.

A pilot study on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathormone (PTH) and calcium, both have been shown to stimulate adrenal steroidogenesis in animal models and in vitro experiments. This is attributed to structural similarity between 15-25 amino acid region of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1-11 amino acid region of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). However, there are no in vivo human data regarding the effect of PTHcalcium axis on adrenocortical function. Ten patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent evaluation for cortisol dynamics including 0800 h and 2000 h plasma cortisol on day 1, cortisol response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia (IIH) on day 2, and 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ONDST) on day 4. Serum aldosterone was also measured at 0800 h in fasting state on salt ad libitum for three days. These parameters were repeated 3 months after curative parathyroidectomy. Basal plasma cortisol level at 0800 h and 2000 h were within upper normal range and loss of circadian rhythm in cortisol secretion was observed in half and forty per cent of patients had nonsuppressibility with ONDST. The defined peak cortisol response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia (>550 nmol/l) was achieved in all and nearly one third of patients had exaggerated response (>2000 nmol/l). After curative parathyroidectomy, the abnormalities in circadian rhythm and non-suppressibility with ONDST continued to prevail in 40 per cent of patients. The peak cortisol response to IIH showed a decrement but remained higher than normal. No correlation was observed between circulating parathyroid hormone and calcium with cortisol levels. Serum aldosterone was in upper normal range pre - and postoperatively, though it decreased postoperatively, but it could not attain a statistical significance (p = 0.5). Abnormalities in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in primary hyperparathyroidism do occur, however these are inconsistent and do not recover in majority of patients even after 3 months of curative parathyroidectomy.

Assessment of embryonic growth in chicken eggs by means of visible transmission spectroscopy. During this work, it was investigated whether spectral measurements can be used to monitor embryonic growth. An experiment was conducted in which both the transmission spectra and embryonic weight were determined on 240 eggs (Cobb, 37 weeks) between Day 5 and Day 10 of incubation. The spectral data were linked to embryonic weight by means of a partial least squares analysis. Different preprocessing procedures were compared during this work, that is, smoothing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and first- and second-order derivative. Compared to the remainder of the preprocessing procedures, MSC leads to a considerable improvement of the prediction capability of the embryonic weight. The ratio of performance to deviation obtained for the MSC spectra equaled 4.5 indicating that a very accurate prediction of embryonic weight is feasible based on the VIS/NIR transmission measurements. Important regions for the prediction are situated around 685-740 nm. It is suggested that the spectral changes in these spectral regions result from the displacement of carotenoids from the yolk into the blood circuitry.

Histomorphologic and ultrastructural lesions of the pancreas in a porcine model of intra-abdominal hypertension. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome are increasingly observed in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IAH on pancreatic histology and ultrastructure in a porcine model. We examined 16 intubated and anesthetized domestic pigs with a mean body weight of 50.6 (SD, 3.8) kg. Using a CO2 pneumoperitoneum, the intra-abdominal pressure was increased to 30 mmHg for an investigation period of 6 or 12 h (each study group n = 6). In the control group, the intra-abdominal pressure remained 3.9 (SD, 5.4) mmHg for 12 h. Additional Ringer's solution was infused to maintain cardiac output at the level of controls. After the observation period, specimens were taken for histological and ultrastructural analysis, and animals were killed. Cardiac output did not change when compared with control. Histologically, mild- to moderate-grade necrosis was observed after 12 h of IAH. In the ultrastructural analysis, leukocyte infiltration and swelling of endothelial cells were found. In the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas, endoplasmic reticulum was dilated, and necrosis was noticed. Mitochondrial damage manifested as cisternal destruction with formation of large vacuoles. In this porcine model, 6 and 12 h of IAH resulted in light-microscopical and ultrastructural changes comparable to pancreatitis in humans. As SAP is often accompanied by IAH, the finding of the underlying study suggests a vicious cycle in which IAH may worsen pancreatitis. Ultimately, these findings are in favor of a decompression in patients with SAP and IAH.

Low-dose aspirin reduces gastro-protective properties of COX-2 selective inhibitors. We present the case of a patient taking aspirin and etoricoxib who was admitted with upper digestive haemorrhage due to duodenal ulcer. With this case we emphasize that the potential of the stomach-protecting properties of COX-2 selective inhibitors may be reduced in patients who are simultaneously taking aspirin. We also review several pathogenic mechanisms that have been advanced by animal studies to explain the finding that a COX-2 selective inhibitor plus low-dose aspirin leads to an ulcer rate near that of a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor alone.

Dual-tract transhepatic U-shaped hemodialysis inferior vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a swine model. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a U-shaped inferior vena cava (IVC) catheter entirely from a transhepatic approach and to determine the catheter caliber that would provide adequate flow for hemodialysis. Three pigs (weight, 45-50 kg) were used. A peripheral right hepatic vein was accessed transhepatically by using a 22-gauge needle, and a 0.018-inch wire was passed into the hepatic veins and IVC. An accessory right hepatic vein was accessed from the IVC. A snare was deployed in the accessory vein and used as a target for a second transhepatic 22-gauge needle pass. A wire was snared through the second transhepatic tract, around into the IVC, and through the first transhepatic tract. The 0.018-inch wire was upsized to a 0.035-inch platform. Measurements where made to tailor a U-shaped catheter from simple 10.2- and 12-F tubes by cutting them longitudinally (single long side hole) along the length of the IVC segment. The U-shaped hemodialysis catheter was placed over the wire and positioned so that the catheter opening lay in the IVC. With use of a dialysis machine, pressures and flow tolerance at set flow rates (100, 200, 300, 350, and 400 mL/min) were tested. All pigs underwent and survived successful catheter placements. All 10.2- and 12-F catheters tolerated flow rates up to 350 and 400 mL/min, respectively. Establishing a U-shaped hemodialysis catheter with an entirely transhepatic approach is technically feasible. The 10.2-F U-shaped dialysis catheters provided a flow rate (>350 mL/min) that is appropriate for hemodialysis in human clinical settings.

Effect of Dipsaci radix on hind limb muscle atrophy of sciatic nerve transected rats. It was reported that Dipsaci radix (DR) has a reinforcement effect on the bone-muscle dysfunction in the oriental medical classics and the experimental animal studies. The muscle atrophy was induced by unilateral transection of the sciatic nerve of the rats. Water-extract of DR was used as treatment once a day for 12 days. The muscle weights of the hind limb, atrophic changes, glycogen contents, compositions and cross-section areas of muscle fiber types in soleus and medial gastrocnemius were investigated. Muscle fiber type was classified to type-I and type-II with MHCf immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Bax and Bcl-2 expressions were observed with immunohistochemiatry. DR treatment significantly increased muscle weights of soleus, medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and posterior tibialis of the damaged hind limb. DR treatment reduced apoptotic muscle nuclei and hyaline-degenerated muscle fibers in soleus and medial gastrocnemius of the damaged hind limb. DR treatment also significantly increased glycogen contents in medial gastrocnemius of the damaged hind limb. DR treatment significantly attenuated the slow-to-fast shift in soleus of the damaged hind limb but not in medial gastrocnemius. DR treatment significantly increased cross-section areas of type-I and type-II fibers in soleus and medial gastrocnemius of the damaged hind limb. In soleus and medial gastrocnemius, DR treatment significantly reduced Bax positive muscle nuclei in the damaged hind limb. These results suggest that DR treatment has an anti-atrophic effect and an anti-apoptotic effect against myonuclear apoptosis induced by the peripheral nerve damage.

Overall survival benefit for weekly vs. three-weekly taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer: A meta-analysis. Taxanes have been extensively tested in patients with advanced breast cancer, but it is unclear whether their weekly use might offer any benefits against standard every three weeks administration. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared weekly and every three weeks taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer. The endpoints that we assessed were objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Efficacy data for paclitaxel and docetaxel were separately analyzed. Trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferences. Omicronbjective response rate was notably better when paclitaxel was used as every three weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, fixed effect model pooled RR 1.20 95%CI 1.08-1.32 p<0.001). No difference were found for PFS (6 studies, 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher among patients receiving weekly paclitaxel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fixed effect model pooled HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). No differences were observed for the weekly compared to the every three weeks use of docetaxel either for objective response, PFS and OS. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy were significantly lower in weekly taxanes schedules. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower in the every three weeks docetaxel regimens. Use of paclitaxel in weekly regimen give overall survival advantages compared with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benefit does not seem to stem from an increased potency of the drug with weekly regimens. The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

Genomic variation and neurohormonal intervention in heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is an important driver of heart-failure progression, and all pharmacologic interventions that improve heart-failure survival inhibit this systemic response to myocardial injury. Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) receptors in the kidney results in the release of plasma renin, the conversion of peptide precursors to angiotensin II (a2), and ultimately the production of aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antagonists all act by inhibiting the activity of critical protein of this core pathway: the beta(1) receptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase. Investigation of the pharmacogenetic interactions of the ACE D/I polymorphism and heart-failure therapy demonstrates the power of genomics to target therapeutics. This review explores how genetic variation in genes involved in neurohormonal activation influences heart-failure outcomes and the impact of pharmacotherapy.

Inflammation in atherosclerosis: from pathophysiology to practice. Until recently, most envisaged atherosclerosis as a bland arterial collection of cholesterol, complicated by smooth muscle cell accumulation. According to that concept, endothelial denuding injury led to platelet aggregation and release of platelet factors which would trigger the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial intima. These cells would then elaborate an extracellular matrix that would entrap lipoproteins, forming the nidus of the atherosclerotic plaque. Beyond the vascular smooth muscle cells long recognized in atherosclerotic lesions, subsequent investigations identified immune cells and mediators at work in atheromata, implicating inflammation in this disease. Multiple independent pathways of evidence now pinpoint inflammation as a key regulatory process that links multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis and its complications with altered arterial biology. Knowledge has burgeoned regarding the operation of both innate and adaptive arms of immunity in atherogenesis, their interplay, and the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that regulate their participation in atheroma formation and complication. This revolution in our thinking about the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis has now begun to provide clinical insight and practical tools that may aid patient management. This review provides an update of the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and highlights how translation of these advances in basic science promises to change clinical practice.

Utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation in radiation oncology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation among radiation oncologists in the United States. A random sample of 1,600 radiation oncologists was contacted by Internet, e-mail, and fax and questioned regarding the use of advanced imaging technologies, clinical applications, and future plans for use. Advanced imaging technologies were defined as any of the following that were directly incorporated into radiation therapy planning: MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT, 4-D CT, functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy. Of 1,089 contactable physicians, 394 (36%) responded. Of respondents, 65% were in private practice and 35% were in academic practice. The proportion using any advanced imaging technology for target delineation was 95%. However, the majority reported only rare (in <25% of their patients; 46.6%) or infrequent (in 25%-50% of their patients; 26.0%) utilization. The most commonly used technologies were 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET (76%), MRI (72%), and 4-D CT (44%). The most common cancers treated using image-guided target delineation were those of the lung (83%), central nervous system (79%), and head and neck (79%). Among users of advanced imaging technologies, 66% planned to increase use; 30% of nonusers planned to adopt these technologies in the future. Advanced imaging technologies are widely used by US radiation oncologists for target delineation. Although the majority of respondents used them in <50% of their patients, the frequency of utilization is expected to increase. Studies determining the optimal application of these technologies in radiation therapy planning are needed.

Maturation of kisspeptinergic neurons coincides with puberty onset in male rats. Kisspeptins, derived from the Kiss1 gene play a central role in activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis via stimulation of GnRH neurons. Both Kiss1 and Kiss1R (receptor) mRNA levels are found to be low in pre-pubertal rats, but whether an increase in kisspeptin and/or its receptor is the primary component in the initiation of puberty and where in the hypothalamus regulation of the kisspeptin/Kiss1R system occurs is unresolved. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we analyzed the level of Kiss1 mRNA and kisspeptin-immunoreactivity in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcuate nucleus of male rats along pubertal development. Neurons expressing Kiss1 mRNA were first detected at PND15, but increased significantly around puberty, and declined again in the adult rat. While virtually no immunoreactive cell bodies were detectable in the AVPV at any age, numerous kisspeptin-positive neurons in the arcuate nucleus were detected in the adult rat. Increasing doses of kisspeptin-54 given peripherally to male rats at PND15, 30, 45, and 60 evoked roughly similar effects, as revealed by the induction of c-Fos in the pituitary and secretion of LH and testosterone. These results show that both Kiss1 mRNA and the peptide increase in arcuate nucleus along pubertal maturation. Since kisspeptin signaling is potentially functional, even for peripheral activation, and well before the kisspeptin neuronal system is fully matured, our data support that the regulation of kisspeptin synthesis and release are key events in puberty onset in the male rat.

Sleep and physical functioning in family caregivers of older adults with memory impairment. Sleep disturbance is common in caregivers of older adults with memory disorders. Little is known, however, about the implications of caregivers' poor sleep with regard to their physical functioning. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between objectively measured sleep and self-reported physical functioning in 45 caregivers (mean age = 68.6 years) who completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36, and the Mini-mental State Examination, and wore an actigraph for at least three days. Our primary predictors were actigraphic sleep parameters, and our outcome was the SF-36 Physical Functioning subscale. In multivariate-adjusted linear regression analyses, each 30-minute increase in caregivers' total sleep time was associated with a 2.2-point improvement in their Physical Functioning subscale scores (unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.4, p = 0.001). In addition, each 10-minute increase in time awake after initial sleep onset was associated with a 0.5-point decrease on the Physical Functioning subscale, although this was not statistically significant (B = -0.5, 95% CI -1.1, 0.1, p = 0.09). Our findings suggest that shorter sleep duration is associated with worse self-reported physical functioning in caregivers. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether poor sleep predicts functional decline in caregivers.


Are all conservatives alike? A study of the psychological correlates of cultural and economic conservatism.

Low mindfulness predicts pain catastrophizing in a fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. The relationship between persistent pain and self-directed, non-reactive awareness of present-moment experience (i.e., mindfulness) was explored in one of the dominant psychological theories of chronic pain - the fear-avoidance model[53]. A heterogeneous sample of 104 chronic pain outpatients at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia completed psychometrically sound self-report measures of major variables in this model: Pain intensity, negative affect, pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, pain hypervigilance, and functional disability. Two measures of mindfulness were also used, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [4] and the Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [1]. Results showed that mindfulness significantly negatively predicts each of these variables, accounting for 17-41% of their variance. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that mindfulness uniquely predicts pain catastrophizing when other variables are controlled, and moderates the relationship between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing. This is the first clear evidence substantiating the strong link between mindfulness and pain catastrophizing, and suggests mindfulness might be added to the fear-avoidance model. Implications for the clinical use of mindfulness in screening and intervention are discussed.

Effects of compression/stretching of the spermatic cord and blunt dissection on testicular growth and fertility. This study was performed to investigate whether compression/stretching of the spermatic cord or blunt dissection influences testicular development and fertility. In addition, the authors evaluated whether the extents of testicular damage differ between these 2 surgical manipulations. Forty-four prepubertal male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc, Indianapolis, Ind) were divided into 3 groups: (1) the control group (CG) animals underwent a sham operation in the right groin, (2) the experimental group 1 (EG1) underwent compression/stretching of the right spermatic cord, and (3) the experimental group 2 (EG2) underwent dissection around the right spermatic cord structures. Testicular volumes, weights, mean seminiferous tubular diameters (MSTDs), mean testicular biopsy scores, and numbers of offspring and of pregnant females were evaluated. Right (operative) and left (nonoperative) testicular volumes were smaller in the EG2 group than in the CG or EG1 groups. Left MSTDs in the EG1 and EG2 groups increased more than in the CG group. Numbers of Sertoli cells in left testes differed in the 3 groups, in the order EG1 < CG < EG2. Mean testicular biopsy scores, offspring numbers, and pregnant female numbers were no different in the 3 groups. Both surgical manipulations influenced testicular growth, but they did not compromise spermatogenesis or fertility in SD rats.

Amino acid analysis. Amino acid analysis is used to determine the amino acid content of amino acid-, peptide- and protein-containing samples. With minor exceptions, proteins are long linear polymers of amino acids connected to each other via peptide bonds. The first step of amino acid analysis involves hydrolyzing these peptide bonds. The liberated amino acids are then separated, detected, and quantified. The method was first developed by Moore, Stein and coworkers in the 1950s using HCl acid hydrolysis, and, despite considerable effort by many workers, the basic methodology remains relatively unchanged. This unit provides an overview and strategic planning for amino acid analysis, discussing a range of methodologies and issues. In addition, several common methods used for analysis of L-amino acids are described in detail, including: HCl acid hydrolysis, performic acid oxidation for methionine and cysteine analysis, base hydrolysis for tryptophan analysis, analysis of free amino acids, and analysis of reactive lysine.

The evolutionary origin of the vertebrate neural crest and its developmental gene regulatory network--insights from amphioxus. The neural crest is an embryonic cell population unique to vertebrates. During vertebrate embryogenesis, neural crest cells are first induced from the neural plate border; subsequently, they delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate to their destination, where they differentiate into a wide variety of derivatives. The emergence of the neural crest is thought to be responsible for the evolution of many complex novel structures of vertebrates that are lacking in invertebrate chordates. Despite its central importance in understanding the origin of vertebrates, the evolutionary origin of the neural crest remains elusive. The basal chordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) occupies an outgroup position that is useful for investigating this question. In this review, I summarize recent genomic and comparative developmental studies between amphioxus and vertebrates and discuss their implications for the evolutionary origin of neural crest cells. I focus mainly on the origin of the gene regulatory network underlying neural crest development, and suggest several hypotheses regarding how this network could have been assembled during early vertebrate evolution.

Incremental prognostic values of serum tenascin-C levels with blood B-type natriuretic peptide testing at discharge in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. This study investigates the predictive value of serum tenascin-C (TN-C), which is observed at the active sites of ongoing tissue remodeling, for cardiac events of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this trial, 110 consecutive patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) resulting from DCM underwent assessments of serum TN-C and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at discharge and were followed up for 22.4 months. Cardiac function and hemodynamics were assessed invasively in 60 of these patients at discharge. There were 19 cardiac events (14 rehospitalizations, 3 deaths from refractory HF, and 2 sudden deaths) during follow-up. The average levels of TN-C and BNP were 73 +/- 38 ng/mL and 279 +/- 414 pg/mL, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for serum TN-C levels predicted cardiac events were >or=78.4 ng/mL, whereas BNP levels were >or=219 pg/mL. Patients with levels higher than this had significantly higher cardiac events and serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL had an incremental predictive power with BNP for cardiac events. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly larger, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated in patients with serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL. The combined index of serum levels for TN-C and BNP at discharge predicts cardiac events from decompensated HF. Additionally, elevated serum TN-C levels reflect left ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling in DCM patients.

Acid sphingomyelinase, cell membranes and human disease: lessons from Niemann-Pick disease. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) plays an important role in normal membrane turnover through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, and is one of the key enzymes responsible for the production of ceramide. ASM activity is deficient in the genetic disorder Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice were originally constructed to study this disorder, and numerous defects in ceramide-related signaling have been shown. Studies in these mice have further suggested that ASM may be involved in the pathogenesis of several common diseases through the reorganization of membrane microdomains. This review will focus on the role of ASM in membrane biology, with a specific emphasis on what a rare genetic disorder (NPD) has taught us about more common events.

Casein retention in curd and loss of casein into whey at chymosin-induced coagulation of milk. Impact of milk protein composition on casein (CN) retention in curd during the milk coagulation process was studied using a model cheese making system. Individual milk samples from 110 cows in mid lactation of the Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein breeds with known genotypes of beta-casein, kappa-casein and beta-lactoglobulin were defatted, coagulated with chymosin, subjected to syneresis and subsequent pressing simulated by centrifugation. The results indicated that kappa-casein concentration of milk plays an important role in the curd formation process and initial syneresis (whey after cutting), whereas an increased CN ratio was associated with less casein in whey after simulated pressing. Increased kappa-casein concentration of milk also characterized the milk samples with no measurable loss of casein in whey, compared with milk samples with casein lost in whey, both after cutting and after simulated pressing. Concentrations of alphas1-casein, beta-casein, and total casein in milk were positively associated with fresh curd yield, which showed a strong correlation with amount of casein retained in curd. No effect of protein genotype on fresh curd yield or casein in whey was found. The beta-lactoglobulin BB genotype was associated with increased casein retention in curd, most likely due to the association of this genotype with CN ratio.


Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of obstructive sleep apnea.

A sample preparation protocol for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance studies of water-soluble metabolites in blood and urine. We describe a general protocol for preparing protein-containing biofluids for (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic studies. In this protocol, untreated samples are diluted in deuterated solvents to precipitate proteins and recover metabolites quantitated relative to standard reference compounds such as 3-trimethylsilylpropionic acid (TSP) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS). The efficacy of this protocol was tested using a bovine serum albumin/metabolite mix and human serum samples. This sample preparation method can be readily applied to any protein-containing biofluid for (1)H NMR studies.

Factors involved in stress urinary incontinence 1 year after first delivery. The aim of the study was to investigate the risk factors involved in stress urinary incontinence (SUI) 1 year after first delivery. This was a longitudinal study of 352 primigravid women who gave birth at Donostia Hospital during 2007. Urinary symptoms were investigated (Abrams et al., Neurourol Urodyn 21:167-178, 2002) on inclusion and 1 year after delivery, and the incontinence severity index (ISI) was calculated. Incontinent women answered the International Consultation on Incontinence short form questionnaire. Pelvic floor muscle strength and joint hypermobility were evaluated. SUI affected 40 (11.4%) women 1 year after first delivery. The ISI distribution was: 62.5% slight, 32.5% moderate, 2.5% severe and 2.5% very severe. The only factor independently associated with SUI after delivery was the development of SUI during pregnancy (OR, 5.79; 95% CI, 2.79-12.00). The new onset of SUI during pregnancy is an independent risk factor for SUI in the postpartum period.

In vitro and in vivo characterization of glycoprotein C-deleted infectious laryngotracheitis virus. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an important respiratory disease of chickens that is caused by an alphaherpesvirus [infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV); Gallid herpesvirus 1]. As herpesvirus envelope glycoproteins are main targets of the humoral host immune response, they are of particular interest for development of vaccines, as well as of diagnostic tools. The conserved, N-glycosylated envelope protein gC has been identified as a major surface antigen of ILTV. To study the function of gC, we now isolated a gC-deleted ILTV recombinant as well as a gC rescuant after co-transfection of permissive chicken cells with virion DNA and transfer plasmids containing engineered subgenomic fragments. Like other alphaherpesvirus homologues, ILTV gC proved to be non-essential for replication. ILTV-DeltagC exhibited delayed penetration kinetics and slightly reduced plaque sizes in cultured chicken cells, whereas virus titres were not reduced significantly compared with wild-type or gC-rescued virus. In vivo studies revealed that ILTV-DeltagC is attenuated in chickens. However, infection with high doses of ILTV-DeltagC was still fatal for approximately 20 % of the animals, whereas wild-type or gC-rescued ILTV led to 50 % mortality. Interestingly, innate and specific immune responses against ILTV-DeltagC were not reduced but enhanced, and surviving chickens were protected completely against challenge infection. Furthermore, ILTV-DeltagC might serve as a basis for marker vaccines permitting differentiation between vaccinated and field-virus-infected animals, as gC-specific antibodies could be detected easily in sera of animals infected with wild-type ILTV.

Structural insight into unique properties of protoporphyrinogen oxidase from Bacillus subtilis. Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) converts protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, playing an important part in the heme/chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Bacillus subtilis PPO (bsPPO) is unique among PPO family members in that it is a soluble monomer, is inefficiently inhibited by the herbicide acifluorfen (AF) and has broader substrate specificity than other PPO enzymes. Here, we present the crystal structure of bsPPO bound to AF. Our structure shows that the AF molecule binds to a new site outside the previously identified inhibitor binding pocket. Most importantly, the benzene ring of the 2-nitrobenzoic acid moiety of AF lies parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD at a distance of less than 3.5A, providing a framework for the interaction of FAD with the substrate protoporphyrinogen IX. Furthermore, our structure reveals that the larger substrate binding chamber and predominantly positively charged chamber surface of bsPPO are more favorable for the binding of coproporphyrinogen-III. These crystallographic findings uncover biochemically unique properties of bsPPO, providing important information for further understanding the enzymatic mechanism.

Abnormal placental invasion--a novel approach to treatment case report and review.

A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.

Interleukin-1 gene -511 CT polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in a Polish population. Interleukin-1 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We genotyped IL-1beta (-511 C/T) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) common polymorphisms in a large case-controlled study in a Polish population. We included 332 patients with late-onset AD and 220 controls without any neurological deficit, cognitive complaints and history of neurological diseases, aged > or = 65 years. The distribution of the IL-1beta (-511 C/T) genotypes was similar to that in the controls (AD: C/C = 45.8%, C/T = 44.6%, T/T = 9.6% vs. controls: C/C = 53.9%, C/T = 38.3%, T/T = 7.3%, p > 0.05). Our study confirms previous reports that APOE epsilon4 is strongly related to the risk of AD (odds ratio = 6.60, 95% confidence interval 4.19-10.41). APOE status did not affect the distribution of the studied IL-1beta polymorphism. The IL-1beta (-511 C/T) polymorphism is not a risk factor for late-onset AD in a Polish population.

[Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) with vectors bearing genes of bacterial antigenes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis]. Transgenic plants of lettuce Lactuca sativa L. cv. Eralash, Sniezinka, Rubinovoje kruzevo with genes coding synthesis of tuberculosis antigenes have been obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Cotyledons of in vitro seedlings were used as the initial material for transformation with plasmids pCB063 (genes ESAT6, nptII) and pCB064 (genes ESAT6:AG85B(-TMD), nptII). PCR-analysis has shown the presence both selective and target genes in all plants analyzed. At the same time, the RT-PCR has shown that both the presence and the absence of a transcription of gene ESAT6 at a stable transcription of a gene nptII is possible.

Pierre Robin sequence: appearances and 25 years of experience with an innovative treatment protocol.

CK2 is a novel negative regulator of NADPH oxidase and a neuroprotectant in mice after cerebral ischemia. NADPH oxidase is a major complex that produces reactive oxygen species (ROSs) during the ischemic period and aggravates brain damage and cell death after ischemic injury. Although many approaches have been tested for preventing production of ROSs by NADPH oxidase in ischemic brain injury, the regulatory mechanisms of NADPH oxidase activity after cerebral ischemia are still unclear. In this study, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a critical modulator of NADPH oxidase and elucidated the role of CK2 as a neuroprotectant after oxidative insults to the brain. We found that the protein levels of the catalytic subunits CK2alpha and CK2alpha', as well as the total activity of CK2, are significantly reduced after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). We also found this deactivation of CK2 caused by ischemia/reperfusion increases expression of Nox2 and translocation of p67(phox) and Rac1 to the membrane after tFCI. Interestingly, we found that the inactive status of Rac1 was captured by the catalytic subunit CK2alpha under normal conditions. However, binding between CK2alpha and Rac1 was immediately diminished after tFCI, and Rac1 activity was markedly increased after CK2 inhibition. Moreover, we found that deactivation of CK2 in the mouse brain enhances production of ROSs and neuronal cell death via increased NADPH oxidase activity. The increased brain infarct volume caused by CK2 inhibition was restored by apocynin, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. This study suggests that CK2 can be a direct molecular target for modulation of NADPH oxidase activity after ischemic brain injury.

Disruption of the chitin synthase gene CHS1 from Fusarium asiaticum results in an altered structure of cell walls and reduced virulence. Natural resistance of wheat against Fusarium head blight (FHB) is inadequate and new strategies for controlling the disease are required. Chitin synthases that catalyze chitin biosynthesis would be an ideal target for antifungal agents. In this study, a class I chitin synthase gene (CHS1) from Fusarium asiaticum, the predominant species of FHB pathogens on wheat in China, was functionally disrupted via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Specific disruption of the CHS1 gene resulted in a 58% reduction of chitin synthase activity, accompanied by decreases of 35% in chitin content, 22% in conidiation, and 16% in macroconidium length. The Deltachs1 mutant strain had a growth rate comparable to that of the wild-type on PDA medium but had a 35% increase in the number of nuclear cellulae and exhibited a remarkably increased sensitivity to osmosis stresses. Electron microscopy revealed substantial changes occurring in cell wall structures of the macroconidium, ascospore, and mycelium, with the most profound changes in the mycelium. Furthermore, the Deltachs1 mutant displayed significantly reduced pathogenicity on wheat spikes and seedlings. Re-introduction of a functional CHS1 gene into the Deltachs1 mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotype. These results reveal an important in vivo role played by a CHS1 gene in a FHB pathogen whose mycelial chitin could serve as a target for controlling the disease.


Automated vs. conventional tractography in multiple sclerosis: variability and correlation with disability.

Pregnancy outcome after cervical conisation: a retrospective cohort study in the Leuven University Hospital. To assess pregnancy outcome after conisation. Retrospective cohort study. Belgium, data from a university hospital. Fifty-five pregnancies in 34 women after conisation, and 55 pregnancies in 54 women without a history of conisation or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Hospital data were reviewed and questionnaires were collected from 599 women who had a conisation in a 5-year period, among whom subsequent pregnancies were identified. The control group consisted of matched pregnancies of women without a history of conisation. Gestational age at delivery, neonatal biometry, neonatal condition at birth. Numbers of sexual partners (4.6 +/- 3.4 SD versus 2.5 +/- 2.5 SD) and ex-smokers were significantly higher in the study group compared with the control group. Gestational age at delivery (266 +/- 2 days versus 274 +/- 9 days), neonatal head circumference (33.9 +/- 2.5 cm, versus 34.6 +/- 2.5 cm) and birthweight (3088 +/- 754 g versus 3381 +/- 430 g) were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group. Numbers of preterm [<37 weeks; 14/55 (25%) versus 2/55 (4%); P = 0.002] and severe preterm (<34 weeks; 6/55 (11%) versus 0/55 (0%); P = 0.031] deliveries in the study group were significantly higher. There were no cases of perinatal mortality. Conisation affects obstetrical outcome after conisation for CIN. Babies tend to be born earlier and are smaller. It is not clear whether this is related to the procedure or to factors linked with CIN.

Inherited thrombophilia in infertile women: implication in unexplained infertility.

Effect of upper body aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness in older adults. The authors evaluated the effects of acute arm-cycling exercise on arterial stiffness of the brachial artery (BA: working limb) and posterior tibial artery (PTA: nonworking limb) in healthy older participants. Eleven participants were tested to evaluate BA and PTA stiffness. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and arterial stiffness indices of the BA and PTA measured by Doppler ultrasound were determined before and 10 min after graded arm-cycling exercise to volitional fatigue on 2 separate days. After the exercise, although BA diameter, brachial systolic BP, pulse pressure, and HR increased significantly (all p < .05), arterial stiffness indices of the BA remained unchanged. Similarly, arterial stiffness indices of the PTA remained unchanged after the exercise, whereas HR increased significantly (p < .05). These results show that acute arm-cycling exercise failed to modify arterial stiffness of the BA and PTA, suggesting that it has no systemic effect on arterial stiffness in healthy older adults.

Vaccines for enteric diseases: update on recent developments. The 5th International Conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases (VED) attracted more than 250 delegates, mainly from industrialized countries. A total of 56 papers were presented and 46 posters were displayed to update recent developments in the field of enteric diseases and vaccine development. This 3-day event enabled academic research institutions, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and international donors to get a sense of what has been going on since the last VED conference in 2007. Topical interests included typhoid and other salmonelloses, rotavirus, norovirus, Shigella spp., mucosal immunization and delivery, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and cholera.

A multiple camera tongue switch for a child with severe spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. The present study proposed a video-based access technology that facilitated a non-contact tongue protrusion access modality for a 7-year-old boy with severe spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS level 5). The proposed system featured a centre camera and two peripheral cameras to extend coverage of the frontal face view of this user for longer durations. The child participated in a descriptive case study. The participant underwent 3 months of tongue protrusion training while the multiple camera tongue switch prototype was being prepared. Later, the participant was brought back for five experiment sessions where he worked on a single-switch picture matching activity, using the multiple camera tongue switch prototype in a controlled environment. The multiple camera tongue switch achieved an average sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 80%. In three of the experiment sessions, the peripheral cameras were associated with most of the true positive switch activations. These activations would have been missed by a centre-camera-only setup. The study demonstrated proof-of-concept of a non-contact tongue access modality implemented by a video-based system involving three cameras and colour video processing.

Factors related to increased daytime sleepiness during the menopausal transition as evaluated by the Epworth sleepiness scale. Sleep disorders and sleep-apnea/hypopnea syndromes are very frequent in women, being misdiagnosed in many cases. The menopause, regardless of age, is associated to poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness that can lead to impaired quality of life, and reduced productivity and functioning. To assess daytime sleepiness and related risk factors among middle aged Ecuadorian women using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In this cross-sectional study 149 women aged 40-59 years were assessed for hot flush presence and intensity using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and requested to fill out the ESS and a questionnaire containing personal and partner data. Mean age of surveyed women was 47.6+/-5.5 years, with 67.8% having less than 12 years of schooling, 33.6% being postmenopausal, and 2.7% on hormone therapy. A 10.1% were current smokers and 20.8% were sedentary. According to the MRS (item 1) 51.7% presented hot flushes, which were graded as severe-very severe in 42.8% of cases. Regarding the partner (n=132), erectile dysfunction was present in 10.6%, premature ejaculation 6.1% and 17.4% abused alcohol. Mean total ESS score was 8+/-4.4 (median 8), with 33.6% considered having some degree of daytime sleepiness (ESS score >or=10). Logistic regression analysis determined that postmenopausal status (OR 6.58, CI 95% [2.51-17.23], p=0.001), sedentarism (OR 3.43, CI 95% [1.14-10.26], p=0.02) and hot flush presence (OR 2.61, CI 95% [1.02-6.65], p=0.04) among women were risk factors for increased daytime sleepiness (ESS total score >or=10) whereas partner faithfulness decreased this risk (OR 0.47, CI 95% [0.24-0.90], p=0.02). Increased daytime sleepiness in this middle aged series was related to female (hormonal status and sedentarism) and partner factors; several which are susceptible of intervention.

The timing of emotional discrimination in human amygdala and ventral visual cortex. Models of visual emotional perception suggest a reentrant organization of the ventral visual system with the amygdala. Using focused functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans with a sampling rate of 100 ms, here we determine the relative timing of emotional discrimination in amygdala and ventral visual cortical structures during emotional perception. Results show that amygdala and inferotemporal visual cortex differentiate emotional from nonemotional scenes approximately 1 s before extrastriate occipital cortex, whereas primary occipital cortex shows consistent activity across all scenes. This pattern of discrimination is consistent with a reentrant organization of emotional perception in visual processing, in which transaction between rostral ventral visual cortex and amygdala originates the identification of emotional relevance.


Estrogen receptor-alpha phosphorylation at serine-118 and tamoxifen response in breast cancer.

[Dyspraxia: landmarks]. Despite its frequency, little is known about dyspraxia. Dyspraxia, which represents disorders in development and learning movements, within the context of a deficiency in the management of spatial information (in children whose verbal intelligence is spared), is often a severe handicap at school and in social life. Dyspraxia must be distinguished from "common" difficulties of unmotivated children at school, with which it is often confused. Hence, the diagnosis must correspond to rigorous methodology. And one should avoid proposing endless training for the deficient action (writing, getting dressed...); indeed such strategies only lead to short-term 'pseudo' progress, without any long term efficacy on the educational success of these intelligent children. To the contrary, the child should be rapidly oriented in two therapeutic directions: (1) a battle between the "double-task" effect stemming from the graphical and spatial difficulties; (2) the use of palliatives (including computing). In conditions of early diagnosis (at 4-8/9 years of age) and well-coordinated management with the school, the prognosis would be excellent in terms of schooling, choice of a profession and social insertion. If not, or if (as is the case in almost a third of cases) dyspraxia is not isolated (associated with dyslexia, hyperactivity, attentional deficit and psychotic traits), the child should be oriented towards a specialised classroom and care.

[Ultrasound-guided intraarticular injection for MR arthrography of the shoulder]. To evaluate ultrasound guidance for intraarticular contrast injection via an anterolateral approach in comparison with fluoroscopic guidance. Contrast agent injection was performed in 40 consecutive patients, 20 under sonographic guidance and 20 under fluoroscopic guidance. None of the patients had previous shoulder surgery. The procedure time was measured and the efficiency of joint distension, incidence of extravasation and intraarticular air on the consecutive MR arthrograms were assessed by three blinded radiologists with musculoskeletal radiology experience. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Intraarticular contrast injection was successfully accomplished in all 40 patients. Subsequent MR arthrograms did not show any significant difference between sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance with respect to diagnostic quality, joint distension (p=0.6665), intraarticular air bubbles (p=0.1567) and occurrence of contrast extravasation (p=0.8565). The mean duration of ultrasound-guided injection was 7:30 min compared to a shorter procedure time of 4:15 min for fluoroscopic guidance. In both groups, no procedural complications were observed. Ultrasound-guided injection for MR arthrography of the shoulder via an anterolateral approach represents a simple, safe, and effective technique which yields comparable results to those of injection under fluoroscopic guidance, but is slightly more time-consuming.

Occurrence of apocrine secretion in the larval gut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti L., Anopheles albitarsis Lynch-Arribálzaga and Culex quinquefasciatus say (Diptera: Culicidae): a defense strategy against infection by Bacillus sphaericus Neide? Cell hypertrophy was the first reaction of the gut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti (L.), Anopheles albitarsis (Lynch-Arribálzaga) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) to the toxins of strains 2362 and S1116 of Bacillus sphaericus, as cells had an increase of intracellular secretory activity. Soon after the cell hypertrophy developed, vesicles were formed at the cell apical portion, which detached with the plasma membrane, characterizing a type of apocrine secretion like. The first pathway of contamination of the mosquito larvae by these bacteria is through the gut, by feeding. Depending on the species of Culicidae and on the bacterial strain used, the hypertrophy of the gut epithelium occurred between 5 and 15 min after exposure to the contaminated environment. The second aspect observed after hypertrophy was the increase in apocrine secretion. The basophilic vesicles that detached from the cells remained between the peritrophic membrane and the gut lumen, such vesicles were filled with material of unknown nature. The gut posterior region showed secretory activity in both control and treated larvae, being much more intense in bacteria-exposed larvae. There were remarkable differences in the epithelial cell reaction according to the toxins of the two bacterial strains, but C.quinquefasciatus was the most susceptible. Differences in the gut cell reactions to the toxins produced by the two bacterial strains are discussed.


Going green in Cryptococcus neoformans: the recycling of a selectable drug marker.

Enhanced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production via the coexpressed phaCAB and vgb genes controlled by arabinose P promoter in Escherichia coli. To develop an approach to enhance polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production via the coexpressed phaCAB and vgb genes controlled by arabinose P(BAD) promoter in Escherichia coli. The polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) synthesis operon, (phaCAB), from Ralstonia eutropha was overexpressed under the regulation of the arabinose P(BAD) promoter in Escherichia coli, and the vgb gene encoding bacterial haemoglobin from Vitreoscilla stercoraria (VHb) was further cloned at downstream of phaCAB to form an artificial operon. The cell dry weight (CDW), PHB content and PHB concentration were enhanced around 1.23-, 1.57-, and 1.93-fold in the engineered cell harbouring phaCAB-vgb (SY-2) upon 1% arabinose induction compared with noninduction (0% arabinose). Furthermore, by using a recombinant strain harbouring P(BAD) promoter-vgb along with native promoter-phaCAB construction, the effect of vgb expression level on PHB biosynthesis was positive correlation. The results exploit the possibility to improve the PHB production by fusing the genes phaCAB-vgb from different species under the arabinose regulation system in E. coli. It also demonstrates that increase in VHb level enhances the PHB production. We were successful in providing a new coexpressed system for PHB synthesis in E. coli. This coexpressed system could be regulated by arabinose inducer, and is more stable and cheaper than other induced systems (e.g. IPTG). Furthermore, it could be applied in many biotechnology or fermentation processes.

Critical role of TLR7 in the acceleration of systemic lupus erythematosus in TLR9-deficient mice. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that TLR7 and TLR9 play pathogenic and protective roles, respectively, in the development of murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the accelerated development of SLE resulting from the deletion of TLR9 and the respective contributions of TLR7 and TLR9 to the development of different autoimmune responses against nuclear and non-nuclear autoantigens implicated in lupus nephritis have not been well defined. In the present study, we addressed these questions by assessing the effect of the TLR9 and/or TLR7 deletion on the production of various autoantibodies and the development of lupus nephritis in C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2 (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2). TLR9-deficient B6.Nba2 mice displayed increased production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, serum retroviral gp70 and glomerular matrix antigens, and developed a markedly accelerated form of lupus nephritis. Enhanced disease was associated with functionally upregulated expression of TLR7, as documented by an increased TLR7-dependent activation of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Notably, disease exacerbation in TLR9-deficient mice was completely suppressed by the deletion of TLR7. Our results indicate that TLR7 has a pivotal role in a wide variety of autoimmune responses against DNA- and RNA-containing nuclear antigens, retroviral gp70 and glomerular matrix antigens implicated in murine SLE, and that enhanced TLR7 activity is critical for the accelerated development of SLE in TLR9-deficient lupus-prone mice.

Cloning and characterization of rat transient receptor potential-melastatin 4 (TRPM4). Transient receptor potential-melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a Ca(2+)-activated, but Ca(2+)-impermeable, cation channel. Increasing [Ca(2+)](i) induce current activation and reduction through TRPM4 channels. Several TRPM4 isoforms are expressed in mice and humans, but rat TRPM4 (rTRPM4) has not been previously identified. Here, we identified, cloned, and characterized two rTRPM4 isoforms, rTRPM4a and rTRPM4b, using 5'-RACE-PCR. rTRPM4b channel activity increased with [Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the rTRPM4b Ca(2+)-dependent activity at negative potentials differed from that of human TRPM4b (hTRPM4b), even though both represent full-length proteins. Additionally, rTRPM4b showed a slightly different single-channel current amplitude and open time distribution than hTRPM4b. However, rTRPM4a, which lacks the N-terminal region of rTRPM4b, and hTRPM4a had no similar functional channel activities. Furthermore, we characterized splicing regions, tissue distribution, and cellular localization of these isoforms. Unlike rTRPM4a, rTRPM4b was localized to the membrane at high levels, suggesting that rTRPM4b is the functionally active channel.

Familial occurrence of an association of multiple intestinal atresia and choanal atresia: a new syndrome? We report on two familial cases from a non-consanguineous marriage, presenting multiple intestinal and choanal atresia. Massive hydramnios and dilatation of the bowel were observed at 29 weeks of gestation during routine ultrasound scan of a healthy mother. The fetal karyotype was normal and cystic fibrosis screening was negative. Regular scans were performed throughout the pregnancy. The child was born at 34 weeks gestation. Choanal atresia was diagnosed at birth and abdominal investigations showed multiple atresia interesting both the small bowel and the colon. Further interventions were necessary because of recurrent obstructions. During the following pregnancy, a dilatation of the fetal intestinal tract was detected by ultrasonography at 27 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy was interrupted. Post-mortem examination of the fetus confirmed the stenosis of long segments of the small intestine associated with areas of colonic atresia. In both cases, histology and distribution were consistent with those reported in hereditary multiple intestinal atresia (HMIA). An association between multiple intestinal and choanal atresia has never been reported. We suggest it could correspond to a new autosomal recessive entity for which cytogenetic investigations and high-resolution array CGH revealed no visible anomalies.

Archaeological demography. Archaeological demography investigates the structure and dynamics of past human populations using evidence from traces of human activities and remnants of material culture in the archaeological record. Research in this field is interdisciplinary, incorporating findings from anthropology, paleogenetics, and human ecology but with a remit that extends beyond the primarily biological focus of paleodemography. Important questions addressed by archaeological demography include the establishment of methods for inferring past population structure, the timing of the emergence of modern human demographic systems, the relative importance of attritional and catastrophic patterns of mortality, and the search for adaptive explanations for demographic transitions, colonization events, and population extinctions. Archaeological evidence, including the extent of settlements and site catchment areas as well as measures of the exploitation, consumption, and discard of materials and artifacts, have traditionally been used as proxies for estimating past population size and density. In recent years this evidence has been supplemented by increasingly large data sets compiled from radiocarbon dating programs. These data sets have been used to investigate demographic waves of advance during continental-scale periods of colonization and cultural change and to detect episodes of population decline, extinction, and hiatuses in settlement history. By considering studies of human genetic diversity that indicate temporary but drastic reductions in effective population size, I hypothesize that catastrophic mortality may have had an important role in long-term population processes and may have limited long-term rates of growth, particularly in prehistoric populations.

Hydrolysis is stimulated by beta-adrenergic signalling to PKA that mediates phosphorylation of lipolytic enzymes, including hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). TAG resynthesis is associated with high-energy consumption, which when inordinate, leads to increased AMPK activity that acts to restrain hydrolysis of TAGs by inhibiting PKA-mediated activation of HSL. Here, we report that in primary mouse adipocytes, PKA associates with and phosphorylates AMPKalpha1 at Ser-173 to impede threonine (Thr-172) phosphorylation and thus activation of AMPKalpha1 by LKB1 in response to lipolytic signals. Activation of AMPKalpha1 by LKB1 is also blocked by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of AMPKalpha1 in vitro. Functional analysis of an AMPKalpha1 species carrying a non-phosphorylatable mutation at Ser-173 revealed a critical function of this phosphorylation for efficient release of free fatty acids and glycerol in response to PKA-activating signals. These results suggest a new mechanism of negative regulation of AMPK activity by PKA that is important for converting a lipolytic signal into an effective lipolytic response.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty using hydroxyapatite blocks for the treatment of vertebral body fracture.

Skin dose study of chest wall treatment with tomotherapy. The tangential-beam technique frequently presents challenges in homogeneity of radiation dose to the target. To ensure an adequate dose to the skin, a bolus is often used. Tomotherapy has already been shown to improve target conformity and homogeneity in other disease sites. Because of the tangential delivery technique and lack of flattening filter in TomoTherapy accelerators, we hypothesize that during chest wall irradiation using tomotherapy, the skin dose will be adequate without bolus. This study compares the dosimetric differences between tomotherapy chest wall irradiation and traditional linear accelerator-based tangential-beam technique. Tomotherapy treatment plans with and without bolus were compared with tangentialbeam plans. Plans were also generated for phantom studies, and point doses were measured using MOSFET dosimetry to verify the adequate skin dose. Monte Carlo simulations of static beams of both techniques were performed, and dosimetry was compared. Monte Carlo simulations and measurements confirmed that beams from tomotherapy deliver a higher skin dose than a standard linear accelerator. Skin dose also increases with the incident angle of the beams. Because of the characteristics of the tomotherapy beam and delivery technique, chest wall treatment plans from tomotherapy showed adequate skin dose [more than 75% of prescribed planning target volume (PTV) dose] even without bolus.

Are 1994 alcohol production and the sales deregulation policy in Japan associated with increased road traffic fatalities among adult and teenage males and females in Japan? International studies have shown a significant association between alcohol availability and traffic crashes that involve alcohol-impaired drivers. A key limitation to previous alcohol availability and motor vehicle crash (MVC) evaluation research is the assumption of population homogeneity in responding to the policies. The present analysis focuses on the evaluation of the impact of alcohol availability on different segments of the Japanese population by comparing MVC fatality rates from before and after implementation of the alcohol deregulation policy in 1994. Poisson regression with robust standard error was used to model the before-to-after change in incidence rate ratios (IRR) in adult males, adult females, teenage males and teenage females. To control potential confounders, unemployment rate, vehicle miles of travel (VMT), vehicle registration, and number of drivers licensed in Japan were added to the model. The exponents of the fitted coefficients are equivalent to incidence rate ratios. Implementation of the policy deregulating alcohol sales and production did not appear to increase traffic fatalities among adult or teenage males or females in Japan. We found that male adult fatalities demonstrated a statistically significant decline following enactment of the deregulation policy in 1994. Contrary to previous research, the findings of this study demonstrated lower rates of fatalities and higher compliance with alcohol-related driving legislation in Japanese society following implementation of the deregulation policy in 1994. Further well designed, nonaligned studies on alcohol availability and traffic fatalities in other countries are urgently needed.

Private costs almost equal health care costs when intervening in mild Alzheimer's: a cohort study alongside the DAISY trial. Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and affects about 25 million people worldwide. Recent studies have evaluated the effect of early interventions for dementia, but few studies have considered private time and transportation costs associated with the intervention. This study assessed the total economic costs associated with a multifaceted intervention for mild Alzheimer's disease, including an estimate of the ratio of public to private costs. The study sample comprised 163 dyads of patients and caregivers who received a multifaceted intervention of counselling sessions, courses and informational packages. The typical duration of the intervention was 7 months. A micro-costing approach was applied using prospectively collected data on resource utilisation that included estimates of participant time and transportation. Precision estimates were calculated using a bootstrapping technique and structural uncertainty was assessed with sensitivity analysis. The direct intervention cost was estimated at EUR 1,070 (95% CI 1,029;1,109). The total cost (including private costs) was estimated at EUR 2,020 (95% CI 1,929;2,106) i.e. the ratio of private to public costs was almost 1:1. Intervention for mild Alzheimer's disease can be undertaken at a relatively low cost to public funds. However, policy planners should pay attention to the significant private costs associated with an intervention, which may ultimately pose a threat to equity in access to health care.

Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based on an unlikely clinical probability by the Wells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: a meta-analysis.

Global gene expression analysis of rodent motor neurons following spinal cord injury associates molecular mechanisms with development of postinjury spasticity. Spinal cord injury leads to severe problems involving impaired motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. After spinal injury there is an initial phase of hyporeflexia followed by hyperreflexia, often referred to as spasticity. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between the reappearance of endogenous plateau potentials in motor neurons and the development of spasticity after spinalization. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased excitability of motor neurons and the return of plateau potentials below a spinal cord injury we investigated changes in gene expression in this cell population. We adopted a rat tail-spasticity model with a caudal spinal transection that causes a progressive development of spasticity from its onset after 2 to 3 wk until 2 mo postinjury. Gene expression changes of fluorescently identified tail motor neurons were studied 21 and 60 days postinjury. The motor neurons undergo substantial transcriptional regulation in response to injury. The patterns of differential expression show similarities at both time points, although there are 20% more differentially expressed genes 60 days compared with 21 days postinjury. The study identifies targets of regulation relating to both ion channels and receptors implicated in the endogenous expression of plateaux. The regulation of excitatory and inhibitory signal transduction indicates a shift in the balance toward increased excitability, where the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex together with cholinergic system is up-regulated and the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor system is down-regulated. The genes of the pore-forming proteins Cav1.3 and Nav1.6 were not up-regulated, whereas genes of proteins such as nonpore-forming subunits and intracellular pathways known to modulate receptor and channel trafficking, kinetics, and conductivity showed marked regulation. On the basis of the identified changes in global gene expression in motor neurons, the present investigation opens up for new potential targets for treatment of motor dysfunction following spinal cord injury.

Effects of 17beta-estradiol on glutamate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in the rat medial vestibular nuclei. We investigated the effects of the neurosteroid 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) on the evoked and spontaneous activity of rat medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons in brainstem slices. E(2) enhances the synaptic response to vestibular nerve stimulation in type B neurons and depresses the spontaneous discharge in both type A and B neurons. The amplitude of the field potential, as well as the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and current (EPSC), in type B neurons, are enhanced by E(2). Both effects are long-term phenomena since they outlast the drug washout. The enhancement of synaptic response is mainly due to facilitation of glutamate release mediated by pre-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), since the reduction of paired pulse ratio (PPR) and the increase of miniature EPSC frequency after E(2) are abolished under D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5). E(2) also facilitates post-synaptic NMDARs, but it does not affect directly alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and group I-metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs-I). In contrast, the depression of the spontaneous discharge of type A and type B neurons appears to depend on E(2) modulation of intrinsic ion conductances, as the effect remains after blockade of glutamate, GABA and glycine receptors (GlyRs). The net effect of E(2) is to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the synaptic response in type B neurons, relative to resting activity of all MVN neurons. These findings provide evidence for a novel potential mechanism to modulate the responsiveness of vestibular neurons to afferent inputs, and so regulate vestibular function in vivo.


Toxicity analysis of postoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Dissection of combinatorial control by the Met4 transcriptional complex. Met4 is the transcriptional activator of the sulfur metabolic network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lacking DNA-binding ability, Met4 must interact with proteins called Met4 cofactors to target promoters for transcription. Two types of DNA-binding cofactors (Cbf1 and Met31/Met32) recruit Met4 to promoters and one cofactor (Met28) stabilizes the DNA-bound Met4 complexes. To dissect this combinatorial system, we systematically deleted each category of cofactor(s) and analyzed Met4-activated transcription on a genome-wide scale. We defined a core regulon for Met4, consisting of 45 target genes. Deletion of both Met31 and Met32 eliminated activation of the core regulon, whereas loss of Met28 or Cbf1 interfered with only a subset of targets that map to distinct sectors of the sulfur metabolic network. These transcriptional dependencies roughly correlated with the presence of Cbf1 promoter motifs. Quantitative analysis of in vivo promoter binding properties indicated varying levels of cooperativity and interdependency exists between members of this combinatorial system. Cbf1 was the only cofactor to remain fully bound to target promoters under all conditions, whereas other factors exhibited different degrees of regulated binding in a promoter-specific fashion. Taken together, Met4 cofactors use a variety of mechanisms to allow differential transcription of target genes in response to various cues.

Mutational analysis of active-site residues in the Mycobacterium leprae RecA intein, a LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease: Asp(122) and Asp(193) are crucial to the double-stranded DNA cleavage activity whereas Asp(218) is not. Mycobacterium leprae recA harbors an in-frame insertion sequence that encodes an intein homing endonuclease (PI-MleI). Most inteins (intein endonucleases) possess two conserved LAGLIDADG (DOD) motifs at their active center. A common feature of LAGLIDADG-type homing endonucleases is that they recognize and cleave the same or very similar DNA sequences. However, PI-MleI is distinctive from other members of the family of LAGLIDADG-type HEases for its modular structure with functionally separable domains for DNA-binding and cleavage, each with distinct sequence preferences. Sequence alignment analyses of PI-MleI revealed three putative LAGLIDADG motifs; however, there is conflicting bioinformatics data in regard to their identity and specific location within the intein polypeptide. To resolve this conflict and to determine the active-site residues essential for DNA target site recognition and double-stranded DNA cleavage, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of presumptive catalytic residues in the LAGLIDADG motifs. Analysis of target DNA recognition and kinetic parameters of the wild-type PI-MleI and its variants disclosed that the two amino acid residues, Asp(122) (in Block C) and Asp(193) (in functional Block E), are crucial to the double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity, whereas Asp(218) (in pseudo-Block E) is not. However, despite the reduced catalytic activity, the PI-MleI variants, like the wild-type PI-MleI, generated a footprint of the same length around the insertion site. The D122T variant showed significantly reduced catalytic activity, and D122A and D193A mutations although failed to affect their DNA-binding affinities, but abolished the double-stranded DNA cleavage activity. On the other hand, D122C variant showed approximately twofold higher double-stranded DNA cleavage activity, compared with the wild-type PI-MleI. These results provide compelling evidence that Asp(122) and Asp(193) in DOD motif I and II, respectively, are bona fide active-site residues essential for DNA cleavage activity. The implications of these results are discussed in this report.


Experimental detection of subcutaneous contrast extravasation using radio frequency permittivity sensing.

Hepatocyte growth factor--a new marker for prognosis in acute coronary syndrome. This study was designed to check the properties of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a new marker of myocardial necrosis. In one hundred and four patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), plasma human HGF (hHGF) concentrations were assessed twice, i.e. just after admission to hospital and 24 h afterwards. The primary composite endpoint was assessed at three-month follow-up. The maximal concentration of hHGF (1902 pg/ml) was reached at the time of admission to hospital due to ACS with significant decrease 24 h after the first measurement (705 pg/ml p < 0.0001). hHGF levels in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were higher than in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and in patients who reached composite primary endpoint (33 patients-4211 pg/ml) vs. event-free 71 patients (1013 pg/ml p < 0.01). The correlation between values of hHGF and N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I was revealed. HGF is a very early, good marker of myocardial necrosis and a sensitive short- and long-term prognostic factor in ACS.

Multiple markers and multiple individuals refine true seal phylogeny and bring molecules and morphology back in line. Despite decades of study, some aspects of Phocidae (Pinnipedia, Carnivora) phylogeny still remain unresolved. Using the largest novel dataset to date, including all extant phocids and comprising 15 nuclear and 13 mitochondrial genes, we illustrate the utility of including multiple individuals per species in resolving rapid radiations, and provide new insight into phocid phylogeny. In line with longstanding morphological views, Pusa is recovered as monophyletic for the first time with genetic data. The data are also used to explore the relationship between genetic distance and taxonomic rank. Intraspecific sampling also highlights the discrepancy between molecular and morphological rates of evolution within Phocidae.

Inhibitory activity of Brazilian green propolis components and their derivatives on the release of cys-leukotrienes. The effects of Brazilian green propolis ethanol extract on Cry j1-induced cys-leukotrienes and histamine release from peripheral leukocytes of patients with allergic rhinitis were investigated. One of the key mechanisms for the anti-allergic properties of the extract was revealed to be the suppression of cys-LTs release. Furthermore, a series of propolis components and their phenethyl esters were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of cys-LTs release. Artepillin C, baccharin, and kaempferide were the major active components of the ethanol extract. The inhibitory activity of artepillin C phenethyl ester was comparable to that of existing LT synthesis inhibitors.

The control of long-term memory: brain systems and cognitive processes. This paper provides a selective review of controlled memory retrieval, i.e., processes, that operate on long-term stored information in the service of current goals and task demands. Binding mechanisms that combine fragments of long-term stored information in response to a retrieval cue, are central for the understanding of the interaction between a retrieval cue and memory-stored information. The paper summarizes empirical evidence showing that ERP slow waves are highly sensitive to the initiation and maintenance of retrieval orientations. It is argued that similar mechanisms of controlled memory retrieval operate in the service of successful remembering and the suppression of unwanted memories (forgetting). The mechanisms can be grouped into two classes: those that enhance retrieval cue processing (cue bias) and those that directly act on memory representations and modulate their accessibility (target bias). From a neuroanatomical point of view, the former class of processes reflects selection mechanisms for internal actions that rely on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the second class of processes can be identified with selective attention mechanisms for which the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays an important role.

Nicotine improves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits in Morris water maze in rats. Ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A) is a neurotoxic derivative of choline that produces not only long-term presynaptic cholinergic deficits, but also various memory deficits in rats similar to some characteristics observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. This study investigated whether nicotine (NCT) administration attenuated spatial learning deficits induced by intracerebroventricular AF64A treatment. AF64A (6 nmol/6 microl)-or saline (SAL)-treated rats were trained in Morris water maze task. NCT (0.025-0.25mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected 5 min before the training every day. The results showed that moderate dose (0.10mg/kg) of NCT attenuated AF64A-induced prolongation of escape latency. Furthermore, NCT dose-dependently recovered the AF64A-induced decrease of time spent in the target quadrant in the probe test. These results suggest that NCT improves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits, and thus it is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of memory deficits in dementia.

Outcomes of diarrhea management in operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Among deployed U.S. military personnel, a sub-population of international travelers, acute infectious diarrhea continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and a potential threat to military effectiveness. To assess outcomes and satisfaction of diarrhea management in the field, a systematic survey was given to military personnel during mid- or post-deployment from Iraq or Afghanistan, from January through August 2004. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed reported at least one episode of diarrhea, while less than half sought care for their symptoms. Overall, trends of decreased post-treatment duration were noted as traveler's diarrhea therapy modalities grew more complex, controlling for severity of illness at presentation. Among those reporting diarrhea, the greatest level of satisfaction was seen in treatment with IV fluids (59%) followed by antibiotics (46%) and loperamide (40%). The greatest amount of dissatisfaction was seen in treatments with oral fluids only. While current standard of care is self-treatment of diarrhea in civilian travelers, the U.S. military lacks standards outlining self-treatment of personnel at the individual level. Further research is needed to develop treatment guidelines on diarrhea management during military deployment.

Living donor liver graft salvage after rupture of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm (HAP) is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of liver transplantation (LTx). It is often associated with a local infection. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are necessary. We report the first occurrence of such complication in the setting of adult living donor liver transplant. A 48-year-old female with primary sclerosing cholangitis underwent living donor right lobe LTx. Her postoperative course was uneventful. A month later, she developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding, with negative endoscopy and angiography. She rebled 2 weeks later, and an HAP was shown on angiography. On exploration, she was found to have an HAP caused by bile leakage from an accessory bile duct and a dissection of the native artery, likely a result of the angiography. The liver was revascularized using a cadaveric iliac artery conduit between the donor hepatic artery and the aorta, and the hepaticojejunostomy was reconstructed. Biliary complications are the most frequent complications in living donor LTx. A clinically silent bile leak can cause an HAP, resulting in massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Surgical repair and biliary reconstruction can yield an excellent clinical result.

Suppression of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamottin via the inhibition of protein kinase Cdelta/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of bergamottin, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor from Citrus paradis (grapefruit), on tumor invasion and migration and the possible mechanisms involved in this inhibition were investigated in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. Bergamottin reduced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced activation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and further inhibited cell invasion and migration. Bergamottin suppressed PMA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 protein, mRNA and transcription activity levels through suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation without changing the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 level. Bergamottin also reduced PMA-enhanced MMP-2 expression through suppression of membrane-type 1 MMP, but did not alter tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 levels. Bergamottin inhibited PMA-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and IkappaBalpha degradation, which are upstream of PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion. Furthermore, bergamottin strongly repressed the PMA-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are dependent on the protein kinase C-delta pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the anti-invasive effects of bergamottin might occur through inhibition of protein kinase C-delta, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and JNK phosphorylation and reduction of NF-kappaB activation, leading to downregulation of MMP-9 expression. These results suggest that the suppression of MMP expression contributes, at least in part, to the antitumor activity of bergamottin.

Drug-related damage of the ageing gastrointestinal tract. Drug use increases with age and the elderly is at increased risk of adverse drug reactions. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are one of the most often reported. Serious event are mostly caused by NSAIDs and/or aspirin which are the most widely prescribed medications in the world. NSAIDs and/or aspirin use are associated with complications from both the upper and the lower gastrointestinal tract. The risk of these complications depends on presence of risk factors, and age is the most frequent and relevant one. At-risk patients should be on prevention strategies including the use of the lowest effective dose, co-therapy with a gastroprotective agents or use of a COX-2 selective agent. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is beneficial in patients starting therapy with these agents, especially in the presence of ulcer history. The best strategy to prevent lower GI complications has yet to be defined.

Receptors and ligands implicated in human T cell costimulatory processes. It is well established that full activation of T cells that recognize antigens requires additional signals. These second signals are generated by the interaction of costimulatory ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells with their receptors on T cells. In addition, T cell activation processes are negatively regulated by inhibitory costimulatory pathways. Interaction of members of the B7 and the TNF superfamilies with members of the CD28 and TNF-R-superfamilies plays major roles in costimulatory processes. However, a large number of molecules that do not belong to these families have been reported to be involved in the generation of T cell costimulatory signals. In addition to well-defined costimulatory pathways, where both receptors and ligands are known, there are many T cell surface molecules that have been described to generate a second signal under certain experimental conditions, f.i. when ligated with antibodies. Furthermore there are several ligands that have been shown to positively or negatively modulate T cell activation by interacting with as of yet unknown T cell receptors. Here we give a comprehensive overview of molecules that have been implicated in human T cell activation processes and propose criteria that define genuine T cell costimulatory pathways.

Population genetic structure of economically important Tortricidae (Lepidoptera) in South Africa: a comparative analysis. Comparative studies of the population genetic structures of agricultural pests can elucidate the factors by which their population levels are affected, which is useful for designing pest management programs. This approach was used to provide insight into the six Tortricidae of major economic importance in South Africa. The population genetic structure of the carnation worm E. acerbella and the false codling moth T. leucotreta, analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, is presented here for the first time. These results were compared with those obtained previously for the codling moth Cydia pomonella, the oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta, the litchi moth Cryptophlebia peltastica and the macadamia nut borer T. batrachopa. Locally adapted populations were detected over local geographic areas for all species. No significant differences were found among population genetic structures as result of population history (whether native or introduced) although host range (whether oligophagous or polyphagous) had a small but significant effect. It is concluded that factors such as dispersal ability and agricultural practices have the most important effects on genetically structuring populations of the economically important Tortricidae in South Africa.


Pregnancy impairs baroreflex control of heart rate in rats: role of insulin sensitivity.

Can patient-written comments help explain patient satisfaction with food quality? This study identified themes in patient-written comments about meals served in a hospital and determined the relationship of those themes to patient food-quality satisfaction ratings among medical and surgical patients. Data from 2 years of quantitative Press Ganey patient-satisfaction ratings and qualitative comments related to meals by 1,077 patients discharged from a Midwest urban medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Themes in comments were identified. Results indicated that patient satisfaction with food quality did not differ based on sex or age, but did differ based on length of stay, perceived health status, and whether a patient provided written comments or not. The most common comments focused on the temperature of hot food, receiving what was ordered, and satisfaction with foodservice staff. The tenor of comments differed by food-quality rating given. Overall food quality rating was best predicted by food-related comments rather than comments about staff, or other issues not addressed in the Press Ganey quantitative questionnaire.

[Evaluation of the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment]. Treatment of breast cancer generally involves quadrantectomy and mastectomy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on indication. The object of the present study was to verify the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment and the influence of the type of surgery (quadrantectomy and mastectomy). A total of 90 women submitted to surgery for breast cancer in the Region of Catanduva, Brazil and a control group of 20 women without surgical compromise were evaluated. The extents of bilateral flexion and abduction movements of the shoulders were assessed by goniometry. The non-matched student t-test and Fisher exact test were utilized for statistical analysis with an alpha error of up to 5% being considered acceptable. Differences of 20 degrees or more in the extent of movement of the shoulders of women submitted to surgery were seen in 47.7% of the cases for flexion and in 56.6% for abduction. The compromise to the movement of the shoulder in the control group was less than 20 degrees in 9 (45%) of the women. On comparing the incidence of alterations in the movements of the arms of women submitted to surgery with the control group, a significant difference was identified for both limbs (p-value < 0.01). The articular mobility of both arms of patients submitted to treatment for breast cancer can be affected.

High species richness of Chironomidae (Diptera) in temporary flooded wetlands associated with high species turn-over rates. Species richness and species turn-over of Chironomidae was studied in irregularly flooded wetlands of the River Dalälven flood-plains in central Sweden. The chironomid fauna, sampled with emergence traps in six wetlands over six summers, contained as much as 135 species, and the cumulative species curves indicated that the regional species pool contain several more species. Recurrent irregular floods may have induced this high chironomid species richness and the high species turn-over in the temporary wetlands, as the dominance between terrestrial and aquatic species shifted between years. Half of the wetlands were treated with Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) against larvae of the flood-water mosquito Aedes sticticus. These treatments had no significant effect on chironomid species richness, but there was a higher species turn-over between years of primarily low abundance species in the treated wetlands. The cumulative number of species was also higher in the Bti-treated experimental wetlands than in the untreated reference wetlands. Thus, Bti treatment against mosquito larvae seemed to have only small effects on chironomid species richness but seemed to increase the colonisation-extinction dynamics.


Prenatal alcohol exposure alters phosphorylation and glycosylation of proteins in rat offspring liver.

Docking of calcium ions in proteins with flexible side chains and deformable backbones. A method of docking Ca(2+) ions in proteins with flexible side chains and deformable backbones is proposed. The energy was calculated with the AMBER force field, implicit solvent, and solvent exposure-dependent and distance-dependent dielectric function. Starting structures were generated with Ca(2+) coordinates and side-chain torsions sampled in 1000 A(3) cubes centered at the experimental Ca(2+) positions. The energy was Monte Carlo-minimized. The method was tested on fourteen Ca(2+)-binding sites. For twelve Ca(2+)-binding sites the root mean square (RMS) deviation of the apparent global minimum from the experimental structure was below 1.3 and 1.7 A for Ca(2+) ions and side-chain heavy atoms, respectively. Energies of multiple local minima correlate with the RMS deviations from the X-ray structures. Two Ca(2+)-binding sites at the surface of proteinase K were not predicted, because of underestimation of Ca(2+) hydration energy by the implicit-solvent method.

What is a "good outcome" in psychotherapy? A qualitative exploration of former patients' point of view. The aim of this study was to explore how former psychotherapy patients characterize "good outcome" after having completed treatment that they described as successful, in the sense that therapy had changed their lives in ways that made a difference. Semistructured qualitative depth interviews were conducted with 10 former psychotherapy patients. A hermeneutical-phenomenological approach was used to analyse interview transcripts. The former patients' descriptions of good outcome clustered around four themes: establishing new ways of relating to others; less symptomatic distress, or changes in behavioural patterns contributing to suffering; better self-understanding and insight; and accepting and valuing oneself. Interrelationships between the four components of good outcome, along with limitations and implications of the study, are discussed.

Short-chain fatty acids act as antiinflammatory mediators by regulating prostaglandin E(2) and cytokines. To investigate the effect of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), cytokines and chemokines in human monocytes. Human neutrophils and monocytes were isolated from human whole blood by using 1-Step Polymorph and RosetteSep Human Monocyte Enrichment Cocktail, respectively. Human GPR41 and GPR43 mRNA expression was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The calcium flux assay was used to examine the biological activities of SCFAs in human neutrophils and monocytes. The effect of SCFAs on human monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied by measuring PGE(2), cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant. The effect of SCFAs in vivo was examined by intraplantar injection into rat paws. Human GPR43 is highly expressed in human neutrophils and monocytes. SCFAs induce robust calcium flux in human neutrophils, but not in human monocytes. In this study, we show that SCFAs can induce human monocyte release of PGE(2) and that this effect can be enhanced in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, we demonstrate that PGE(2) production induced by SCFA was inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a receptor-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, SCFAs can specifically inhibit constitutive monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) production and LPS-induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in human monocytes without affecting the secretion of other cytokines and chemokines examined. Similar activities were observed in human PBMC for the release of PGE(2), MCP-1 and IL-10 after SCFA treatment. In addition, SCFAs inhibit LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in human PBMC. Finally, we show that SCFAs and LPS can induce PGE(2) production in vivo by intraplantar injection into rat paws (P < 0.01). SCFAs can have distinct antiinflammatory activities due to their regulation of PGE(2), cytokine and chemokine release from human immune cells.

Abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1 immunoreactive brain nuclei in rats. Abdominal surgery-induced postoperative gastric ileus is well established to induce Fos expression in specific brain nuclei in rats within 2-h after surgery. However, the phenotype of activated neurons has not been thoroughly characterized. Nesfatin-1 was recently discovered in the rat hypothalamus as a new anorexigenic peptide that also inhibits gastric emptying and is widely distributed in rat brain autonomic nuclei suggesting an involvement in stress responses. Therefore, we investigated whether abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the rat brain. Two hours after abdominal surgery with cecal palpation under short isoflurane anesthesia or anesthesia alone, rats were transcardially perfused and brains processed for double immunohistochemical labeling of Fos and nesfatin-1. Abdominal surgery, compared to anesthesia alone, induced Fos expression in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Double Fos/nesfatin-1 labeling showed that of the activated cells, 99% were nesfatin-1-immunoreactive in the SON, 91% in the LC, 82% in the rRPa, 74% in the EW and VLM, 71% in the anterior parvicellular PVN, 47% in the lateral magnocellular PVN, 41% in the medial magnocellular PVN, 14% in the NTS and 9% in the medial parvicellular PVN. These data established nesfatin-1 immunoreactive neurons in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem as part of the neuronal response to abdominal surgery and suggest a possible implication of nesfatin-1 in the alterations of food intake and gastric transit associated with such a stressor.


Chromatin states of core pluripotency-associated genes in pluripotent, multipotent and differentiated cells.

Maternal and young child nutrition adversely affected by external shocks such as increasing global food prices. Rising food prices, resulting from the ongoing global economic crisis, fuel price volatility, and climate change, have an adverse impact upon the poor, especially those in food-importing, resource-limited countries. The conventional approach by large organizations has been to advocate for increased staple crop yields of mainly cereals. High food prices are predicted to continue to at least 2015. Past shocks and their known impacts upon nutrition were reviewed. Price instability and increases have long been an existing global problem, which has been exacerbated by recent macroeconomic shocks such as acute emergencies due to war and civil strife, acute climatic events, increase in food prices, fuel price volatility, dysfunction of the global financial systems, long-term climate change, and the emergence of failed states. The FAO estimated that there were 815 million "hungry" people in 2006, with a now additional 75-135 million with increased vulnerability, and currently it is estimated that there are one billion people at risk of food insecurity. The shocks initially compromise maternal and child nutrition, mainly through a reduction in dietary quality and an increase in micronutrient deficiencies and concomitant increases in infectious disease morbidity and mortality. A further reduction in the quantity of diet may follow with greater underweight and wasting. Recent macroeconomic shocks have greatly increased the number of people who are vulnerable to hunger in developing countries. Nutritional surveillance systems need to be strengthened and expanded to inform policy decisions.

Differences in abdominal muscle activation patterns of younger and older adults performing an asymmetric leg-loading task. To determine whether differences exist between younger (20-50 years) and older adults (>65 years) in abdominal muscle amplitudes, temporal patterns, and three-dimensional (3D) pelvic motion, while performing an asymmetric leg-loading task. Cross-sectional. Neuromuscular function laboratory. Ten healthy younger (33.3 +/- 7.7 years) and 10 healthy gender- and body mass index-matched older adults (69.0 +/- 6.6 years). Surface electromyograms from 6 abdominal muscle sites bilaterally and pelvic motions were simultaneously recorded. Root mean square (RMS) amplitude during the leg extension phase was calculated for each muscle. Ensemble average waveforms for the total exercise were analyzed using principal component (PC) analysis. Total angular displacement of the pelvis was calculated. Student t tests were performed on demographic and angular displacement data. Three-factor mixed model analysis of variances (group, muscle, side) tested main effects and interactions (P < .05) for the RMS amplitude and PC scores from the temporal waveforms. Bonferroni post-hoc analyses tested pair-wise differences. There were no between-group differences for the pelvic motions. Three PC patterns captured 85% of the variance in the waveforms. The external oblique (EO) RMS amplitudes were significantly (P < .05) higher than those of the other 3 muscle sites, similar for the PC1 scores which captured overall amplitude. The PC2 score for the internal oblique (IO) was significantly higher (P < .05) than that of all other muscles, illustrating a higher initial amplitude compared with later in the movement. There was a significant group by muscle interaction for PC3 scores, demonstrating group differences in temporal patterns. Both groups were able to minimize lumbopelvic motion and recruited their abdominal muscles to similar overall amplitudes, with the IO muscle activated to higher amplitudes early in the movement task. The older adult group demonstrated a distinctive drop in abdominal activity during the leg-lowering phase of the exercise and less symmetry among muscle sites.

Dunaliella as an attractive candidate for molecular farming.

Galectin-1-asialofetuin interaction is inhibited by peptides containing the tyr-xxx-tyr motif acting on the glycoprotein. Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a ubiquitous beta-galactoside-binding protein expressed by various normal and pathological tissues, has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in consequence of its regulatory role in adhesion, cell viability, proliferation, and angiogenesis. The functions of Gal-1 depend on its affinity for beta-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates; accordingly, the inhibition of sugar binding blocks its functions, hence promising potential therapeutic tools. The Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptide motifs have been reported to be glycomimetic sequences, mainly on the basis of their inhibitory effect on the Gal-1-asialofetuin (ASF) interaction. However, the results regarding the efficacy of the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr motif as a glycomimetic inhibitor are still controversial. The present STD and trNOE NMR experiments reveal that the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides studied do not bind to Gal-1, whereas their binding to ASF is clearly detected. (15)N,(1)H HSQC titrations with (15)N-labeled Gal-1 confirm the absence of any peptide-Gal-1 interaction. These data indicate that the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides tested in this work are not glycomimetics as they interact with ASF via an unrevealed molecular linkage.


Bilateral mechanical-pain sensitivity over the trigeminal region in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain.

[Strategy in diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases]. Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are the most frequent metabolic disorders. They have in common a respiratory chain deficiency. Clinical presentation of MD is very heterogeneous and the major physiological functions may be affected. Diagnosis is complex due to the potential involvement of two genomes (nuclear or mitochondrial DNA), the large number of candidate genes to screen and the small number of patients reported for each type of MD. Clinical presentation, trait of inheritance, cerebral imaging (MRI and CT-Scan) and specialized biochemical investigations are good indicators, but identification of causing mutation(s) is the clue to confirm diagnosis. Task is huge and progress in diagnosis of MD should come from genotype-phenotype correlations studies and from major technical improvements in molecular diagnosis. Exhaustive study of mitochondrial DNA is the first necessary step that is now possible with methods like Surveyor and Affymetrix resequencing chip. Combination of data including clinical informations, cerebral imaging, respiratory chain deficiency and/or assembly profile of respiratory chain complexes (BN-PAGE profile) may contribute for orientation for nuclear DNA studies. Elucidation of the genetic bases of MD is important for patients: identification of causing mutation(s) allows offering genetic counselling and possibility of prenatal diagnosis.

Role of Eisenia fetida in rapid recycling of nutrients from bio sludge of beverage industry. Beverage industry bio sludge proved to be toxic when given alone to earthworms even after stabilization for 15 days, therefore, it was mixed in various proportions with cattle dung. Best suitable mixture for highest survival, maximum growth and highest population buildup of Eisenia fetida was determined by observing mortality, growth rate, rate of cocoon production, population buildup and time taken for decomposition of waste. Minimum mortality and maximum population buildup were observed in 50:50 mixture of bio sludge and cattle dung. Nitrogen, phosphorous, sodium and pH increased in all the feed mixtures, while electrical conductivity, organic carbon and potassium declined in all the samples in comparison to traditional compost (without worms). Degradation of 50:50 mixture could be achieved in 75 days when worms were inoculated at 25 g/kg feed mixture. But the best-quality product was obtained after 105-110 days with 7.5 g worms/kg feed mixture.

Hemodynamic alterations in the coronary circulation of cardiomyopathic hamsters: age and Ang II-dependent mechanisms. Coronary vasospasms have been reported in the early stages of cardiomyopathy in the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster (CM; BIO-TO2 strain). It has been proposed these alterations could lead to ischemic heart disease and heart failure. However, the cause of these coronary abnormalities has not been established. In this study, we evaluated coronary hemodynamic to assess the role of Ang-II, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide (NO) in the development of these alterations in CM of 1, 2, and 6 months of age. Excised hearts from control (CT) and CM were retroperfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (KRB), and coronary resistance (CR) was determined. The experimental protocol involved sequential infusions of the thromboxane analog U46619 (THX, 0.1micromol/L), bradykinin (BKN, 10micromol/L), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10micromol/L). Similar experiments were conducted after treatment of hearts with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10micromol/L). Basal CR increased with age, but no significant differences were observed between CT and CM. Reactivity to THX was increased (69%, P < .05) in 2-month-old CM when compared with CT. This effect was observed concomitantly with a significant reduction (53%, P < .05) in BKN-induced relaxation. The reduction in BKN-dependent relaxation was prevented by treatment for 1 month with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (1 g.kg.day), or losartan, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker (10 mg.kg.day). Losartan also prevented the THX-induced increased reactivity in 2-month-old CM. The BKN-induced relaxation occurred through an L-NAME-sensitive pathway that was impaired with age. SNP dilation was preserved in all animal groups. Our results strongly implicate vascular renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) and oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction and increased reactivity in the early stages of cardiomyopathy in CM. These findings could be relevant to understand the etiology of cardiovascular disorders, in particular, in patients with sarcoglycanopathies.


[From the history of the 19th century pathology. Rudolf Virchow and his view of disease].

Electrical stimulation of the dorsal cochlear nucleus induces hearing in rats. Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) restore hearing by electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus (CN). Depending on the physiological condition, duration of the pre-existing deafness, extent of damage to the CN, and the number of channels accessible to the tonotopic frequency gradients of the CN, ABIs improve speech understanding to varying degrees. Although the ventral cochlear nucleus, a mainstream auditory structure, has been considered a logic target for ABI stimulation, it is not yet clear how the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) contributes to patients' hearing during ABI stimulation. To better understand the mechanisms underlying ABIs, we tested if electrical stimulation of the rat DCN induces hearing using a novel electrical prepulse inhibition (ePPI) of startle reflex behavior model. Our results showed that bipolar electrical stimulation of all channels in the DCN induced behavioral manifestation of hearing and that electrical stimulation of certain channels in the DCN induced robust neural activity in auditory cortex channels that responded to acoustic stimulation and demonstrated well-defined frequency tuning curves. This suggests that the DCN plays an important role in electrical hearing and should be further pursued in designing new ABIs. The novel ePPI behavioral paradigm may potentially be developed into an efficient method for testing hearing in animals with an implantable prosthesis.

[Working hypothesis of simplified techniques for the first mapping of occupational hazards in handicrafts. Part two: physical and chemical risks]. Craft features a strong link with tradition which preserves and perpetuates techniques created and consolidated over time, in a particular historical, cultural and geographical situation. Italy is home to excellent craftsmanship: fashion, furniture, giftware, design. The framework law for the craft n. 433/1985 defines the craft business carried on by the craftsman for a predominant objective of producing goods, including semi-finished or services. The D.L.gs 81/2008 defines the manner in which the employer must conduct risk assessment in the workplace and process the risk assessment document. The aim of the study is to provide employers with a simple methodology that allows the drafting of the first mapping of hazards/dangers identificating risk sources in the working process. The developed methodology is expressed as a model of information gathering, which brings to a first overview of all major risk indicators that may arise in the craftsmanship.

[Pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the role of FGF23 and Klotho]. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex metabolic alteration secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reduction of 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is the first derangement, followed by an increase in PTH, and, lastly, calcium and phosphate modifications. Vitamin D is a hormone whose actions take place through a specific receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is ubiquitous. Accordingly, heterogeneous biological effects can be added to the classical effects on mineral bone metabolism. In the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism, an important role is also played by alterations of calcium transport, which is under the control of two receptors: VDR and CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). The expression of these receptors is reduced during CKD. Recent findings have allowed to identify a new hormonal system, the FGF23-Klotho axis, that integrates the old and simple, but now inadequate, PTH-Vit D axis. FGF23 is a circulating factor produced by osteocytes that inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity. As such, FGF23 is involved in phosphate homeostasis and its serum levels increase along with the progression of CKD. Interestingly, FGF23 has very low affinity for its receptor and requires the activity of Klotho, an anti-aging gene, to become active. These new actors allow us to identify a bone-kidney axis, whose real physiological importance is still under evaluation.

Long-term cyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and histopathological alterations in Wistar rats. The immunosuppressant agent cyclosporine (CsA) is currently used in transplanted patients and in the therapy of autoimmune disorders. CsA treatment has significant acute and chronic side effects on the liver and kidney. However, in the clinical setting, it is difficult to distinguish a direct effect of CsA treatment from other confounding variables, such as allograft rejection and effects due to other drug therapies. In the present study, we assessed for direct associations between CsA immunosuppressive therapy and cytokines levels, kidney and liver functionality, as well as lung histopathological status in rats submitted to chronic CsA treatment without undergoing any transplantation. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The control group received vehicle (corn oil), and treated groups received CsA 5 or 15 mg/kg, by daily gastric gavage during 8 weeks. The results demonstrated that CsA treatment decreases blood levels of interleukins 1α (IL-1α), 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), but does not alter interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IFN-γ levels. Serum biochemical markers of renal (creatinine) and hepatic (SGPT and SGOT) injury/dysfunction did not vary with CsA treatment, despite the presence of small histological alterations, suggesting that the function of these metabolic organs were preserved. Pulmonary histopathological lesions were observed in the CsA groups, and they were attributed to the activation of the local immunoresponse mechanisms by the normal microbiota in immunosuppressive CsA cases. These results suggest that the CsA concentrations administered in our experimental protocol were able to induce immunosuppression in rats without causing nephro and hepatotoxicity.

Determining the accuracy of blood pressure measurement  by the Omron HEM-907 before and after hemodialysis. The accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measuring devices determined in resting conditions may be distorted in those under hemodialysis (HD). The evaluation of accuracy of the Omron HEM-907 was performed in accordance with the International Protocol for validation of BP measuring devices (IP). Out of a group of 49 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (56.7 +/- 15.6 years), four groups of 33 patients each were selected to ascertain their BP before and after HD. The Omron HEM-907 fulfilled the IP accuracy requirements for systolic BP measurements before and after HD. In the case of diastolic BP before HD, the Omron HEM-907 did not fulfill both requirements for phase 2.2 IP. In only 21 out of 33 patients, the difference between the mean of two observers and the Omron HEM-907 device (Diff) was not more than 5 mmHg, while the requirement was 22 patients. In seven patients, all three Diff were over 5 mmHg, while the accepted limit is three. After HD, the Omron HEM-907 did not fulfill one out of two criteria of phase 2.2 IP - in five people, all three Diff were over 5 mmHg. The Omron HEM-907 oscillometric method of BP measurement should not be used to measure BP before and after HD in ESRD patients. In ESRD patients, an alternative method of BP measurement, in the event of a lack of a mercury sphygmomanometer, could be a classical auscultatory method together with the Omron HEM-907, which allows for this type of BP measurement.

Efficacy of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of dysmenorrhea: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. To investigate the effectiveness of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in alleviating the symptoms of dysmenorrhea. This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was comprised of 62 patients with dysmenorrhea who were randomly divided into 2 groups (montelukast and placebo). Data obtained from 50 patients were analyzed (montelukast: 24; placebo: 26). Using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage per menstrual cycle, values before treatment were compared to average scores over two menstrual cycles with treatment. Both the VAS scores and NSAID usage decreased significantly in both groups. The decreases were greater in the montelukast group compared to the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, in "highly effective cases," which were defined as having a post-treatment value less than half of the pre-treatment value, the decreases were significantly greater in the montelukast group than in the placebo group (VAS: montelukast, 4 vs. placebo, 0 (P=0.029); NSAID: montelukast, 9 vs. placebo, 3 (P=0.031)). The present study found that montelukast may be effective in alleviating pain associated with dysmenorrhea in some women. Montelukast is safe and does not influence hormonal levels. Therefore, montelukast is a clinically reasonable management option to consider before prescribing a hormonal agent.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is estimated to be approximately 6 to 30 per 1 million live births. The disease is usually caused by missense mutations in KRT5 and KRT14, encoding keratins mostly expressed in the epidermal basal layer. Major advances in understanding of the molecular basis of EBS and other keratin disorders have led to the development of DNA-based prenatal testing.

Psychophysiological effects of emotional responding to goal attainment. Effects of positive performance feedback on self-reported emotion and associated physiological responding and their relation to motivational engagement were investigated in an achievement context. To create a situation of self-relevant goal striving and goal attainment, appraisals of goal relevance and goal conduciveness were manipulated by presenting 65 female undergraduate students with a psychological test, followed by positive performance feedback. Emotional responding during the 1-min feedback showed elicitation of various positive achievement-related emotions associated with broad sympathetic activation (decreased pre-ejection period, increased cardiac output, and increased skin conductance and response rate). Individual-level emotion reports indicated distinct subgroups of participants experiencing primarily either interest, joy, pride, or surprise. Between-participants physiological reactivity was found to differ based on primary self-reported feelings. We discuss motivational antecedents and consequences in achievement-related emotions.

Estimating the integrity of aged DNA samples by CE. A CE/UV method was developed to separate by a micellar system the four DNA bases and other five purinic-pyrimidinic compounds (5-methyl-cytosine, uracil, xanthyne, hypoxanthyne and 5-bromo-uracil). Selectivity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity were assessed and proved to be suitable for the analysis of the primary structure of DNA. This method was adopted to study 16 aged samples including two Egyptian mummies, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and other forensic specimens. Lower relative values of the four canonical unmodified DNA bases (uDNAb) and more complex pherograms were found in the aged samples when compared with the modern controls. The results of the CE analysis, together with those obtained by classical molecular methods (agarose gel electrophoresis, DNase I and RNase A assays, and UV spectrophotometry), were finally evaluated for assessing the reliability of STR typing. Since samples with low uDNAb showed no amplification or unreliable STR profiles, the uDNAb value is discussed as a further quality criterion in the evaluation of the genetic data obtained from aged samples.

Facilitation of 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission in dorsal periaqueductal grey matter accounts for the panicolytic-like effect of chronic fluoxetine. Chronic administration of antidepressants such as fluoxetine and imipramine increases the responsiveness of 5-HT(1A) receptors in dorsal periaqueductal grey matter (DPAG), a midbrain area consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of panic disorder. This effect has been related to the clinically relevant anti-panic action of these drugs. In this study we determined whether long-term administration of fluoxetine also affects 5-HT efflux in DPAG. As a comparison, the effect of chronic treatment with the anxiolytic 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist buspirone on DPAG 5-HT levels was assessed. We also investigated whether the inhibitory effect of chronic fluoxetine on escape behaviour in the rat elevated T-maze, considered as a panicolytic-like effect, is counteracted by intra-DPAG injection of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. Male Wistar rats were treated (1 or 21 d, i.p.) with fluoxetine, buspirone or vehicle, once daily. After treatment, 5-HT in DPAG was measured by in-vivo microdialysis coupled to HPLC. In another study, rats treated (21 d, i.p.) with either fluoxetine or vehicle also received intra-DPAG injection of WAY 100635 or saline 10 min before being tested in the elevated T-maze. Chronic, but not acute, administration of fluoxetine significantly raised extracellular levels of 5-HT in DPAG. Long-term treatment with buspirone was ineffective. In the elevated T-maze, intra-DPAG injection of WAY 100635 fully blocked the anti-escape effect of chronic administration of fluoxetine. Therefore, chronic fluoxetine facilitates 5-HT(1A)-mediated neurotransmission within DPAG and this effect accounts for the panicolytic-like effect of this antidepressant in the elevated T-maze.

[Research advances of Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trev]. Qiancengta, a traditional Chinese medicine produced from the whole plant of the club moss Huperzia serrata, has been used for a long history in China for treatment of a number of ailments, including contusions, strains, swellings, schizophrenia, myasthenia gravis and noworganophosphate poisoning. It has become known worldwide as a medicinal plant since Chinese scientists discovered huperzine A from it in the 1980s, which is reversible, potent and selective acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors by in vitro and in vivo pharmacological, and produce definite effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Now, Qiancengta is popular in all over the word for his famous pharmacological actions. For further exploitation this valuable resource under protection of nature environmental, its biological and ecological features, pharmaceutical active ingredients, artificial propagation and in vitro tissue culture, were reviewed, and the sustainable use of Qiancengta natural resource through plant biotechnology was put on the agenda.

Genetic structure of the Han Chinese population revealed by genome-wide SNP variation. Population stratification is a potential problem for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), confounding results and causing spurious associations. Hence, understanding how allele frequencies vary across geographic regions or among subpopulations is an important prelude to analyzing GWAS data. Using over 350,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs in over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study revealed a one-dimensional "north-south" population structure and a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the Han Chinese. The north-south population structure is consistent with the historical migration pattern of the Han Chinese population. Metropolitan cities in China were, however, more diffused "outliers," probably because of the impact of modern migration of peoples. At a very local scale within the Guangdong province, we observed evidence of population structure among dialect groups, probably on account of endogamy within these dialects. Via simulation, we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across modern China can cause spurious associations in GWAS if not properly handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene studies in which population stratification cannot be directly accessed and accounted for because of the lack of genome-wide data, with the exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is no longer a good indicator of ancestral origin. Our findings are important for designing GWAS in the Chinese population, an activity that is expected to intensify greatly in the near future.

Predictors of HIV disclosure among untested, HIV-negative and HIV-positive Australian men who had anal intercourse with their most recent casual male sex partner. We analysed HIV disclosure between Australian men who have sex with men (MSM) who reported anal intercourse with their last casual male partner. Of 804 MSM included in the analysis, 413 reported HIV disclosure and 391 reported no disclosure. After identifying bivariate associations with HIV disclosure, we developed three models of HIV disclosure (one for untested, one for HIV-negative and one for HIV-positive MSM). A range of factors was found to be associated with HIV disclosure. Having previously had sex with the last casual male partner and expecting HIV-negative and HIV-positive men to disclose before sex were predictors of HIV disclosure shared by more than one serostatus group. As unprotected anal intercourse was more common among MSM who disclosed (across all serostatus groups), we suggest caution should be exercised before encouraging HIV disclosure as a prevention strategy. Nondisclosure remains more strongly associated with safe sex among Australian MSM.

Basic principle of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a new neurophysiological technique based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a pulse of current passes through a coil, it becomes a magnetic field and penetrates the scalp and skull, and reach the brain painlessly. Review TMS stimulator, types of stimulation, mechanism of action, and its application. There are three types of TMS stimulation: 1) Single pulse; used in studying of motor threshold and phosphene threshold. 2) Paired pulse; used in the study of intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms. 3) Repetitive stimulation; changes corticospinal/corticocortical pathway. The mechanisms increases activity of synapse, changes the secretion of neurotransmitter and causes neuronal plasticity or long-term potentiation. Repetitive stimulation is used in fundamental basic science for brain mapping. It is a new therapeutic method for neuro-psychiatic disorders that does not respond to medications. TMS study is rapidly increasing and accepted as a noninvasive technique. The most favorable treating outcomes are depression and Parkinson disease. Other neuro-psychiatic therapeutic outcomes are ongoing.

Description of the larva of Popanomyia kerteszi James & Woodley (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) and identification key to immature stages of Pachygastrinae. The larva of Popanomyia kerteszi James & Woodley is described based on individuals collected under tree barks in initial stages of decomposition in Marambaia island (23 degrees 4'15''S, 43 degrees 53'59''W, at sea level), Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The immatures of P. kerteszi were compared with other species of the subfamily Pachygastrinae and an identification key to the described immature stages of this subfamily is presented. This is also the first record of P. kerteszi to Rio de Janeiro.

Emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy and their relation to social cognition--an fMRI-study. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study sought to characterize neural processes related to aspects of empathy and social cognition. It has been hypothesized previously that merely observing emotions in others automatically activates associated representations of the emotional state in the observer. We tested this prediction by presenting drawings depicting either one or two persons in an emotionally charged or neutral situation. Importantly and in contrast to previous imaging studies on empathy or social cognition, we did not instruct participants to assess the depicted persons' feelings or thoughts, but told them to simply watch the pictures to be able to perform a memory task unrelated to the main experimental question. This novel design allowed us to assess automatically elicited empathy-related effects (contrasting emotional and neutral situations) and to compare them with automatic social cognitive processes (contrasting stimuli with two persons vs. one person). We observed empathy-related increased hemodynamic responses in areas previously shown to be related to emotion processing (ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, PFC) and to social cognitive processes (superior temporal sulcus, STS, and medial PFC). The medial PFC activation was negatively correlated with participants' predisposition to feel distressed in emotional social situations, suggesting that interindividual differences in these higher-order functions might also impact empathic responses in social interactions.

Influence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes dispersed in natural organic matter on speciation and bioavailability of copper. The dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by natural organic matter (NOM) may influence the bioavailability of MWNTs and other contaminants. The speciation and bioavailability of copper (Cu) in MWNTs-associated NOM was studied using Daphnia magna. Cu titration data indicated that the binding affinity of Cu for MWNTs-associated NOM was lower than that for NOM alone. The free Cu(2+) ion activity was increased even by the addition of a low nontoxic concentration of 1.0 mg/L MWNTs. The 96 h LC(50) of MWNTs was determined to be 2.48 mg/L. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra results showed clearly different features in Cu spiked between NOM and MWNTs-associated NOM, indicating that the interruption of Cu binding was probably due to steric stabilization of the MWNTs dispersed in NOM, which inhibited the complexation by rendering the functional groups in NOM less favorable to Cu. The mortality and biochemical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the D. magna bioassay were enhanced in MWNTs-associated NOM compared to NOM alone because of increased free Cu(2+) ion activity as expected from the titration and FTIR results. This study suggests the bioavailability of Cu is enhanced by the presence of MWNTs interacting with NOM.

The effect of open-chest cardiac resuscitation on mitral regurgitant flow: an on-line transesophageal echocardiographic study in dogs. We sought to determine the effect of cardiac massage on a pre-existing regurgitant mitral valve during open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OCCPR) in an animal experiment. Our study included 29 dogs that were used as experimental models. We anesthetized them and inserted a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe. Then we performed a transverse thoracotomy, attempting to produce acute mitral regurgitation (MR). In models that showed cardiac arrest we initiated OCCPR to restore cardiac function. The regurgitant area of mitral jet and left ventricular (LV) diameters and volumes were calculated before and during OCCPR using TEE. Ventricular fibrillation and/or electromechanical dissociation occurred in 13 animals (45%). In 4 models without preexisting MR, no additional regurgitation was detected during OCCPR, while in another 5 with preexisting MR we noticed a slight increase in the regurgitant flow. The regurgitant flow area changed from 0.62 +/- 1 cm2 before to 1.1 +/- 0.36 cm2 during OCCPR (p<0.008). In the 4 animals that had severe damage to the mitral apparatus after the attempts, the regurgitant flow increased from 4.01 +/- 0.93 cm2 to 7.7 +/- 2.6 cm2 (p<0.002). The LV transverse diameter decreased from 4.39 +/- 0.62 cm to 1.54 +/- 0.5 cm and its volume from 60.5 +/- 7.14 cm3 to 17.02 +/- 4.14 cm3 (both p<0.001), thus showing the effectiveness of OCCPR. Given the presence of preexisting mitral regurgitation, direct cardiac massage during OCCPR would probably be less effective than expected, because of an increase in the amount of the regurgitant.

Modulating dendritic cells (DC) from immunogenic to tolerogenic responses: a novel mechanism of AZA/6-MP. Azathioprine (Aza), 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-Thioguanine (6-TG) are thiopurine drugs widely used as immunosuppressants/anti-inflammatory agents in organ transplantation and chemotherapy. Aza is well tolerated and effective in modifying the course of MS. Here we investigated the action of 6-MP on human dendritic cells (DCs). We described for the first time that 6-MP impairs in vitro differentiation of DCs, has an inhibitory effect during DC activation processes inducing a functionally less immunogenic phenotype. Moreover, 6-MP significantly reduces DC IL-23 production and CCR7 expression, at the same time induces IL-10 augmentation. All these findings add a novel action mechanism in Aza immune modulation.

How the niche regulates hematopoietic stem cells. The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) forms all types of blood cells of the hematopoietic system. In the adult, HSC are mainly quiescent, being mostly in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle during steady-state conditions. However, during hematopoietic stress, the stem cells respond quickly to regenerate the damaged hematopoietic system. To understand how environmental signals affect HSC and its progeny, it is essential to know the lineage relationships and transcriptional mechanisms controlling self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Because of the high possible output of blood cells from a single HSC, a tight regulation of these processes is extremely important. An essential component for this control is the marrow microenvironment, in this context also referred to as the HSC niche. The niche is heterogeneous and regulates stem cell metabolism through both surface-bound and soluble factors. Several signaling pathways have been shown to take part in these regulation processes, with Notch and especially Wnt signaling being the best studied ones. Dysregulation of the niche, for instance by environmental exposure, has recently been shown to lead to hematopoietic abnormalities. Thus, to understand the effect of the environment on hematopoiesis, it is of importance to study both HSC, its direct progeny and the cellular components of the niche. Detailed knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms operating between hematopoietic cells and their direct surroundings facilitates the study of how such signaling may be disrupted by environmental exposure.


Effect of ischemic preconditioning on the genomic response to reperfusion injury in deceased donor liver transplantation.

Association of porcine IGF binding protein-5 gene with meat quality. IGFBP-5 is a member of the IGF families. Using PCR-SSCP, genotypic and allelic frequencies were analyzed in 18 pig breeds (n = 600). The association between haplotypes and production performance was analyzed in a Jinhua x Pietrain population family (n = 212, total 24 traits). Two SNPs (T199C and G485A) within the gene were analyzed. The breeds had different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Typically, the Chinese native pig breeds carried a higher allele C and G frequency (over 50%) than those of the European pigs, and only Guangdong Large White and wild boar were at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The pigs carrying the CG haplotype had higher hue, loin, and thigh pH1 values than pigs with the TA haplotype, and pigs with the TA haplotype had the lowest loin pH2 value and highest color-a value among the haplotypes. It is proposed that the IGFBP-5 gene is associated with the variation in meat quality, especially in pH value together with other QTLs on chromosome 15.

Evidence of vasopressinergic-noradrenergic mechanisms in depression with above-normal plasma vasopressin concentration with and without psychotic features. Previous studies in the field of melancholic or endogenous depression have resulted in support for a subcategory of depression with above-normal plasma vasopressin (AVP) concentration (ANA). Since an analogous animal model with increased release of above-normal plasma vasopressin exhibits reduced Sympathetic-Nervous-System activity, the present study investigated the plasma norepinephrine concentration and the correlation between plasma norepinephrine and AVP in this ANA depression. As psychotic-melancholic patients may have increased plasma norepinephrine concentration, and noradrenergic activation may stimulate AVP release, potentially confounding effects of psychotic features were also investigated. The data set of the same depressed patient sample that was used before, but limited to those with complete hormonal data (n = 75), was re-analysed. ANA depression (n = 14) had negatively correlating AVP and norepinephrine concentrations. A very small subcategory of ANA depression with psychotic features (n = 3) had high plasma norepinephrine concentration, suggesting that this could be an independent subcategory. This was supported by the combination of relatively low above-normal plasma AVP concentrations with the highest severity scores for depression in this subcategory, which does not correspond with the positive correlation between AVP concentration and severity in non-psychotic ANA depression. The results further support the validity of ANA depression and the analogy with the High Anxiety Behaviour animal model of depression. Further investigations are needed to replicate these findings and to search for genetic and traumatic factors involved.

Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure only a small minority of patients are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current issues. A Medline database search was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", "CA19-9", "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "adjuvant therapy", "chemotherapy", and "microRNA". Additional papers were then identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. While high quality CT is often the only imaging modality needed for preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cholangiography, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, extended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy are discussed. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics.

Interactions of temperature and taste in conditioned aversions. The influence of temperature on taste cues and the ability to discriminate and learn about different temperatures of foods are important factors regulating ingestion. The goal of this research was to demonstrate that thermal orosensory input can serve as a salient stimulus to guide ingestive behavior in the rat, and also that it interacts with gustatory input during choice and conditioned aversion experiments. A novel apparatus with Peltier refrigerators was used to control the temperature of solutions in 10-min, 2-bottle tests. It was determined that naive rats preferred cold water (10 degrees C) to warm water (40 degrees ). When cold water was paired with a toxic LiCl injection, rats avoided cold water and drank warm water, thus demonstrating that cold water could serve as the conditioned stimulus in a conditioned temperature aversion. Rats conditioned against cold water could discriminate 10 degrees C water from 16 degrees C water, but not from 13 degrees C water, thus showing an ability to discriminate orosensory thermal cues to within 3-6 degrees C. Rats also generalized conditioned aversions from cold water to cold saccharin and cold sucrose solutions. However, if rats were conditioned against a compound taste and thermal stimulus (10 degrees C, 0.125% saccharin), the rats could distinguish and avoid each component individually, i.e., by avoiding cold water or warm saccharin. Finally, daily 2-bottle extinction tests were used to assess the strength of aversions conditioned against a taste cue (0.25 M sucrose), a thermal cue (10 degrees C water), or the combination. Aversions to taste or temperature alone persisted for 7-14 days of extinction testing, but the combined taste-temperature aversion was stronger and did not extinguish after 20 days of extinction testing. These results demonstrate that temperature can serve as a salient cue in conditioned aversions that affect ingestion independent of taste cues or by potentiating taste cues.


A randomized trial of massage therapy after heart surgery.

Financial hardship and mortality among older adults using the 1996-2004 Health and Retirement Study. We investigated the effect of financial hardship on mortality risk in a community-dwelling sample of adults 50 years of age and olderin the United States. The 1996 Health and Retirement Study cohorts were followed prospectively to 2004 (N = 8,377). Gender-stratified grouped Cox models were used to estimate the difference in the relative risk (RR) of mortality between a specific number of financial hardships (one, two, or three or more) and no hardships; and the predictive utility of each individual financial hardship for mortality during the follow-up period. Gender-stratified models adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and functional limitations in 1996 showed that women reporting one (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.92) or three or more (HR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.05-2.46) and men reporting two (HR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.21-2.69) financial hardships had a substantially higher probability of mortality compared to those reporting no financial hardships. Individual financial hardships that predicted mortality in fully adjusted models for women included receiving Medicaid (HR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.68-2.98) and for men receiving Medicaid (HR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.57-2.84) and receiving food stamps (HR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.09-2.33). These findings suggest that over and above the influence of traditional measures of socioeconomic status, financial hardship exerts an influence on the risk of mortality among older adults and that the number and type of hardships important in predicting mortality may differ for men and women.


Abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1 immunoreactive brain nuclei in rats.

Ultrastructural and molecular characterization of endosymbionts of the reed beetle genus Macroplea (Chrysomelidae, Donaciinae), and proposal of "Candidatus Macropleicola appendiculatae" and "Candidatus Macropleicola muticae". Intracellular bacterial symbionts are known from various insect groups, particularly from those feeding on unbalanced diets, where the bacteria provide essential nutrients to the host. In the case of reed beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Donaciinae), however, the endosymbionts appear to be associated with specialized "glands" that secrete a material used for the beetles' unusual water-tight cocoon. These glands were discovered over a century ago, but the bacteria they contain have yet to be characterized and placed in a phylogenetic context. Here, we describe the ultrastructure of two endosymbiotic species ("Candidatus Macropleicola appendiculatae" and "Candidatus Macropleicola muticae") that reside in cells of the Malpighian tubules of the reed beetle species Macroplea appendiculata and Macroplea mutica, respectively. Fluorescent in situ hybridization using oligonucleotides targeting the 16S rRNA gene specific to Macroplea symbionts verified the localization of the symbionts in these organs. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA placed "Candidatus Macropleicola" in a clade of typically endosymbiotic Enterobacteriaceae (gamma-proteobacteria). Finally, we discuss the evidence available for the hypothesis that the beetle larvae use a secretion produced by the bacteria for the formation of an underwater cocoon.

Increased H-reflex response induced by intramuscular electrical stimulation of latent myofascial trigger points. Myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) present with mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia. No electrophysiological evidence exists as to the excitability of muscle spindle afferents at myofascial trigger points MTrPs. The purpose of this current study was to explore whether an H-reflex response could be elicited from intramuscular electrical stimulation. If so, to assess the possibility of increased reflex response at MTrPs. The H-reflex latency and the conduction velocity were first determined from electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in 13 healthy subjects. Then an intramuscular monopolar needle electrode was inserted randomly into a latent MTrP or a non-MTrP in the gastrocnemius muscle. Electrical stimuli at different intensities were delivered via the intramuscular recording electrode to the MTrP or non-MTrP. The average conduction velocity (44.3 +/- 1.5 m/s) of the electrical stimulation of tibial nerve was similar (p>0.05) with the conduction velocity (43.9 +/- 1.4 m/s) of intramuscular electrical stimulation. The intramuscular H-reflex at MTrPs was higher in amplitude than non-MTrPs (p<0.001). The reflex threshold was lower for MTrPs than non-MTrPs (p<0.001). The current study provides first electrophysiological evidence that intramuscular electrical stimulation can evoke H-reflex, and that higher H-reflex amplitude and lower H-reflex threshold exist at MTrPs than non-MTrPs respectively, suggesting that muscle spindle afferents may be involved in the pathophysiology of MTrPs.

Characterization of adipose-derived stem cells: an update. Adipose tissue is an attractive source of multipotent adult stem cells due to its wide-spread availability, accessibility, and ease of harvest. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), the adherent stromal cell population present within adipose tissue, are easily expanded in culture, able to differentiate along multiple cell-lineage pathways, and have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit in models of injury and disease through immunomodulation, structural integation, and/or trophic support. Recent developments in the characterization of ASCs, specifically their isolation, gene and protein expression, differentiation, and expansion, are reviewed in this article.

Role of ethanol in kava hepatotoxicity. Kava is known for its recreational, ceremonial and medicinal use in the Pacific. The aqueous non-alcoholic drink of kava rhizome produces intoxicating, relaxing and soothing effects. While kava's medicinal effects receive worldwide recognition, kava-containing products came under scrutiny after over 100 reports of spontaneous adverse hepatic effects. Many mechanisms have been postulated to explain the unexpected toxicity, one being pharmacokinetic interactions between kavalactones and co-administered drugs involving cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Alcohol is often co-injested in kava hepatotoxicity cases. This review evaluates the possible hepatotoxicity mechanisms involving alcohol and kava.

RNA-interference approach to study functions of NADPH : cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in human hepatocytes. Human NADPH : cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 7q11.2. This flavoprotein donates electrons derived from NADPH to a variety of acceptor proteins, including squalene monooxygenase, heme oxygenase, cytochrome b(5), and many microsomal cytochromes P450 (CYPs), which are involved in oxidative drug metabolism, steroidogenesis, and other functions. Numerous aspects related to cellular POR expression have not been systematically investigated. Interestingly, POR expression is lower compared to CYPs and may thus be limiting for monooxygenase activities, but conversely, POR knock-out in mice resulted in compensatory upregulation of CYPs. POR may also influence intracellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. To systematically investigate such effects, we developed specific POR gene silencing in cell lines and primary human hepatocytes by RNA interference using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In HepG2 cells, POR mRNA could be reduced by 95% over 4 days accompanied by reduced protein content and activity. In primary human hepatocytes, POR mRNA knock-down was less effective and more variable. Analysis of CYPs indicated induction of CYP3A4 but not CYP1A2 or CYP2D6. These results demonstrate that POR can be efficiently and almost completely silenced in HepG2 cells and, at least partially, in primary human hepatocytes. This will allow systematic studies of various consequences of POR variability in human cells.


Low dose, alternating electric current inhibits growth of prostate cancer.

The evolutionarily conserved core design of the catalytic activation step of the yeast spliceosome. Metazoan spliceosomes exhibit an elaborate protein composition required for canonical and alternative splicing. Thus, the minimal set of proteins essential for activation and catalysis remains elusive. We therefore purified in vitro assembled, precatalytic spliceosomal complex B, activated B(act), and step 1 complex C from the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mass spectrometry revealed that yeast spliceosomes contain fewer proteins than metazoans and that each functional stage is very homogeneous. Dramatic compositional changes convert B to B(act), which is composed of approximately 40 evolutionarily conserved proteins that organize the catalytic core. Additional remodeling occurs concomitant with step 1, during which nine proteins are recruited to form complex C. The moderate number of proteins recruited to complex C will allow investigations of the chemical reactions in a fully defined system. Electron microscopy reveals high-quality images of yeast spliceosomes at defined functional stages, indicating that they are well-suited for three-dimensional structure analyses.


Intranasal immunization with vaccine vector Streptococcus gordonii elicits primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the genital and intestinal tracts.

Acute 'strokenomics': efficacy and economic analyses of alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. Cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of adult disability in Western countries and, as such, is associated with a considerable and increasing economic burden. Prevention of disability is preferable to a costly and prolonged period of rehabilitation; however, in this regard, we have only a limited number of acute treatments. Treatment of ischemic stroke with the tissue plasminogen activator alteplase has a considerable and compelling evidence base confirming its clinical efficacy. Good-quality trial data are complemented by years of 'real-life' clinical experience. There is limited pharmacoeconomic literature describing the use of alteplase in ischemic stroke, and published data are consistent and broadly supportive of its use in select patient populations. Delivery of stroke and other medical care can differ across countries; however, models based on American, Canadian and European data suggest that following initial monetary investment, net healthcare-associated costs for tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients are less than for untreated contemporaries. Potential savings are driven by reduced disability and associated long-term care costs. At present, robust economic data are only available for the period of 1-year following stroke. Continuing cost savings associated with reduced disability in the longer term make intuitive sense but are yet to be confirmed. A recurring theme in these economic analyses is of reducing healthcare costs associated with the increasing use of thrombolysis. In this regard, it is unfortunate that rates of tissue plasminogen activator utilization remain modest in most centers. This review will discuss the economics of alteplase in acute stroke, making particular reference to the current and projected economic burden of stroke, the evidence base for thrombolysis and published literature on the economics analyses of this therapy.

Treatment of late-life depression alleviates caregiver burden. To describe the burden experienced by family caregivers of older adults with depression and to examine the positive effects on caregivers of treating late-life depression. Two-phase treatment study for major depressive disorder (MDD) that included 6 weeks of open treatment with antidepressant medication for all older patients followed by 16 weeks of randomized treatment for patients who were partial responders, comparing a combination of medication and interpersonal psychotherapy with medication alone. Primary care and university late-life mental health research clinic. Adults aged 60 and older participating in a randomized trial for treatment of MDD who enrolled in a family caregiver study and their caregiver (N=244 dyads). Improvement in patient symptoms during open treatment (lower scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)) and remission of depression during randomized treatment (3 consecutive weekly HRSD scores of < or =7) were examined as predictors of lower general caregiver burden and burden specific to patient depression. Caregivers reported a moderate to high level of general caregiver burden on average. Change in patient depression during open treatment was associated with significantly decreased depression-specific burden (beta=-0.22, P=.001) and a trend toward lower general burden (beta=-0.08, P=.08). Caregivers of patients who remitted showed significantly decreased depression-specific burden (F (1,76)=4.27, P=.04). Treatment of late-life depression has benefits that extend to the family members on whom patients depend. Caregiver education and support may strengthen these effects.


Dynamic NMR spectroscopy of three 2,2'-dialkyl/aryl-1-picrylhydrazines in liquid solution.

Comorbidity of insomnia and depression. During the last decade, several studies have shown that insomnia, rather than a symptom of depression, could be a medical condition on its own, showing high comorbidity with depression. Epidemiological research indicates that insomnia could lead to depression and/or that common causalities underlie the two disorders. Neurobiological and sleep EEG studies suggest that a heightened level of arousal may play a common role in both conditions and that signs of REM sleep disinhibition may appear in individuals prone to depression. The effects of antidepressant drugs on non-REM and REM sleep are discussed in relation to their use in insomnia comorbid with depression. Empirical treatment approaches are behavioral management of sleep combined with prescription of a sedative antidepressant alone, co-prescription of two antidepressants, or of an antidepressant with a hypnotic drug.

A randomized trial of massage therapy after heart surgery. To determine whether massage therapy improves postoperative mood, pain, anxiety, and physiologic measurements; shortens hospital stay; and decreases occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Two hundred fifty-two adults undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to usual postoperative care (n=126) or usual care plus two massages (n=126). Assessments of mood, depression, anxiety, pain, physiologic status, cardiac rhythm, and hospital length of stay were completed. Logistic and linear regressions were performed. Preoperative pain, mood, and affective state scores were positively associated with postoperative scores; however, there were no postoperative differences between groups for any measures (P=.11 to .93). There were no differences in physiologic variables except lower postoperative blood pressure after massage (P = .01). Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurrence (P = .6) and median postoperative hospital length of stay (P = .4) were similar between groups. Massage therapy is feasible in cardiac surgical patients; however, it does not yield therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, it should be a patient-selected and -paid option.

A novel technique for treating auricular hematomas in mixed martial artists (ultimate fighters). This study aimed to describe a "bolsterless" technique for managing auricular hematomas in professional fighters. Eight auricular hematomas were drained under local anesthesia by incising along an anatomical auricular crease. After evacuation of the hematoma and copious irrigation, the resultant skin flap was replaced in anatomical position, and through-and-through absorbable mattress sutures were used to secure the flap in place. Incision sites were left open and dressed with antimicrobial ointment. No bolsters were placed. The patients were given 1 week of oral antibiotic therapy. All 8 hematomas resolved without further intervention. All 8 ears returned to their preinjury cosmetic state. Fighters were able to return to training within a week of the initial injury. No postoperative infections or other complications were noted. In contrast to wrestlers, mixed martial artists (also called "ultimate fighters") do not routinely wear protective head gear. As a result, they are at increased risk of recurrent auricular hematomas, often resulting in severe auricular deformities (cauliflower ear). These patients are anxious to return to training and fighting, and are reluctant to wear a bolster after repair. At their urging, we agreed to attempt this bolsterless technique. Although 2 patients in this series already had a significant cauliflower ear before being treated for the current hematoma, in all cases the auricle returned to its preinjury condition. Bolsterless treatment using mattress sutures and cosmetically placed incisions represents a successful technique for management of auricular hematomas in this population.

The antiparasitic isoxazoline A1443 is a potent blocker of insect ligand-gated chloride channels. A structurally unique isoxazoline class compound, A1443, exhibits antiparasitic activity against cat fleas and dog ticks comparable to that of the commercial ectoparasiticide fipronil. This isoxazoline compound inhibits specific binding of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor channel blocker [(3)H]4'-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) to housefly-head membranes, with an IC(50) value of 455pM. In contrast, the IC(50) value in rat-brain membranes is>10muM. To study the mode of action of this isoxazoline, we utilized MdGBCl and MdGluCl cDNAs, which encode the subunits of housefly GABA- and glutamate-gated chloride channels, respectively. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to confirm that A1443 blocks GABA- and glutamate-induced chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing MdGBCl or MdGluCl channels, with IC(50) values of 5.32 and 79.9 nM, respectively. Blockade by A1443 was observed in A2'S-MdGBCl and S2'A-MdGluCl mutant channels at levels similar to those of the respective wild-types, and houseflies expressing A2'S-MdGBCl channels were as susceptible to A1443 as standard houseflies. These findings indicate that A1443 is a novel and specific blocker of insect ligand-gated chloride channels.

A water-sediment screening tool for measuring biodegradation of organic chemicals.

The potential of free cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on textile dye degradation. The objective of the present work was to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD), color of textile effluent containing dye Procion Blue 2G and recycle the treated effluent. To achieve this objective, the degradation potential of bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested. In degradation, the 'clean' electro-oxidation (EO) process was combined with bio-treatment such that an electro-oxidation step was included between two bio-degradation treatments. Bio-oxidation process was carried out under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Results showed more than 90% reduction in COD and complete removal of color at the end of two cycles of combined oxidation process with a post electro-oxidation. The treated effluent was then subjected to photo-oxidation to remove the microbes so that the water can be recycled after the removal of total dissolved solids (TDS).

Kinetic and thermodynamic solubility values of some bioactive compounds. Thermodynamic solubility is a decisive physicochemical property in drug development. The Chasing Equilibrium method offers an alternative to the classical procedures to measure the solubility of compounds with acid-base properties. The method is fast and yields accurate results. In this work, the solubility of several compounds including acids and bases was determined through the Chasing Equilibrium approach. A study of experimental conditions in terms of sample weight was performed to measure solubilities. The study shows that only a limited range of weights, depending on the nature and solubility of the compounds, is adequate to obtain reliable results.

Diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and a sesquiterpene-coumarin conjugate from Jatropha integerrima. Five new compounds, 2alpha-hydroxyjatropholone (1), 2beta-hydroxyjatropholone (2), 1,5-dioxo-2,3-dihydroxyrhamnofola-4(10),6,11(18),15-tetraene (3), 2-keto-5-hydroxyguai-3,11-diene (4), and a sesquiterpene-coumarin conjugate, jatrophadioxan (5), and nine known compounds have been isolated from the roots of Jatropha integerrima. The structures were established from spectroscopic data, and the relative configuration of 1 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Six diterpenes were evaluated for their antiplasmodial, antituberculosis, and cytotoxic activities.

[Pulmonary cryptococcosis]. Cryptococcosis is a deep mycosis that develops in immunosuppressed individuals. Isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis is a rare disease. The authors describe an autopsy case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a 69-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus suppressing the immune system. Pulmonary inflammatory changes were characterized by disseminated destructive changes, a weak exudative reaction and the formation of epithelioid cell granulomas with the presence of Pirogov-Langerhans giant multinucleate cells. Round fungal cells weakly stained with hematoxylin and eosin can be mistakenly taken as artifacts. The diagnosis of chronic pulmonary cryptococcosis was established only after histological study using the selective staining.

Inhibition of adult rat retinal ganglion cells by D1-type dopamine receptor activation. The spike output of neural pathways can be regulated by modulating output neuron excitability and/or their synaptic inputs. Dopaminergic interneurons synapse onto cells that route signals to mammalian retinal ganglion cells, but it is unknown whether dopamine can activate receptors in these ganglion cells and, if it does, how this affects their excitability. Here, we show D(1a) receptor-like immunoreactivity in ganglion cells identified in adult rats by retrogradely transported dextran, and that dopamine, D(1)-type receptor agonists, and cAMP analogs inhibit spiking in ganglion cells dissociated from adult rats. These ligands curtailed repetitive spiking during constant current injections and reduced the number and rate of rise of spikes elicited by fluctuating current injections without significantly altering the timing of the remaining spikes. Consistent with mediation by D(1)-type receptors, SCH-23390 [R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine] reversed the effects of dopamine on spikes. Contrary to a recent report, spike inhibition by dopamine was not precluded by blocking I(h). Consistent with the reduced rate of spike rise, dopamine reduced voltage-gated Na(+) current (I(Na)) amplitude, and tetrodotoxin, at doses that reduced I(Na) as moderately as dopamine, also inhibited spiking. These results provide the first direct evidence that D(1)-type dopamine receptor activation can alter mammalian retinal ganglion cell excitability and demonstrate that dopamine can modulate spikes in these cells by a mechanism different from the presynaptic and postsynaptic means proposed by previous studies. To our knowledge, our results also provide the first evidence that dopamine receptor activation can reduce excitability without altering the temporal precision of spike firing.

Prion protein self-peptides modulate prion interactions and conversion. Molecular mechanisms underlying prion agent replication, converting host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into the scrapie associated isoform (PrP(Sc)), are poorly understood. Selective self-interaction between PrP molecules forms a basis underlying the observed differences of the PrP(C) into PrP(Sc) conversion process (agent replication). The importance of previously peptide-scanning mapped ovine PrP self-interaction domains on this conversion was investigated by studying the ability of six of these ovine PrP based peptides to modulate two processes; PrP self-interaction and conversion. Three peptides (octarepeat, binding domain 2 -and C-terminal) were capable of inhibiting self-interaction of PrP in a solid-phase PrP peptide array. Three peptides (N-terminal, binding domain 2, and amyloidogenic motif) modulated prion conversion when added before or after initiation of the prion protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction using brain homogenates. The C-terminal peptides (core region and C-terminal) only affected conversion (increased PrP(res) formation) when added before mixing PrP(C) and PrP(Sc), whereas the octarepeat peptide only affected conversion when added after this mixing. This study identified the putative PrP core binding domain that facilitates the PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) interaction (not conversion), corroborating evidence that the region of PrP containing this domain is important in the species-barrier and/or scrapie susceptibility. The octarepeats can be involved in PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) stabilization, whereas the N-terminal glycosaminoglycan binding motif and the amyloidogenic motif indirectly affected conversion. Binding domain 2 and the C-terminal domain are directly implicated in PrP(C) self-interaction during the conversion process and may prove to be prime targets in new therapeutic strategy development, potentially retaining PrP(C) function. These results emphasize the importance of probable PrP(C)-PrP(C) and required PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) interactions during PrP conversion. All interactions are probably part of the complex process in which polymorphisms and species barriers affect TSE transmission and susceptibility.

Ochratoxin A: is it present in breast milk samples obtained from mothers from Ankara, Turkey? Breast feeding is very important in the first year of life. However, breast milk may be contaminated with many residues of xenobiotics and naturally occurring toxins such as mycotoxins. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of mycotoxins that may play a causative role in some diseases seen in neonates. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine OTA levels in breast milk samples. For this purpose breast milk samples were collected from 75 mothers. Their babies were in-patients in the Department of Pediatrics, Section of Neonatology, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, in Ankara, Turkey. All samples were stored at -20 degrees C until analysis. Following an extraction procedure, OTA levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean coefficient values for within-day and between-day variations of the method were 7.3 and 4.9%, respectively. The detection limit of the method was found to be 10 ng l(-1). The recovery percentage of OTA was 91.70 and 136.6 for two different concentrations added to breast milk samples. OTA was found in all samples tested in the range of 620.87-13111.30 ng l(-1). Considering potential hazard of OTA to human health, and especially the vulnerability of infants, the present data suggest the necessity of further research on OTA in Turkey, either monitoring its levels in biological fluids and foods or evolving protection strategies.


High-definition fiber tracking guidance for intraparenchymal endoscopic port surgery.

Correlation of bacterial colonization status between mother and child: the Generation R Study. Determinants of bacterial colonization in children have been described. In the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort study, we determined whether the colonization statuses of mothers and children are correlated. Such a correlation was observed for Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Direct transmission, genetic susceptibility and/or unidentified environmental factors may play a role here.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy in the elderly: current issues.

Child-care environment and dietary intake of 2- and 3-year-old children. Previous research has shown that children in child-care do not comply with dietary intake recommendations (i.e. either exceeding or not meeting recommendations), which may be attributable to specific features of the child-care environment. The present study explored the relationship between the social and physical child-care (day-care) environment and dietary intake of 2- and 3-year-olds in Dutch child-care centres. The dietary intake of 135 children, aged 2 and 3 years, who were in child-care was assessed by observing randomly selected children at three meals (morning snack, lunch and afternoon snack) to determine dietary intake (i.e. saturated fat, dietary fibre and energy intake). The environment was observed using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation checklist, a structured instrument assessing the physical and social environment. Children consumed a mean of 486 kJ (116 kcal) during the morning snack, 2043 kJ (488 kcal) during lunch and 708 kJ (169 kcal) during the afternoon snack. There were some gender and age differences in dietary intake. Several environmental factors (e.g. serving style and staff's model dietary behaviour) were significantly associated with the children's dietary intake. Overall, energy intake was in the upper range of recommended intake for children in child-care. The associations of several environmental factors with dietary intake stress the importance of the child-care environment for children's dietary behaviour. Intervening in this setting could possibly contribute to the comprehensive prevention of childhood obesity.

Effects of in utero exposure to Tityus bahiensis scorpion venom in adult rats. The toxicity of Tityus bahiensis scorpion venom is well known, but there are little data about the damage in offspring of dams that were exposed to the venom during pregnancy. The objective of this work was to determine the toxic effects of venom in adult offspring of Wistar rats exposed to venom in utero. Dams were divided into a control group, subcutaneously injected with saline solution on the 10th (GD10) and 16th (GD16) days, and two experimental groups, subcutaneously injected with venom (2.5mg/kg) on GD10 or GD16, respectively. Adult offspring were evaluated according to behavioral development and neuronal integrity in the hippocampus. Tests performed in the activity box and in the enriched environment demonstrated that males from GD10 had motor decrease. Females from GD10 showed a depressive-like state and were more anxious, as demonstrated by the forced swimming test and social interaction. The plus-maze discriminative avoidance task demonstrated that GD16 males had lower levels of anxiety. The number of neuronal cells was decreased in CA1, CA3 and CA4 hippocampal areas of males and females from GD10 group and in CA1 of females and CA4 of males from GD16 group. Thus, we conclude that venom exposure in pregnant dams causes subtle alteration in the behavioral and neuronal development of offspring in adult life in a gender-dependent manner.

Topical diclofenac solution. Topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid) is a liquid formulation containing the NSAID diclofenac sodium (1.5% w/w). The solution base contains 45% w/w dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to enhance the absorption of diclofenac through the skin. Topical diclofenac solution is applied directly to the knee for treatment of symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. In well designed 4- to 12-week trials in patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee, topical diclofenac solution (40 drops four times daily) was significantly more effective than placebo or vehicle control (carrier solution without diclofenac) for improving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index pain and physical function, and improving patient global assessment (PGA) and/or patient overall health assessment scores from baseline to the final assessments. Topical diclofenac solution (50 drops three times daily) was as effective as oral diclofenac 150 mg/day for improving WOMAC pain and physical function and PGA scores in a 12-week double-blind study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Topical diclofenac solution was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event experienced by topical diclofenac solution recipients was dry skin at the application site. Gastrointestinal adverse events and abnormal laboratory parameters were less common with topical diclofenac solution than with oral diclofenac.

A core-substituted naphthalene diimide fluoride sensor. The synthesis and characterization of a highly fluorescent core-substituted naphthalene diimide sensor (varphi = 0.34) bearing a bis-sulfonamide group is described. The compound shows a unique selectivity and reactivity for the fluoride ion over other anions in CHCl(3) by a two-stage deprotonation process leading to a colorimetric response. In DMSO solution, the sensor is shown to be highly selective for fluoride (K(a) approximately 10(6) M(-1)) over other anions with more pronounced changes in absorption characteristics.

Molecular modeling of dissociative and non-dissociative chemisorption of nitrosamine on close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes. The nitrosamine adsorbed on close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Structure optimization of all possible adsorption configurations based on the combination of two nitrosamine (amino- and imino-) isomers and four types of nanotubes was carried out. The most stable configuration for the nitrosamine adsorbed on the (5,5) armchair SWCNTs was found to be dissociative chemisorption. The adsorption energies of the most stable structures of the adsorption complexes of close-ended and open-ended pristine SWCNTs with the imino isomer of nitrosamine were -127.15 and -137.14 kcal mol(-1), respectively.


Production of novel antioxidative phenolic amides through heterologous expression of the plant's chlorogenic acid biosynthesis genes in yeast.

Changes in iron, sulfur, and arsenic speciation associated with bacterial sulfate reduction in ferrihydrite-rich systems. Biologically mediated redox processes have been shown to affect the mobility of iron oxide-bound arsenic in reducing aquifers. This work investigates how dissimilatory sulfate reduction and secondary iron reduction affect sulfur, iron, and arsenic speciation. Incubation experiments were conducted with As(III/V)-bearing ferrihydrite in carbonate-buffered artificial groundwater enriched with lactate (10 mM) and sulfate (0.08-10 mM) and inoculated with Desulfovibrio vulgaris (ATCC 7757, formerly D. desulfuricans), which reduces sulfate but not iron or arsenic. Sulfidization of ferrihydrite led to formation of magnetite, elemental sulfur, and trace iron sulfides. Observed reaction rates imply that the majority of sulfide is recycled to sulfate, promoting microbial sulfate reduction in low-sulfate systems. Despite dramatic changes in Fe and S speciation, and minimal formation of Fe or As sulfides, most As remained in the solid phase. Arsenic was not solubilized in As(V)-loaded incubations, which experienced slow As reduction by sulfide, whereas As(III)-loaded incubations showed limited and transient As release associated with iron remineralization. This suggests that As(III) production is critical to As release under reducing conditions, with sulfate reduction alone unlikely to release As. These data also suggest that bacterial reduction of As(V) is necessary for As sequestration in sulfides, even where sulfate reduction is active.

Comparison of the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment and local anaesthetic injection for low back pain: a randomised controlled clinical trial. To compare the effectiveness of repeated acupuncture stimulation and local anaesthetic injection at the most painful points in patients with low back pain. This randomised controlled clinical trial involved 26 patients with low back pain randomly allocated to either an acupuncture group (n = 13) or a local anaesthetic injection group (n = 13). Both acupuncture and anaesthetic injection were performed at two to five of the most painful points on the lower back once weekly for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture group, a 0.18 mm diameter stainless steel needle was inserted to a depth of 10-20 mm and manual stimulation was applied. In the local anaesthetic injection group, a 0.5 mm diameter needle was inserted to a depth of 10-20 mm and a local anaesthetic was injected. Participants evaluated pain using a Visual Analogue Scale immediately before and after the first treatment, before each subsequent treatment, and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after completion of treatment. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the change in Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (p<0.01), with acupuncture providing more favourable results than local anaesthetic injection. The reduction in pain score from baseline calculated at each time period was significantly different between the two groups after the first (p<0.05) and final (p<0.01) treatments, and during the follow-up period (after 2 weeks (p<0.01) and 4 weeks (p<0.05)). Both injection and acupuncture relieved pain, but acupuncture was superior for the immediate and sustained effects, suggesting that it is a useful treatment for low back pain. The difference in the effects may be attributable to differences in the mechanism of pain suppression.

[Molecular-genetic analysis of sorghum cultivated in Ukraine]. PCR-analysis of intraspecific and interspecific polymorphism of sorghum, soryz and their nearest relatives (maize, rice) has been conducted. The level of polymorphism within the sample was 100%. Interspecific polymorphism (species of sorghum and soryz) was 96.2% that testifies the wide changeability of the analyzed samples. Clasterisation of the genotypes occurred according to their species.

[Detection of the first strain of glycopeptide intermediary Staphylococcus aureus in Tunis Rabta hospital]. Since the advent of the first glycopeptide intermediately susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) and its heterogeneous variant hGISA in 1997, debate still ensues as their clinical significance. We report here the first case of GISA in Rabta hospital of Tunisia. Antimicrobial resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method in accordance with CA-SFM (Comity of Antibiogramm of French society of Microbiology). The MIC of vancomycin and teicoplanin was determined by E-test. The detection of mec A gene, virulence factors genes and agr groups (1-4) was performed by multiplex PCR. spa types were determined with the assistance of Ridom of Staph Type software (Ridom GmbH, Wurburg, Germany). The allelic profiles of MRSA were assigned on the basis of their MLST type using the eBURST program. A MRSA bacteraemia patient was treated with teicoplanin for 14 days. S. aureus isolated from patient's blood culture was identified as MRSA and GISA with teicoplanin MIC of 16 mg/l. The molecular study of this strain showed that it belongs to the clonal complex CC8 and is attached to the iberian clone (agr1, enterotoxin A, ST 247, spa type t052). Clinicians and laboratories alike are increasingly aware that patients on long-term vancomycin therapy may signal the presence and potential spread of hGISA/GISA strains. hGISA/GISA strains emerged from lineages with agr types I and II. The multiresitance of the Iberian clone ST247 could be explained by the presence of several resistance genes.

Combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine enhances immune functions and protects against influenza virus infection in aged mice. Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are attenuated with aging. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels also decrease with aging. Previously, we have reported that combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine enhances antigen-specific IgG production, partly through augmentation of GSH levels and T helper 2-mediated responses in 12-week-old mice. These findings suggest that combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine to aged mice improves immune responses via increase of GSH synthesis. Here, we examined the effects of combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine on antigen-specific antibody production and influenza virus infection in aged mice. Combined administration of these amino acids for 14 days before primary immunization significantly enhanced the serum antigen-specific IgM and IgG levels in 24-month-old mice. Furthermore, 13-month-old mice co-treated with these amino acids orally for 10 days had significantly lower lung viral titers than controls at 6 days after influenza virus infection. In addition, this co-treatment also significantly prevented the weight loss associated with infection. Enhancement of anti-influenza-virus IgG antibodies by combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine was seen 10 days after infection. The significantly elevated serum interleukin-10/interferon-gamma ratio and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase mRNA expression, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis, in the spleen 3 days after infection may have contributed to the observed beneficial effects. These results suggest that combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine enhances immune function and GSH synthesis which are compromised with advanced age, and may become a useful strategy in healthy aging.

Characterization of the human plasma phosphoproteome using linear ion trap mass spectrometry and multiple search engines. Major plasma protein families play different roles in blood physiology and hemostasis and in immunodefense. Other proteins in plasma can be involved in signaling as chemical messengers or constitute biological markers of the status of distant tissues. In this respect, the plasma phosphoproteome holds potentially relevant information on the mechanisms modulating these processes through the regulation of protein activity. In this work we describe for the first time a collection of phosphopeptides identified in human plasma using immunoaffinity separation of the seven major serum protein families from other plasma proteins, SCX fractionation, and TiO(2) purification prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. One-hundred and twenty-seven phosphosites in 138 phosphopeptides mapping 70 phosphoproteins were identified with FDR < 1%. A high-confidence collection of phosphosites was obtained using a combined search with the OMSSA, SEQUEST, and Phenyx search engines.

The central arterial burden of the metabolic syndrome is similar in men and women: the SardiNIA Study. We evaluated whether specific clusters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components differentially impact on arterial structure and function, and whether the impact is similar in men and in women. Components of the MetS and arterial properties were assessed in 6148 subjects, aged 14-102 in a cluster of four towns in Sardinia, Italy. MetS was defined in accordance with the ATP III criteria. Age groups were classified as: <35, 35-49, 50-64, and > or =65 years. Systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, pulse pressure, common carotid artery (CCA) diameter, intima-media thickness, distensibility, strain, stiffness index, wall stress, and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured. Common carotid artery plaque was defined as focal encroachment of the arterial wall and CCA calcification as acoustic shadowing. In any age group, subjects with MetS presented thicker, stiffer or less distensible, and wider large arteries than controls. The arterial burden of MetS increased as the number of altered MetS components increased. However, not all MetS components were associated with the same changes in arterial properties. In fact, specific clusters of MetS components, i.e. any combination of altered glucose tolerance, elevated BP, and elevated triglycerides (with or without abdominal obesity), dramatically increased age-associated arterial changes. The impact of MetS on arterial function was similar in men and women. MetS accelerates age-associated arterial changes, even in older persons. However, not all the clusters of MetS components render the same burden on arterial structure and function.

Thoracic fluid content and impedance cardiography: a novel and promising noninvasive method for assessing the hemodynamic effects of diuretics in hypertensive patients. Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a reliable, noninvasive method allowing the assessment of the hemodynamic profile in hypertensive patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential hemodynamic effects of diuretics with ICG and examine whether the empiric administration of diuretics actually has a substantial impact on thoracic fluid content (TFC). The study population included 248 hypertensive and 68 healthy subjects (35-87 years old) and was divided into 4 groups: group A comprised hypertensive patients under treatment including diuretic; group B consisted of hypertensive patients under treatment without diuretic; group C included untreated hypertensive patients; and group D included healthy subjects. The measurements were performed using the Cardio Screen ICG system (Medis, Germany). Men and women were examined separately, since TFC seems to be sex-dependent. In the men's subgroup, the highest TFC value (41.7 +/- 4.9) was found in Group C (untreated hypertensive group), while the lowest TFC (36.4 +/- 5.7) was seen in Group A (diuretic hypertensive group). Women treated empirically with diuretics (group A) had a mean TFC of 27.3, while the other no-diuretic groups had a mean TFC of approximately 30. The mean TFC in men was significantly higher than in women in all study groups examined. Both men and women who were treated empirically with diuretics showed a significantly lower TFC in comparison with patients treated with other antihypertensive drugs, untreated patients and healthy control subjects. TFC is an ICG parameter that is associated with the administration of diuretics and has interesting clinical applications in optimizing and tailoring antihypertensive treatment.

Pulmonary rehabilitation and palliative care. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated to improve symptoms and quality of life of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. These benefits are not necessarily associated with physiological improvement and have not been shown to improve mortality. In this sense, its goals are palliative. Rehabilitation programs assess patients' knowledge of their diseases, degree of symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, understanding of common therapies, and capacity for exercise. The exercise component of pulmonary rehabilitation improves function within the rehabilitation setting and may translate to increased activity at home for some patients. The programs also offer additional opportunities to identify for referring providers potentially undetected underlying comorbidities such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression, which contribute to a poor quality of life for many patients. In addition, patients and their caregivers can be encouraged to ask questions about interventions during exacerbations, the meaning of advance care planning, and goals for end of life care with the intent that these dialogues will lead to further discussions with their doctors and families.

Vagal paraganglioma: imaging versus intraoperative findings. A 59-year-old woman presented with a mass on the jugulo-digastric level. Inspection of the oral cavity showed medial bulging of the left pharyngeal wall and tonsil. Transcutaneous ultrasonography showed a vascular tumor of the parapharyngeal space with complete encirclement of the internal carotid artery. Magnetic resonance angiography and common carotid angiography showed the bloody support from the external carotid artery of that tumor. During the surgical procedure, we identified the tumor, who arises from the vagus nerve and who had multiple fine arterial branches from the internal carotid artery until the skull base. We performed complete resection of the parapharyngeal tumor, by transcervical approach, with sacrificed the vagus nerve. The histopathological report showed a vagal paraganglioma. After one year is no sign of recurrence.

Nickel-quinolones interaction. Part 2--interaction of nickel(II) with the antibacterial drug oxolinic acid. The mononuclear nickel(II) complexes with the first-generation quinolone antibacterial agent oxolinic acid in the presence or absence of nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands (2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. The experimental data suggest that oxolinic acid acts as deprotonated bidentate ligand coordinated to Ni(II) ion through the ketone and carboxylato oxygens. The crystal structure of (2,2'-bipyridine)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II), 2 has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The cyclic voltammograms of the complexes recorded in dmso solution and in 1/2 dmso/buffer (containing 150mM NaCl and 15mM trisodium citrate at pH 7.0) solution have shown that in the presence of calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) they can bind to CT DNA by the intercalative binding mode. UV study of the interaction of the complexes with CT DNA has shown that the complexes bind to CT DNA and bis(aqua)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II) exhibits the highest binding constant to CT DNA. Competitive study with ethidium bromide (EB) has shown that the complexes can displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human or bovine serum albumin protein having relatively high binding constant values.

A silica-supported iron oxide catalyst capable of activating hydrogen peroxide at neutral pH values. Iron oxides catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) into oxidants capable of transforming recalcitrant contaminants. Unfortunately, the process is relatively inefficient at circumneutral pH values because of competing reactions that decompose H(2)O(2) without producing oxidants. Silica- and alumina-containing iron oxides prepared by sol-gel processing of aqueous solutions containing Fe(ClO(4))(3), AlCl(3), and tetraethyl orthosilicate efficiently catalyzed the decomposition of H(2)O(2) into oxidants capable of transforming phenol at circumneutral pH values. Relative to hematite, goethite, and amorphous FeOOH, the silica-iron oxide catalyst exhibited a stoichiometric efficiency, defined as the number of moles of phenol transformed per mole of H(2)O(2) consumed, which was 10-40 times higher than that of the iron oxides. The silica-alumina-iron oxide catalyst had a stoichiometric efficiency that was 50-80 times higher than that of the iron oxides. The significant enhancement in oxidant production is attributable to the interaction of Fe with Al and Si in the mixed oxides, which alters the surface redox processes, favoring the production of strong oxidants during H(2)O(2) decomposition.

Probabilistic prediction of the human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism sites. This article briefly introduces the results of in silico prediction of the most probable metabolism sites for the human cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. Ligand-based QSAR models have been developed using a novel GALAS modeling approach, and provide probabilities of being a target of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 for any atom in a molecule. The GALAS-model development methodology allows evaluation of the reliability of predictions in the form of estimated prediction Reliability Indices (RIs). For all the models considered in this study, the number of misclassifications and inconclusive results was reduced significantly when only predictions of high quality (RI>0.5) were taken into account, demonstrating that RI reflects accuracy of prediction. The applicability domain of regioselectivity models is shown to be easily expandable to cover compound classes of interest to the user. The results obtained so far show promising perspectives for the utilization of the GALAS modeling in the analysis of regioselectivity for other important biotransformation enzymes--a work currently in progress.

[Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in patients consulting urological clinics: the ENJEU survey (one day national survey on prevalence of male sexual dysfunction among men consulting urologists)]. The objective of this survey was to describe medical reasons disclosed by men over 18 years old when visiting an urologist, to estimate the prevalence of male sexual dysfunction (MSD) including erectile dysfunction (ED) and to describe treatment options for ED. This survey was performed, with Urology French Association (AFU) partnership, in 150 urological clinics, sample representative of urologists in France regarding age, geographical distribution and practice. The survey was proposed to all adults' men consulting a participating urologist the defined day (Tuesday the 19th of June 2007 or an imminent day). A total of 1848 (92.5%) patients agreed to participate; analysis was performed on 1740 patients. Information related to urological disorders, sexual dysfunctions, their treatment and their impact on the patient's life were gathered by a patient auto-questionnaire. Erectile dysfunction was assessed through the single question of John B. McKinlay. Among patients (mean age 63+/-14 years), 68% (IC95%=[65.2%; 70.7%]) had ED (44% severe); 25% were treated (of which 2/3 with IPDE5 alone or in association). Male sexual dysfunction was the first reason for visiting urologists (14%) following prostatic diseases (62%). About 60% of the patients had already talked about their ED to a physician, who was an urologist in 44.6% of cases. The perspective of living the rest of their life with this trouble was "unacceptable" for 21.1% of patients with ED and "fairly acceptable" for 34.4%. This first survey in French urologists' community emphasizes the high prevalence male sexual dysfunctions for inpatients visiting their urologists. Despite declared urologists' interest for male sexual dysfunction, the discrepancy between the high prevalence of ED and the low rate of patients consulting for this condition probably explains the low rate of patients using treatments.

A better parameter in predicting insulin resistance: obesity plus elevated alanine aminotransferase. To investigate the association of obesity and elevated alanine aminotransferase with insulin resistance and compare these factors with metabolic syndrome. We enrolled a total of 1308 male workers aged from 22 to 63 years. Data was extracted from the workers' periodic health check-ups in hospitals. All cases were from the community of northern Taiwan. This was a cross-sectional observational study from July to September in 2004. We grouped all cases into four groups, based on the quartile of homeostasis model assessment. The top fourth quartile group was defined as the group with insulin resistance. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis for the odds ratio of the risk factors for insulin resistance. Compared with metabolic syndrome, the coexistence of both factors had a 4.3-fold (95% CI: 2.7-6.8) increased risk, which was more than metabolic syndrome with a 3.6-fold (95% CI: 2.6-5.0) increased risk. The two factors had a synergistic effect. The synergistic index of obesity and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.01-4.3). Obesity and elevated ALT are associated with insulin resistance. The effects are synergistic. Coexistence of them is better than metabolic syndrome in predicting insulin resistance.

Variability of marker-based rectal dose evaluation in HDR cervical brachytherapy. In film-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer, position of the rectal markers may not accurately represent the anterior rectal wall. This study was aimed at analyzing the variability of rectal dose estimation as a result of interfractional variation of marker placement. A cohort of five patients treated with multiple-fraction tandem and ovoid high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy was studied. The cervical os point and the orientation of the applicators were matched among all fractional plans for each patient. Rectal points obtained from all fractions were then input into each clinical treated plan. New fractional rectal doses were obtained and a new cumulative rectal dose for each patient was calculated. The maximum interfractional variation of distances between rectal dose points and the closest source positions was 1.1 cm. The corresponding maximum variability of fractional rectal dose was 65.5%. The percentage difference in cumulative rectal dose estimation for each patient was 5.4%, 19.6%, 34.6%, 23.4%, and 13.9%, respectively. In conclusion, care should be taken when using rectal markers as reference points for estimating rectal dose in HDR cervical brachytherapy. The best estimate of true rectal dose for each fraction should be determined by the most anterior point among all fractions.

The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and the multidimensional approach. A new look at the older patient with gastroenterological disorders. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, usually interdisciplinary, diagnostic process intended to determine an elderly person's medical, psychosocial, and functional capacity and problems with the objective of developing an overall plan for treatment and short- and long-term follow-up. The potential usefulness of the CGA in evaluating treatment and follow-up of older patients with gastroenterological disorders is unknown. In the paper we reported the efficacy of a Multidimensional-Prognostic Index (MPI), calculated from information collected by a standardized CGA, in predicting mortality risk in older patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and liver cirrhosis. Patients underwent a CGA that included six standardized scales, i.e. Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Short-Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Exton-Smith Score (ESS) and Comorbity Index Rating Scale (CIRS), as well as information on medication history and cohabitation, for a total of 63 items. The MPI was calculated from the integrated total scores and expressed as MPI 1=low risk, MPI 2=moderate risk and MPI 3=severe risk of mortality. Higher MPI values were significantly associated with higher short- and long-term mortality in older patients with both upper gastrointestinal bleeding and liver cirrhosis. A close agreement was found between the estimated mortality by MPI and the observed mortality. Moreover, MPI seems to have a greater discriminatory power than organ-specific prognostic indices such as Rockall and Blatchford scores (in upper gastrointestinal bleeding patients) and Child-Plugh score (in liver cirrhosis patients). All these findings support the concept that a multidimensional approach may be appropriate for the evaluation of older patients with gastroenterological disorders, like it has been reported for patients with other pathological conditions.

High-sensitive flow-based kinetic exclusion assay for okadaic acid assessment in shellfish samples. Episodes of shellfish contamination with okadaic acid (OA) are a human health threat that is causing increasing concern. As a way to overcome the shortcomings involved in the reference methods of analysis set by legislations, alternative procedures are envisaged. This paper describes the development of different immunosensors for the analysis of OA, focusing on the comparison of their sensitivity, precision, ease of use and sample matrix effects. Initially, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunosensor was developed, which enabled the quantification of the toxin in mussel samples at concentrations in the range of the 160 microg kg(-1) European regulatory limit with good percentages of recovery. Nevertheless, calibration curves with spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effects could not be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based on kinetic exclusion measurements was developed achieving the theoretical lowest limit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA antibody (IC(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in the assay solution). This highly sensitive automated system allows rapid and reliable OA quantification, with no significant matrix effects for the analysis of spiked mussel and scallop samples. Performance features such as high sensitivity and precision, low limits of detection and simplicity of the analysis protocol, shows the biosensing-systems based on kinetic exclusion measurements for toxin detection in shellfish samples as highly performing tools for rapid and continuous screening.


Cranial volume, mild cognitive deficits, and functional limitations associated with diabetes in a community sample.

Comparison of two carbonated apatite ceramics in vivo. Carbonated apatite ceramics, with a composition similar to that of bone mineral, are potentially interesting synthetic bone graft substitutes. In the present study, two porous carbonated apatite ceramics were developed, characterized and tested for their bone repair capacity and osteoinductive potential in a goat model. Although the two ceramics were prepared from a similar starting powder, their physico-chemical and structural characteristics differed as a consequence of different preparation methods. Both ceramics had an open and interconnected porous structure with a porosity of about 80%. The morphology of the surface of CA-A and CA-B at the submicron level differed significantly: CA-A consisted of irregular grains with a size of 5-20microm, with 1-10microm large micropores among the grains, whereas CA-B surface consisted of much smaller and regular shaped grains (0.05-0.5microm), with most micropores smaller than 1microm. The specific surface area of CA-B was about 10 times larger than that of CA-A due to its significantly smaller grain size. CA-A and CA-B ceramics contained 3 and 5 wt.% of B-type carbonated apatite, respectively. Although neither ceramic succeeded in completely bridging the 17mm iliac wing defect with new bone after 12weeks of implantation, CA-A showed significantly more bone formation in the pores of the implant than CA-B. The total area percentage of new bone in the total defect area was 12.7+/-1.81 and 5.51+/-1.37 (mean+/-SEM) for CA-A and CA-B, respectively. Intramuscular implantation of the ceramics led to ectopic bone formation by CA-A in all three implanted specimens, in contrast to CA-B, where no new bone was observed in any of the 11 animals. CA-A showed a more pronounced degradation than CA-B both in vitro and in vivo at both implantation sites, which was unexpected based on the physico-chemical and structural properties of the two ceramics. Both physico-chemical and structural properties of the ceramics could, dependently or independently, have affected their in vivo behaviour, emphasizing the importance to control individual parameters for successful bone repair.

Diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a primary care clinic. Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and internationally. The purpose of this study was to describe spirometry use in the diagnosis of COPD and to evaluate the management of COPD occurring in a primary care clinic. Two hundred patients with a diagnosis of COPD attending a university-based family medicine clinic were randomly chosen for a retrospective medical record review. Pulmonary function testing, provision of smoking cessation advice and pharmacological management were compared to the recommendations of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. Mean age was 65.4 years, 48% were male and 72% were Caucasian. Overall, 58.5% (n = 117) of patients had pulmonary function testing, with 60.7% acknowledged in the outpatient record; 55% (n = 110) were receiving medications in combinations that are recommended; and 40% of patients were receiving stage appropriate medications. 67.8% of current smokers were offered smoking cessation advice or treatment. Overall there was low use of recommended medication combinations and stage appropriate treatment, with better observance of diagnostic and risk factor reduction guidelines. In order to improve COPD care for patients, physicians need education about the recommended stepwise treatment options and office systems that promote integration of pulmonary function testing findings into care.

Neonatal tumours in Malaysia: a call for heightened awareness. Neonatal neoplasms are rare tumours notorious for their atypical presentation and unpredictable behaviour. Their optimal treatment remains uncertain, a dilemma compounded by the deleterious effects of adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy during this vulnerable period of growth. This paper examined the relatively high incidence of these tumours and its impact on paediatric surgery in Malaysia. Neonatal tumours treated at the Department of Paediatric Surgery, Kuala Lumpur Hospital over an 8-year period were retrospectively analysed. Besides data pertaining to patient demographics, distribution of tumour types and survival rates, morbidity from disease as well as treatment was emphasised in particular. The 28 neonatal tumours, majority of which were sacrococcygeal teratoma, constituted 7% of all tumours treated by the unit. Surgical excision remained the mainstay of treatment. Mortality and morbidity from disease and treatment were not insignificant, at 7 and 29%, respectively. The outcome of neonatal tumours treated in Malaysia appeared to be influenced by indigenous factors unique to the local healthcare setting. Several solutions were expounded, chief among these are strategies of improved and earlier detection, in addition to the centralisation of expertise for this group of tumours.

Relatedness of Macrophomina phaseolina isolates from tallgrass prairie, maize, soybean and sorghum. Agricultural and wild ecosystems may interact through shared pathogens such as Macrophomina phaseolina, a generalist clonal fungus with more than 284 plant hosts that is likely to become more important under climate change scenarios of increased heat and drought stress. To evaluate the degree of subdivision in populations of M. phaseolina in Kansas agriculture and wildlands, we compared 143 isolates from maize fields adjacent to tallgrass prairie, nearby sorghum fields, widely dispersed soybean fields and isolates from eight plant species in tallgrass prairie. Isolate growth phenotypes were evaluated on a medium containing chlorate. Genetic characteristics were analysed based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms and the sequence of the rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The average genetic similarity was 58% among isolates in the tallgrass prairie, 71% in the maize fields, 75% in the sorghum fields and 80% in the dispersed soybean fields. The isolates were divided into four clusters: one containing most of the isolates from maize and soybean, two others containing isolates from wild plants and sorghum, and a fourth containing a single isolate recovered from Solidago canadensis in the tallgrass prairie. Most of the sorghum isolates had the dense phenotype on media containing chlorate, while those from other hosts had either feathery or restricted phenotypes. These results suggest that the tallgrass prairie supports a more diverse population of M. phaseolina per area than do any of the crop species. Subpopulations show incomplete specialization by host. These results also suggest that inoculum produced in agriculture may influence tallgrass prairie communities, and conversely that different pathogen subpopulations in tallgrass prairie can interact there to generate 'hybrids' with novel genetic profiles and pathogenic capabilities.

Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract fraction 2 and povidone-iodine induced changes in the cyst of Acanthamoeba spp.: light and electron microscopic studies. To compare the minimal cysticidal concentration (MCC) between Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract fraction 2 and Povidone-lodine (PVP-I) on the Acanthamoeba cyst and to illustrate the morphological changes of the cyst after being treated by light and electron microscopies. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from patients with Acanthamoeba keratitis and cultured on a non-nutrient agar plate (NNA) seeded with heat killed Escherichia coli (NNA-E.coli) at 37 degrees C for 7 days, adjusted to a final concentration of 10(4) cysts/ml. Several concentrations of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract were tested to find the minimal cysticidal concentrations (MCC) of both agents, at these concentrations there was no viable cyst which was confirmed by no excystment after further incubation for 7 days. The cysts were prepared for routine transmission and scanning electron microscopic studies. Structural damages of the treated cysts by MCC of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract showed a series of damages. Starting from shrinkage, destruction or rupture of the cyst walls and opercula, withdrawal of the cytoplasm or edema cyst by the outside solution passed through the damaged wall caused a decrease in wrinkle ridges of the ectocyst. Then the cyst was ripped and torn into small pieces MCC of PVP-I solution and the fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract were 0.04% and 1:4, respectively. The structural damages were somewhat similar, such as the shrinkage, ruptured cyst wall and opercula, edema and end by breaking up of the cyst wall and degeneration of the inside cytosol. Pouzolzia indica may be modified as an effective disinfectant solution for a contact lens case if the active ingredients are more purified.

The 2009 Carl Ludwig Lecture: Pathophysiology of the human sympathetic nervous system in cardiovascular diseases: the transition from mechanisms to medical management. Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regional sympathetic activity is best studied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (multiunit or single fiber recording) and by isotope dilution-derived measurement of organ-specific norepinephrine release to plasma (regional "norepinephrine spillover"). Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system abnormalities are crucial in the development of cardiovascular disorders, notably heart failure, essential hypertension, disorders of postural circulatory control causing syncope, and "psychogenic heart disease," heart disease attributable to mental stress and psychiatric illness. These abnormalities involve persistent, adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in heart failure and hypertension, episodic or ongoing cardiac sympathetic activation in psychogenic heart disease, and defective sympathetic circulatory reflexes in disorders of postural circulatory control. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this "mechanisms-to-management" transition is at differing stages of development with the different conditions. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension, perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. With psychogenic heart disease and postural syncope syndromes, knowledge of the neural pathophysiology is emerging, but clinical translation remains for the future.

Changes in regional blood flow induced by unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) were investigated in 7 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 4 men and 3 women (mean age 62.3 +/- 8.1 years), who underwent rCBF measurement by N-isopropyl-p-(iodine-123)-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography at rest before and after unilateral STN DBS preoperatively in the on-drug condition, and postoperatively in the on-drug and on-stimulation condition. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify significant changes in rCBF from the preoperative to the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingulate cortices and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bilateral medial frontal cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilateral STN DBS produced rCBF changes in the bilateral cingulate cortices, cerebellar hemispheres, and medial frontal cortices. These findings indicate that unilateral STN DBS affects rCBF in both hemispheres.

Mirror lenses in light microscopy--theoretical considerations and practical implications. Various types of mirror lenses were developed some decades ago designed for several special tasks in microscopy. When compared with high-end glass lenses, mirror lenses lead to an extraordinary image quality because of their supraapochromatic color fidelity and their high planarity; the working distances are significantly longer, and in most cases, the depth of field and resolution are higher than in concurrent glass lenses. In this respect, the microscopic advantages of mirror lenses seem to be comparable with the advantages of mirror telescopes in astronomy; for in observations of celestial bodies, mirror telescopes lead to better results than refractors based on glass lenses. When mirror lenses are available in light microscopy, not only common illumination modes can be carried out in transmitted or incident light, but also new and specific axial illumination techniques can be utilized, which cannot be achieved with normal glass lenses. This axial illumination, called "luminance contrast," can be carried out in various modes, so that the resulting images can be compared with dark-field, phase or interference-contrast images. In all variants, especially, fine details within transparent specimens can be visible in maximized contrast and resolution, and blooming or haloing artifacts are significantly reduced or absent. These findings are based on theoretical consideration, and intensive practical tests carried out with several mirror lenses constructed in various optical designs. All in all, supramicroscopic image qualities could be expected if mirror lenses were produced based on the optimized manufacturing techniques available nowadays.

Intranasal immunization with a proteoliposome-derived cochleate containing recombinant gD protein confers protective immunity against genital herpes in mice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of intranasal (IN) immunization with Neisseria meningitides B proteoliposome (AFPL1) and AFPL1-derived cochleate (AFCo1), containing glycoprotein D (gD) of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) for induction of protective immunity against genital herpes infection in mice. We could show that IN immunization with both AFPL1 and AFCo1 containing gD induced gD-specific IgG antibody and lymphoproliferative responses. However, IFN-gamma response could only be detected in CD4(+) splenic cells and genital lymph node cells of the AFCo1gD immunized mice upon recall antigen stimulation in vitro. Importantly, IN immunization with AFCo1gD could elicit a complete protection against an otherwise lethal vaginal challenge with HSV-2, while the AFPL1gD immunized mice were only partially protected. Further, we could show that the IFN-gamma response and protective immunity observed after IN immunization with AFCo1gD are mediated via the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88. These data may have implications for the development of a mucosal vaccine against genital herpes.

Congenital anomalies of the uterine cervix: lessons from 30 cases managed clinically by a common protocol. To outline the anatomic variations of malformations of the uterine cervix and to discuss the clinical management of cervical agenesis and dysgenesis. Thirty patients who were treated for cervical malformations in six institutions during a 69-year interval are reviewed. Hospital-based tertiary-care reproductive endocrine infertility units. Thirty women with congenital uterine-cervical anomalies. Exploratory laparotomy with cervicovaginal reconstruction or hysterectomy. All surgical findings were carefully reviewed to determine the anatomic characteristics of the malformed cervix. When cervical reconstruction was performed, the patient was followed to determine the need for reoperation or if the patient achieved a pregnancy. Patients lacked a cervix (cervical agenesis) or had one of three variants of cervical dysgenesis. Patients with cervical dysgenesis were characterized as having: 1) an intact cervical body with obstruction of the cervical os; 2) a cervical body consisting of a fibrous band or cord; or 3) cervical fragmentation. One patient conceived after reconstruction. Reoperation was less likely to occur among women who had an obstructed endocervical canal but an otherwise normal cervical body. There are two forms of anatomic congenital cervical malformations, the second of which may be considered as three distinct variations.

[The application of the theory of narcissism in criminal proceedings (forensic theory of narcissism)]. The concept of narcissism was introduced by Freud's psychoanalysis and is founded on a solid biological basis today, namely the so-called happiness hormones (endorphins, serotonin etc.), which generate happiness, joy and other positive feelings in the human being. By setting rules as to which actions are socially accepted and appreciated and thus associated with a positive feedback, society is able to promote the desirable behaviour and effectively control the integration of the individual into society. Happiness can be sought either in professional or in private life. Negative experiences in one of these fields can be compensated by positive experiences in the other. By means of a case, in which bottled-up narcissistic rage led to a state of severely impaired consciousness, the applicability of the forensic theory of narcissism in criminal law is illustrated and discussed. Depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders, personality changes after extremely stressful situations and non-substance addictions such as computer addiction can be better understood on the basis of Kohut's model of the narcissistic balance of satisfaction.

Occurrence of chromosomal aneuploidy in rabbit oocytes and embryos at different developmental stages. The aim of our study was to analyse chromosomal aneuploidy occurrence in rabbit oocytes and embryos. Chromosomal analysis was done in rabbit oocytes and rabbit preimplantation embryos at 2-, 4- and 8-cell stages derived from in vivo fertilization. For mitotic cycle synchronization at the metaphase stage, 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos were incubated in k-DMEM medium, supplemented with colcemid (1 microg/ml), for 7, 12 or 13h respectively. Success of metaphase synchronization was at values of 100, 86.1 and 92.2% for 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos respectively. Recovery rate of analysable metaphase plates was reached at 58.8%, 83.9% and 59.8% for 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos and 100% for oocytes. Significant difference (p < 0.01) in aneuploidy rate between oocytes (40.7%) and 2-cell embryos (62.5%) was found. These results demonstrate higher efficiency of synchronization of embryo cells at the metaphase stage, what may contribute to elevating the proportion of analysable nuclei.

Validation of a TAI Short Form with an adolescent sample. Although test anxiety is increasingly used in research with multiple constructs, it is not always possible to administer a lengthy scale to measure it. Taylor and Deane (2002) developed a 5-item short form of the 20-item Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; see Spielberger, Gonzalez, Taylor, Algaze, & Anton, 1978). Although evidence of reliability and validity was good, there were several limitations, including the age and gender of the sample, and the lack of data obtained with the short form rather than the original TAI. The current study attempts to address those limitations and augment previous results with additional types of validity evidence (i.e., coefficients of divergent validity and exploratory factor analysis) in a sample of 152 seventh- and eighth-graders. Results were high reliability (.86) and good evidence of multiple facets of validity. Previous results were confirmed and extended for adolescents and for use in applied psychological and educational settings.

Hydrogen peroxide mediates the expression of ascorbate-related genes in response to methanol stimulation in Oncidium. We investigated the signaling role of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in regulating the ascorbate (AsA) level after exogenous methanol (MeOH) application. The endogenous H(2)O(2) and AsA levels as well as the expression of related genes were monitored after MeOH treatment of cultures of Oncidium protocorm-like bodies (PLB). A high MeOH concentration was deleterious and caused irreversible consumption of endogenous AsA. However, a low MeOH concentration (50mM) triggered the synthesis of H(2)O(2) and was effective in enhancing the expression of AsA-biosynthetic genes of the Smirnoff-Wheeler and galacturonate (GalUA) pathways. The increased expression of these genes could be blocked by the addition of hydroxylamine, an inhibitor of alcohol oxidase (EC: 1.1.3.13), and diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (EC: 1.6.3.1). Thus, the H(2)O(2) generated by MeOH application is a product of MeOH detoxification through alcohol oxidase and NADPH oxidase activation. In this chain, H(2)O(2) acts as a secondary messenger for the activation of AsA-related genes. Our results reveal the signaling function of H(2)O(2) and cellular AsA homeostasis in Oncidium orchids in response to MeOH stimulation. A mechanism for the MeOH effect on AsA production is suggested.

Cost-effectiveness of the Boston keratoprosthesis. To conduct a cost-utility analysis and determine the cost-effectiveness of the Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston Kpro). Retrospective cohort study. setting: The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary corneal service. patients: Inclusion required a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients with autoimmune diseases and chemical burns were excluded. Eighty-two patients were included with various indications for surgery. intervention: The keratoprosthesis is a collar button-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) device consisting of 2 curved plates sandwiched around a corneal donor (allo)graft. The device is assembled intraoperatively and sutured to a patient's eye after removing the diseased cornea. Average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was determined by cost-utility analysis, using expected-value calculations and time-tradeoff utilities. The comparative effectiveness, or gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), was also sought. Cost-effectiveness was compared to recently published data on penetrating keratoplasty (PK). A total discounted incremental QALY gain for the Boston Kpro of 0.763 correlated with a conferred QALY gain of 20.3% for the average patient. The average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was $16 140 per QALY. Comparable to corneal transplantation, with a cost-effectiveness between $12 000 and $16 000 per QALY, the keratoprosthesis can be considered highly cost-effective.

Memory for actions of an event: older and younger adults compared. Previous studies have shown increased false memory effects in older compared to younger adults. To investigate this phenomenon in event memory, in the present study, the authors presented younger and older adults with a robbery. A distinction was made between verbal and visual actions of the event, and recognition and subjective experience of retrieval (remember/know/guess judgments) were analyzed. Although there were no differences in hits, older adults accepted more false information as true and, consequently, showed less accurate recognition than younger adults. Moreover, older adults were more likely than younger adults to accompany these errors with remember judgments. Young adults accepted fewer false verbal actions than visual ones and awarded fewer remember judgments to their false alarms for verbal than for visual actions. Older adults, however, did not show this effect of type of information. These results suggest that aging is a relevant factor in memory for real-life eyewitness situations.

Macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha/CCL-20 is transcriptionally induced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine in human mononuclear phagocytes through nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Alterations in iron availability can trigger pro-inflammatory signals in various cell types. We demonstrate that desferrioxamine (DFX), an iron chelator used in clinics for the treatment of iron overload, neoplasias, and Alzheimer disease, stimulates the expression and secretion of CCL20, a chemoattractant for immature dendritic cells, activated/memory T lymphocytes, and naive B cells, in primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Iron chelation was part of the mechanism by which DFX induced CCL20, because addition of iron sulfate counteracted its stimulatory effects. Functional studies of the CCL20 promoter, using a series of 5'-deleted and mutated reporter constructs, demonstrated that CCL20 mRNA induction was dependent on gene transcription activation and mediated by the NF-kappaB pathway. The NF-kappaB element located at position -92/-82 of the CCL20 promoter was required for gene transactivation by DFX because: (i) transcription was abrogated by a 3bp mutation of the NF-kappaB-binding motif; (ii) treatment with DFX increased specific NF-kappaB binding to this sequence. Nuclear translocation of both NF-kappaBp65 and NF-kappaBp50 family members was increased in response to DFX and associated with I-kappaBalpha degradation, suggesting a role for these subunits in CCL20 promoter transactivation. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that iron chelation can transcriptionally induce CCL20 in mononuclear phagocytes and identify the NF-kappaB binding site as a regulatory sequence of the CCL20 promoter that is activated by iron deprivation. These results add new insights into our understanding of the mechanisms by which iron perturbations affect mononuclear phagocyte immune functions and regulate inflammatory responses.

[Adolescence, substance abuse and suicide attempt by jumping from a window]. Suicide represents, in France, the second cause of death in youth aged 15 to 24. Sixteen per cent of juvenile mortality is attributable to suicide. The annual incidence of suicide attempts in this age group is estimated at about 40 000 cases. Jumping from high represents 6% of deaths from suicide: girls resort to this method twice as often as boys. The severity of somatic consequences and the frequency of sequels following a jumping from a window can hold center stage for a long time, at the risk of trivializing the psychopathology underlying such a violent acting-out. These clinical situations particularly involve a multidisciplinary follow up including an early and active participation of psychiatric consultation-liaison teams. Jumping from a window can occur even apart from established mental disorders, such as psychotic or mood disorders. Our four case-reports draw attention to risk factors represented by: substance abuse (alcohol, cannabis, but also cocaine, ecstasy...), the notion of previous suicide attempts and various drive disorders having a self-harm value or displaying an underlying impulsiveness (eating disorders, scarifications, shoplifting, running away...), the precipitating role of a recent loss of a parent or an important removal from family environment, the potential influence, especially in this age group, of spectacular cases of suicide amplified by the Medias ("Werther effect"). Paradoxically, to belong to a well-off milieu can also contribute to the risk of such acting-out, when parents replace affection and availability by an easy access to various consumer goods and a permissive education, thus opening the way to the encounter with different substances.

[Determination of the detergent efficiency of the detergents disinfecting for surfaces]. Since the disinfecting activity of disinfectants is evaluated by standards, the intrinsic detergent activity is not easily quantifiable and no standard have been suggested yet. Beyond the physicochemical parameters like wettability or foaming presented by the manufacturers, it appears necessary to us to objectively measure the real effect of the detergent agent. The objective of our work is to propose a simple, fast and reproducible method to evaluate detersive activity of the disinfecting detergents. We measured three factors (total amount of extracted bacteria, extraction efficiency and slope of extracting curve) by using Rodac prints technique on two different supports (PVC, stainless steel) that have been contaminated by either E. coli or S. aureus. An increasing mark from 1 to 6 is given to each of these factors in case of statistically differences. The three factors allowed us to calculate a "Specific Index of detersion" (SI) for each germ/support couple (3 to 18). Addition of the marks given to each couple for each disinfecting detergent allowed to calculate a "Globally Index of detersion" (GI) (9 to 72). We tested 4 commercialised disinfecting detergents: Surfanios, Aniosurf, Major C100 and Ecodiol. All detergents may be classified according to their effectiveness on a bacterium/support couple (value of the SI). This enlights a specific spectrum for each disinfecting detergents. As a result, Ecodiol seems to be the most effective deterging agent on 3 of the 4 germ/support couples (S. aureus/PVC, E. coli/PVC and E. coli/stainless steel), whereas Aniosurf is most effective on the S. aureus/stainless steel couple. The GI is very useful to choose the best compromise between activities for all situations. GI rankings of the tested agents were as follows: water < Aniosurf < Surfanios < neutralizing < Major C100 < Ecodiol. This experimental model will be used to test and compare the intrinsic detergent activities of other commercialised products which are usually used for the biocleaning of the medical devices (i.e. endoscopes or reusable dialysis device).

Suppression of food intake by intracerebroventricular injection of alpha-MSH varies with age in rats. During the aging process of mammals first a phase of obesity and increased adiposity is observed in middle-aged subjects, then anorexia and loss of body weight (sarcopenia) at old age. A possible age-dependence of the anorexigenic alpha-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (alpha-MSH) in these regulatory changes was studied. Male Wistar rats aged 6-8 weeks (juvenile), 3-4 months (young adult), 6 and 12 months (middle-aged), and 24-26 months (old) were equipped with chronic cannula to the lateral cerebral ventricle. The effect of 5 microg alpha-MSH injected through the cannula was analyzed on food intake evoked by 24-h food deprivation. Juvenile rats seemed almost resistant to alpha-MSH (21.9% suppression). In young adults alpha-MSH suppressed food intake by 68.7%. However, the alpha-MSH-induced anorexia was significantly less pronounced in middle-aged (55.7% or 26.4% in rats aged 6 or 12 months, respectively), and much more pronounced (73.3%) in old rats. The adiposity (judged by the relative amount of perirenal fat) increased until middle-age, but did not change between middle-age and old-age. It is concluded that changes in alpha-MSH responsiveness possibly contribute to both the age-related obesity in middle-aged rats and to the anorexia of old ones: first the adiposity then the age may be the important factor.

Outcomes after arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair. Although a number of reports have documented outcomes after open revision rotator cuff repair, there are few studies reporting results after arthroscopic revision. Arthroscopic repair of failed rotator cuff results in significant improvement in shoulder functional outcome and pain relief. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Multiple variables including demographic data, the number of prior ipsilateral shoulder surgeries, and tear size were recorded from chart review. An independent examiner then measured shoulder strength, range of motion, and shoulder functional outcome scores including American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog pain scale. Paired t tests were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative measures. Additionally, contingency table analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for failure of repair requiring further surgery and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score less than 50. Fifty-four patients (88.5%) were available for follow-up evaluation with a mean age of 54.9 +/- 10.1 years (range, 22.7-82.5 years) and a mean follow-up of 31.1 +/- 11.9 months. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 43.8 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) before revision to 68.1 +/- 7.2 at final follow-up (P = .0039). The Simple Shoulder Test improved significantly from 3.56 +/- 0.8 before surgery to 7.5 +/- 1.1 at most recent follow-up (P < .0001). Visual analog pain scale scores improved from 5.17 +/- 0.8 to 2.75 +/- 0.8 (P = .03), and forward elevation increased from 121.0 degrees +/- 12.3 degrees to 136 degrees +/- 11.8 degrees postoperatively (P = .025). Greater than 1 prior shoulder surgery was associated with cases that required additional surgery (P = .031). Female gender (P = .007) and preoperative abduction less than 90 masculine (P = .009) were associated with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores less than 50. Arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair may be a reasonable treatment option even after prior open repairs and provides both improved pain relief and shoulder function. Nonetheless, results are not completely optimal. Female patients and those who have undergone more than 1 ipsilateral shoulder surgery are at increased risk for poorer results.

[Feasibility study for whole plant medicinal use of Tribulus terrestris]. The content differences of leaf, plant and fruit of Tribulus terrestris was compared to study the feasibility of whole plant medicinal use. The samples were collected in three typical habitats and six different production areas of T. terrestris. The main medicinal ingredients saponins and flavonoids were determined in root, stem, leaf and fruit during the harvest time. The two ingredients were abounded in leaf and more than 2.61 times as in other parts of the plant. The results showed that there were no differences between the whole plant and the fruit. It should pay more attentions on the collection, preservation and utilization of the leaf of T. terrestris in the harvesting and processing stage. The whole plant for medical use was feasibility based on the content of the ingredients.

Acute myocarditis: can novel echocardiographic techniques assist with diagnosis? Two-dimensional echocardiography has historically played a limited role in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis because of a lack of specific diagnostic features. The emergence of novel echocardiographic modalities such as strain and myocardial perfusion imaging have greatly augmented the scope of echocardiography, permitting the assessment of myocardial contractility, blood flow, and microvascular integrity. However, the application of these cutting-edge techniques in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis is still at a nascent stage. We present a case of acute myocarditis where echo-based strain imaging/mapping and real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography enabled the detection of regional contractile and perfusion abnormalities, not otherwise apparent with conventional echocardiography. These findings and the final diagnosis were later confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. This case highlights the potential utility of novel echocardiographic techniques in the diagnostic workup of acute myocarditis and underscores the need for prospective studies to assess the sensitivity and specificity of these newer technologies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a multimodality echocardiographic approach towards the diagnosis of myocarditis.

Evaluation of the microcirculatory disturbance of biliary ischemia after liver transplantation with contrast-enhanced ultrasound: preliminary experience.

The effects of forestry on Hg bioaccumulation in nemoral/boreal waters and recommendations for good silvicultural practice. Mercury (Hg) levels are alarmingly high in fish from lakes across Fennoscandia and northern North America. The few published studies on the ways in which silviculture practices influence this problem indicate that forest operations increase Hg in downstream aquatic ecosystems. From these studies, we estimate that between one-tenth and one-quarter of the Hg in the fish of high-latitude, managed forest landscapes can be attributed to harvesting. Forestry, however, did not create the elevated Hg levels in the soils, and waterborne Hg/MeHg concentrations downstream from harvested areas are similar to those from wetlands. Given the current understanding of the way in which silviculture impacts Hg cycling, most of the recommendations for good forest practice in Sweden appear to be appropriate for high-latitude regions, e.g., leaving riparian buffer zones, as well as reducing disturbance at stream crossings and in moist areas. The recommendation to restore wetlands and reduce drainage, however, will likely increase Hg/MeHg loadings to aquatic ecosystems.

A preliminary study of solid embryonic cerebellar graft survival in adult B6CBA Lurcher mutant and wild type mice.

Interpretation of radiologic abnormalities in patients with chronically infected ingrown toenails with regard to a possible exogenic osteomyelitis. Chronic infection of ingrown toenails may lead to exogenous osteomyelitis. Therefore, plain x-rays are commonly taken in children with significant inflammation. We evaluated the preoperative radiologic findings and their clinical significance, especially with regard to exogenic osteomyelitis. We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent surgery for infected ingrown toenails during a 5-year period. Data collection included the history of infection, preoperative laboratory tests, preoperative x-rays, and intraoperative presentation. One hundred thirty-four patients with infected ingrown nails of the hallux underwent 161 surgical procedures. Mean age at surgery was 14.1 years. Preoperative x-rays were taken in 113 (70.2%) cases. The treating surgeon classified 76 (67.2%) x-rays as negative (no bone affection), 16 (14.2%) as positive (definite bone affection), and 21 (18.6%) as suspicious for bone affection. Only 11 (30%) of 37 children with positive or suspicious x-rays showed bone affection during surgery, which presented as a softening of the cortical bone. None of the children had significantly elevated inflammation markers in the preoperative laboratory tests. Children with positive or suspicious x-rays had a significant longer history of infection compared to those without radiologic abnormalities (8 vs 4.5 weeks mean; P = .024). A reevaluation of the x-rays by an experienced radiologist was undertaken and revealed no case of definite osteolysis. In about one third of all infected ingrown toenails, radiologic changes of the distal phalanx occur. These changes primarily represent periostal reactions. A typical osteomyelitis as a complication of chronically infected ingrown toenails is rare.


In silico methods for physiologically based biokinetic models describing bioactivation and detoxification of coumarin and estragole: implications for risk assessment.

Spike bursts generated by the thermosensitive (cold) neuron from the antennal campaniform sensilla of the ground beetle Platynus assimilis. Responses of the antennal thermosensitive neuron of the ground beetle Platynus assimilis to warming from 20 to 50 degrees C were measured and analysed. During warming, neurons switched from regular spiking to bursting. ISI analysis showed that the number of spikes in the burst and spike frequency within the burst were temperature dependent and may precisely encode unfavourably or dangerously high temperatures in a graded manner. In contrast, regular spikes of the neuron encode moderate temperatures at 20-30 degrees C. The threshold temperature of spike bursting varied in different neurons from 25 to 47 degrees C. As a result, the number of bursting neurons increased with temperature increase. Therefore, in addition to the burst characteristics, the total number of bursting neurons may also contain useful information on external temperature. A relationship between the spike bursts and locomotor activity of the beetles was found which may have importance in behavioural thermoregulation of the species. At 44.4+/-0.6 degrees C, first indications of partial paralysis (of the hind legs) were observed. We emphasize, that in contrast to various sensory systems studied, the thermoreceptor neuron of P. assimilis has a stable and continuous burst train, no temporal information is encoded in the timing of the bursts.


A seroprevalence investigation of chicken astrovirus infections.

Evaluating the effective connectivity of resting state networks using conditional Granger causality. The human brain has been documented to be spatially organized in a finite set of specific coherent patterns, namely resting state networks (RSNs). The interactions among RSNs, being potentially dynamic and directional, may not be adequately captured by simple correlation or anticorrelation. In order to evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, we applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to the RSNs retrieved by independent component analysis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our analysis provided evidence for specific causal influences among the detected RSNs: default-mode, dorsal attention, core, central-executive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. In particular, we identified that self-referential and default-mode networks (DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the human brain functional architecture. Specifically, the former RSN exerted the strongest causal influence over the other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of self-referential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive processing. In quite contrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affected by the other RSNs, which may underlie an integration of information from primary function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies. Overall, our results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied information for a deeper understanding of the brain network dynamics.

ZAP-70 intron1 DNA methylation status: determination by pyrosequencing in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ZAP-70 expression is a strong prognostic indicator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, ZAP-70 quantification by flow cytometry lacks sufficient standardization. Based upon the correlation between ZAP-70 expression and its gene methylation status, we have developed a quantitative pyrosequencing assay for the determination of ZAP-70 methylation adapted for routine use. Methylation in four CpG pairs (C-223, C-243, C-254, and C-267) in the first intron of ZAP-70 is associated with repression of ZAP-70. Moreover, it correlates with CD38 expression (n=111, p<.0001), IgHv mutation status (n=106, p<.0001), time to treatment (p<.0001), and overall survival (p=.0014). Pyrosequencing of ZAP-70 provides a good alternative to flow cytometry.

Massive bilateral adrenal gland metastases from melanoma diagnosed by F18-FDG-PET/CT. We report a case of a 75-year-old man with a history of a malignant melanoma with massive bilateral adrenal gland metastases diagnosed by F18-FDG-PET/CT after 10 years of negative follow-up.

[Pre-collision pain and psychological distress predict poor outcome following acute whiplash trauma--secondary publication]. Patients with acute whiplash trauma were followed to examine if pre-collision pain and psychological distress were associated with reduced work capability and neck pain at 12 month follow-up. Pre-collision unspecified pain was associated with reduced work capability, and neck pain and pre-collision psychological distress was associated with neck pain. In conclusion unspecified pain (as opposed to specified pain) and high accumulation of pre-collision psychological distress (as opposed to a single psychological disorder) before the collision was associated with poor recovery at follow-up.

[CAMDEX-R and dementia diagnosis in Brazil: translation and transcultural adaptation of the informant interview]. The Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly - revised (CAMDEX-R) is an instrument developed in England and used as an aid to the diagnosis of dementia, mainly in its initial forms. It contains nine sections (named from A to I), including a neuropsychological evaluation and an interview with an informant (section H). This kind of interview has proved to be useful in the detection of dementia. To translate and transculturally adapt to Brazilian Portuguese the section H of CAMDEX-R. The section under study is a structured interview, composed by 130 items, applied to an informant aiming at diagnosing a demential state. The study was conducted by the universalist approach, with evaluation of conceptual, item, semantic and operational equivalences. Two independent translations into Portuguese were done by two bilingual Brazilians. Those were backtranslated into English by two bilingual Americans, also independently, without knowing the original version. From the translations, backtranslations and original text, another bilingual Brazilian suggested a synthesis-version. Based on the synthesis-version, a multidisciplinary group of two geriatricians and two gerontologists made the test-version with the transcultural adaptations needed. The test-version was used in the pre-test in the geriatric outpatient department of <<Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro>>, and it was carried out with twenty-five caregivers who were stimulated to comment and paraphrase the questions. The main focus was the items considered by the group of specialists to be of greater difficulty to adapt. The identified problems returned to the group of specialists, who produced the final-version then. The Portuguese version was made with some modifications to the literal translation, aiming at keeping a semantic equivalence to the original interview. The conceptual, item and semantic equivalences were considered established. The operational equivalence is in progress. The concern about our target population's low level of schooling was present during the whole transcultural adaptation process, leading us to choose more popular words. The Brazilian version of CAMDEX-R's Section H was considered suitable for daily clinical use.

Relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of lipophilic N-acyldiamines. We report in this work the preparation and antibacterial evaluation of a series of N-monoacylated diamines against six Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative bacteria. The results obtained showed the existence of relationship between lipophilicity and antibacterial activity of the tested compounds. The best results were obtained against Gram-positive bacteria for compounds having a 10-12 carbons alkyl chain. Compound 4e was the most active against Microccus lentus (MIC=2 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC=4 microg/mL) and Enterobacter aerogenes CDC 1680 (MIC=8 microg/mL).


In vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.

Developmental changes in dopamine neurotransmission in adolescence: behavioral implications and issues in assessment. Adolescence is characterized by increased risk-taking, novelty-seeking, and locomotor activity, all of which suggest a heightened appetitive drive. The neurotransmitter dopamine is typically associated with behavioral activation and heightened forms of appetitive behavior in mammalian species, and this pattern of activation has been described in terms of a neurobehavioral system that underlies incentive-motivated behavior. Adolescence may be a time of elevated activity within this system. This review provides a summary of changes within cortical and subcortical dopaminergic systems that may account for changes in cognition and affect that characterize adolescent behavior. Because there is a dearth of information regarding neurochemical changes in human adolescents, models for assessing links between neurochemical activity and behavior in human adolescents will be described using molecular genetic techniques. Furthermore, we will suggest how these techniques can be combined with other methods such as pharmacology to measure the impact of dopamine activity on behavior and how this relation changes through the lifespan.


[Sleep-wake patterns in Portuguese undergraduates].

Botulinum toxin for the correction of asymmetric crying facies. The clinical hallmark of asymmetric crying facies (ACF) is a symmetric appearance of the oral aperture and lips at rest, but significant depression of one side of the lower lip with animation (crying or smiling). ACF can resolve spontaneously in the first year of life, but surgical intervention may be required at some point to ensure a good cosmetic outcome. The authors report on the successful use of botulinum toxin type A to achieve temporary facial symmetry in two children with ACF with results lasting up to six months and suggest that such treatments may be helpful in providing more time to consider and/or plan surgical intervention.

The oral susceptibility of South African field populations of Culicoides to African horse sickness virus.

Differential ion mobility separations of peptides with resolving power exceeding 50. Differential ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS) separates gas-phase ions by mobility differences with respect to the electric field intensity. A major emerging FAIMS application is the fractionation of proteolytic digests. Using a planar FAIMS unit with helium/nitrogen mixtures, we have increased FAIMS resolving powers for peptide analyses from the prior maximum of approximately 20-30 to approximately 50-70. The resolution improved nearly 3-fold, allowing, in particular, separation of previously unresolved conformers.

Use of the internet by legal guardians of patients from public and private pediatric urology health services in Brazil. To describe the internet access characteristics of parents of patients in both public (PubHS) and private (PrivHS) pediatric urology health services. Question sheets (200) were supplied to the legal guardians (LG) of patients seen in the PubHS (100) and a PrivHS (100) which have different socio-economic perspectives. LG were questioned on whether they sought on the web information about the urologic problem of their child, the kind of information sought, and whether it affected communication and the overall relationship with their physicians. LG from the PubHS had less access to the internet than those from the PrivHS (51% vs 81%, P<0.001). Overall, 44 LG (with no significant difference between PubHS and PrivHS) reported that they sought on the web information about their child's urologic disease. Out of these, 28 considered that communication with their doctor improved. There were no statistically significant differences between the PubHS and PrivHS regarding peace of mind and confidence in treatment after internet consultation. The internet is utilized by LG of patients in both the PubHS and PrivHS. Of the 44% who sought information on the web about their child's urologic disease, 64% considered that communication with the doctor improved.


[Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy revealing Glanzmann thrombasthenia].

Expression and sequence of CYP1A1 in the camel. In this study, we determined a partial sequence of CYP1A1 in the camel and its phylogenetic position. The deduced amino acid sequence of camel CYP1A1 showed the highest identity 94% with those of sheep and cattle CYP1A1. In a phylogenetic analysis, the camel CYP1A1 isoform was located beside sheep and cattle CYP1A1. When we studied the distribution of camel CYP1A1 mRNA in different tissues, we found that this isoform was expressed in all tissues except the hump. Interestingly, the lungs of all the camels and tongues of two of the three animals showed high expressions of CYP1A1 mRNA, and this may indicate exposure to ligands of aryl hydrocarbon receptor such as environmental pollutants or flavonoids.


Congenital anomalies of the uterine cervix: lessons from 30 cases managed clinically by a common protocol.

Relationship between distribution of tapetum fibrosum and retinal pigment epithelium in the sheep eye. The tapetum lucidum is a light-reflective device improving visual sensitivity in mesopic vision. There have been few studies on tapetal distribution and its relationship with degree of pigmentation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the present study, sheep's eyes were used for macroscopical observation of the tapetum, and then histological sections of the posterior eyecups were made to analyze the distribution of tapetal thickness and degree of pigmentation in the RPE. Macroscopically, with available light, the tapetum was located in the dorsal eye fundus to the optic disc and showed an L-shape with the horizontally elongated nasal part and the dorsally expanded temporal part. In photographs with a flash, the tapetal area expanded and showed a more triangular shape. The tapetum histologically consisted of layers of dense collagen fibers and was thicker in the temporal part than in the nasal part. The maximum tapetal thickness was approximately 70 microm. The histological tapetal area was similar to the tapetal shape with a flash light. The pigmentation of the RPE was divided into three types, nonpigmented, transitional, and pigmented areas. The nonpigmented area was similar to the tapetal shape with available light. It is suggested that approximately 55% of the histological tapetal area is covered with the nonpigmented area and is functional under a natural light condition. The functional tapetal area was similar to the L-shaped high-density area of retinal ganglion cells.

Hydrotherapy added to endurance training versus endurance training alone in elderly patients with chronic heart failure: a randomized pilot study. To assess if Hydrotherapy (HT) added to endurance training (ET) is more effective than ET alone in order to improve exercise tolerance of elderly male patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Twenty-one male CHF patients, age 68+/-7 (mean+/-DS) years; ejection fraction 32+/-9. NYHA II-III were enrolled. Eleven pts were randomized to combined training (CT) group performing HT+ET and 10 patients to ET group (ET only). At baseline and after 24 weeks all patients underwent: 6-minute walking test (6MWT), assessment of quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peak torque (PT), blood pressure and heart rate (HR), echocardiography and non-invasive hemodynamic evaluation. HT was performed 3 times/week in upright position at up to the xyphoid process at a temperature of 31°C. ET was performed 3 times/week. Exercise was well tolerated. No patients had adverse events. Distance at 6MWT improved in both groups (CT group: 150+/-32 m; ET group:105+/-28 m) with significant intergroup differences (p 0.001). On land diastolic BP and HR significantly decreased in the CT group while remained unchanged in the ET group (-11 mmHg+/-2, p 0.04; e - 12 bpm, p 0.03; respectively) CO and SV had a relative despite no significant increase in CT group TPR on land significantly decreased in CT group (-23+/-3 mmHg/l/m; p 0.01) while remained unchanged in ET group. Patients of CT group had no significant higher increase of both MVC and PT than ET group. CT training, significantly improves exercise tolerance and hemodynamic profile of patients with CHF.

Inhibition of Foxo1 mediates protective effects of ghrelin against lipotoxicity in MIN6 pancreatic beta-cells. Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide secreted predominantly by X/A-like cells of the gastric fundus. Ghrelin increases pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and survival via sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt. The transcription regulator Foxo1 is a prominent effector of PI3K/Akt; when it is inhibited, pancreatic beta-cells are protected against fatty-acid-induced apoptosis. We investigated the role of Foxo1 in the protective effect of ghrelin under lipotoxic conditions in the MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell line. Results showed that ghrelin promoted cell proliferation and attenuated palmitate-induced apoptosis in cultured MIN6 cells. Nuclear exclusion of Foxo1 was necessary for the function of ghrelin. Treatment of MIN6 cells with palmitate and ghrelin-induced rapid nuclear exclusion and phosphorylation of Foxo1. Unlike the JNK inhibitor SP600125, Akt inhibitor IV blocked the anti-lipotoxic effect of ghrelin and stimulated Foxo1 nuclear translocation. In addition, treatment with ghrelin combined with SP600125 showed a synergistic antiapoptotic effect in palmitate-treated MIN6 cells. Ghrelin also inhibited the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway of apoptosis in MIN6 cells, decreased expression of cytoplasmic triglyceride, and downregulated gene expression of Bcl-2-associated X (BAX), sterol-response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP-10). These findings suggest that ghrelin protects pancreatic beta-cells from lipotoxicity by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of Foxo1.


Evaluation of critical size defects of mouse calvarial bone: An organ culture study.

The degree of tongue-coating reflects lingual motor function in the elderly. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the degree of tongue-coating and oral function. Tongue-coating is a moss-like deposit which forms over the tongue surface, and includes micro-organisms, food residues, and abrasive epithelia. It is considered that motor function of the tongue and lips and saliva secretion decrease in the aged and have some effect on the accumulation of tongue-coating. Although saliva secretion has been reported as a factor amongst these oral functions in contributing to tongue-coating, the correlation with the motor function of oral structures is unknown. The factors that contribute to the accumulation of tongue-coating were examined in 48 subjects of advanced age (mean age 80.8 +/- 7.8 years) with no severe levels of periodontal disease. Changes in the degree of tongue-coating were also examined after oral functional training in these subjects. The frequency of oral cleaning, status of oral hygiene, motor function of the tongue, and masticatory performance were examined as potential factors associated with the degree of coating. The results showed that tongue pressure and the frequency of oral diadochokinesis measured by pronouncing the single syllable 'ka' as an indicator were statistically significantly correlated with the degree of tongue-coating. Several factors in oral function improved with training, and also the degree of tongue-coating decreased in 27 subjects. These results suggest a correlation between the degree of tongue-coating and a reduction in lingual motor function and, in addition, possible improvement in level of coating by functional training of the tongue.

Non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, endogenous opioids and monoamine neurotransmitters. Self-inflicted injury, including cutting or burning, is the most frequent reason for psychiatric visits to medical emergency departments. This behavior, particularly when there is no apparent suicidal intent, is poorly understood from both biological and clinical perspectives. To examine the role of endogenous opioids and monoamine neurotransmitters in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). We compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of endogenous opioids, 5 hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with a history of repetitive non-suicidal self-injury with a diagnostically-matched group of individuals who had never engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. History of suicidal behavior, demographic background and psychopathology was assessed. All patients were diagnosed with a Cluster B personality disorder (i.e. borderline, antisocial, narcissistic or histrionic) (N=29) and had a history of at least one suicide attempt. Fourteen participants had a history of repeated non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI) in adulthood and 15 did not (no NSSI). The NSSI group had significantly lower levels of CSF beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin when compared with the non-NSSI group. CSF dynorphin, HVA and 5-HIAA levels did not differ. Severity of depression, hopelessness and overall psychopathology was greater in the NSSI group. beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin, opioids acting upon receptors involved in mediating stress-induced and physical pain analgesia respectively, are implicated in NSSI. Serotonergic and dopaminergic dysfunctions do not appear to be related to NSSI. Based on our findings, we propose a model of non-suicidal self-injury. Our results suggest that drugs acting on the opioid system warrant exploration as pharmacological treatments for NSSI.

Incidence and seasonal variation in hip fracture incidence among elderly women in Norway. The HUNT Study.

Oncoapoptosis: a novel molecular therapeutic for cancer treatment. Many cancer cells refractory to radiation treatment and chemotherapy proliferate due to loss of intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis) regulation. Consequently, the resolution of these cancers are many times outside the management capabilities of conventional therapeutics. We have developed a replication defective herpes simplex virus system which triggers apoptosis specifically in transformed human cells, termed oncoapoptosis. Susceptibility to virus induced cell death is dependent on the p53 protein status in the tumor cells, indicating specific targeting of the treatment. Primary cells which produce functional p53 are resistant to oncoapoptotic killing but not to apoptosis induced by nonviral environmental factors. Thus, induction of apoptosis by nonreplicating virus is a feasible molecular therapeutic approach for killing human cancer cells. Our findings have important implications in designing novel virus-based anticancer strategies.

Gene expression of ERbeta isoforms in laser microdissected human breast cancers: implications for gene expression analyses. Despite many published studies on ERbeta, progress towards understanding its role in breast cancer remains slow. This is largely due to discordant data between mRNA and protein studies as well as failure to take into account the biologically distinct ERbeta isoforms and their heterogeneous expression profile. We compared expression of ERbeta1, -2 and -5 genes in HB2 and MCF-7 breast cell lines, primary breast fibroblasts (n=5) and whole tissue and laser microdissected epithelial and stromal cells obtained from 25 human breast tumours. Our study shows that the level of gene expression of ERbeta isoforms depends on the cell population within a given tumour and varies dramatically in different cellular compartments. This has implications for gene expression analyses and could explain some of the contradictory data published to date, rendering "grind and bind" analyses of ERbeta uninformative. With the technology now available, we suggest a more refined approach be adopted to help resolve some of the controversy surrounding ERbeta.

What is the mechanism for persistent coexistence of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae? The rise of antimicrobial resistance in many pathogens presents a major challenge to the treatment and control of infectious diseases. Furthermore, the observation that drug-resistant strains have risen to substantial prevalence but have not replaced drug-susceptible strains despite continuing (and even growing) selective pressure by antimicrobial use presents an important problem for those who study the dynamics of infectious diseases. While simple competition models predict the exclusion of one strain in favour of whichever is 'fitter', or has a higher reproduction number, we argue that in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae there has been persistent coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, with neither approaching 100 per cent prevalence. We have previously proposed that models seeking to understand the origins of coexistence should not incorporate implicit mechanisms that build in stable coexistence 'for free'. Here, we construct a series of such 'structurally neutral' models that incorporate various features of bacterial spread and host heterogeneity that have been proposed as mechanisms that may promote coexistence. We ask to what extent coexistence is a typical outcome in each. We find that while coexistence is possible in each of the models we consider, it is relatively rare, with two exceptions: (i) allowing simultaneous dual transmission of sensitive and resistant strains lets coexistence become a typical outcome, as does (ii) modelling each strain as competing more strongly with itself than with the other strain, i.e. self-immunity greater than cross-immunity. We conclude that while treatment and contact heterogeneity can promote coexistence to some extent, the in-host interactions between strains, particularly the interplay between coinfection, multiple infection and immunity, play a crucial role in the long-term population dynamics of pathogens with drug resistance.

Cell membrane expression of cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 is modulated by alpha-actinin-2 interaction. Cardiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 plays a critical role in heart excitability and conduction. The molecular mechanism that underlies the expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that cytoskeleton proteins can be involved in the regulation of cell surface expression and localization of several ion channels. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Na(v)1.5-associated proteins that may be involved in channel function and expression. We identified alpha-actinin-2 as an interacting partner of the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains III and IV of Na(v)1.5 (Na(v)1.5/LIII-IV). Co-immunoprecipitation and His(6) pull-down assays confirmed the physical association between Na(v)1.5 and alpha-actinin-2 and showed that the spectrin-like repeat domain is essential for binding of alpha-actinin-2 to Na(v)1.5. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the interaction with alpha-actinin-2 increases sodium channel density without changing their gating properties. Consistent with these findings, coexpression of alpha-actinin-2 and Na(v)1.5 in tsA201 cells led to an increase in the level of expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane as determined by cell surface biotinylation. Lastly, immunostaining experiments showed that alpha-actinin-2 was colocalized with Na(v)1.5 along the Z-lines and in the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that alpha-actinin-2, which is known to regulate the functional expression of the potassium channels, may play a role in anchoring Na(v)1.5 to the membrane by connecting the channel to the actin cytoskeleton network.

Safety and efficacy of paediatric outpatient radiofrequency catheter ablations. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is a frequently performed procedure as treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children >4 years of age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the paediatric outpatient RFA procedure. Between 2002 and 2008, 271 RFAs were analyzed. Exclusion criteria for outpatient procedures amongst others were distance to home >1h and anticipated complex RFA in congenital heart disease. All patients underwent pre- and post-procedural echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Patient discharge was within 6h after conclusion of RFA. Parental follow-up phone calls the day after the procedure were performed. All patients were seen in outpatient clinics 1 month after RFA. A total of 97/271 (37%) patients aged 13.6 (4.8-18.0) years qualified for outpatient RFA. Accessory pathway ablations (n=50) and atrioventricular node modifications (n=39) were the most common RFAs. RFA was successful in 94/97 (97%) patients. Post-procedural echocardiography and electrocardiogram did not reveal any RFA related complications. Anaesthetic adverse events, predominantly post-interventional nausea and vomiting, were observed in 10 (10%) patients. Hospital discharge within 6h was practicable in all but one due to ongoing nausea. Follow-up phone calls did not reveal further complications. Recurrence of tachycardia after successful RFA was observed in 6 of 94 (6%) patients and prompted re-intervention in 4. Outpatient RFA is feasible and safe in selected paediatric patients. No RFA related complication was observed. Anaesthetic adverse events were nausea and vomiting due to general anaesthesia. Success rate and recurrence rate of tachycardia were favourable after outpatient RFA.

Immunization with live attenuated influenza viruses that express altered NS1 proteins results in potent and protective memory CD8+ T-cell responses. The generation of vaccines that induce long-lived protective immunity against influenza virus infections remains a challenging goal. Ideally, vaccines should elicit effective humoral and cellular immunity to protect an individual from infection or disease. Cross-reactive T- and B-cell responses that are elicited by live virus infections may provide such broad protection. Optimal induction of T-cell responses involves the action of type I interferons (IFN-I). Influenza virus expressed nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) functions as an inhibitor of IFN-I and promotes viral growth. We wanted to examine the priming of CD8(+) T-cell responses to influenza virus in the absence of this inhibition of IFN-I production. We generated recombinant mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34 viruses with NS1 truncations and/or deletions that also express the gp33-41 epitope from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Intranasal infection of mice with the attenuated viruses primed long-lived T- and B-cell responses despite significantly reduced viral replication in the lungs compared to wild-type virus. Antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells expanded upon rechallenge and generated increased protective memory T-cell populations after boosting. These results show that live attenuated influenza viruses expressing truncated NS1 proteins can prime protective immunity and may have implications for the design of novel modified live influenza virus vaccines.

Oxidized low-density lipoproteins upregulate proline oxidase to initiate ROS-dependent autophagy.

A comparison of the in vitro biotransformation of (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin B2 by human faecal microbiota. The catabolism by human faecal microbiota of (-)-epicatechin (1) (2, 3-cis stereochemistry) and its dimer pure procyanidin B2 (2), has been compared using a static in vitro culture model. The catabolites were characterised by LC-MS(n), UV absorption and relative retention time, and quantified relative to standards. No more than approximately 10% of procyanidin B2 (2) was converted to epicatechin (1) by scission of the interflavan bond. Five phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were unique to 2, and ten phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were common to both substrates. The dominant catabolites (> or =24 h incubation) were 5-(3'-hydroxy phenyl) valeric acid (9), 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (10) and phenyl acetic acid (12) (maximum yields 27.4+/-4.2, 38.2+/-4.2, 22.7+/-2.9%, respectively, from 1 and 9.4+/-1.2, 52.8+/-2.1, 28.8+/-1.6%, respectively, from 2). Substrate 2 was degraded twice as rapidly as 1. Evidence is presented for the production of previously unreported catabolites of 2 that retain the flavanol A-ring and the C4-->C8 interflavan bond. It was confirmed that catabolism favoured removal of the 4'-hydroxyl rather than the 3'-hydroxyl group and that both beta-oxidation and alpha-oxidation occurred.

Alcohol as a risk factor for injury: lessons from French data. The relationship between alcohol and injury is complex and the evidence level varies depending on the type of injury. The role of alcohol as a causal factor of traffic accidents is clear. There is less evidence concerning home and leisure injuries which include a wide range of accident causes and mechanisms. However, several studies dealing with specific injuries, such as drowning and fracture injuries in seniors, suggest a correlation between alcohol and the occurrence of injuries. Intentional injuries (violence, suicide) are complex and multifactorial phenomena. It is therefore more complicated to find the link between alcohol consumption and these kind of injuries. However, several physiological, psychological and social mechanisms are suggested to clarify this relationship. In conclusion, further data are needed to improve knowledge regarding the link between alcohol and injuries and, consequently, to implement preventive interventions. The collection of data on alcohol consumption at the moment of admission in emergency wards should be particularly promoted.


The embryonic blood-CSF barrier has molecular elements to control E-CSF osmolarity during early CNS development.

The 8th and 9th tandem spectrin-like repeats of utrophin cooperatively form a functional unit to interact with polarity-regulating kinase PAR-1b. Utrophin is a widely expressed paralogue of dystrophin, the protein responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a large spectrin-like protein whose C-terminal domain mediates anchorage to a laminin receptor, dystroglycan (DG). The rod domain, composed of 22 spectrin-like repeats, connects the N-terminal actin-binding domain and the C-terminal DG binding domain, and thus mediates molecular linkage between intracellular F-actin and extracellular basement membrane. Previously, we demonstrated that a cell polarity-regulating kinase, PAR-1b, interacts with the utrophin-DG complex, and positively regulates the interaction between utrophin and DG. In this study, we demonstrate that the 8th and 9th spectrin-like repeats (R8 and R9) of utrophin cooperatively form a PAR-1b-interacting domain, and that Ser1258 within R9 is specifically phosphorylated by PAR-1b. Substitution of Ser1258 to alanine reduces the interaction between utrophin and DG, suggesting that the Ser1258 phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of the utrophin-DG complex. Interestingly, PAR-1b also binds and phosphorylates R8-9 of dystrophin, and colocalizes with dystrophin at the skeletal muscle membrane. These results reveal a novel function of the rod domain of utrophin beyond that of a passive structural linker connecting the N- and C-terminal domain.

Association of abnormal vaginal flora and Ureaplasma species as risk factors for preterm birth: a cohort study. To find out whether the presence of Ureaplasma species (U. spp.) in combination with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora is an independent risk factor for preterm delivery. Prospective observational study. Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital in Brussels. A total of 1,988 singleton pregnancies were included. From each woman, a cervical culture for U. spp. was obtained and the vaginal flora evaluated at the first prenatal visit. The presence of known risk factors for preterm delivery was recorded. Preterm birth was defined as delivery < 37 weeks. There were 97 (4.9%) preterm births. In patients delivered before 37 weeks, abnormal vaginal flora was detected in 22.7% and U. spp. in 53.6% of these. The conditions were found together in 17.5%. In patients delivered at term, an abnormal vaginal flora was detected in 14.4% and U. spp. in 41.4% of these women, while they co-existed in 8.2%. Using a logistic regression analysis taking into account known risk factors for preterm birth and the microbiological parameters, preterm delivery was correlated with the presence of U. spp. (odds ratio (OR) 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.48; p = 0.02) and abnormal vaginal flora in combination with U. spp. (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.35-4.10; p = 0.003). No significant correlation between the presence of abnormal vaginal flora and preterm delivery (p = 0.09) was found. Preterm delivery was significantly correlated with the presence of U. spp. The risk for preterm delivery increased when U. spp. was associated with an abnormal vaginal flora.

Occupational allergy in strawberry greenhouse workers. Employees in strawberry greenhouses are highly exposed to several (potential) allergenic agents. However, no occupational allergy in this branch has been described before. First, the presence of work-related allergic symptoms in strawberry workers was explored. Second, we aimed to prove the concept that an IgE-mediated allergy could be responsible for work-related symptoms. To test the possibility of an IgE response secondary to cross-reactivity to birch or grass pollen, inhibition experiments were performed. First, a questionnaire survey concerning work-related allergic symptoms among strawberry workers in the Netherlands was carried out. Second, 3 workers with work-related symptoms were investigated in detail. Skin tests, serum-specific IgE tests with home-made extracts of strawberry pollen and other possible allergenic agents of the strawberry greenhouse environment were executed. Furthermore, immunoblots and nasal provocations with strawberry pollen extract were performed. In addition, inhibition experiments were performed. 29 of 75 questionnaire respondents (38.7%) reported work-related symptoms. Sensitization to strawberry pollen was found in skin tests in all 3 employees with work-related symptoms. ELISA and immunoblotting with strawberry pollen showed positive results in 2 employees. Birch and grass pollen failed to inhibit IgE binding to strawberry pollen in 1 of 2 employees. Partial inhibition was seen in the second employee. Nasal provocation validated clinically relevant allergy to these pollens in 2 of 3 subjects. Allergic symptoms attributable to the workplace are present among a proportion of strawberry greenhouse employees. An IgE-mediated occupational allergy to strawberry pollen may contribute to these symptoms.


Infusing neuroscience into the study and prevention of drug misuse and co-occurring aggressive behavior.

Neuroglia in neurodegeneration. Neuroglial cells are fundamental for control of brain homeostasis and they represent the intrinsic brain defence system. All forms in neuropathology therefore inevitably involve glia. The neurodegenerative diseases disrupt connectivity within brain circuits affecting neuronal-neuronal, neuronal-glial and glial-glial contacts. In addition neurodegenerative processes trigger universal and conserved glial reactions represented by astrogliosis and microglial activation. The complex of recently acquired knowledge allows us to regard the neurodegenerative diseases as primarily gliodegenerative processes, in which glial cells determine the progression and outcome of neuropathological process.

[Impact of exogenous paraquat on enzyme exudation and biochemical changes of lignin degradation fungi]. To study the effect of exogenous oxygen, we added water solution of paraquat to 7 d cultures of Coriolus versicolor for the next 148 h. Enzyme exudation and biochemical process were investigated on the addition of paraquat. We found that compared with the control (without paraquat), the addition of 30 micromol/L paraquat stimulated the activity of manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase (LiP), and laccases (Lac) 7, 2.5 and 1.3 times, respectively. Also, addition of paraquat enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the first 48 h. Impact of paraquat on ligninolytic enzymes was significant than that on antioxidant enzyme. Addition of paraquat enhanced phenolic compounds and formaldehyde of cultures too. And concentration of malondialdehyde was increased in the first 24 h. The results showed that addition of paraquat promoted oxidative stress, but the antioxidant systems of the fungal strain are sufficient to prevent mycelia from oxidative stress. As exogenous oxygen, paraquat might be a useful substrate in degradation of lignocellulose.

Identification of the potential target genes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells. Using a microRNA (miRNA) array, we found that PMA induced miR-146a expression in human microvascular endothelial cells. The miR-146a expression was dependent on dose and time and independent of PKC activation. Using a combined approach involving predictions using miRanda algorithm and whole genome microarray experiments with or without inhibition of miR-146a expression by LNA-antimir-146a or LNA-control, 29 potential target genes of miR-146a were identified. Because endothelial cell S phase progression is an early event in the induction of angiogenesis, we evaluated 5 cell cycle-related genes from the 29 target genes and found that the transcripts of 3 genes (CCNA2, PA2G4, and BRCA1) were downregulated after PMA treatment, but their expression was rescued upon miR-146a inhibition. However, inhibition of miR-146a expression failed to alter the cell cycle distribution or angiogenesis induced by PMA treatment. By using a combined approach involving computational prediction and a whole genome microarray experiment in the presence or absence of antimir, the observations in this presented article raise the possibility that antimir strategies might be used to identify the potential miRNA targets.

An approach for including consideration of stream water dissolved organic carbon in long term forest planning. The objective of this study was to add to a traditional forest planning model by incorporating some consideration of the effects of forestry on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in streams over time. In a case study, for a watershed in northern Sweden, we present the best possible solution to a forest planning problem that maximizes the net present value (NPV) while the DOC concentration levels in the watershed are maintained below a defined threshold value. Results from the case study show that the decrease in NPV, when taking DOC into account, was considerable. However, the decrease in possible harvest volume was restricted in the case study area because the model moved harvesting activity from the first 20-year period to later periods to avoid high initial DOC concentrations. The model presented could be a useful tool for predicting the effect of forestry on DOC concentrations over time.

The role of endoscopic ultrasound for loco-regional staging of rectal cancer. Rectal cancer is projected to have the 10th highest incidence of cancer in the United States in 2009, with 40 870 estimated new cases this year. The prognosis for patients with rectal cancer is directly related to several factors, with the most important, based on current data, the extent of primary tumor invasion, the number of lymph nodes involved, involvement of the circumferential resection margin, and the presence of metastases. Contemporary therapy is dependent upon pre-surgical diagnostic imaging modalities, which influence the indication for neoadjuvant therapy and the decision process concerning the appropriate surgical approach. A comprehensive overview based on the currently available evidence of endoscopic ultrasound imaging in the loco-regional assessment of primary de novo rectal cancer evaluation following neoadjuvant therapy and post operative disease surveillance is presented. Relevant ano-rectal anatomy, staging systems for rectal cancer and alternative radiological staging strategies are also presented.

A disconnection account of Gerstmann syndrome: functional neuroanatomy evidence. To examine the functional neuroanatomy that could account for pure Gerstmann syndrome, which is the selective association of acalculia, finger agnosia, left-right disorientation, and agraphia. We used structural and functional neuroimaging at high spatial resolution in healthy subjects to seek a shared cortical substrate of the Grundstörung posited by Gerstmann, ie, a common functional denominator accounting for this clinical tetrad. We construed a functional activation paradigm that mirrors each of the four clinical deficits in Gerstmann syndrome and determined cortical activation patterns. We then applied fiber tracking to diffusion tensor images and used cortical activation foci in the four functional domains as seed regions. None of the subjects showed parietal overlap of cortical activation patterns from the four cognitive domains. In every subject, however, the parietal activation patterns across all four domains consistently connected to a small region of subcortical parietal white matter at a location that is congruent with the lesion in a well-documented case of pure Gerstmann syndrome. Our functional neuroimaging findings are not in agreement with Gerstmann's postulate of damage to a common cognitive function underpinning clinical semiology. Our evidence from intact functional neuroanatomy suggests that pure forms of Gerstmann's tetrad do not arise from lesion to a shared cortical substrate but from intraparietal disconnection after damage to a focal region of subcortical white matter.


In utero diagnosis of congenital pyloric atresia in a single twin using MRI and ultrasound.

Treatment of elderly primary insomnia patients with EVT 201 improves sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. Two doses of EVT 201, a partial positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) system, were evaluated in elderly primary insomnia patients with daytime sleepiness. Participants were 149 elderly patients with DSM-IV primary insomnia including evidence of daytime sleepiness (53 males, 96 females; mean age 71.3yrs, range 65-86yrs). A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design was used to assess the hypnotic efficacy of EVT 201 1.5 and 2.5mg during seven consecutive nights. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed on nights 1, 6 and 7 of treatment. Daytime assessments on Day 8 included the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The primary endpoint was total sleep time (TST) and the key secondary endpoint was mean MSLT latency. Compared to placebo, EVT 201 1.5 and 2.5mg increased TST (30.9, 56.4min, respectively; p=0.0001, p<0.0001); reduced wake after sleep onset (WASO; -15.2, -36.1min, respectively; p=0.014, p<0.0001); reduced latency to persistent sleep (LPS; -15.9, -19.9min, respectively; p=0.009, p=0.001). The 2.5mg dose also reduced WASO in hours 5-8 (-16.3min, p=0.001). Both doses also improved subjective sleep quality and usual subjective efficacy measures. A significantly longer mean MSLT latency was observed on Day 8 with both doses, compared to placebo (2min increase; p=0.03, both doses). The PVT, RAVLT, and POMS did not differ among treatment groups. No serious or unexpected treatment emergent adverse events were noted. EVT 201 improved PSG measures of sleep onset and sleep maintenance and significantly reduced daytime physiological sleep tendency. These findings suggest that treatment of primary insomnia in older patients has the potential to improve daytime sleepiness as well as sleep.

Pesticides in dust from homes in an agricultural area. We collected indoor dust samples from homes in the Salinas Valley of California. Of 22 pesticides measured in 504 samples, permethrins and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos were present in highest amounts. In multivariate Tobit regression models among samples from 197 separate residences, reported agricultural uses of chlorpyrifos, a herbicide (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA)), and a fungicide (iprodione) on agricultural fields were significantly (p < 0.01) associated, with 83%, 19%, and 49% increases, respectively, in dust concentrations for each kg applied per day, near participant homes, in the month or season prior to sample collection. However, agricultural use of diazinon, which was 2.2 times that of chlorpyrifos, and of permethrin were not significantly associated with dust levels. Other variables independently associated with dust levels included temperature and rainfall, farmworkers storing work shoes in the home, storing a diazinon product in the home, housing density, having a home less clean, and having an air conditioner. Permethrins, chlorpyrifos, DCPA, and iprodione have either a log octanol-water partition coefficient (K(ow)) greater than 4.0, a very low vapor pressure, or both. Health risk assessments for pesticides that have these properties may need to include evaluation of exposures to house dust.

Plasma granzyme B as a predicting factor of coronary artery disease--clinical significance in patients with chronic renal failure.

Kinship, marriage, and the genetics of past human dispersals. The extent to which colonizing farmer populations have overwhelmed or "replaced" indigenous forager populations, as opposed to having intermarried with them, has been widely debated. Indigenous-colonist "admixture" is often represented in genetic models as a single parameter that, although parsimonious and simple, is incongruous with the sex-specific nature of mtDNA and Y-chromosome data. To help interpret genetic patterns, we can construct useful null hypotheses about the generalized migration history of females (mtDNA) as opposed to males (Y chromosome), which differ significantly in almost every ethnographically known society. We seek to integrate ethnographic knowledge into models that incorporate new social parameters for predicting geographic patterns in mtDNA and Y-chromosome distributions. We provide an example of a model simulation for the spread of agriculture in which this individual-scale evidence is used to refine the parameters.


Pharmacological modification of dendritic cells to promote their tolerogenicity in transplantation.

Development of biomaterial scaffold for nerve tissue engineering: Biomaterial mediated neural regeneration. Neural tissue repair and regeneration strategies have received a great deal of attention because it directly affects the quality of the patient's life. There are many scientific challenges to regenerate nerve while using conventional autologous nerve grafts and from the newly developed therapeutic strategies for the reconstruction of damaged nerves. Recent advancements in nerve regeneration have involved the application of tissue engineering principles and this has evolved a new perspective to neural therapy. The success of neural tissue engineering is mainly based on the regulation of cell behavior and tissue progression through the development of a synthetic scaffold that is analogous to the natural extracellular matrix and can support three-dimensional cell cultures. As the natural extracellular matrix provides an ideal environment for topographical, electrical and chemical cues to the adhesion and proliferation of neural cells, there exists a need to develop a synthetic scaffold that would be biocompatible, immunologically inert, conducting, biodegradable, and infection-resistant biomaterial to support neurite outgrowth. This review outlines the rationale for effective neural tissue engineering through the use of suitable biomaterials and scaffolding techniques for fabrication of a construct that would allow the neurons to adhere, proliferate and eventually form nerves.

[Pregnancy and delivery course in overweight and obese women]. Pregnancy and delivery in case of overweight women require special care. The main means of preventing obstetrical complications is promoting healthy lifestyle and pregnancy weight gain control among females planning the pregnancy as well as prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy/delivery course monitoring. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pregnancy and delivery course in overweight and obese pregnant women. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of medical files of 132 pregnant women delivering in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic in Tychy, Poland. The investigated group was divided into subgroups based on pre-pregnancy body mass index according to World Health Organization Criteria for obesity. The comparative analysis was then performed between the subgroups. The prevalence of bleedings in pregnancy pregnancy induced hypertension, diabetes and urinary tract infections was statistically higher in obese pregnant females. Similarly the rate of shoulder dystocia was statistically higher in the obese and overweight subgroups of women. There were no significant differences between subgroups in mean neonate body length or mean Apgar scores. However the highest neonate body weight was observer in subgroup of overweight females and those with pre-pregnancy normal BMI who gained more than 16 kilograms during pregnancy. 1. Excessive weight gain in pregnancy is associated with higher risk of pregnancy and delivery complications. 2. Both excessive pre-pregnancy body weight and excessive weight gain in pregnancy increase the risk of perinatal complications.

Emotional and physical satisfaction in noncohabiting, cohabiting, and marital relationships: the importance of jealous conflict. This article examines whether associations between marital status and emotional and physical satisfaction depend on jealous conflict associated with expectations about sexual exclusivity. Using data from a representative sample of 681 women and men drawn from the city of Chicago and its inner suburbs, this study estimated logistic regression models of jealous conflict and ordered logistic regression models of adults' reported emotional and physical satisfaction of their relationships. The results show that marriages are less exposed to jealous conflict than cohabiting and noncohabiting relationships. Regarding emotional and physical satisfaction, their associations with marital status were contingent upon whether individuals reported jealous conflict in their relationships. Specifically, in relationships without jealous conflict, married couples were more emotionally satisfied than noncohabiting couples. Married couples, but not cohabiting and noncohabiting couples, had significantly lower emotional and physical satisfaction when jealous conflict occurred. Cohabitors were not less emotionally or physically satisfied than married respondents. Overall, this research supports the argument that sexual exclusivity expectations are important for understanding the link between marital status and relationship quality.

Dislocation and bicruciate lesions of the knee: epidemiology and acute stage assessment in a prospective series. Knee dislocation and bicruciate lesions are rare. Assessments of results from retrospective series carry an insufficient level of evidence. A prospective multicenter study was therefore set up, under the auspices of the French Society of Orthopedic Surgery. The inclusion period covered the whole of 2007. Clinical, imaging (dynamic X-ray and MRI) and vascular (angioscan and arteriography) assessment was performed systematically. In patients over the age of 60 years, ligament lesions were always managed non-surgically; in those under the age of 60 years, surgery was considered in the absence of associated vascular lesion or open dislocation and if there was frontal laxity exceeding 15 degrees or a posterior drawer test greater than 10mm. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and peripheral ligament tears were repaired or reinforced under arthroscopy or by arthrotomy. The anterior cruciate ligament was never operated on. In all other cases, management was conservative. Sixty-seven knees were included (55 male, 11 female; mean age: 37 years). Fifteen patients (25.4%) had bicruciate lesion, and 44 (74.6%) knee dislocation. Mean trauma-to-reduction interval was 3 hrs 50 min. Only one of the nine cases of popliteal artery lesion exhibited discernible distal pulse wave. Only three of these patients underwent vascular surgical repair. Twelve knees (five bicruciate lesions, seven dislocations) had isolated common peroneal nerve damage. This prospective study detailed the epidemiology and treatment of the lesions encountered, with the option of PCL and peripheral ligament reconstruction. The results, however, still require long-term analysis.

Darwin, medicine and cancer. 'Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution'! So said Theodore Dobzhansky. It is extraordinary how little Darwinism and post-Darwinian evolutionary science has penetrated medicine despite the fact that all biology is built upon its foundations. Randy Nesse, one of the fathers of Darwinian medicine, recently observed that doctors 'know the facts but not the origins'. Clearly, then, in this auspicious year-200 years since Charles Darwin's birth and 150 years since the first edition of the Origin of Species-it is time to reconsider Darwin's legacy to medicine and to invite evolution back into the biomedical fold. Here, we consider the legacy of Darwin and the contribution of the other great evolutionists such as Ernst Mayr to cancer and medicine.

Prognostic relevance of promoter hypermethylation of multiple genes in breast cancer patients. Methylation-mediated suppression of detoxification, DNA repair and tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in cancer development. This study was designed to investigate the impact of concurrent methylation of multiple genes in breast tumors on disease prognosis. Methylation specific PCR was carried out to analyze the methylation status of seven genes in archived breast tissues and determine the effect of aberrant methylation of multiple genes on disease prognosis and patients' survival. Promoter hypermethylation was observed in PRB 67%, ERalpha 64%, RASSF1A 63%, p16INK4A 51%, RARbeta2 22%, GSTP1 25% and BRCA1 27% of the breast cancers, respectively. Concurrent methylation of BRCA1, ERalpha, GSTP1 and RARbeta2, was observed in a large proportion of breast cancers analyzed, suggesting that these genes do not appear to be methylated alone. Patients with high methylation indices had poor prognosis (p<0.001, Hazards ratio=14.58). Cox regression analysis showed RARbeta2 promoter methylation to be an independent important determinant of breast cancer prognosis. Our results suggest that methylation of multiple genes plays an important role in prognosis of breast cancer. Our study not only describes the association of methylation mediated silencing of multiple genes with the severity of disease, but also drives to speculate the molecular crosstalk between genes or genetic pathways regulated by them individually.


Tissue Doppler E/E' ratio is a powerful predictor of primary cardiac events in a hypertensive population: an ASCOT substudy.

Production of clastogenic DNA precursors by the nucleotide metabolism in Escherichia coli. RdgB is a bacterial dNTPase with a strong in vitro preference for non-canonical DNA precursors dHapTP, dXTP and dITP that contain deaminated or aminogroup-modified purines. Utilization of these nucleotides by replisomes in rdgB mutants of Escherichia coli produces modified DNA, on which EndoV nicking near the base analogues initiates excision repair. Some EndoV-initiated excision events cause chromosomal fragmentation, which becomes inhibitory if recombinational repair is also inactivated (the rdgB recA co-inhibition). To reveal the sources and the identities of the non-canonical DNA precursors, intercepted by RdgB in E. coli, we characterized 17 suppressors of the rdgB recA co-inhibition. Ten suppressors affect genes of the RNA/DNA precursor metabolism, identifying the source of non-canonical DNA precursors. Comparing chromosomal fragmentation with the density of EndoV-recognized DNA modifications distinguishes three mechanisms of suppression: (i) reduction of the non-canonical dNTP production, (ii) inhibition of the base analogue excision from DNA and (iii) enhancement of the cell tolerance to chromosomal fragmentation. The suppressor analysis suggests IMP as the key intermediate in the synthesis of the clastogenic DNA precursor, most likely dITP.

Self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels in older African-American adults. Self-reported experiences of "everyday" discrimination have been linked to indices of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality and findings have been particularly pronounced for African-American populations. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, is a known correlate of cardiovascular and other health outcomes and has also been linked to several psychosocial processes. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association between experiences of discrimination and CRP. We examined the cross-sectional association between self-reported experiences of discrimination and CRP in a sample of 296 older African-American adults (70% female, mean age=73.1). Experiences of discrimination were assessed with the 9-item everyday discrimination scale and CRP was assayed from blood samples. In linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and education, experiences of discrimination were associated with higher levels of CRP (B=.10, p=.03). This association remained significant after additional adjustments for depressive symptoms (B=.10, p=.04), smoking, and chronic health conditions (heart disease, diabetes, hypertension) that might influence inflammation (B=.11, p=.02). However, results were attenuated when body mass index (BMI) was added to the model (B=.09, p=.07). In conclusion, self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with higher levels of CRP in older African-American adults, although this association is not completely independent of BMI.

Lipid and glycolipid antigens of CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells. In spite of their relatively limited antigen receptor repertoire, CD1d-restricted NKT cells recognize a surprisingly diverse range of lipid and glycolipid antigens. Recent studies of natural and synthetic CD1d-presented antigens provide an increasingly detailed picture of how the specific structural features of these lipids and glycolipids influence their ability to be presented to NKT cells and stimulate their diverse immunologic functions. Particularly for synthetic analogues of alpha-galactosylceramides which have been the focus of intense recent investigation, it is becoming clear that the design of glycolipid antigens with the ability to precisely control the specific immunologic activities of NKT cells is likely to be feasible. The emerging details of the mechanisms underlying the structure-activity relationship of NKT cell antigens will assist greatly in the design and production of immunomodulatory agents for the precise manipulation of NKT cells and the many other components of the immune system that they influence.

MicroRNAs miR-124 and miR-135a are potential regulators of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2) expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes. We aimed to study whether regulatory networks that determine susceptibility to hypertension may involve a miRNA component. Screening of loci, involved in renal water-salt balance regulation, highlighted the mineralocorticoid receptor gene NR3C2 as a potential target for several miRNAs. A luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-124 and miR-135a suppress NR3C2 3'UTR reporter construct activity 1.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively. As the tested miRNAs did not reduce the levels of target mRNA, we suggest that the binding of miR-124 and miR-135a to NR3C2 3'UTR contributes to the translational, not transcriptional regulation of the gene. Co-expression of two different miRNAs did not increase the repression of the reporter gene, indicating no additive or synergistic effects between the tested miRNAs. Our results demonstrate that by repressing the mineralocorticoid receptor gene NR3C2, miR-124 and miR-135a could participate in the regulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and thereby might be involved in blood pressure regulation.

Identification of the potential target genes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial cells.

Endothelin 1 and prostacyclin attenuate increases in hydraulic permeability caused by platelet-activating factor in rats. We have previously documented that endothelin 1 (ET-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2) decrease basal state hydraulic permeability (Lp). The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of ET-1 and PGI2 to modulate transendothelial fluid flux during situations in which Lp was artificially elevated with platelet-activating factor (PAF). We hypothesized that ET-1 and PGI2 administration before PAF exposure would prevent the increase in Lp secondary to PAF. In addition, in a potentially more clinically relevant situation, we also hypothesized that ET-1 and PGI2 administration after PAF exposure would attenuate the increase in Lp secondary to PAF. Microvascular Lp was measured in rat mesenteric postcapillary venules. Exposure to 10 nM PAF increased Lp 4-fold (P < 0.001). If the administration of 80 pM ET-1 or 10 microM PGI2 was completed before PAF exposure, no PAF-associated increase in Lp was observed (P < 0.001). The administration of ET-1 or PGI2 after PAF exposure attenuated the peak increase in Lp caused by PAF alone by 55% and 57%, respectively (P < 0.001). We conclude that ET-1 and PGI2 administration before PAF exposure prevents PAF-induced elevations in Lp, and in a more clinically relevant situation, ET-1 and PGI2 administered after PAF exposure attenuate the PAF-induced increase in Lp. Endothelin 1 and PGI2 receptors may provide important therapeutic targets for decreasing the microvascular fluid leak-associated morbidity resulting from shock and sepsis.

Discharge patterns of nociceptive primary afferent fibres in the rat coccygeal nerve after UVA-light exposure. We have shown that administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine into the base of rats' tails prevents the development of hyperalgesia induced by UV(A)-light to a noxious thermal challenge, but not to noxious mechanical challenges. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of rats' tails to UV(A)-light altered the responses of Adelta- and C-fibres innervating the tail to noxious mechanical and noxious thermal challenges. We dissected the right ventral coccygeal nerve in Sprague-Dawley rats that had their tails exposed to, or shielded from, UV(A)-light 24-h earlier. Single afferent Adelta- and C-fibres receptive fields were located and the response of a fibre to noxious blunt (3.9Nbar algometer) and punctate (rat toothed forceps) mechanical challenges, as well as a noxious thermal (49 degrees C) challenge was measured. In rats exposed to UV(A)-light, the peak firing rates and areas under the curve of post-challenge histograms of Adelta- and C-fibres evoked neural activity were increased when noxious blunt and punctate challenges were applied to the rats' tails. However, the peak firing rate and areas under the curve of post-challenge histograms of C-fibre evoked neural activity, which were responsive to noxious thermal challenges, were not increased after UV(A)-light exposure. We have shown that the Adelta- and C-fibres that encode for noxious punctate and blunt challenges were sensitized after UV(A)-light exposure, but C-fibres responsible for encoding noxious thermal challenges were not sensitized by UV(A)-light exposure.

Phylogenetic diversity of Sri Lankan freshwater crabs and its implications for conservation. As part of a Global Biodiversity Hotspot, the conservation of Sri Lanka's endemic biodiversity warrants special attention. With 51 species (50 of them endemic) occurring in the island, the biodiversity of freshwater crabs is unusually high for such a small area (65,600 km(2)). Freshwater crabs have successfully colonized most moist habitats and all climatic and elevational zones in Sri Lanka. We assessed the biodiversity of these crabs in relation to the different elevational zones (lowland, upland and highland) based on both species richness and phylogenetic diversity. Three different lineages appear to have radiated simultaneously, each within a specific elevational zone, with little interchange thereafter. The lowland and upland zones show a higher species richness than the highland zone while--unexpectedly--phylogenetic diversity is highest in the lowland zone, illustrating the importance of considering both these measures in conservation planning. The diversity indices for the species in the various IUCN Red List categories in each of the three zones suggest that risk of extinction may be related to elevational zone. Our results also show that overall more than 50% of Sri Lanka's freshwater crab species (including several as yet undescribed ones), or approximately 72 million years of evolutionary history, are threatened with extinction.

Stem cells for hepatic regeneration: the role of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells. Severe hepatic dysfunctions including hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma are life-threatening conditions for which effective medical treatments are needed. With the only effective treatment to date being orthotropic liver transplantation, alternative approaches are needed because of the limited number of donors and the possibility of immune-rejection. One alternative is regenerative medicine, which holds promise for the development of a cell-based therapy enabling hepatic regeneration through transplantation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) or hepatocyte-like cells generated from AT-MSCs. When compared with embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, the use of AT-MSCs as regenerative cells would be advantageous in regard to ethical and safety issues since AT-MSCs are somatic cells and have the potential to be used without in vitro culture. These autologous cells are immuno-compatible and exhibit controlled differentiation and multi-functional abilities and do not undergo post-transplantation rejection or unwanted differentiation such as formation of teratomas. AT-MSC-based therapies may provide a novel approach for hepatic regeneration and hepatocyte differentiation and thereby support hepatic function in diseased individuals.

Cold-active extracellular alkaline protease from an alkaliphilic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: production of enzyme and its industrial applications. A novel psychro-tolerant bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MTCC 7528) with an ability to produce extracellular, cold-active, alkaline, and detergent-stable protease was isolated from soil samples obtained from Gangotri glacier, Western Himalaya, India. The culture conditions for higher protease production were optimized with respect to incubation time, agitation, substrate, pH, and temperature. Maximum protease production of 56.2 U x mL(-1) was achieved in the medium at 20 degrees C and pH 9.0 after 120 h incubation. The protease was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography and approximately 55-fold purification was achieved. The purified enzyme was a 75 kDa protease with maximum activity and stability at pH 10 and 20 degrees C. The activity of enzyme is stimulated by Mn2+ and inhibited completely by metalloprotease inhibitors, indicating that it is a metalloprotease. The protease showed excellent stability and compatibility with commercial detergents and exhibited high efficiency for the removal of different types of protein-containing stains at low temperature. The wash performance analysis of blood and grass stains on cotton fabric showed an increase in reflectance by 26% and 23%, respectively, after treatment with enzyme in comparison to detergent only. These results indicate that it may be a potential component to use as a detergent additive for cold washing and in environmental bioremediation in cold regions.


A 19-year retrospective investigation of maternal mortality at Point G National Hospital, Bamako, Mali.

Making anatomic terminology of the prostate and contiguous structures clinically useful: historical review and suggestions for revision in the 21st century. Herein we review nomenclature of the prostate and contiguous structures in each of the 10 official publications from the 1895 [Basel] Nomina Anatomica to the 1998 Terminologia Anatomica. We then compare existing clinical terminology with official terminology endorsed by anatomists over the years with a goal to modernize official terminology. Problematic terms, namely, lobes and lobuli, fascia versus capsule, Denonvilliers' fascia, and transition versus periurethral zone, are addressed. The idea of recognizing prostate arteries, veins, nerves, and neurovascular bundles is introduced. Prostatic and membranous urethras and the closely related external urethral sphincter are covered. We believe urogenital hiatus should also be called anterior levator hiatus. Trapezoid zone should be discarded in future editions of nomenclature. Our recommended changes are supported by a series of pertinent photographs of gross and whole mount histologic specimens and magnetic resonance images. Finally, we provide a new table of terms for the prostate with recommended amendments and deletions to existing official nomenclature as contained in the 1998 Terminologia Anatomica.

Ultrasound improved ethanol fermentation from cassava chips in cassava-based ethanol plants. The effects of ultrasound and heat pretreatments on ethanol yields from cassava chips were investigated. Cassava slurries were sonicated for 10 and 30 s at the amplitudes of 80, 160, and 320 microm(pp) (peak to peak amplitude in microm) corresponding to low, medium, and high power levels, respectively. The sonicated and non-sonicated (control) samples were then subjected to simultaneous liquefaction-saccharification and ethanol fermentation. Cassava starch-to-ethanol conversion efficiencies showed that higher ethanol yields were directly related to sonication times, but not to power levels. Significantly higher ethanol yields were observed only for sonicated samples at the high power level. The ethanol yield from the sonicated sample was 2.7-fold higher than yield from the control sample. Starch-to-ethanol conversion rates from sonicated cassava chips were also significantly higher; the fermentation time could be reduced by nearly 24 h for sonicated samples to achieve the same ethanol yield as control samples. Thus, ultrasound pretreatment enhanced both the overall ethanol yield and fermentation rate. When compared to heat-treated samples, the sonicated samples produced nearly 29% more ethanol yield. Combined heat and ultrasound treatment had no significant effect on overall ethanol yields from cassava chips. Ultrasound is also preferable to heat pretreatment because of lower energy requirements, as indicated by energy balances. Integration of ultrasound application in cassava-based ethanol plants can significantly improve ethanol yields and reduce the overall production costs.


Diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults.

Hypertension in the elderly. Many elderly patients have hypertension, although it is more likely to go untreated in this population. Treatment goals are the same in elderly patients as in younger patients, but elderly patients are more likely to have multiple comorbidities, which must be factored into treatment plans. This article highlights the unique challenges in treating this population.

Dopamine-stimulated dephosphorylation of connexin 36 mediates AII amacrine cell uncoupling. Gap junction proteins form the substrate for electrical coupling between neurons. These electrical synapses are widespread in the CNS and serve a variety of important functions. In the retina, connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctions couple AII amacrine cells and are a requisite component of the high-sensitivity rod photoreceptor pathway. AII amacrine cell coupling strength is dynamically regulated by background light intensity, and uncoupling is thought to be mediated by dopamine signaling via D(1)-like receptors. One proposed mechanism for this uncoupling involves dopamine-stimulated phosphorylation of Cx36 at regulatory sites, mediated by protein kinase A. Here we provide evidence against this hypothesis and demonstrate a direct relationship between Cx36 phosphorylation and AII amacrine cell coupling strength. Dopamine receptor-driven uncoupling of the AII network results from protein kinase A activation of protein phosphatase 2A and subsequent dephosphorylation of Cx36. Protein phosphatase 1 activity negatively regulates this pathway. We also find that Cx36 gap junctions can exist in widely different phosphorylation states within a single neuron, implying that coupling is controlled at the level of individual gap junctions by locally assembled signaling complexes. This kind of synapse-by-synapse plasticity allows for precise control of neuronal coupling, as well as cell-type-specific responses dependent on the identity of the signaling complexes assembled.

Management of schizophrenia with substance use disorders. Around 50% of patients with schizophrenia develop a co-occurring substance use disorder involving alcohol or illicit substances at some time during their lives. The comorbid substance abuse will markedly affect the course of illness of schizophrenia. In this article, the authors review the epidemiology, theories of causation, effect on the course of illness, and treatment of co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder.

D(2) receptors receive paracrine neurotransmission and are consistently targeted to a subset of synaptic structures in an identified neuron of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system. Dopamine (DA) modulates motor systems in phyla as diverse as nematodes and arthropods up through chordates. A comparison of dopaminergic systems across a broad phylogenetic range should reveal shared organizing principles. The pyloric network, located in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), is an important model for neuromodulation of motor networks. The effects of DA on this network have been well characterized at the circuit and cellular levels in the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Here we provide the first data about the physical organization of the DA signaling system in the STG and the function of D(2) receptors in pyloric neurons. Previous studies showed that DA altered intrinsic firing properties and synaptic output in the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, in part by reducing calcium currents and increasing outward potassium currents. We performed single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments to show that PD neurons exclusively expressed a type 2 (D(2alphaPan)) DA receptor. This was confirmed by using confocal microscopy in conjunction with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on STG whole-mount preparations containing dye-filled PD neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that surface receptors were concentrated in fine neurites/terminal swellings and vesicle-laden varicosities in the synaptic neuropil. Double-label IHC experiments with tyrosine hydroxylase antiserum suggested that the D(2alphaPan) receptors received volume neurotransmissions. Receptors were further mapped onto three-dimensional models of PD neurons built from Neurolucida tracings of confocal stacks from the IHC experiments. The data showed that D(2alphaPan) receptors were selectively targeted to approximately 40% of synaptic structures in any given PD neuron, and were nonuniformly distributed among neurites.

Structure and functionality in flavivirus NS-proteins: perspectives for drug design. Flaviviridae are small enveloped viruses hosting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. Besides yellow fever virus, a landmark case in the history of virology, members of the Flavivirus genus, such as West Nile virus and dengue virus, are increasingly gaining attention due to their re-emergence and incidence in different areas of the world. Additional environmental and demographic considerations suggest that novel or known flaviviruses will continue to emerge in the future. Nevertheless, up to few years ago flaviviruses were considered low interest candidates for drug design. At the start of the European Union VIZIER Project, in 2004, just two crystal structures of protein domains from the flaviviral replication machinery were known. Such pioneering studies, however, indicated the flaviviral replication complex as a promising target for the development of antiviral compounds. Here we review structural and functional aspects emerging from the characterization of two main components (NS3 and NS5 proteins) of the flavivirus replication complex. Most of the reviewed results were achieved within the European Union VIZIER Project, and cover topics that span from viral genomics to structural biology and inhibition mechanisms. The ultimate aim of the reported approaches is to shed light on the design and development of antiviral drug leads.


Telomerase gene mutation screening in Chinese patients with aplastic anemia.

Effects of antioxidants on glucose-induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in endothelial cells. Hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction can be the result of increased oxidative stress and concomitant increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To test the extent of coupling between these two stresses, the effect of antioxidant vitamins on glucose-induced oxidative stress and ER stress in endothelial cells were studied. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with physiological (5.5mM) or supra-physiological (27.5mM) dextrose concentrations, and ER stress and oxidative stress were measured. Additional experiments were carried out in HUVEC over-expressing exogenous glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) and treated with 5.5mM dextrose. Supra-physiological dextrose concentrations increased both ER stress and oxidative stress. However, while oxidative stress could be effectively inhibited with alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid, these antioxidants had no effect on ER stress. Increasing intracellular glucose levels by exogenous expression of Glut-1 in endothelial cells also increased oxidative stress and ER stress. Whereas the oxidative stress in these cells was reduced with alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid and dimethylsulfoxide, the ER stress could not be ameliorated with alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. These results indicate that ER stress can be uncoupled from oxidative stress and antioxidants can ameliorate the latter without altering the ER stress induced by hyperglycemia.

Extrapontine myelinolysis in preoperative sellar region tumor: report of two cases. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a well-known disorder caused by rapid correction of serum sodium. Many conditions including hormonal abnormality are associated with this syndrome. The authors describe two cases of preoperative sellar region tumor associated with hypopituitarism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. These two patients had hyponatremia. Neurological manifestations in both of them were generalized dystonia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a characteristic extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM). The first case was a 35-year-old man with craniopharyngioma who developed generalized dystonia after rapid correction of hyponatremia. The second case was a 24-year-old man with gonadotroph pituitary adenoma who developed generalized dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia in the course of hyponatremia. Hormonal changes will cause fluctuation in hyponatremia and correction of hyponatremia, even if the recommended rate may be hazardous and will promote ODS. Patients with sellar region tumors are at risk of developing ODS and correction of hyponatremia in these cases should be closely monitored.

Evaluating intra-articular drug delivery for the treatment of osteoarthritis in a rat model. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that can result in joint pain, loss of joint function, and deleterious effects on activity levels and lifestyle habits. Current therapies for OA are largely aimed at symptomatic relief and may have limited effects on the underlying cascade of joint degradation. Local drug delivery strategies may provide for the development of more successful OA treatment outcomes that have potential to reduce local joint inflammation, reduce joint destruction, offer pain relief, and restore patient activity levels and joint function. As increasing interest turns toward intra-articular drug delivery routes, parallel interest has emerged in evaluating drug biodistribution, safety, and efficacy in preclinical models. Rodent models provide major advantages for the development of drug delivery strategies, chiefly because of lower cost, successful replication of human OA-like characteristics, rapid disease development, and small joint volumes that enable use of lower total drug amounts during protocol development. These models, however, also offer the potential to investigate the therapeutic effects of local drug therapy on animal behavior, including pain sensitivity thresholds and locomotion characteristics. Herein, we describe a translational paradigm for the evaluation of an intra-articular drug delivery strategy in a rat OA model. This model, a rat interleukin-1beta overexpression model, offers the ability to evaluate anti-interleukin-1 therapeutics for drug biodistribution, activity, and safety as well as the therapeutic relief of disease symptoms. Once the action against interleukin-1 is confirmed in vivo, the newly developed anti-inflammatory drug can be evaluated for evidence of disease-modifying effects in more complex preclinical models.

Anatomy of normal human anterior cruciate ligament attachments evaluated by divided small bundles. Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has several potential advantages over single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendons. However, there are still controversies regarding tunnel placement in tibial and femoral attachments. The macroscopically normal ACL consists of small bundles about 1 mm in diameter. Detailed observation of the divided smaller bundles will achieve better understanding of the tunnel placement in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Descriptive laboratory study. This study used 20 cadaveric knees. The ACL was divided into anteromedial and posterolateral bundles, then separated into 10 small bundles of 2-mm diameters, with preservation of their attachment sites marked with color markers. The positional relationship between the femoral and tibial attachments of each small bundle was investigated. A layered positional correlation of small bundles was found between the tibial and femoral attachments. Small bundles aligned in the anterior-posterior direction in the tibia corresponded to the bundles aligned in a high-low direction in the femur in flexion. The femoral attachment pattern was relatively similar in each specimen; however, the tibial attachment showed 2 patterns: an oblique type (12 of 20) and a transverse type (8 of 20). The posterior portion of the posterolateral bundle was separately attached to the medial and lateral portions of the tibial attachment. There was no fibrous insertion in the center of the posterior portion of the ACL tibial attachment in any specimen. In this bare area, there was fat tissue and vascular bundles. Small bundles constituting the ACL showed a relatively layered arrangement between 2 attachments. The tibial attachment showed 2 patterns of oblique and transverse types, and the vascular bundles were located in the center of the posterolateral bundle. The results of this study of the normal ACL will provide insights for surgeons when placing grafts during anatomic ACL reconstruction.

Genetic influences on the cognitive biases associated with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents. There is a substantial overlap between genes affecting anxiety and depression. Both anxiety and depression are associated with cognitive biases such as anxiety sensitivity and attributional style. Little, however, is known about the relationship between these variables and whether these too are genetically correlated. Self-reports of anxiety sensitivity, anxiety symptoms, attributional style and depression symptoms were obtained for over 1300 adolescent twin and sibling pairs at two time points. The magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on the measures was examined. Strongest associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety ratings at both measurement times (r=.70, .72) and between anxiety and depression (r=.62 at both time points). Correlations between the cognitive biases were modest at time 1 (r=-.12) and slightly larger at time 2 (r=-.31). All measures showed moderate genetic influence. Generally genetic correlations reflected phenotypic correlations. Thus the highest genetic correlations were between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety ratings (.86, .87) and between anxiety and depression ratings (.77, .71). Interestingly, depression ratings also showed a high genetic correlation with anxiety sensitivity (.70, .76). Genetic correlations between the cognitive bias measures were moderate (-.31, -.46). The sample consists primarily of twins, there are limitations associated with the twin design. Cognitive biases associated with depression and anxiety are not as genetically correlated as anxiety and depression ratings themselves. Further research into the cognitive processes related to anxiety and depression will facilitate understanding of the relationship between bias and symptoms.

Bioinspired interactions studied by vibrational circular dichroism. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra are reliable indicators of the spatial structure of chiral molecules. The specific and characteristic feature of vibrational spectroscopy, and therefore also of VCD, where the energy of some vibrational modes is predominantly focused to a specific part of the molecule, enables monitoring both the structure of the molecule dissolved in different solvents and under different physicochemical conditions and molecular interactions. This minireview deals with recent contributions covering structural information on the bioinspired interactions obtained by means of VCD, especially in the following areas: interaction of DNA with biomolecules and biogenic metals, guanine tetramers and quadruplexes, biointeractions of bile pigments, and polypeptide and protein interactions with other biomolecules.

Inactivation of alternative sigma factor 54 (RpoN) leads to increased acid resistance, and alters locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) expression in Escherichia coli O157 : H7. Alternative sigma factor 54 (RpoN) is an important regulator of stress resistance and virulence genes in many bacterial species. In this study, we report on the gene expression alterations that follow rpoN inactivation in Escherichia coli O157 : H7 strain Sakai (Sakai rpoN : : kan), and the influence of RpoN on the acid resistance phenotype. Microarray gene expression profiling revealed the differential expression of 103 genes in SakairpoN : : kan relative to Sakai. This included the growth-phase-dependent upregulation of genes required for glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) ( gadA, gadB, gadC and gadE), and the downregulation of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) genes, which encode a type III secretion system. Upregulation of gad genes in SakairpoN : : kan during exponential growth correlated with increased GDAR and survival in a model stomach system. Complementation of SakairpoN : : kan with a cloned version of rpoN restored acid susceptibility. Genes involved in GDAR regulation, including rpoS (sigma factor 38) and gadE (acid-responsive regulator), were shown to be required for the survival of SakairpoN : : kan by the GDAR mechanism. This study describes the contribution of rpoN to acid resistance and GDAR gene regulation, and reveals RpoN to be an important regulator of stress resistance and virulence genes in E. coli O157 : H7.


Poverty as a determinant of young drivers' fatal crash risks.

Joint position sense and vibratory perception sense in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III (hypermobility type). Neurophysiological deficits could make patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type III (hypermobility type) more vulnerable to musculoskeletal problems, particularly to joint instability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether joint position sense (JPS) and vibratory perception sense (VPS) in EDS type III patients in the knee and shoulder joints are impaired. Thirty-two female EDS type III patients as defined by the Villefranche criteria and 32 individually gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects were included in the study. Range of motion was determined using a goniometer, passive and active JPS were assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer system, and the VPS was measured by a biothesiometer. Daily physical activity was evaluated by the Baecke questionnaire. The EDS type III group showed significantly larger ranges of movement (P < 0.05) and lower levels of sport physical activity (SPA) compared to the control group (P = 0.023). Considering SPA as covariate, the EDS type III group demonstrated a significant impairment in knee joint reposition compared to the control group (P = 0.018). No significant differences were found for shoulder JPS. The VPS was not significantly different in the EDS type III group compared to the control group. In addition, no significant correlation was found between JPS and VPS, neither at the knee nor at the shoulder joint. This is the first study examining proprioception deficits in EDS type III patients as defined by the Villefranche criteria. Further research on the neurophysiological dysfunctions and mechanisms in this pathologic entity is needed.

Phosphate-functionalized magnetic microspheres for immobilization of Zr(4+) ions for selective enrichment of the phosphopeptides. In this work, we developed phosphate functionalized magnetic Fe(3)O(4)@C microspheres to immobilize Zr(4+) ions for selective extraction and concentration of phosphopeptides for mass spectrometry analysis. Firstly, we synthesized Fe(3)O(4)@C magnetic microspheres as our previous work reported. Then, the microspheres were functionalized with phosphate groups through a simple hydrolysis reaction using 3-(trihydroxysilyl)propyl methylphosphate. And the Zr(4+) ions were immobilized on phosphate-functionalized magnetic microspheres by using phosphate chelator. Finally, we successfully employed Zr(4+)-phosphate functionalized magnetic microspheres to selectively isolate the phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of standard protein and real samples including rat brain. All the experimental results demonstrate the enrichment efficiency and selectivity of the method we reported here.


Expandable metal stents for endoscopic bilateral stent-within-stent placement for malignant hilar biliary obstruction.

[The endo-exo femur prosthesis--a new concept of bone-guided, prosthetic rehabilitation following above-knee amputation]. The implantation of an intramedullary transcutaneously conducted femur prosthesis presents a rather new procedure for the rehabilitation of above-knee amputated patients. The aim of the so-called endo-exo prosthesis is to avoid the well-known problems at the interface between the sleeve of the prosthesis and the soft tissue coat of the femur stump which often impedes an inconspicuous and harmonic gait. The company ERSKA Implants in Lübeck/Germany has developed an intramedullary femur prosthesis with a spongiosa metal-configurated relief surface which, when implanted cementless, enables a secure osseointegration and allows a more direct transmission of muscle power to the lower leg prosthesis. A minimum length of 16-18 cm and a sufficient soft tissue coverage of the femur stump is needed. The problems at the perforation point of the implant through the soft tissue coat can be handled or even be avoided and they do not necessarily provoke an intramedullary infection. We report on 30 cases that were operated between 1999 and 2008. The design of the prosthesis, aspects of the operative procedure and latest results are presented.


Surface molecular self-assembly for organophosphate pesticide imprinting in electropolymerized poly(p-aminothiophenol) membranes on a gold nanoparticle modified glassy carbon electrode.

Cancer stem cells sustaining the growth of mouse melanoma are not rare. Cancer stem cell (CSC) is generally believed to be a very small proportion of tumor cells capable of initiating and sustaining growth of the tumor. Its existence is usually demonstrated by xenotransplanting human cancer cells in immunodeficient mice. In this paper, we report that the growth of B16-F10 melanoma cells in syngeneic mice could be maintained by a relatively larger proportion (>10%) of tumor cells. The result of this study does not seem to support the current view that cancer stem cells (CSCs) responsible for the sustainable growth of tumor are rare.


Comparative evaluation of vaccine efficacy of recombinant Marek's disease virus vaccine lacking Meq oncogene in commercial chickens.

Differential diagnosis of chylothorax in a patient on parenteral nutrition: a case report. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is widely used when enteral feeding is contraindicated or not possible in patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, but it is not without complications. We describe the rare complication of PN-related chylothorax that can lead to extensive investigations if not picked up early with clinical suspicion and simple biochemical tests.

A study of the effects of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole   and letrozole on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women   with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. ALIQUOT (Anastrozole vs. Letrozole, an Investigation of Quality Of Life and Tolerability) was a prospective, open-label, randomized pharmacodynamic study designed to assess the effects of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Ninety-four patients were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg), or 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg). After completion of the study period, patients in the immediate adjuvant group were either switched to tamoxifen (n = 38) or continued on anastrozole or letrozole. In the beginning of the study, 42 patients had taken tamoxifen within 3 months. Patients taking drugs likely to affect bone metabolism, including bisphosphonates, were excluded. Eighty-four patients had complete sample measurements and were included in the analysis. Prior tamoxifen therapy resulted in a significantly lower mean baseline procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (PINP) compared with patients with no prior tamoxifen. There were no significant differences in bone markers between AIs at any time. By 6 months, significant increases were seen in PINP, C-terminal telopeptides (CTX), bone specific alkaline phosphatise (ALP), and urinary N-terminal telopeptides (NTX). Patients with prior tamoxifen had significantly greater increases than patients with no prior tamoxifen. Patients treated with 3 months of tamoxifen following 6 months of an AI showed a significant decrease in markers of bone resorption, serum CTX and urinary NTX. In conclusion, AI-induced bone turnover increases over time. Anastrozole and letrozole produce similar effects on bone metabolism and turnover. Stopping tamoxifen therapy and starting AIs results in a significantly greater increase in bone turnover compared with commencing AIs in tamoxifen-naïve patients. Patients given tamoxifen following AI therapy showed a decrease in markers of bone resorption.

Paramutation: the tip of an epigenetic iceberg?

Evidence of effectiveness of herbal medicinal products in the treatment of arthritis. Part 2: Rheumatoid arthritis. Herbal medicinal products (HMPs) that interact with the mediators of inflammation are used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to update a previous systematic review published in 2000. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane registers) to June 2007, unrestricted by date or language, and included randomized controlled trials that compared HMPs with inert (placebo) or active controls in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Five reviewers contributed to data extraction. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus with reference to Cochrane guidelines and advice from the Cochrane Collaboration. Twenty studies (10 identified for this review update, and 10 of the 11 studies of the original review) investigating 14 HMPs were included. Meta-analysis was restricted to data from previous seven studies with oils from borage, blackcurrant and evening primrose containing gamma linolenic acid (GLA). GLA doses equal or higher than 1400 mg/day showed benefit in the alleviation of rheumatic complaints whereas lower doses ( approximately 500 mg) were ineffective. Three studies compared products from Tripterygium wilfordii (thunder god vine) to placebos and returned favorable results but data could not be pooled because the interventions and measures differed. Serious adverse effects occurred in one study. In a follow-up study all side effects were mild to moderate and resolved after the intervention ceased, but time to resolution was variable. Two studies comparing Phytodolor NR to placebo were of limited use because some measures were poorly defined. The remaining studies, each considering differing HMPs, were assessed individually. For most HMPs used in the treatment of RA, the evidence of effectiveness was insufficient to either recommend or discourage their use. Interventions with HMPs containing GLA or Tripterygium wilfordii extract appear to produce therapeutic effects but further investigations are warranted to prove their effectiveness and safety.

Variation of treatment planning parameters (D90 HR-CTV, D 2cc for OAR) for cervical cancer tandem ring brachytherapy in a multicentre setting: comparison of standard planning and 3D image guided optimisation based on a joint protocol for dose-volume constraints. To perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of different treatment planning methods used in different centres for MRI-based brachytherapy (BT) of cervical cancer. Two representative patients with advanced cervical cancer (1 "limited volume case"; 1 "extensive volume case") were planned for brachytherapy (BT) with a tandem-ring applicator by six different centres. During a workshop all centres produced an institutional standard plan and an MRI-based adaptive treatment plan for each case. Optimisation was based on the fractionation schedule (HDR, PDR) and method according to the institutional protocol. The loading pattern, dwell times, shape of the point A isodose varied considerably between institutional standard plans, as did dose-volume parameters for high risk CTV (HR-CTV) and also for the D(2cc) for OAR, violating the dose-volume constraints in many situations. During optimisation, the centres stayed as close as possible to the standard loading pattern and dwell times. The dose distributions and dose-volume parameters between the plans from the different centres became much more comparable after optimisation. The prescribed dose to the HR-CTV could be achieved in the limited volume case by all centres, in the extensive case only if additional needles were applied. Treatment planning for gynaecologic brachytherapy based on different traditions shows less variation in regard to target coverage and OAR dose, when 3D image-based optimisation is performed with a uniform prescription protocol.

The pepper 9-lipoxygenase gene CaLOX1 functions in defense and cell death responses to microbial pathogens. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are crucial for lipid peroxidation processes during plant defense responses to pathogen infection. A pepper (Capsicum annuum) 9-LOX gene, CaLOX1, which encodes a 9-specific lipoxygenase, was isolated from pepper leaves. Recombinant CaLOX1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the hydroperoxidation of linoleic acid, with a K(m) value of 113. 9 mum. Expression of CaLOX1 was differentially induced in pepper leaves not only during Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (Xcv) infection but also after exposure to abiotic elicitors. Transient expression of CaLOX1 in pepper leaves induced the cell death phenotype and defense responses. CaLOX1-silenced pepper plants were more susceptible to Xcv and Colletotrichum coccodes infection, which was accompanied by reduced expression of defense-related genes, lowered lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased reactive oxygen species and lowered salicylic acid accumulation. Infection with Xcv, especially in an incompatible interaction, rapidly stimulated LOX activity in unsilenced, but not CaLOX1-silenced, pepper leaves. Furthermore, overexpression of CaLOX1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) conferred enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and Alternaria brassicicola. In contrast, mutation of the Arabidopsis CaLOX1 ortholog AtLOX1 significantly increased susceptibility to these three pathogens. Together, these results suggest that CaLOX1 and AtLOX1 positively regulate defense and cell death responses to microbial pathogens.

[Clinical heterogeneity and coexistence of diabetic neuropathies: difference and similarities between types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus]. To evaluate the heterogeneity and the coexistence of diabetic neuropathy (DNP) in type 1 (T1DM) and 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. 74 T2DM and 20 T1DM patients were evaluated according to age (years), time from diagnosis of diabetes (TDD, years), body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), HbA1c and DNP type (American Diabetes Association criteria). T1DM was younger (32.7 +/- 11.0 versus 56.9 +/- 10.3; p = 0.0001), leaner (BMI: 23.6 +/- 3.85 versus 28.4 +/- 5.3; p = 0.0005) and they had longer TDD (17.1 +/- 9.7 versus 10.4 +/- 6.8; p = 0.003). Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (60% versus 32.4%; p = 0.02) and its coexistence with polyneuropathy (PN) (62.5% versus 33.3%; p = 0.03) were more common in T1DM. Chronic painful polyneuropathy (CPP) was more prevalent in T2DM (60.8% versus 30.0%; p = 0.009). Logistic regression showed HbA1c as an independent variable related to PN (p = 0.04) in both groups. TDD (p = 0.03) and CPP (p = 0.003) were related to CAN in T1DM. Age (p = 0.0004) was related to CPP in T2DM. The DNP have shown a heterogeneity distribution in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The related factors to different phenotypes of this complication, apart from hyperglycemia, may be variable between these two types of diabetes mellitus.

Bordetella pertussis vaccine strains and circulating isolates in Serbia. In Serbia, whole cell pertussis vaccine was introduced in 1957. Current composition of the vaccine has been used since 1985 and contains four autochthonous strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 1957 to 1984. To monitor changes in bacterial population, 70 isolates collected from 1953 to 2000 were studied together with the vaccine strains. The methods included serotyping of fimbriae (Fim), genotyping of pertactin (prn) and pertussis toxin S1 subunit (ptxA), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. Shift from ptxA2 to ptxA1 has been observed in isolates since the late of 1960s. All isolates from 1980 to 1984 harbored ptxA1. Re-appearance of the ptxA2 allele followed an addition of the two strains harboring ptxA1 in the vaccine in 1985. The allele prn1 was predominant among the Serbian isolates, though prn3 and prn11 have been detected since 1981 and 1984. The allele prn2 was found only in two strains isolated in 2000. Serotype Fim2.3 disappeared before 1980 and serotype Fim2 became predominant since then. The Serbian vaccine strains showed differences in ptxA and prn. The results of this present study indicate that the B. pertussis population in Serbia is different from other vaccinated populations and that this difference may be related to the vaccine used.

Mucocele of appendiceal stump--an atypical presentation and a diagnostic dilemma. Appendiceal mucocele is a well-recognised entity that can present in a variety of clinical syndromes or can occur as an incidental surgical finding. The term mucocele is inherently imprecise and inclusive of both benign and malignant lesions. Mucocele of the appendiceal stump is a rare entity. We present a case of an appendiceal stump mucocele caused by a mucinous cystadenoma clinically presented as a giant retroperitoneal mass. Diagnosis was made postoperatively, after pathological study of the surgical sample. The case of a 54-year-old woman, with a previous appendectomy, suffering from a painful mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, is reported. Imaging showed a large cystic structure at the base of the caecum. Surgery revealed a 13 x 5.5 cm retroperitoneal cystic mass, which was excised together with the appendiceal remnant. Pathological diagnosis was that of a mucocele arising from the appendiceal stump due to the development of a benign mucinous cystadenoma. The patient was discharged on the fourth post-operative day after an uneventful recovery. Mucocele of the appendiceal stump is a rare entity. In spite of extensive pre-operative investigations, preoperative diagnosis may still remain elusive and may only be made at the time of surgery.

Heightened flexor withdrawal response in individuals with knee osteoarthritis is modulated by joint compression and joint mobilization. Patients with chronic pain often present with hyperalgesia, possibly due to hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in flexor withdrawal reflex (FWR) excitability in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the potential effect of specific physical inputs or therapeutic interventions (ie, joint compression and mobilization) on these behaviors. Ten subjects with and 10 without knee OA (age 45-75) were recruited. The FWR was examined utilizing suprathreshold, noxious electrocutaneous stimuli applied at the medial foot. Surface electromyographic (EMG) was recorded from the tibialis anterior (TA) and biceps femoris (BF), and peak joint torques recorded at the hip, knee, and ankle. FWR threshold was ascertained and responses at 2x threshold recorded after the following conditions: a maximal, volitional, joint-compression task, a sham hands-on intervention, and a Grade III oscillatory joint-mobilization intervention. A decreased threshold-to-flexor withdrawal response was found in the OA vs control group (P < .01). EMG and joint-torque FWR responses were further augmented in the OA group following the maximal joint-compression task (P < .05), yet remained unchanged or diminished in controls. Joint mobilization, but not sham intervention, reduced reflex responses significantly, although primarily by decreasing BF activity and knee torques (P < .05). Application of specific physical inputs to individuals with knee OA similar to those encountered during activity of daily living or during therapeutic interventions appear to modulate involuntary, nociceptive reflex responses. Routine weight-bearing activities such as walking may potentially enhance heightened FWR responses, while joint mobilization, a commonly used clinical intervention, may diminish reflex excitability.


Chronic inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 attenuates antibody responses against vaccinia infection.

Common peroneal nerve palsy following TNF-based isolated limb perfusion for irresectable extremity desmoid tumor. Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) (2 mg, TNF-alpha and 100mg, melphalan) was performed for an irresectable right thigh desmoid tumor with calf extension in a 49-year-old man. The patient had a history of four resections since the age of 19 years. Local ILP toxicity appeared with extensive edema and common peroneal neurologic impairment including paresis that remained severe 10 months later. One of the most troublesome side effects of perfusion is peripheral nerve damage, which has been reported at a rate of between 1 and 48% of perfused patients. ILP is an effective treatment in recurrence situations or where resection threatens loss of function; it, however, requires administration in specialized centers, progress in standardization and close monitoring to avoid locoregional toxicity, the mechanisms of which merit further investigation. Emergency compartmental pressure measurement may indicate fasciotomy, can be of great interest.

Robot-assisted ureteroureterostomy in the adult: initial clinical series. To report what we believe is the first series of robot-assisted ureteroureterostomy (RAUU) in adults with greater than 24-month follow-up because ureteral stricture disease can be difficult to manage. During 2004-2006, a total of 3 patients were found to have complex ureteral pathology: 2 with refractory symptomatic ureteral strictures and 1 with a complete ureteral transection. After thorough discussion of all available treatment options, these patients agreed to undergo RAUU. All patients had successful primary reanastomosis of the ureter robotically. Average operating room time was 136.6 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 3 days. All patients had ureteral stents placed during the operation. All patients at last follow-up were noted to be pain free with stable T(1/2) on nuclear renal scan. RAUU is a potential treatment option for ureteral strictures in carefully selected patients. These cases may include failed endopyelotomy, refractory ureteral stricture, or cases of ureteral transection in which a ureteral reimplantation may be difficult. The robotic platform provides excellent reconstructive capabilities that may be difficult to obtain for surgeons who are not performing laparoscopic cases in high volume.

Bacopa monnieri and Bacoside-A for ameliorating epilepsy associated behavioral deficits. Bacopa monnieri is an outstanding nervine tonic used for raising the mental performance. It helps in concentration, comprehension, recall and alertness, Brahmi is particularly beneficial as it aids in categorizing information in brain and its subsequent expression. Bacopa is also called as a natural antioxidant which may give details its neuroprotective role seen in the memory centers of the brain. Epilepsy is neuronal disorder characterized by learning, cognitive and memory impairments. The present review summarizes information concerning botany, chemistry and beneficial effect of Bacopa monnieri on epilepsy associated behavioral deficits.

Procalcitonin: inflammatory biomarker for assessing the severity of community-acquired pneumonia--a clinical observation in geriatric patients. Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease of the elderly and involves a high mortality risk. Demographic developments are creating new challenges for acute medical treatment strategies in geriatric patients with their underlying multimorbidity. In addition to the diagnostic parameters recorded on hospital admission, such as white cell count and C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, more than the risk scores CRB- and CURB-65 evaluated to date, appears to be a promising parameter for assessing the severity of pneumonia in elderly patients to allow early detection of severe courses and initiation of suitable treatment. The decisive factor is the dynamic course of the procalcitonin values over 3 consecutive days, as demonstrated in this case series.


Heparin inhibits the production of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and improves atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice.

Arsenic transport by zebrafish aquaglyceroporins. Arsenic is one of the most ubiquitous toxins and endangers the health of tens of millions of humans worldwide. It is a mainly a water-borne contaminant. Inorganic trivalent arsenic (AsIII) is one of the major species that exists environmentally. The transport of AsIII has been studied in microbes, plants and mammals. Members of the aquaglyceroporin family have been shown to actively conduct AsIII and its organic metabolite, monomethylarsenite (MAsIII). However, the transport of AsIII and MAsIII in in any fish species has not been characterized. In this study, five members of the aquaglyceroporin family from zebrafish (Danio rerio) were cloned, and their ability to transport water, glycerol, and trivalent arsenicals (AsIII and MAsIII) and antimonite (SbIII) was investigated. Genes for at least seven aquaglyceroporins have been annotated in the zebrafish genome project. Here, five genes which are close homologues to human AQP3, AQP9 and AQP10 were cloned from a zebrafish cDNA preparation. These genes were named aqp3, aqp3l, aqp9a, aqp9b and aqp10 according to their similarities to the corresponding human AQPs. Expression of aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l and aqp10 in multiple zebrafish organs were examined by RT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that these aquaglyceroporins exhibited different tissue expression. They are all detected in more than one tissue. The ability of these five aquaglyceroporins to transport water, glycerol and the metalloids arsenic and antimony was examined following expression in oocytes from Xenopus leavis. Each of these channels showed substantial glycerol transport at equivalent rates. These aquaglyceroporins also facilitate uptake of inorganic AsIII, MAsIII and SbIII. Arsenic accumulation in fish larvae and in different tissues from adult zebrafish was studied following short-term arsenic exposure. The results showed that liver is the major organ of arsenic accumulation; other tissues such as gill, eye, heart, intestine muscle and skin also exhibited significant ability to accumulate arsenic. The zebrafish larvae also accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic. This is the first molecular identification of fish arsenite transport systems and we propose that the extensive expression of the fish aquaglyceroporins and their ability to transport metalloids suggests that aquaglyceroporins are the major pathways for arsenic accumulation in a variety of zebrafish tissues. Uptake is one important step of arsenic metabolism. Our results will contribute to a new understanding of aquatic arsenic metabolism and will support the use of zebrafish as a new model system to study arsenic associated human diseases.

Effects of growth hormone treatment on growth in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Several therapeutic trials have been conducted over the past decade to evaluate the role of exogenous growth hormone (GH) as a means of correcting the growth deficiency seen in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Early studies showed the benefit of GH treatment with respect to final height in patients with JIA. Of 13 patients receiving GH, 84% (11 patients) achieved a final height within their target range compared with only 22% (4 of 18 patients) of untreated patients. There are, however, factors that may limit the statural gains achieved with GH therapy including severe inflammation, severe statural deficiency at GH therapy initiation, long disease duration and delayed puberty. Data on the efficacy of GH replacement therapy in children with JIA and factors that influence the statural growth response will be reviewed. Results from therapeutic trials show that treatment with GH can decrease the statural deficit that occurs during the active phase of JIA, producing an adult height that is close to the genetically determined target height.

[Protective effect of diclofenac towards the oxidative stress induced by paracetamol toxicity in rats]. Association of paracetamol (PARA) and diclofenac (DiCF) is the aim of our study. 60 male rats "Albinos wistar" were treated by oral gavage (per os) during seven days. A control group was treated by mineral water (0+0) mg/kg and a second group was treated with only a toxic dose of 100 mg/kg of PARA (100+0). Remaining lots were treated with a combination of different toxic doses of PARA and a therapeutic dose of DiCF (15+3, 100+3, 200+3 and 400+3) mg/kg. Plasma concentration of amiotransferases (ASAT, ALAT), alkalines phosphatase (ALP), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione (GSH), glucose, cholesterol, creatinin, direct and total bilirubin, significantly varied in the treated rats regarding to the witness's rats. The toxicity of PARA revealed by a dose dependant blood increases of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, glucose, creatinin, bilirubin, and by decreases of cholesterol concentration and tissue GSH in comparisons to controls. The depletion of GSH and the increase of the oxidative stress enzymes (GPx and GR) suggest a detoxification function of the glutathione system. The association (PARA + DiCF) revealed a protective effect, resulting in the increase of the concentrations of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, bilirubin and the increase of GSH. Regarding to all these results, it has been suggested that DiCF has a protective action towards the toxic effects of PARA.

Typology of club drug use among young adults recruited using time-space sampling. The present study examined patterns of recent club drug use among 400 young adults (18-29) recruited using time-space sampling in NYC. Subjects had used at least one of six club drugs (methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), cocaine, methamphetamine, and D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) within the prior 3 months. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to estimate latent groups based on patterns of recent club drug use and examined differences in demographic and psychological variables by class. A 3-class model fit the data best. Patterns were: Primary cocaine users (42% of sample), Mainstream users (44% of sample), and Wide-range users (14% of sample). Those most likely to be Primary cocaine users were significantly less likely to be heterosexual males and had higher educational attainment than the other two classes. Those most likely to be Wide-range users were less likely to be heterosexual females, more likely to be gay/bisexual males, dependent on club drugs, had significantly greater drug and sexual sensation seeking, and were more likely to use when experiencing physical discomfort or pleasant times with others compared to the other two groups. Findings highlight the utility of using person-centered approaches to understand patterns of substance use, as well as highlight several patterns of club drug use among young adults.

Contribution of interaction with family, friends and neighbours, and sense of neighbourhood attachment to survival in senior citizens: 5-year follow-up study. This study examines how social engagement with family, friends and neighbours and a sense of attachment to neighbourhood are associated with 5-year survival among senior citizens in Japan. A cohort study was conducted with 3283 seniors of Tokyo born in 1903, 1908, 1913, or 1918 who were recruited from stratified random sampling of resident registration records of two cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area. They were administered with a questionnaire in 1992, and the responses were compared with their 5-year survival status in 1997. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that activities with family, friends and neighbours are significant predictors of 5-year survival of senior citizens, independent of the baseline demographics, lifestyle and health status. The analysis further indicated that a sense of attachment to neighbourhood (i.e., expression of a desire to continue staying in the current residential area) significantly predicts 5-year survival of female senior citizens and enhances the survival benefits of activities with friends and neighbourhood activities. Our results highlight the importance of strengthening and enhancing the quality of community life to sustain the health and well-being of seniors and overcome challenges associated with an aging population.

Toxicology: pearls and pitfalls in the use of antidotes. Although most poisonings require only supportive care, the emergency physician must recognize when the use of an antidote is required, and understand the risks and benefits of the treatment rendered. Although the more commonly instituted specific therapy in acute poisoning is the administration of intravenous fluids followed by the administration of oxygen, in certain circumstances prompt administration of a specific antidote may be required, and failure to identify these circumstances may lead to significant morbidity or mortality. This article describes select antidotes, and discusses their indications and potential pitfalls.

Pediatric emergencies associated with fever. Fever is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 38.0 degrees C (>100.4 degrees F). A recently documented fever at home should be considered the same as a fever in the ED and should be managed similarly. All febrile infants younger than 28 days should receive a "full sepsis workup" and be admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy. Clinical and laboratory criteria can be used to identify a low-risk population of febrile infants aged 1 to 4 months who have not received 2 doses of conjugate vaccines for bacterial meningitis. Children with sickle cell disease are at high risk and require special evaluation. MRSA infections are now common and should be considered in all patients with pyoderma, severe pneumonia, and catheter-related sepsis. HSV infection of the CNS should be considered whenever a patient has altered mental status and CSF findings are not diagnostic of bacterial meningitis. Fever rarely represents life-threatening pathology; however, a handful of less common serious causes of pediatric fever exist with the potential for morbidity and mortality.

Correlations between gene expression and mercury levels in blood of boys with and without autism. Gene expression in blood was correlated with mercury levels in blood of 2- to 5-year-old boys with autism (AU) compared to age-matched typically developing (TD) control boys. This was done to address the possibility that the two groups might metabolize toxicants, such as mercury, differently. RNA was isolated from blood and gene expression assessed on whole genome Affymetrix Human U133 expression microarrays. Mercury levels were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed and partial correlations between gene expression and mercury levels were calculated, after correcting for age and batch effects. To reduce false positives, only genes shared by the ANCOVA models were analyzed. Of the 26 genes that correlated with mercury levels in both AU and TD boys, 11 were significantly different between the groups (P(Diagnosis*Mercury) ≤ 0.05). The expression of a large number of genes (n = 316) correlated with mercury levels in TD but not in AU boys (P ≤ 0.05), the most represented biological functions being cell death and cell morphology. Expression of 189 genes correlated with mercury levels in AU but not in TD boys (P ≤ 0.05), the most represented biological functions being cell morphology, amino acid metabolism, and antigen presentation. These data and those in our companion study on correlation of gene expression and lead levels show that AU and TD children display different correlations between transcript levels and low levels of mercury and lead. These findings might suggest different genetic transcriptional programs associated with mercury in AU compared to TD children.

Gastric collision tumor of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma--a case report. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) of the stomach are rare and represent only a small percentage of all gastric endocrine tumors. Here we report a case of a rare combination of gastric LCNEC concurrent with gastric adenocarcinoma. A 50-year-old man presented with heartburn sensation for 2 weeks. An endoscopic evaluation revealed a relatively well-demarcated ulcerative elevated lesion at the lower body of the stomach. Grossly, the gastric mass was a 5x4.5 cm-sized ulcerative fungating lesion. Microscopically, two separated lesions were recognized. The main lesion showed neuroendocrine morphology, such as nests and trabeculae. Most of the tumor cells had large, vesicular nuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, and immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The other lesion was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of early gastric cancer type IIa located adjacent mucosa of the main lesion. We diagnosed this lesion as gastric LCNEC concurrent with focal adenocarcinoma, collision type.

From partnership to policy: the evolution of Active Living by Design in Portland, Oregon. Portland's Active Living by Design focused on two communities facing different active living challenges: Lents is an urban, lower-income community with poor bicycle/pedestrian and park infrastructure, and Damascus is a semirural community expected to see extensive urban growth in the next 30 years. Pilot projects were implemented in a semirural community with considerable growth potential, and a lower-income, ethnically diverse urban neighborhood. The partners' primary active-living goals included: prepare and sustain a network of public health, planning, community, and policymaking partners; affect urban planning and policy decisions to influence built-environment changes in Portland neighborhoods; and support active-living program and promotion partners. Partners have focused on building capacity for cross-disciplinary collaboration and leading strategic efforts toward policy, environmental, and social change. Partners have been engaged in policy advocacy and strategic campaign initiatives, as well as community program efforts that bring active living opportunities to underserved neighborhoods. The ALbD community-action model served as a valuable tool for organizing intervention activities and bringing diverse partners together under a shared vision. Public health professionals engaged in land-use and transportation collaborations must strike a balance between becoming experts in technical aspects of new disciplines and addressing a wide range of active living determinants. Embracing a healthy community agenda can create fruitful new partnerships and increase the impact on systemic change. Many of the partnerships' collaborative efforts to encourage healthy communities through policy, environmental, and social change have been largely successful and can serve as a model for other communities.


Residents' and attending physicians' handoffs: a systematic review of the literature.

Activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-induced tryptophan degradation in advanced atherosclerotic plaques: Tampere vascular study. We aimed to characterize the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or IDO-induced tryptophan degradation-dependent pathways, which may lead to suppression of T cells and possible protection against atherosclerosis. Expression of IDO and IDO-related pathway components was analyzed in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques (n = 24) and in non-atherosclerotic arteries (n = 6). Up-regulation of IDO and genes related to the IDO pathway was found to be pronounced in atherosclerotic plaques. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated IDO protein in the atheromatous core and co-distribution with monocyte-macrophages (CD68-positive cells). In gene-set enrichment analysis, the IDO pathway revealed a significant (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.07) regulatory T cell, fork-head box protein 3 (FoxP3)-initiated CD28-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-driven pathway leading to activation of IDO expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Expression of these IDO pathway genes varied between 2.1- and 16.8-fold as compared to control tissues (P < 0.05 for all). IDO and the IDO-related pathway are important mediators of the immunoinflammatory responses in advanced atherosclerosis offering new viable therapeutic targets for the development of antiatherogenic immunosuppressive therapies.

A selective, nontoxic, OFF-ON fluorescent molecular sensor based on 8-hydroxyquinoline for probing Cd(2+) in living cells. In spite of the fact that cadmium(II) has been recognized as a highly toxic element and that excessive exposure to this metal ion has been reported to have many adverse effects on human health, very few selective and specific fluorescent probes are available for imaging Cd(2+) in living cells. Herein, we report the spectroscopic and photochemical characterization of 5-(5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinolinylmethyl)-2,8-dithia-5-aza-2,6-pyridinophane (L) as a fluorescent sensor for the selective imaging of Cd(2+) in living cells. In particular, the response of L to Cd(2+) was first assessed in aqueous solutions, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, and liposomes, and subsequently in living cells by fluorescence microscopy techniques. Cytofluorimetric analyses of leukemic HL-60 cells loaded with L also allowed evaluation of the toxicity of the probe and the selective analysis of its intracellular fluorescence in the presence of Cd(2+). Furthermore, the 1:1 complex species [Cd(L)H(2)O](2+) responsible for the OFF-ON chelation enhancement of fluorescence (CHEF) effect on L was structurally characterized; time-dependent DFT calculations allowed the prediction of theoretical excitations, which were comparable with the experimental ones.

[Expression, purification and characterization of bacteriophage lysin of Streptococcus in Escherichia coli]. Lysins are murein hydrolases produced by bacteriophage that act on the cell wall of host bacteria to release progeny phages. Research indicated that lysins could kill bacteria effectively and specifically in vitro. To prepare recombinant bacteriophage lysin of Streptococcus (PlyC) and analyze its biological activity, we obtained two genes of PlyC named PlyCA and PlyCB by PCR amplification and inserted them into pET-32a(+), then transformed the recombinant expression vectors pET-32a(+)-PlyCA and pET-32a(+)-PlyCB into E. coli BL21(DE3) respectively. After induction with 0.7 mmol/L IPTG at 30 degrees C for 7 h, PlyCA and PlyCB were successfully expressed, SDS-PAGE analysis determined that they all constituted above 30% of the total cell proteins. After Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography, the purity was more than 95%. With the denaturation and protein refolding, we gained the recombinant PlyC. To determine its biological activity, we adopted turbidimetry and plate count method. Before and after lysin treatment, the cell morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the recombinant PlyC could specifically cleavage Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci). Under the incubation time of 60 min with 4 microg/mL PlyC in Streptococcus pyogenes dilution which OD600 was 0.56, the germicidal effect was up to 99.6%, while SEM observations showed that cell wall cracked and presented cell debris. This finding laid the foundation for the further study and achieving an effective treatment for streptococcal infection.

Functional features of gene expression profiles differentiating gastrointestinal stromal tumours according to KIT mutations and expression. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) represent a heterogeneous group of tumours of mesenchymal origin characterized by gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. Although mutations in either receptor are thought to drive an early oncogenic event through similar pathways, two previous studies reported the mutation-specific gene expression profiles. However, their further conclusions were rather discordant. To clarify the molecular characteristics of differentially expressed genes according to GIST receptor mutations, we combined microarray-based analysis with detailed functional annotations. Total RNA was isolated from 29 frozen gastric GISTs and processed for hybridization on GENECHIP HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix). KIT and PDGFRA were analyzed by sequencing, while related mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Fifteen and eleven tumours possessed mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, respectively; no mutation was found in three tumours. Gene expression analysis identified no discriminative profiles associated with clinical or pathological parameters, even though expression of hundreds of genes differentiated tumour receptor mutation and expression status. Functional features of genes differentially expressed between the two groups of GISTs suggested alterations in angiogenesis and G-protein-related and calcium signalling. Our study has identified novel molecular elements likely to be involved in receptor-dependent GIST development and allowed confirmation of previously published results. These elements may be potential therapeutic targets and novel markers of KIT mutation status.

Grassroots coalition building: lessons from the field. In an era of major health care reform, nursing professionals will best impact both the politics surrounding reform as well as related health policy through well-established and effective collaborative groups. Whether the work is taking place at the local, state, or national levels, successful and powerful coalitions are the result of skill and finesse-not luck-and therefore must be built upon connecting with the right people, communicating effectively, understanding political challenges, and navigating them skillfully. The authors offer 10 success strategies for building successful coalitions based on lessons learned over a decade of involvement in grassroots nursing workforce initiatives.

Microbial antitumor drugs: natural products of microbial origin as anticancer agents. This review discusses the role of microbial secondary metabolites produced by organisms from all three domains of life (the Archaea, Prokarya and Eukarya) as sources of pure natural products or derivatives of natural products, and as leads for novel synthetic compounds that may have the potential to ameliorate cancer. Drugs for which a microbe has either been identified as the producer of the active component or has been associated with its production based on circumstantial evidence are discussed. In addition, the impact of the increase in available genomic information and manipulation is discussed, along with some relevant examples, leading to the realization that the potential of microbes as sources of new leads/agents or as biological probes is large.

Interferon induced thyroiditis. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used for the treatment of various disorders, most notable chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. One of the commonest side effects of IFNalpha therapy is thyroiditis, with up to 40% of HCV patients on IFNalpha developing clinical or subclinical disease. In some cases interferon induced thyroiditis (IIT) may result in severe symptomatology necessitating discontinuation of therapy. IIT can manifest as clinical autoimmune thyroiditis, presenting with symptoms of classical Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, or as non-autoimmune thyroiditis. Non-autoimmune thyroiditis can manifest as destructive thyroiditis, with early thyrotoxicosis and later hypothyroidism, or as non-autoimmune hypothyroidism. While the epidemiology and clinical presentation of IIT have been well characterized the mechanisms causing IIT are still poorly understood. It is likely that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) itself plays a role in the disease, as the association between HCV infection and thyroiditis is well established. It is believed that IFNalpha induces thyroiditis by both immune stimulatory effects and by direct effects on the thyroid. Early detection and therapy of this condition are important in order to avoid complications of thyroid disease such as cardiac arrhythmias.

Pacifier-sucking and breast-feeding: a comparison between the 1960 s and the 1990 s. Pacifiers and their forerunners have been condemned in past centuries, probably beginning in the 17(th) and 18(th) centuries when alcohol and opiates were incorporated as fillings in sucking rags in Great Britain. Nowadays, the modern pacifier is criticized for reducing breast-feeding time and encouraging weaning. The purpose of this study was to analyze if pacifier-sucking has been detrimental to breast-feeding in the past few decades. In the present study, 2 groups of young children born 30 years apart (1967 and 1995 to 1997) in the same geographic area were analyzed in the first 6 months of age regarding their sucking and feeding habits, including initial and prolonged pacifier-sucking and breast-feeding. Findings do not support the commonly held opinion that pacifier-sucking reduces breast-feeding time. In the 30 years that separate the 2 groups, the pacifier-sucking habit increased by 32% and prolonged use of a pacifier increased. At the same time, breast-feeding at 6 months old has increased 20-fold in the contemporary group (born between 1995 and 1997) as compared with the 1967 group. The results suggest that mothers might be unable to satisfy their child's sucking urge through breast-feeding alone, and that they use the pacifier as a supplement. Pacifier use does not negatively affect the prevalence of breast-feeding.

Lesions of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex prevent response conflict produced by action-outcome associations. Rats with prelimbic (PL) cortex lesions were tested on a discrete-trial discrimination where food rewards were used as both discriminative cues and reinforcing outcomes. On incongruent trials, the discriminative cue food differed from the outcome food; on congruent trials they were the same. When cue and outcome foods differ, a conflict is created between the response directly promoted by the food as a cue (mediated by stimulus-response, S-R, associations) and the response indirectly promoted by the food as an outcome (mediated via action-outcome associations). No conflict is produced when cue and outcome foods are the same. Sham-lesioned rats acquired the discrimination more slowly for incongruent trials than for congruent trials, and incongruent trials were more susceptible to disruption by delay. In contrast there was no difference between congruent and incongruent trial types in PL-lesioned animals during acquisition or delay testing. Delays between cue and response had greater overall effects on lesioned than on sham-lesioned animals. These results are consistent with the behaviour of PL-lesioned animals being controlled by S-R associations with no response conflict due to interference from action-outcome associations.

Reduction of Cr(VI) by crop-residue-derived black carbon. Burning crop residues is a common postharvest practice on farmland, leading to the accumulation of black carbon (BC) in the soil. To understand the potential role of BC in immobilizing toxic Cr(VI) in soil, this study evaluated the Cr(VI) sorption kinetics at pH levels ranging from 3 to 7 and examined the reaction mechanism of Cr(VI) with BC derived from burning rice straw. The BC samples, after reacting with Cr(VI), were analyzed using Cr K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that Cr(VI) was sorbed and subsequently reduced to Cr(III), which was bound to the BC surface through surface complexation and precipitation. As indicated by the diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectra, the phenolic groups of BC are the dominant drivers of Cr(VI) reduction, giving rise to carbonyl/carboxyl groups on the BC surface. The reaction rate of Cr(VI) with BC increased from 10(-3.62) to 10(-1.65) h(-1) as pH was decreased from 7 to 3 because Cr(VI) sorption and reduction both occur faster at low pH. These results suggest that BC derived from burning crop residue is an effective reductant for Cr(VI) and may play an important role in determining the fate of Cr(VI) in BC-rich farmland soils.

A survey of recycling behaviour in households in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This paper examines the factors that might influence recycling behaviour of the households in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Information on recycling activity, socio-economic characteristics, and attitudes of the households towards recycling were obtained from interviews with 456 households in Dhaka. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the dominant factors that might influence the recycling behaviour of the households. The results showed that environmental consciousness, the availability of storage space, and age (25-35 years) are significant positive predictors of recycling behaviour (at the 1% level). Another variable Income 2 (TK3,000-15,000) is also positively correlated with recycling (at the 5% level). Establishment of a recycling programme could be an effective strategy in implementing sustainable waste management in Bangladesh. For this strategy to succeed, however, active partnership between households and the waste management service department is required. The households' attitudes toward recycling should, therefore, be taken into consideration as should the results of this study, which are important indicators of households' positive attitudes toward sustainable waste management in Dhaka.

Cognitive outcome following traumatic brain injury. To determine whether an association exists between traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained in adulthood and cognitive impairment 6 months or longer after injury. Systematic review of the published, peer-reviewed literature. From 430 articles, we identified 11 primary and 22 secondary studies that examined cognitive impairment by using performance measures for adults who were at least 6 months post-TBI. There was clear evidence of an association between penetrating brain injury and impaired cognitive function. Factors that modified this association included preinjury intelligence, volume of brain tissue lost, and brain region injured. There was also suggestive evidence that penetrating brain injury may exacerbate the cognitive effects of normal aging. We found clear evidence for long-term cognitive deficits associated with severe TBI. There was suggestive evidence that moderately severe brain injuries are associated with cognitive impairments. There was inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists between a single, mild TBI and cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. In adults, penetrating, moderate, and severe TBIs are associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether mild TBI is associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury.

Rhodopsin: the functional significance of asn-linked glycosylation and other post-translational modifications. Rhodopsin, the G-protein coupled receptor in retinal rod photoreceptors, is a highly conserved protein that undergoes several types of post-translational modifications. These modifications are essential to maintain the protein's structure as well as its proper function in the visual transduction cycle. Rhodopsin is N-glycosylated at Asn-2 and Asn-15 in its extracellular N-terminal domain. Mutations within the glycosylation consensus sequences of rhodopsin cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that leads to blindness. Several groups have studied the role of rhodopsin's N-linked glycan chains in protein structure and function using a variety of approaches. These include the generation of a transgenic mouse model, study of a naturally occurring mutant animal model, in vivo pharmacological inhibition of glycosylation, and in vitro analyses using transfected COS-1 cells. These studies have provided insights into the possible role of rhodopsin glycosylation, but have yielded conflicting results.

Amphiphilic comblike polymers enhance the colloidal stability of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles. Stable colloidal dispersions of magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles (MNPs) were obtained with the inclusion of an amphiphilic comblike polyethylene glycol derivative (CL-PEG) as an amphiphilic polymeric surfactant. Both the size and morphology of the resulting CL-PEG-modified MNPs could be controlled and were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The interaction between MNPs and CL-PEG was confirmed by the presence of characteristic infrared absorption peaks, and the colloidal stability of the nanoparticle dispersion in water was evaluated by long-term observation of the dispersion using UV-visible spectroscopy. SQUID measurements confirmed the magnetization of CL-PEG-modified MNPs. The zeta potential of the CL-PEG-modified MNPs showed a dramatic conversion from positive to negative in response to the pH of the surrounding aqueous medium due to the presence of carboxyl groups at the surface. These carboxyl groups can be used to functionalize the MNPs with biomolecules for biotechnological applications. However, regardless of surface electrostatics, the flexible, hydrophilic side chains of CL-PEG-modified MNPs prevented the approach of adjacent nanoparticles, thereby resisting aggregation and resulting in a stable aqueous colloid. The cytotoxicity of MNPs and CL-PEG-modified MNPs was evaluated by a MTT assay.

The role of allopurinol on oxidative stress in experimental hyperthyroidism. During hyperthyroidism, production of free oxygen radicals derives, where xanthine oxidase may also play an important role. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has a significant effect on thyrotoxicosis-related oxidative stress. However, the relationship between thyroid hormones, oxidative stress parameters and allopurinol remains to be explored. Forty-two Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups. Rats in group A served as negative controls, while group B had untreated thyrotoxicosis and group C received allopurinol. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily 0.2 mg/kg L-thyroxine intraperitoneally in groups B and C; 40 mg/kg allopurinol were given daily intraperitoneally. Efficacy of the treatment was assessed after 72 h and 21 days, by measuring serum xanthine oxidase (XO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and nitric oxide derivates (NO*x). In both time periods, serum XO, MDA, GSH and NO*x levels were significantly increased after thyroid hormone induction (p<0.05). Levels of XO, MDA and NO*x decreased with allopurinol treatment (p<0.05). There was a remarkable decrease in triiodothyronine levels in group C after 72 h (p<0.05), and in both triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels in group C after 21 days (p<0.05). There was no difference between groups B and C in means of serum GSH, GR and GPx levels (p>0.05). This study suggests an association between allopurinol and the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Allopurinol prevents the hyperthyroid state, which is mediated predominantly by triiodothyronine and not by XO. This issue has to be questioned in further studies where allopurinol is administered in control subjects.

Outcome of acute myeloid leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis in Brazil. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a high white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation has been associated with an increased early mortality rate, usually secondary to leukostasis. However, the value of the WBC count at which there is a high risk of early death (ED) and the efficiency of supportive treatments remain unclear. In this report, a series of 187 consecutive adult patients with AML in our institution was reviewed. The outcome of 40 patients with WBC above 50×10(9) L(-1) (hyperleukocytosis) was compared to 147 patients with a leukocyte count lower than 50×10(9) L(-1). The group with hyperleukocytosis showed a significantly shorter OS (P<0.0001) and a higher rate of ED (P=0.0008). Even when the data from ED patients were removed from analysis, we still detected a shorter OS in patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.0049), which suggests that high WBC number influences long-term survival, and not only ED. We also observed higher lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum creatinine levels in the group of patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.0003 and 0.0406, respectively). Besides considering all the patients with ED, we could observe higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase, a serum creatinine and nitrogen urea (P=0.0056, P=0.0008 and P<0.0001, respectively). Pulmonary involvement was more frequent in patients with ED (P=0.0277). In conclusion, hyperleukocytosis confers a poorer prognosis in patients with AML.


Botulinum toxin for the correction of asymmetric crying facies.

Ionic ingress and charge-neutralization phenomena of conducting-polymer films. Ionic ingress and diffusion through a conducting-polymer (CP) film containing embedded charges under potential and concentration gradients is studied. Electroneutrality, a common assumption in modeling of similar systems, is not justified in this case or similar diffusion-limited processes, as the timescale of ionic diffusion in the solid matrix is quite large. Counter ions therefore cannot move instantaneously for effective neutralization of excess charges. Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations have to be solved for such cases without any simplifying assumption. Analytical solution shows the existence of a charge boundary layer, which limits and strongly influences the ionic flux. A general numerical method for solution is also developed for the dynamic modeling, analysis, and design of these types of systems. The numerical results are validated by comparison with analytical solutions as well as with some experimental results available in the literature. With this modeling framework, the basic features of controlled release of molecules across a CP film under an applied electrical potential can be explained quantitatively.

The effects of glycine transporter I inhibitor, N-methylglycine (sarcosine), on ketamine-induced alterations in sensorimotor gating and regional brain c-Fos expression in rats. Reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Sarcosine, a potent glycine transporter inhibitor, can increase synaptic glycine and then promote NMDAR function. We assessed the antipsychotic potential of sarcosine by comparing the abilities of sarcosine and clozapine to restore the prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficit, hyperlocomotion and regional brain c-Fos expression changes caused by an NMDAR antagonist, ketamine. Four groups of rats were given acute injections, including saline+saline, saline+30 mg/kg ketamine, 100mg/kg sarcosine+30 mg/kg ketamine, and 15 mg/kg clozapine+30 mg/kg ketamine. Both sarcosine and clozapine reversed the ketamine-induced PPI deficit and hyperlocomotion. They both did not change ketamine-induced increase in c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. However, in the olfactory bulb, sarcosine, but not clozapine, significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increase in c-Fos expression. Our animal study demonstrated that sarcosine may have antipsychotic potential.

Epidemiology of physical activity in American Indians in the Education and Research Towards Health cohort. The health benefits of an active lifestyle are well established. However, Americans in general and American Indians specifically are not sufficiently active to achieve these health benefits. This study presents the descriptive epidemiology of physical activity in a community-based sample of American-Indian adults. Data came from Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH), a cross-sectional study conducted between December 2003 and April 2006 of 5207 American-Indian adults in South Dakota and Arizona. Physical activity was assessed using a culturally tailored, computer-assisted instrument. Both type and intensity of activities were measured; minutes per week averaged over the past year was the primary outcome. Individuals were categorized as being sufficiently active, not sufficiently active, or inactive using a cut point of more or less than 150 minutes/week. Information on age, gender, and BMI was also collected. More than one third of participants were not sufficiently active (<150 minutes/week) and 18% reported no leisure-time activity. Sufficient activity was less often reported by women than men (41% vs 56%) and by participants from the Southwest than those from the Northern Plains (44% vs 50%). Of all activity categories, the most time was spent on household activities among all participants. There were clear trends in physical (in)activity across BMI strata; time spent in sedentary activities increased while leisure-time activity decreased with BMI. American-Indian adults in this cohort exhibited levels of physical (in)activity similar to those of other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., suggesting a need for specific interventions to increase activity levels across the population.

Routine modified D2 lymphadenectomy performance in pT1-T2N0 gastric cancer. To evaluate routine modified D2 lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer, based on immunohistochemically detected skip micrometastases in level II lymph nodes. Among 95 gastric cancer patients who were routinely submitted to curative modified D2 lymphadenectomy, from January 2004 to December 2008, 32 were classified as pN0. All level I lymph nodes of these 32 patients were submitted to immunohistochemistry for micrometastases detection. Patients in whom micrometastases were detected in the level I lymph node stations (n = 4) were excluded from further analysis. The level II lymph nodes of the remaining 28 patients were studied immunohistochemically for micrometastases detection and constitute the material of the present study. Skip micrometastases in the level II lymph nodes were detected in 14% (4 out of 28) of the patients. The incidence was further increased to 17% (4 out of 24) in the subgroup of T1-2 gastric cancer patients. All micrometastases were detected in the No. 7 lymph node station. Thus, the disease was upstaged from stage IA to IB in one patient and from stage IB to II in three patients. In gastric cancer, true R0 resection may not be achieved without modified D2 lymphadenectomy. Until D2+/D3 lymphadenectomy becomes standard, modified D2 lymphadenectomy should be performed routinely.

Impact of patient adherence and test performance on the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in developing countries: the case of Honduras. We examined the impact of patient adherence and screening test performance on the cost-effectiveness of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and Pap smears when used with colposcopy for diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using computer modeling. The primary outcome was cancer prevalence in the 10 years after screening. Three hypothetical populations of 35-year-old women were compared: never-screened women, women screened with VIA, and women screened with Pap smears. We used community-based data from our screening program in Honduras to estimate screening test sensitivity and specificity, adherence to follow-up, and costs of screening and colposcopy services. Published data were used to model disease outcomes. VIA was more sensitive than Pap smears (70% vs. 4%), less expensive (U.S. 0.23 dollars vs. 3.17 dollars), and the 2-vist VIA system had a higher rate of adherence to follow-up than the 3-visit Pap smear system (84% vs. 38%). VIA had a higher false-positive rate than Pap smears resulting in higher colposcopy referral rates, but more dysplasia was detected and treated. Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that screening with VIA would cost U.S. 3,198 dollars per cancer case avoided and reduce cancer cases by 42%, versus U.S. 36,802 dollars and 2% for Pap screening. Although Pap smear quality was low in Honduras, sensitivity analysis showed that VIA was more cost-effective than Pap smears, even when test accuracy was equivalent. In developing countries, systems barriers can limit the cost-effectiveness of Pap smears. VIA may be a cost-effective alternative for some resource-poor settings, although systems barriers, quality control, and feasibility issues must be considered.

Configurations of gender inequality: the consequences of ideology and public policy. This paper gathers a wide range of indicators into distinctive profiles to show how configurations of gender economic inequality are shaped by both welfare state strategies and gender role ideologies. When multiple aspects of gender inequality are assembled together, it becomes evident that all societies exhibit both gender-egalitarian and inegalitarian features. These tradeoffs can best be understood through the ideological and institutional contexts in which they are embedded. Empirical illustrations are provided for fourteen advanced societies by analysing the major expressions of gender inequality; from women's economic wellbeing and financial autonomy, through labour force participation and continuity of employment, to occupational attainments and economic rewards. The analysis confirms the existence of distinctive profiles of gender inequality and their affinity to normative conceptions of the gender order and ideal types of welfare state institutions.

Isopathic treatment effects of Arsenicum album 45x on wheat seedling growth--further reproduction trials. Two experimental studies on wheat preintoxicated with Arsenic trioxide yielded a significant shoot growth increase after an isopathic application of Ars-alb 45x. One independent reproduction trial however, yielded an effect inversion: wheat shoot growth was significantly decreased after application of Ars-alb 45x. In this study we investigated the role of three potential confounding factors on the experimental outcome: geographical location of the experiments, influence of the main experimenter, and seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning. Laboratory-internal reproducibility was assessed by meta-analysis. Wheat poisoned with Arsenic trioxide was cultivated in vitro in either Ars-alb 45x, water 45x, or unpotentised water. Treatments were blinded and randomised. Shoot length was measured after 7 days. The stability of the experimental set-up was assessed by systematic negative control (SNC) experiments. The SNC experiments did not yield significant differences between the three groups treated with unpotentised water. Thus the experimental set-up seemed to be stable. We did not observe any shoot growth increase after a treatment with Ars-alb 45x in any of the newly performed experiments. In contrast, the meta-analysis of all 17 experiments performed (including earlier experiments already published) yielded a statistically significant shoot growth decrease (-3.2%, p=0.017) with isopathic Ars-alb 45x treatment. This effect was quantitatively similar across all five series of experiments. Ultramolecular Ars-alb 45x led to statistically significant specific effects in arsenic poisoned wheat when investigated by two independent working groups. Effect size and effect direction differ, however. The investigated factors (geographical location, experimenter, seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning) did not seem to be responsible for the effect inversion. Laboratory external reproducibility of basic research into homeopathic potentisation remains a difficult issue.

Duodenal stenosis secondary to tuberculosis. An 18-year-old man presented with complaints of epigastric pain, vomiting after meals, loss of appetite and weight, evening rise of temperature, and irregular bowel movements. Barium meal follow-through revealed a dilated stomach and first and second parts of the duodenum and stenotic lesion in the second part of the duodenum. Endoscopic biopsy of the stenotic lesion revealed acute on chronic nonspecific duodenitis with fibrosis. Isoperistaltic antecolic gastrojejunostomy was done to bypass the obstruction, and enlarged lymph nodes were biopsied. The biopsy of the enlarged lymph nodes revealed changes consistent with tuberculosis; therefore, the patient was started on antituberculous drugs in the postoperative period.

A positive influence of vision on motor symptoms during sensory attention focused exercise for Parkinson's disease. This study evaluated the effect of increased attention to sensory feedback during exercise. Two 12-week exercise programs that differed only in the presence (PD SAFEx) or absence (non-SAFE control group) of increased attention focused on sensory feedback were compared. Participants were assessed symptomatically using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) before the start of the exercise program, immediately following the 12-week program and after a 6-week nonexercise washout period. Secondary outcome measures included the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), Grooved Pegboard (GP) and velocity and step length of self-paced gait. Both groups significantly improved on the TUG, GP, velocity, and step length, and this was maintained after a 6-week washout period. Of additional interest, only the PD SAFEx program significantly improved motor symptoms (UPDRS). These gains were maintained in the PD SAFEx group 6 weeks after the exercise was stopped, while motor symptoms significantly worsened in the non-SAFE group. These results suggest that increasing awareness of sensory feedback may be a critical factor that specifically impacts motor symptoms. Future work should strive to uncover the underlying neurophysiological mechanism behind this effect.

Effects of pain education program on pain intensity, pain treatment satisfaction, and barriers in Turkish cancer patients. The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to investigate the effect of a pain education program (PEP) on pain intensity, patients' satisfaction with pain treatment, and patient-related barriers to pain management among Turkish patients with cancer. The study was conducted in a sample of 40 patients who were hospitalized for cancer and experiencing pain. The patients were equally randomized to either a PEP or a control group. The data were collected by means of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Numeric Rating Scale, and the Barrier Questionnaire-Revised. After the completion of the questionnaires at the first interview, patients in the PEP group received pain education using a pain educational booklet and an explanatory slide program that discussed the booklet's content with the patients. Patients in the control group received routine clinical care. The questionnaires were reapplied to the patients in both groups after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Participation in a PEP was associated with decreased pain intensity scores for "present" and "least pain" during weeks 2, 4, and 8 (p < .05). Similarly, there were significant differences between the groups with respect to weeks 2, 4, and 8 satisfaction with pain treatment (p < .05). At the end of second week, the total BQ-r score decreased significantly in the PEP group from 2.12 to 1.29 compared with 2.30 to 2.28 in the control group (p < .001). The findings suggest that the PEP decreases pain intensity, improves satisfaction with treatment, and decreases barriers about cancer pain management in cancer patients. Incorparation of PEP into the standard of care for cancer patients with pain may improve the quality of pain management.

Fitness and nutritional status of female medical university students. The aim of this comparison was to evaluate the nutritional status and cardio-respiratory fitness of future health professionals, namely university students engaged in medical studies. It was assumed that the lifestyle of such students would be reflected by healthy body composition and fitness performance indicators. Altogether 1,560 volunteer, female, university students of three institutions were investigated in 2008. Height, body weight, BMI, body fat content and 800 m run test means were compared.The height, weight and BMI means did not differ significantly but PE students recorded the lowest mean body fat (18.34% vs. 24.37 and 25.12%) and shortest mean running time (203 s vs. 239 and 243 s). Among the medical (11.23%) and technical university students (19.95%) statistically the same prevalence of obesity was observed.High body fat content and low running performance of medical students were in contrast with our hypothesis. Their prevalence of overweight/obesity and low fitness did not differ from that of relatively sedentary technical university students and the average Hungarian young adult population. Thus, it is questionable how young health professionals will promote the necessity and positive effects of regular physical activity if they do not apply them to their own lifestyle.

Midwifery care in eight industrialized countries: how does Canadian midwifery compare? Much has been written about the status of midwifery in developing countries, yet there is limited knowledge and analysis of the role of midwifery in the provision of maternity care in the developed world. The purpose of this study was to better understand how midwifery in Canada compares with midwifery in other developed countries with particular attention to educational preparation, scope of practice, and the contribution of midwives to the overall provision of maternity care. Eight countries were selected on the basis of comparably low maternal mortality rates (defined as < 10/100,000 live births). Document analysis and a survey of key informants were used to develop an understanding of the role of midwifery in the various jurisdictions. We then undertook an analysis of similarities and differences among models. Variations in models of midwifery exist within and among the countries studied. Midwifery in Canada is most similar to midwifery in the Netherlands and New Zealand with regard to the model of practice, continuity of care, choice of birth place and degree of autonomy. Midwifery in Canada is growing, but offers a relatively small contribution to the national provision of maternity services in comparison with other countries. The growth of midwifery in Canada may play a key role in lowering intervention rates and strengthening maternity care as is evidenced in other industrialized nations where midwifery care is an integral part of maternity services.

Behavioral and neural evidence of incentive bias for immediate rewards relative to preference-matched delayed rewards. Several theories of self-control [including intertemporal bargaining (Ainslie, 1992) and self-signaling (Bodner and Prelec, 2001)] imply that intertemporal decisions can be more farsighted than would be predicted by the incentive associated with rewards outside a decision context. We examined this hypothesis using behavior and functional neuroimaging. First, subjects expressed preferences between amounts of money delayed by 4 months and smaller amounts available that day. This allowed us to establish "indifference pairs" individualized to each participant: immediate and delayed amounts that were equally preferred. Participants subsequently performed a reaction time functional magnetic resonance imaging task (Knutson et al., 2001a) that provided them with distinct opportunities to win each of the rewards that comprised the indifference pairs. Anatomical region of interest analysis as well as whole-brain analysis indicated greater response recruited by the immediate rewards (relative to the preference-matched delayed rewards) in regions previously implicated as sensitive to incentive value using the same task (including bilateral putamen, bilateral anterior insula, and midbrain). Reaction time to the target was also faster during the immediate relative to delayed reward trials (p < 0.01), and individual differences in reaction time between immediate versus delayed reward trials correlated with variance in magnetic resonance signal in those clusters that responded preferentially to immediate rewards (r = 0.33, p < 0.05). These findings indicate a discrepancy in incentive associated with the immediate versus the preference-matched delayed rewards. This discrepancy may mark the contribution of self-control processes that are recruited during decision-making but that are absent when rewards are individually anticipated.

Use of homeopathic preparations in phytopathological models and in field trials: a critical review. The literature on the applications of homeopathy for controlling plant diseases in both plant pathological models and field trials was first reviewed by Scofield in 1984. No other review on homeopathy in plant pathology has been published since, though much new research has subsequently been carried out using more advanced methods. To conduct an up-to-date review of the existing literature on basic research in homeopathy using phytopathological models and experiments in the field. A literature search was carried out on publications from 1969 to 2009, for papers that reported experiments on homeopathy using phytopathological models (in vitro and in planta) and field trials. The selected papers were summarized and analysed on the basis of a Manuscript Information Score (MIS) to identify those that provided sufficient information for proper interpretation (MIS>or=5). These were then evaluated using a Study Methods Evaluation Procedure (SMEP). A total of 44 publications on phytopathological models were identified: 19 papers with statistics, 6 studies with MIS>or=5. Publications on field were 9, 6 with MIS>or=5. In general, significant and reproducible effects with decimal and centesimal potencies were found, including dilution levels beyond the Avogadro's number. The prospects for homeopathic treatments in agriculture are promising, but much more experimentation is needed, especially at a field level, and on potentisation techniques, effective potency levels and conditions for reproducibility. Phytopathological models may also develop into useful tools to answer pharmaceutical questions.

Personality disorders among alcohol-dependent patients manifesting or not manifesting cocaine abuse: a comparative pilot study. This study assessed personality disorders (PDs) in 158 alcohol-dependent outpatients (62 manifesting cocaine abuse and 96 without cocaine abuse) with the International Personality Disorders Examination interview between 2003 and 2006. Thirty-nine alcohol-dependent/cocaine abusers (62.9% of this group) and 51 only alcohol-dependent patients (53.1% of this group) manifested at least one PD. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the overall prevalence rate of PDs. The most prevalent PDs, among the alcohol-dependent/cocaine abusers, were antisocial (21%), narcissistic (14.5%), and borderline (11.3%) PDs. The most frequently diagnosed PDs among the only alcohol-dependent patients were obsessive-compulsive (20.8%), paranoid (10.4%), and dependent (9.4%) PDs. There were significant differences between the groups. The study limitations are discussed.

Therapeutic monitoring of sirolimus and everolimus is necessary in order to minimize adverse side-effects and to ensure effective immunosuppression. A sirolimus-dosing model using the concentration/dose ratio has been previously proposed for kidney transplant patients, and the aim of our study was the evaluation of this single model for the prediction of trough sirolimus and everolimus concentrations. Trough steady-state sirolimus concentrations were determined in several blood samples from each of 7 kidney and 9 liver maintenance transplant recipients, and everolimus concentrations from 20 kidney, 17 liver, and 3 kidney/liver maintenance transplant recipients. Predicted sirolimus and everolimus concentrations (Css), corresponding to the doses (D), were calculated using the measured concentrations (Css(0)) and corresponding doses (D(0)) on starting the study: Css = (Css(0))(D)/D(0). The diagnostic efficiency of the predicting model for the correct classification as subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic values with respect to the experimentally obtained concentrations was 91.3% for sirolimus and 81.4% for everolimus in the kidney transplant patients. In the liver transplant patients the efficiency was 69.2% for sirolimus and 72.6% for everolimus, and in the kidney/liver transplant recipients the efficiency for everolimus was 67.9%. The model has an acceptable diagnostic efficiency (>80%) for the prediction of sirolimus and everolimus concentrations in kidney transplant recipients, but not in liver transplant recipients. However, considering the wide ranges found for the prediction error of sirolimus and everolimus concentrations, the clinical relevance of this dosing model is weak.

Mediators of target organ damage in hypertension: focus on obesity associated factors and inflammation. Arterial hypertension represents a major cardiovascular epidemic in the developed and developing world. Projections out to 2025 suggest that up to 50% of the adult populations of Western countries will meet standard guideline definitions of hypertension and thus require therapeutic intervention both non-pharmacological or pharmacological. Hyper-tension is also a component of many other major comorbidities contributing to cardiovascular disease burden. These include obesity, the metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Downstream consequences initially presenting as target organ damage of various degrees include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and chronic heart failure. Although elevated blood pressure per se is undoubtedly the major factor contributing to hypertensive target organ damage there is clear evidence that other mediators are also crucially involved in the transition from a healthy to a diseased state of target organs in the clinical setting of elevated blood pressure. This has obvious consequences for a multifactorial approach aimed not only at achieving target blood pressure levels but also at preventing the development or the progression of target organ damage in order to optimally reduce the overall cardiovascular risk for patients. The epidemic we are currently facing in regards to obesity is closely associated with the expected increase in the prevalence of hypertension. A closer look into the role of obesity and associated factors for the rise in blood pressure and their role in target organ damage is therefore inevitable. This review will thus focus on the clinically important aspects of target organ damage associated with hypertension, particularly obesity related hypertension, and the evidence for the involvement of neurohormonal activation and inflammatory pathways.

Proteomics reveal tissue-specific features of the cress (Lepidium sativum L.) endosperm cap proteome and its hormone-induced changes during seed germination. Mature angiosperm seeds consist of an embryo surrounded by the endosperm and the testa. The endosperm cap that covers the radicle plays a regulatory role during germination and is a major target of abscisic acid-induced inhibition of germination. Cress (Lepidium sativum) is a close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Cress seeds offer the unique possibility of performing tissue-specific proteomics due to their larger size while benefiting the genomic tools available for Arabidopsis. This work provides the first description of endosperm cap proteomics during seed germination. An analysis of the proteome of the cress endosperm cap at key stages during germination and after radicle protrusion in the presence and absence of abscisic acid led to the identification of 144 proteins, which were clustered by the changes in their abundances and categorized by function. Proteins with a function in energy production, protein stability and stress response were overrepresented among the identified endosperm cap proteins. This strongly suggests that the cress endosperm cap is not a storage tissue as the cereal endosperm but a metabolically very active tissue regulating the rate of radicle protrusion.

Ultrasound-guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of breast cancer in inoperable patients: a pilot study. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising minimal invasive modality to treat small breast cancer (BCA). In most studies cancers were surgically excised shortly after RFA. We present six patients inoperable when diagnosed with BCA, and performed RFA instead of surgery. Ultrasound-guided bipolar RFA was performed under local anesthesia in six women aged 63 - 85 years. They had core-biopsy proven T 1 - 2N0 M0, grade I or II, 1.0 - 2.7 cm sized invasive ductal cancers, with positive estrogen receptor status. Four tumors measured > 2 cm, and three 1.0 - 1.2 cm in diameter. Patients were at high-risk for general anesthesia and surgery because of severely impaired cardiac function, advanced age, or associated diseases (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), diabetes, hypertension, depression) and/or refused surgery. Six tumors in five patients were completely ablated, without recurrence during follow-up (range: 9 - 49 months). One superficially located cancer was partially ablated; the patient died two months later from myocardial infarction. The Patient with AML and BCA had an infection of the treated breast after 4 months and postponed mastectomy to an AML remission status. There were no signs of malignancy in histopathology; the patient finally died of leukemia 42 months after RFA. The remaining four patients are well, without complications. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA under local anesthesia is an effective alternative to surgery for BCA < 3 cm in patients with a high-risk for surgery.

Severity of disease in patients admitted for acute care to a general hospital: age and gender differences. Debates regarding unnecessary admissions and the benefit of hospitalization of older people for acute care lack data about severity of disease in older compared with younger patients, and comparison of gender. The objective was to assess the severity of illness upon admission in relation to age and gender, in a single-center, prospective observational study. Place was the Emergency room in a general community hospital in Oslo, Norway. Patients were consecutively admitted for acute care from October 1st to December 31st 2006. The Acute Physiological Score (APS), which is part of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) upon admission, age and gender, were main outcomes. Of a total of 1736 patients admitted, 1565 (90.1%) were included in the study, 918 (58.7%) women and 600 (38.3%) aged 80+ years. Estimate (95% CI) for the age effect on the APS was 0.02 (0.016, 0.024), p<0.0001, which implies that the APS increases by 0.2 for every increase of one year, after adjusting for co-morbidities. The effect of female gender was -0.39 (-0.54, -0.24). Gender difference was highest among patients 80 years and older. Older patients admitted for acute care have a higher severity of disease than younger ones. Males have more severe disease than females, particularly the oldest.

Hydroxyapatite nanoarray-based cyanide biosensor. Here we report a simple, biomolecular-friendly protocol for the fabrication of a hydroxyapatite nanowires array (HANWA) biosensor of spatial positioning, large surface area, and abundant adsorbing sites and its application to cyanide sensing. The fabrication of HANWA is performed by template-assisted electrodeposition. The well-aligned hydroxyapatite nanoarray is composed of vertical nanowires with a diameter of approximately 200 nm and an average length of 1 microm. The electrochemical biosensor for the determination of cyanide through its inhibitory effect on horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encapsulated by chitosan (CHIT) on the platform of HANWA is demonstrated. The current organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructure provides excellent enzyme-substrate contact with enzyme activity well maintained. The densely distributed HANWA with large surface area and abundant adsorbing sites can provide a favorable electrochemical interface for the construction of electrochemical biosensor. A sensitive detection limit of 0.6 ng ml(-1) was obtained for cyanide. The proposed CHIT-HRP/HANWA biosensor has the advantages of spatial resolution, high sensitivity, rapid regeneration, and fast response associated with individual nanowires. It broadens the possible applications of chemosensors and biosensors, and it offers an alternative method for toxic substance determination. The new device holds great promise for environmental and food industrial monitoring of toxins.

Incidence of overweight and obesity in a Mediterranean population-based cohort: the Cornellà Health Interview Survey Follow-up Study (CHIS.FU). To study the changes in body mass index (BMI) in a population-based cohort and their relationship with sociodemographic variables in a Mediterranean-country. A prospective population-based cohort with 8-year follow-up. The data used derive from the Cornellà-Health-Interview Survey Follow-up (CHIS.FU). 1008 people aged > or = 20 years (females=508; males=500) were interviewed in 1994 and in 2002, providing self-reported weight and height data. The BMI was compared using the Wilcoxon test for paired data. Changes in the BMI were calculated and their relationship with sociodemographic-variables and lifestyles using multivariate Breslow-Cox regression. 28.1% of participants had changed from normal-BMI in 1994 to overweight in 2002 (women=25.6%; men=31.6%). 16.8% increased from overweight to obesity (women=25.8%; men=11.2%). The cumulative incidence of overweight: women=26.4%; men=34.0%. The cumulative incidence of obesity: women=29.9%; men=13.1%. The cumulative age and sex-adjusted incidence of overweight showed a significant relationship with marital-status (married: RR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4, divorced/widowed: RR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.7-9.3) and moderate alcohol-consumption (RR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1). We observed a decreased age-adjusted risk in the incidence of obesity for men (RR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). The observed changes in the increase in the incidence of obesity and overweight indicated a similar evolution in the obesity epidemic regardless of Mediterranean dietary patterns in our population.

Racial and ethnic differences in reproductive potential across the life cycle. To review variations in specific reproductive health outcomes by race and ethnicity. A growing number of reports have explored potential gaps in the quality of reproductive health and healthcare across racial and ethnic groups. Diverse results from numerous investigations have made it challenging for practitioners to confirm the significance of these disparities. Three specific areas of the reproductive life cycle were examined: pubertal onset, outcomes from treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and the menopausal transition. These areas were selected as they encompass a continuum of events across the reproductive life span of women. Outcomes were compared in black, white, Asian, and Hispanic women. Medline searches querying on keywords puberty, IVF, ART, menopause, menopausal symptoms, racial disparity, race, Asian, Japanese, Chinese, African American, black, Hispanic, and Latino were performed to isolate relevant publications for review. Differences across race and ethnicity were noted in each clinical endpoint. The most notable findings included earlier puberty in blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, significantly lower live birth rates after ART in all racial and ethnic groups compared with whites, and differences in perimenopausal symptomatology and possibly timing in various racial/ethnic groups compared with whites. Additional research is needed to completely unravel the full significance and basic underpinnings of these disparities. Some of the limitations of the current state of the literature in drawing conclusions about the independent effect of race/ethnicity on reproductive disparities include small samples sizes in some studies, inconsistencies in the characterization of racial/ethnic groups, and incomplete control of potential confounding. Race and ethnicity appear to be important correlates of outcomes from the initiation of reproduction functioning through to its conclusion. The ultimate goal of identifying racial disparities in reproduction is to isolate the basic determinants of disparities and formulate strategies to improve outcomes for women at risk. The differences demonstrated in this review of the literature could represent environmental, sociocultural, and/or genetic correlates of race that influence these important milestones.

Unanticipated C=C bonds in covalent monolayers on silicon revealed by NEXAFS. Interfaces are crucial to material properties. In the case of covalent organic monolayers on silicon, molecular structure at the interface controls the self-assembly of the monolayers, which in turn influences the optical properties and electrical transport. These properties intrinsically affect their application in biology, tribology, optics, and electronics. We use near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy to show that the most basic covalent monolayers formed from 1-alkenes on silicon retain a double bond in one-fifth to two-fifths of the resultant molecules. Unsaturation in the predominantly saturated monolayers will perturb the regular order and affect the dependent properties. The presence of unsaturation in monolayers produced by two different methods also prompts the re-evaluation of other radical-based mechanisms for forming covalent monolayers on silicon.


Hormonal deprivation therapy-induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy--comparison of early postoperative results in an Australian rural centre and a German university hospital. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease. Cultural as well as organisational differences can result in significant variations of postoperative length of stay. AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether differences in postoperative length of stay and early postoperative outcome can be observed by comparison of an Australian rural centre and a German university hospital. Between February 2006 and August 2007 (18 months), 359 patients (140 Australia, 219 Germany) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mean patient age was 50.4 +/- 1.5 and 53.5 +/- 1.0 years, respectively. Seventy-seven percent of the Australian and 62% of the German patients were female. Twenty-one percent and 20% of the procedures were emergencies, respectively. Median American Society of Anaesthesiologists score of all patients was two. The conversion rate was 8% in both centres. A 4% complication rate was observed in Australia (N = 5, 3x bile leak, 1x postoperative bleeding and 1x wound infection) as opposed to 3% in Germany (N = 7, 2x bile leak, 2x postoperative bleeding and 3x wound infection). Postoperative length of stay in Australia was 1.8 +/- 0.1 days (median 1 day) and was significantly longer in patients after emergency surgery (1.6 +/- 0.1 versus 2.6 +/- 0.3 days, p < 0.018). Postoperative length of stay in Germany was 3.7 +/- 0.2 days (median 3 days), and no significant differences were observed when elective and emergency procedures were compared (3.5 +/- 0.2 versus 3.9 +/- 0.5 days, p > 0.05). Comparison of treatment results indicates a significantly shorter postoperative stay in Australia (3 days versus 1 day, p < 0.001). In rural Australia, a median postoperative stay of 1 day after laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely achieved. Postoperative length of stay is significantly longer in the German setting with otherwise comparable patients and surgical techniques. Simple changes of pre- and postoperative management of elective as well as emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy will allow, for substantial cost savings, for the German health system.

Magnetic resonance molecular imaging of post-stroke neuroinflammation with a P-selectin targeted iron oxide nanoparticle. We have developed a magnetic resonance molecular imaging method using a novel iron-oxide contrast agent targeted towards P-selectin - MNP-PBP (magnetic nanoparticle-P-selectin binding peptide) - to image endothelial activation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. MNP-PBP consists of approximately 1000 PBP ligands (primary sequence: GSIQPRPQIHNDGDFEEIPEEYLQ GGSSLVSVLDLEPLDAAWL) conjugated to a 50 nm diameter aminated dextran iron oxide particle. In vitro P- and E-selectin binding was assessed by competition ELISA. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57/BL 6 mice followed by contrast injection (MNP-PBP; MNP-NH2; Feridex; MNP-PBP-FITC) at 24 h after reperfusion and T(2) magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T was performed. Infarction and microvasculature accumulation of contrast agent was assessed in coronal brain sections. MNP-PBP attenuated antibody binding to P-selectin by 34.8 +/- 1.7%. P-selectin was preferentially increased in the infarct hemisphere and MNP-PBP-FITC accumulation in the infarct hemisphere microvasculature was observed. Compared with the nontargeted iron oxide agents MNP-NH2 and Feridex, MNP-PBP showed a significantly greater T(2) effect within the infarction. MR imaging of P-selectin expression with a targeted iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent may reveal early endothelial activation in stroke and other neuroinflammatory states.

Nutrient and microbial dynamics in eutrophying shrimp ponds affected or unaffected by vibriosis. A field survey was conducted on two intensive shrimp farms using similar technical practices: one (DF) historically affected by a vibriosis, the other (HC) in which the pathogen has been observed although no mortality event has occurred. Because historical data suggest that eutrophication process may directly or indirectly play a role in the disease outbreak, we focussed our research on its dynamics. A higher variability of the phytoplanktonic compartment linked to an imbalance in the molar N:P ratio was observed in farm DF compared to farm HC, implying a modification on the linkage between the bacteria and phytoplankton compartments at DF. The beginning of the mortality outbreak at DF followed a shift from pico- to nanophytoplankton. The organic matter mineralization process at the water-sediment interface may explain the disturbance observed in the water column during eutrophication. The consequences of this disturbance on shrimps' health status and pathogen ecology are discussed.

Use of electronic medical records by physicians and students in academic internal medicine settings. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have been touted as one method to improve quality and safety in medical care, and their use has recently increased. The purpose of this study is to describe current use of EMRs by medical students at U.S. and Canadian medical schools. In 2006 the authors performed a cross-sectional survey of the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine institutional members at U.S. and Canadian academic health centers. Outcome measures included implementation of EHRs, EHR use by students, and the challenges of having students use EMRs. Of 110 members, 82 (74.5%) responded. Of those 82, 48 (58%) reported using an EMR in the ambulatory setting (excluding Veterans' Affairs medical centers) of their institutions, and only 21 of those 48 (44%) had policies regarding medical student documentation of progress notes in the EMR during the ambulatory internal medicine (IM) clerkship. Schools were dichotomously split; about half (23/48, 48%) required and about half (25/48, 52%) prohibited allowing students to document in the EMR. The programs that prohibited medical students from documenting in the EMR primarily cited billing concerns. Other issues regarding student use of EMRs included student access, faculty concerns, and note quality. Use of EMRs by IM clerkship students is common, yet many institutions do not have policies regarding student use. Where policies do exist, they vary, and many prohibit students from using EMRs. Concerns about documentation as it relates to billing seem to be a significant factor in prohibiting students' use of EMRs.

Radial modulation of single microbubbles. Radial modulation imaging is a new promising technique to improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound images. The method is based on dual-frequency insonation of contrast agent microbubbles. A low-frequency (LF) pulse is used to modulate the responses of the microbubbles to a high-frequency (HF) imaging pulse. Inverting the LF pulse induces amplitude and phase differences in the HF response of contrast agent microbubbles, which can be detected using Doppler techniques. Although the technique has been successfully implemented, no consensus persists on parameter choice and resulting effects. In a separate study, "compression-only" behavior of coated microbubbles was observed. Compression-only behavior could be beneficial for radial modulation imaging. This was investigated using high-speed camera recordings and simulations. We recorded the vibrations of 78 single microbubbles in a dual-frequency ultrasound field. The results showed that the LF pulse induced significant compression-only behavior, which for microbubble sizes below and at HF resonance resulted in high radial amplitude modulation. It, however, also appeared that, for radial modulation imaging, microbubble size is more important than resonance and compression-only effects.

Primer on gadolinium chemistry. Gadolinium is widely known by all practitioners of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but few appreciate the basic solution chemistry of this trivalent lanthanide ion. Given the recent linkage between gadolinium contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, some basic chemistry of this ion must be more widely understood. This short primer on gadolinium chemistry is intended to provide the reader the background principles necessary to understand the basics of chelation chemistry, water hydration numbers, and the differences between thermodynamic stability and kinetic stability or inertness. We illustrate the fundamental importance of kinetic dissociation rates in determining gadolinium toxicity in vivo by presenting new data for a novel europium DOTA-tetraamide complex that is relatively unstable thermodynamically yet extraordinarily inert kinetically and also quite nontoxic. This, plus other literature evidence, forms the basis of the fundamental axiom that it is the kinetic stability of a gadolinium complex, not its thermodynamic stability, that determines its in vivo toxicity.

A study of interaction of cationic dyes with anionic polyelectrolytes.

Human dosimetry of carbon-11 labeled N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide extrapolated from whole-body distribution kinetics and radiometabolism in rats. Carbon-11 labeled N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide ([11C]PK11195) is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) antagonist that is used as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical for neuroinflammatory imaging. This study was designed to investigate the radiation dosimetry of [11C]PK11195. Whole-body distribution kinetics of intravenously administered [11C]PK11195 in rats was assessed by means of dynamic PET imaging, and estimates for human radiation dosimetry were calculated. Rat plasma and various tissue homogenates obtained at different time points after intravenous injection of [11C]PK11195 were analyzed by reversed-phase gradient radio-HPLC method using online radiodetection. In addition, in vitro stability of [11C]PK11195 was determined in rat brain homogenate by incubation at +37 degrees C. PET imaging of rats showed the highest radioactivity levels in heart, kidneys, thyroid gland, liver, and lungs. The radioactivity cleared rapidly from lungs and slowly from heart and liver. However, much of the radioactivity retained in kidneys, which was in concordance with the observed low urinary excretion of [11C]PK11195. Extrapolating from the rat data, the effective dose of [11C]PK11195 for a 70-kg man was estimated to be 4.2 +/- 0.3 microSv/MBq. Five different radiometabolites were detected in rat plasma, and the level of intact [11C]PK11195 decreased from 80% +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) at 10 min to 44% +/- 5% at 40 min after injection. In rat heart, brain, kidney, and lung homogenates, more than 90% of total radioactivity originated from intact [11C]PK11195. In liver, however, the amount of [11C]PK11195 was approximately 70% and decreased over time, indicating metabolism by liver enzymes. [11C]PK11195 showed a fast uptake in many rat tissues and it was metabolized relatively fast in vivo, but not in brain in vitro. The estimated effective dose for humans speaks for the use of [11C]PK11195 in human PET imaging.


Mechanistic basis of Rho GTPase-induced extracellular matrix synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells.

Effects of acute ethanol on beta-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens of selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-avoiding ANA rats. The selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring alko alcohol (AA) and alcohol-avoiding alko nonalcohol (ANA) rats have been used to demonstrate differences in relevant neurotransmitters which could account for their difference in alcohol consumption. Studies have demonstrated differences in distinct components of the endogenous opioid system in various brain regions associated with the process of reinforcement between the AA and ANA lines of rats. The goal of this current study was to investigate the hypotheses that the AA and ANA rats will show differences in the release of beta-endorphin at the level of nucleus accumbens (NAC) and in locomotor activity in response to acute systemic administration of ethanol. AA and ANA rats were unilaterally implanted with a guide cannula to aim microdialysis probes at the level of NAC. Intraperitoneal injections of 0.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g ethanol/kg body weight were administered. Dialysate samples were collected at 30-min intervals prior to and following the injection. Radioimmunoassay specific for beta-endorphin was used to determine the dialysate beta-endorphin content. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose induced a transient increase in extracellular beta-endorphin at the level of NAC of AA but not of ANA rats. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose also attenuated locomotor activity in the AA but not in the ANA rats. The lack of an increase in the beta-endorphin concentration in the NAC of ANA rats in response to ethanol may partially account for their lower alcohol consumption and lower alcohol-induced attenuation of locomotor activity compared to AA rats.

Performance comparison of right- and left-sided double-lumen tubes among infrequent users. To compare performance of right- versus left-sided double-lumen tubes (DLTs) among infrequent users by evaluating the incidence and severity of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and high airway pressures. A retrospective, cohort study. A university hospital. Ninety-eight patients undergoing left-sided DLT placement (53.9 +/- 21.2 years old) and 98 patients undergoing right-sided DLT placement (62.3 +/- 20.6 years old). Cases performed by thoracic anesthesia specialists were excluded. The authors retrospectively reviewed electronic anesthetic records from a 2-year period to determine the incidence and severity of hypoxia (SpO(2) < 90%), hypercapnia (end-tidal carbon dioxide > 45 mmHg) and high airway pressures (peak inspiratory pressure >35 cmH(2)O) during one-lung ventilation via right and left DLTs. Right-sided (n = 98) DLTs were almost exclusively used on the side contralateral to surgery by infrequent users, whereas left-sided (n = 98) DLTs were used for ipsilateral surgery one third of the time. Hypoxia lasted longer in left versus right DLTs, but the frequency of hypoxia was the same for each tube type among infrequent users. Hypercapnia and high airway pressures occurred more frequently with left-sided DLTs. Left-sided DLTs are perceived to be safer because they may be less prone to malpositioning during lung isolation. However, the supposition that left-sided DLTs are safer than right-sided DLTs when intraoperative hypoxia, hypercapnia, and high airway pressures are used as criteria, even when these tubes are used by infrequent users, is not supported by the data.

Review of human DC subtypes. Dendritic cells (DC) are critical to the induction and regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases as well as contributing to the development of tumours by their lack of appropriate function. As such, understanding human DC biology provides the insight needed to develop applications for their use in the treatment of diseases. Currently, studies on mouse DC outnumber those on human cells; however, the comparison between mouse and human models has been somewhat misleading due to the basic biological and practical differences between the two models. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of human DC subtypes by describing the phenotype of the populations and how this relates to function. We also hope to clarify the differences in nomenclature between the human and mouse models that have arisen by way of the different experimental models.

Computational modelling of blood-flow-induced changes in blood electrical conductivity and its contribution to the impedance cardiogram. Studies have shown that blood-flow-induced change in electrical conductivity is of equal importance in assessment of the impedance cardiogram (ICG) as are volumetric changes attributed to the motion of heart, lungs and blood vessels. To better understand the sole effect of time-varying blood conductivity on the spatiotemporal distribution of trans-thoracic electric fields (i.e. ICG), this paper presents a segmented high-resolution (1 mm(3)) thoracic cardiovascular system, in which the time-varying pressures, flows and electrical conductivities of blood in different vessels are evaluated using a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations, red blood cell orientation and cardiac cycle functions. Electric field and voltage simulations are performed using two and four electrode configurations delivering a small alternating electric current to an anatomically realistic and electrically accurate model of modelled human torso. The simulations provide a three-dimensional electric field distribution and show that the time-varying blood conductivity alters the voltage potential difference between the electrodes by a maximum of 0.28% for a cardiac output of about 5 L min(-1). As part of a larger study, it is hoped that this initial model will be useful in providing improved insights into blood-flow-related spatiotemporal electric field variations and assist in the optimal placement of electrodes in impedance cardiography experiments.

Flexibility contra stiffness: the phragmoplast as a physical barrier for beads but not for vesicles. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles are transported to the division plane to fuse with each other, forming the cell plate, the initial membrane-bordered cell wall separating daughter cells. Vesicles, but not organelles, move through the phragmoplast, which consists of two opposing cylinders of microtubules and actin filaments, interlaced with endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To study physical aspects of this transport/inhibition process, we microinjected fluorescent synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-1-glycerol (DOPG) vesicles and polystyrene beads into Tradescantia virginiana stamen hair cells. The phragmoplast was nonselective for DOPG vesicles of a size up to 150 nm in diameter but was a physical barrier for polystyrene beads having a diameter of 20 and 40 nm and also when beads were coated with the same DOPG membrane. We conclude that stiffness is a parameter for vesicle transit through the phragmoplast and discuss that cytoskeleton configurations can physically block such transit.

Quasi-experimental evidence on the causal effects of physical health on mental health. While a large body of literature has demonstrated an association between physical health problems and psychiatric ones, the extent to which one is causally linked to the other remains difficult to estimate. This quasi-experimental study seeks to (i) estimate causal effects of an acute negative health event (health shock) on mental health and (ii) examine the role of debt and disability as potential mediators. The study design employs exogenous injuries in bus accidents together with a matching procedure to simulate a random exposure to physical health shock. The study was conducted among travellers on state-owned buses in Karnataka, India. Exposure occurred between July and December 2005. Outcomes were assessed from a household survey conducted in November-December 2006. Eighty-four injured passengers identified from bus accident compensation records were interviewed along with 336 unexposed individuals enrolled from passengers on the same accident bus routes, matched on age group, gender and village/neighbourhood of residence. The main outcome of Psychological Distress was measured using the Kessler-10 scale. Exposure to the health shock increases psychological distress by 1.5 standard deviations (SD) 1 year later (P < 0.01). Physical disability is a key mediating mechanism, accounting for 65% of the observed effect. After controlling for disability, odds of having distress levels commensurate with moderate/severe mental illness was 3.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-7.19]. Indebtedness resulting from the health shock did not mediate the association between shock and distress. Evidence from this quasi-experimental study supports the hypothesis that acute physical health shocks can cause long-term mental health problems.

The protein kinase mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila hippo and plays a critical role in regulation of programmed cell death. MST1 exerts pro-apoptotic function through cleavage, autophosphorylation-Thr(183) and subsequent translocation to the nucleus where it phosphorylates a number of molecules, including LATS1/2, FOXO, JNK, and histone H2B. Here, we show that the cleavage of MST1 is inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Akt interacts with MST1 and phosphorylates a highly conserved residue threonine 120 of MST1, which leads to inhibition of its kinase activity and nuclear translocation as well as the autophosphorylation of Thr(183). Phospho-MST1-Thr(120) failed to activate downstream targets FOXO3a and JNK. Further, inverse correlation between pMST1-Thr(120) and pMST1-Thr(183) was observed in human ovarian tumors. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of MST1-Thr(120) by Akt could be a major mechanism of regulation of the Hippo/MST1 pathway by cell survival signaling.

Giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma with mixed histological pattern: a rare presentation and literature review. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare tumor that may grow to a considerable size before causing clinical symptoms. Mixed-type retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a very rare clinical entity. We herein describe a rare case of a 54-year-old female who was diagnosed with a giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma arising from the right perinephric space. Radical nephrectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy were necessary to achieve complete tumor excision. Histological examination revealed a mixed-type liposarcoma consisting of well-differentiated and pleomorphic elements and deep invasion into the renal parenchyma, which is quite infrequent. The patient was well and disease-free 12 months after surgery. Mixed-type retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare tumor. Aggressive surgical resection of the tumor together with adjacent structures, if necessary, is the mainstay of treatment.

Drive for thinness and drive for muscularity: opposite ends of the continuum or separate constructs? The goal of this study was to examine whether the drive for thinness and the drive for muscularity occur concurrently among late adolescents and to understand the body attitudes associated with desiring a thinner and/or a more muscular physique. Participants included 235 college freshmen who participated in a larger study of body image and eating attitudes. The majority of individuals reported having both a high drive for thinness and a high drive for muscularity (65.4%). Additionally, the presence of both drives significantly predicted body compulsivity and body anxiety among females, and body-esteem among males. Results of the current study provide considerable evidence that a drive for thinness and a drive for muscularity are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the degree to which an individual strives for thinness and/or muscularity has differential effects on their body attitudes.

Preoperative biliary drainage for distal obstruction: the case against revisited. No conclusive evidence exists confirming the role of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in reversing the physiological disturbances resulting from biliary obstruction to improve outcome. This review examined the impact of PBD and the outcomes after surgery. A PubMed literature search was undertaken using the keywords preoperative, biliary, and drainage. The primary end points were the effect of PBD on mortality, morbidity, and bile cultures. The secondary outcome measures were PBD and pancreatic leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis/infectious complications, wound infection, hemorrhage, and bile leak rates. The impact of bile cultures positive for bacteria and the outcomes after surgery were also examined. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases wound and bile infection rates on meta-analysis (P < 0.0005) using a fixed and random effect model, but no adverse effect on mortality and morbidity was found. A bile culture positive for bacteria negatively impacts on both mortality and morbidity (P < 0.005) after surgery. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases the rates of bile culture positive for bacteria and the probability of wound infection. Bile cultures positive for bacteria adversely impact mortality and morbidity after surgery in jaundiced patients. Although no evidence has been found by this review that PBD directly increases mortality and morbidity, it is possible that in certain patients, PBD may deleteriously affect outcome by bacterial contamination of the bile.


Switching on the lights for real-time multimodality tumor neuroimaging: The integrated positron-emission tomography/MR imaging system.

Evidence for caspase effects on release of cytochrome c and AIF in a model of ischemia in cortical neurons. Neuronal apoptosis following ischemia can be mediated by a caspase-dependent pathway, which involves the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c that initiates a cascade of caspase activation. In addition, there is a caspase-independent pathway, which is mediated by the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Using caspase inhibitor gene therapy, we investigated the roles of caspases on the mitochondrial release of cyt c and the release of AIF. Specifically, we used herpes simplex virus-1 amplicon vectors to ectopically express a viral caspase inhibitor (crmA or p35) in mixed cortical cultures exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation. Overexpression of either crmA or p35 (but not the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD) inhibited the release of AIF; this suggests that there can be cross-talk between the caspase-dependent and the ostensibly caspase-independent pathway. In addition, both crmA overexpression and DEVD inhibited cyt c release, suggesting a positive feedback loop involving activated caspases stimulating cyt c release.

The consequence of encouraging girls to be active for weight loss. The purpose of the study, conducted in Pennsylvania, USA, was to assess the prospective effect of parental encouragement of physical activity (PA) for weight loss on adolescent girls' concern about weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) and objectively-measured PA. Non-Hispanic White girls (N = 177) and their parents were assessed when girls were 9, 11, 13 and 15 years old. At each age, girls' concern about their weight, pubertal development, BMI, and dietary intake were measured along with mothers' and fathers' encouragement of PA for weight loss, modeling of PA, and logistic support for PA. At ages 13 and 15 years, girls' PA was assessed using accelerometry. At age 11, girls' PA was measured using a combination of self-report measures and a standardized assessment of cardiovascular fitness. Parents of obese girls reported the highest encouragement of PA for weight loss; however, girls from all weight categories were exposed to encouragement of PA for weight loss and showed similar age-related increases in parental encouragement. Encouragement of PA for weight loss was prospectively associated with higher concern about weight and higher BMI, independent of pre-existing levels of these constructs and covariates. Encouragement of PA for weight loss was not associated with girls' objectively-measured PA. Parental encouragement of PA for weight loss was therefore not an effective strategy in this sample. Findings are consistent with research on parental child feeding practices, where parental control has been linked with unintended negative dietary and psychosocial outcomes among children.

[High expression of antimicrobial peptide Cecropin AD in Escherichia coli by fusion with EDDIE]. In this study, we efficiently expressed the active antimicrobial peptide (CAD), which fused with the site-mutated coat protein (EDDIE) of the classical swine fever virus, in Escherichia coli. First, we obtained the e-cad fusion gene from the CAD gene and the EDDIE gene using overlapping PCR. Then to get the recombinant expression vector (pETED), the e-cad fusion gene was cloned into the pET30a vector by a site-directed homologous recombination technique. The EDDIE-CAD fusion protein expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, and its yield was more than 40% of total bacterial proteins. After renaturated in vitro and self-cleavage of the fusion protein, we obtained the antimicrobial peptide Cecropin AD. Antimicrobial experiments showed that the Cecropin AD efficiently inhibited the growth of G+ and G- bacteria, but it weakly inhibited the growth of Saccharomyces. This method provides an excellent way for high expression of antimicrobial peptides when fused with EDDIE.

Endoscopic evaluation and treatment of esophageal cance. Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality. During the past twenty years the prevalence of adenocarcinoma, which is linked to gastroesophageal reflux and Barrett's metaplasia, has increased precipitously for unclear reasons. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has revolutionized primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging. Additionally, the recent introduction of combined computed and positron emission tomography (CT-PET) promises to improve the detection of distant metastasis. While classic surgical approaches have significant morbidity and mortality, the recent widespread introduction of minimally invasive techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation offer new options to those with limited disease. Finally, endoscopically placed self expandable metal stents have become the primary mode of palliating dysphagia and there is a growing interest in the use of removable stents to optimize nutrition in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients awaiting esophagectomy. In this article we will review the presentation, staging, and treatment of esophageal cancer with an emphasis on the evolving role of endoscopy to help accomplish these objectives.

Mapping genes for plant structure, development and evolution: functional mapping meets ontology.

Workforce issues in rural surgery. Almost one quarter of America's population and one third of its landmass are defined as rural and served by approximately 20% of the nation's general surgeons. General surgeons are the backbone of the rural health workforce. There is significant maldistribution of general surgeons across regions and different types of rural areas. Rural areas have markedly fewer surgeons per population than the national average. The demography of the rural general surgery workforce differs substantially from the urban general surgery workforce, raising concerns about the extent to which general surgical services can be maintained in rural areas of the United States.

Torso muscle EMG profile differences between patients of back pain and control. Electrophysiological criteria that identify and characterize low back pain can lead to better understanding of the affliction and possibly aid in its treatment. Nineteen male and 22 female subjects with chronic back pain, without lumbar radiculopathy; and 30 male and 33 female control subjects with no history of low back pain in the last 12 months, were recruited into the study. All subjects flexed, extended, laterally flexed, flexed anterolaterally and extended posterolaterally isometrically to 20% and 100% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Additionally, patients were asked to do these activities to their pain threshold levels and control subjects to 60% maximum voluntary contraction. Surface electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from lumbar erectores spinae, external obliques and rectus abdominis bilaterally. The electromyogram was subjected to magnitude, Fast Fourier Transform, and wavelet analyses. The median frequency and frequency bands were calculated with their power. The wavelet decomposition was done and a logistic discriminate analysis was carried out to classify patients and normal controls. The normalized peak electromyograms of patients were significantly greater than controls (P<0.01). The muscle conduction velocity was not disturbed by pain. Significant differences were found in total power between patients and controls (P<0.01). The analysis correctly classified patients and controls 65% and 98% of the time, respectively at 20% MVC, 95.1% (patients) and 86.8% (controls) at pain threshold/60% MVC, and 74.3% (patients) and 86.4% (controls) at pain tolerance/MVC (P<0.05). The surface electromyography can be used in discriminating chronic low back pain patients and controls. This would be an objective test over and above other subjective tests, such as pain provocation.

Clinical and cytopathological aspects in phyllodes tumors of the breast. The frequency of mesenchymal breast tumors is very low, being represented mostly by tumors with biphasic proliferation (phyllodes tumors) and less by other types of non-epithelial tumors. From clinical point of view, phyllodes tumors (PT) can mimic a breast carcinoma. Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis by cytological examination on material obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) is very important for adequate treatment of these tumors. In current study, we assessed clinical aspects of 79 phyllodes tumors regarding patient's age and localization of the tumors. In 17 out of 79 cases, it has been performed FNA within the tumors with further cytological examination on the smears obtained. The median age of the patients was 46.07-year-old, being progressively higher with grade of the tumors with significant values between benign and borderline tumors (p=0.04954) and between benign and malignant ones (p=0.02890). The distinguish on the smears of stromal fragments and naked stromal nuclei with variable grade of atypia regarding the tumoral type, in detriment of epithelial elements have been conclusive for fibroepithelial lesion as cytopathological diagnosis. The preoperative differentiation between a breast phyllodes tumor and a breast carcinoma is extremely important for avoiding of a useless radical surgery for the patient. If the fine needle aspiration was correctly performed, the accuracy of the cytodiagnosis has been 82% in current study.

Robust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with ensemble feature selection methods. Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method. Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of approximately 15% in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

GREB1 tissue expression is associated with organ-confined prostate cancer. By reason of its heterogeneous behavior, it is difficult to determine the prognosis of many prostate cancer cases. Patients with the same clinicopathologic conditions may present varying clinical findings and rates of progression. We determined the role of new genes as potential molecular markers for prostate cancer prognosis. We performed a microarray analysis of two pools of patients with prostate cancer divided according to their clinicopathologic characteristics. After that, we validated these results by testing the genes with most different expressions between the two pools using the quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction method. We analyzed gene expression in 33 patients with localized prostate cancer according to prostate specific antigen (PSA), pathologic stage, Gleason score, and biochemical recurrence. For statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney Test. The microarray analysis revealed that 4,147 genes presented a different expression between the two pools. Among them, 3 genes, TMEFF2, GREB1, and TH1L, were at least 13-times overexpressed, and 1 gene, IGH3, which was at least 5 times under-expressed in pool 1 (good prognosis) compared with pool 2 (bad prognosis), were selected for analysis. After the validation tests, GREB1 was significantly more overexpressed among patients with stage T2 compared with T3 (P = 0.020). The expressions of other 3 genes did not present significant differences according to the clinicopathological variables. Tissue expression of GREB1 is associated with organ-confined prostate cancer and may constitute a gene associated with a favorable prognosis.


Characterising the KMP-11 and HSP-70 recombinant antigens' humoral immune response profile in chagasic patients.

[Phoretic association of the mites Myialges spp. (Astigmata: Epidermoptidae) and Ornitocheyletia hallae volgin (Prostigmata: Cheyletidae) with the fly Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart) (Diptera: Hippoboscidae)]. This study evaluated aspects of population ecology and community component of mites in Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart) of domestic pigeons Columba livia in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A total of 236 forest mites were found in 74 out of 156 fl ies (47.4% infestation). The prevalence for Myialges anchora Sergent & Trouessart was 23.7%, with average intensity 1.5 +/- 0.90 and average abundance 0.4 +/- 0.76, mostly (94.4%) located on the abdomen; 75.9% of the mites (n = 41) surrounded by eggs, with a mean of 16.4 +/- 14.60 eggs per individual and 21.6 +/- 12.90 eggs per ovigerous female. The prevalence for M.lophortyx (Furmann & Tharshis) was 13.5% (n = 21) with 62 individuals, mean intensity 3.0 +/- 2.75 average abundance 0.4 +/- 1.41; 41.9% (n = 26) located at the right wing and 58.1% (n = 36) were in the left wing; 72.6% (n = 45) showed ovigerous mass, with 4.56 +/- 3.42 per each individual and 6.3 +/- 3.04 per ovigerous female. The prevalence of Ornithocheyletia hallae Volgin was 23.7% (n = 37) with 120 individuals, with mean intensity of 3.2 +/- 4.47, and mean abundance of 0.8 +/- 2.56. In 28.4% (n = 21) of flies occurred simultaneous mite infestations, mainly for M.anchora and O.hallae, present in 66.7% (n = 14) of flies with mixed effect. The component communities showed an aggregate distribution. The mite species O.hallae was more agregate, while M.anchora and M.lophortyx showed the same K value.

Rehabilitation of the knee following sports injury. Rehabilitation of a knee injury is done in a criterion-based progression that is based on individual progress from one phase to another and not on a prespecified period of time. If the rehabilitation deviates from this approach, the body will react with adverse affects such as inflammation, pain, and further injury. Delay in the entire rehabilitation program will delay the athlete in meeting goals and returning to play. Phase I focuses on restoration of range of motion, pain modulation, inflammatory control, modification of activities, and gait training. Phase II is characterized by gaining full range of motion, demonstration of normal gait pattern, basic to advanced strengthening and flexibility, appropriate cardiovascular conditioning, and proprioception retraining. Phase III allows functional return to prior activity level. This phase includes a sport/occupational-specific functional progression. Utilizing a trained rehabilitation specialist will allow the athlete/individual an effective and efficient return to prior level of function.

Applying feminist, multicultural, and social justice theory to diverse women who function as caregivers in end-of-life and palliative home care. Women are largely responsible for providing care to terminally ill family members at home. The goal of this review is to conceptualize diverse women's experiences in palliative home care from feminist, multicultural, and social justice perspectives. Peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified using the following databases: CIMAHL, psycINFO, and pubMED. The following search terms were used: women/mothers/daughters, Caregiving, family caregivers, feminism, culture, multiculturalism, and palliative home care. Article reference lists were also reviewed. The majority of penitent articles which formed the basis for the arguments presented were drawn from nursing, medicine, and counseling psychology scholarship. The application of feminist, multicultural, and social justice theory brings to attention several potential issues female caregivers may experience. First, there exist diverse ways in which women's Caregiving is manifested that tend to correspond with variations in culture, relationship, and age. Second, it is important to attend to changing expectations placed on women as a result of Caregiving at the end of life. Third, the changing power dynamics women may experience in end of life Caregiving are very complex. The principle finding of the review was the highlighting of potential risks that culturally diverse female caregivers are likely to face at the end of life. The application of social justice theory provides a number of implications for practice and policy. Specifically, the identifying significant concerns regarding female caregivers in palliative home care, as well as suggesting ways to appropriately attend to these concerns, and oppression of women is less likely to be perpetuated, specific areas for future research in this domain are identified.

Genome sequence analysis of the first human West Nile virus isolated in Italy in 2009. In 2009, six new human cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) were identified in Veneto region, following the six cases already reported in 2008. A human West Nile virus (WNV) isolate was obtained for the first time from an asymptomatic blood donor. Whole genome sequence of the human WNV isolate showed close phylogenetic relatedness to the Italy-1998-WNV strain and to other WNV strains recently isolated in Europe, with the new acquisition of the NS3-Thr249Pro mutation, a trait associated with avian virulence, increased virus transmission, and the occurrence of outbreaks in humans.

Social separation and diazepam withdrawal increase anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and serotonin turnover in the median raphe and hippocampus. The present work aimed to evaluate the effects of social separation for 14 days (chronic stress) and of withdrawal from a 14-day treatment with diazepam (acute stress) on the exploratory behaviour of male rats in the elevated plus-maze and on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) turnover in different brain structures. Social separation had an anxiogenic effect, evidenced by fewer entries into, and less time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Separation also selectively increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the hippocampus and median raphe nucleus. Diazepam withdrawal had a similar anxiogenic effect in grouped animals and increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the same brain structures. Chronic treatment with imipramine during the 14 days of separation prevented the behavioural and neurochemical changes caused by social separation. It is suggested that the increase in anxiety determined by both acute and chronic stress is mediated by the activation of the median raphe nucleus-hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine pathway.

[Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of cantharidin in beagle dogs]. To study the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of cantharidin in beagle dogs to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability of cantharidin in beagle dogs by determining dose-time curve and by comparing with the pharmacokinetics of cantharidin injection. Six beagle dogs, after protein precipitation by hydrochloric acid, ethyl acetate was applied to extract cantharidin from plasma The plasma concentration of cantharidin in beagle dogs was determined by GC-MS. The WinNonLin program was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of cantharidin by iv in dogs (34 mL x h(-1) x kg(-1)) were AUC (203.5 +/- 23.8) h x microg x L(-1), CL (168.8 +/- 18.6) mL x h(-1) x kg(-1), t1/2 (0.69 +/- 0.03) h. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of cantharidin by op (102 microg x kg(-1)) were: AUC (160.4 +/- 26.9) h x microg x L(-1), CL (649.1 +/- 97.7) mL x h(-1) x kg(-1), t1/2 (0.38 +/- 0.1) h., F (bioavailability) = 26.7% comparing to injection. As compared with cantharidin injection, the absorption of catharidin by op is poor and the bioavailability is also low, indicating that enhancement of the bioavailability will be beneficial to the clinical application.

A prospective randomised controlled trial and economic modelling of antimicrobial silver dressings versus non-adherent control dressings for venous leg ulcers: the VULCAN trial. To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial silver-donating dressings for venous leg ulcers compared with simple non-adherent (also known as low-adherent) dressings. A pragmatic, prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) and cost-effectiveness analysis of silver-donating versus low-adherent dressings in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. A non-randomised observational group was also recruited. Primary and secondary care services in the north and south of England (Sheffield and Exeter). Consenting patients with active ulceration of the lower leg that had been present for a period of greater than 6 weeks. Patients were randomised to receive either a silver-donating or non-silver low-adherent dressing applied beneath compression bandages or hosiery. The choice of dressing within these groups was left to clinician preference. Evaluation was by clinical assessment, supplemented by evaluation of quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome measure was complete ulcer healing at 12 weeks in the index limb. Secondary measures were costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost-effectiveness, time to healing, and recurrence rate at 6 months and 1 year. In total, 304 participants were recruited to the clinical trial: 213 to the RCT and 91 to the observational arm. Within the RCT 107 were randomised to antimicrobial dressings and 106 to the control dressings. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups for the primary outcome measure of proportion of ulcers healed at 12 weeks (59.6% for silver and 56.7% for control dressings). The overall median time to healing was also not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.408). A total of 24 patients had recurrent ulcers within 1 year; the recurrence rates of 11.6% (n = 11) for the antimicrobial and 14.4% (n = 13) for the control dressings were not significant. Mean utility valuations for both the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) quality of life questionnaire and Short Form 6 dimensions (SF-6D) utility index showed no differences for either group at 1, 3, 6 or 12 months. Compared with the control group, the antimicrobial group had an incremental cost of 97.85 pounds and an incremental QALY gain of 0.0002, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the antimicrobial dressings of 489,250 pounds. Cost-effectiveness modelling of the results of the RCT showed that antimicrobial dressings were not cost-effective. No significant differences in either primary or secondary end points were found between the use of antimicrobial silver-donating dressings and the control group of low-adherent dressings. Modelling showed that antimicrobial silver dressings were not cost-effective. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN72485131.

West Nile virus transmission via organ transplantation and blood transfusion - Louisiana, 2008. Three years after the introduction and spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, transmission through blood transfusion and solid organ transplantation was documented in 2002. Within a year, these findings led to nationwide screening of blood donors for WNV. Although screening is extremely sensitive, current methods still do not detect all WNV-infected blood donations, and organ donors are not screened routinely. In October 2008, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) was notified of a heart transplant recipient with suspected West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). LDH launched an investigation to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether the organ recipient's infection was derived from the organ donor or blood products the donor received before organ donation. The investigation concluded that two cases of probable transfusion-transmitted WNV resulted from a common blood donor; one infection resulted in WNND via an organ donor, and the other resulted in asymptomatic WNV infection via blood transfusion directly. This investigation also found that criteria used by the blood-screening laboratory to screen the implicated blood donation for WNV were less stringent than criteria used by other blood collection centers in the area. Use of the more stringent screening criteria might have detected the WNV and prevented the blood donation from being used. To increase the likelihood of detecting WNV-positive donations, blood centers should use the most sensitive screening criteria feasible and communicate frequently with nearby blood centers on screening results during times of high WNV activity in their geographic area. In addition, health-care providers should consider WNND as a possible cause of neurologic complications in patients after blood transfusion or organ transplantation.

Identification and isolation of rodent respiratory tract dendritic cells. This chapter describes the preparation of respiratory tract tissue from both mice and rats for the isolation of respiratory tract dendritic cells (RTDC). The methods describe in detail the preparation of cells from the respiratory tract tissue of the main conducting airways (representing mucosal populations) and peripheral lung (representing predominantly interstitial populations) in both rodent species. Our research in this area has found that these anatomical sites differ in their composition of antigen-presenting cell (APC) types including RTDC, and that phenotypic and functional differences exist in RTDC isolated from these sites. We predominantly use a flow cytometry-based approach to identify and sort RTDC as this is the most accurate way of isolating RTDC subsets in an environment where many typical dendritic cell surface markers are shared by other APC populations.

Synthesis of low-temperature, fast, single-firing body for porcelain stoneware tiles with coal gangue. Coal gangue is a major industrial solid waste in China, causing great environment pollution. According to phase diagram theory, a low-temperature, fast, single-firing body mix for porcelain stoneware tiles was designed in the quaternary system CaO--MgO--Al₂O₃--SiO₂, using coal gangue as the main raw material. The coal gangue was from Baishan city, Jilin province and mainly composed of kaolinite and quartz. Mineralogical compositions and microstructures of some selected samples sintered at different temperatures were identified with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results indicated that the optimal body mix was the one containing 34 wt% coal gangue sintered at 1170°C for about 1 h, with rupture strength of 43 MPa and water absorption of 0.22%. The main crystalline phases of the sintered body were quartz, anorthite and mullite.

Global effects of BKV infection on gene expression in human primary kidney epithelial cells. BK virus (BKV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that establishes a lifelong persistent infection in kidney epithelial cells. BKV reactivation within these cells results in a lytic infection in immunocompromised patients. Little is known about the specific interactions of BKV and the host cell during persistence and reactivation. We performed global cellular gene expression analyses using microarrays to characterize the global effect of BKV on primary kidney epithelial cells during the viral life cycle. Our results demonstrate that BKV primarily activates genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (58% and 44% of upregulated genes at 48 and 72 h post-infection, respectively). Surprisingly, we observed that only four genes were downregulated during infection and that only two genes directly involved in the inflammatory response were differentially expressed. These results provide information about how BKV interacts with a cell type in which it both establishes persistence and undergoes lytic reactivation.

The role of Toll-like receptors in perinatal brain injury. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of microbe-sensing receptors on peripheral immune cells. TLRs have also been discovered to be present in the brain, particularly in circumventricular organs, microglia, and astrocytes. Some TLRs are strongly expressed in the embryonic brain and TLR3 and TLR8 have been implicated in neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth in the developing brain, whereas TLR2 and TLR4 have been shown to regulate adult neurogenesis. TLR2 and TLR4 also play a role in acute ischemic brain injury in the adult, although no neuroprotection was observed following perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. These findings suggest that different TLRs have specific roles in the immature and adult brain following brain damage.


Pitfalls in the evaluation and resuscitation of the trauma patient.

A biophysical model for modulation frequency encoding in the cochlear nucleus. Encoding of amplitude modulated (AM) acoustical signals is one of the most compelling tasks for the mammalian auditory system: environmental sounds, after being filtered and transduced by the cochlea, become narrowband AM signals. Despite much experimental work dedicated to the comprehension of auditory system extraction and encoding of AM information, the neural mechanisms underlying this remarkable feature are far from being understood (Joris et al., 2004). One of the most accepted theories for this processing is the existence of a periodotopic organization (based on temporal information) across the more studied tonotopic axis (Frisina et al., 1990b). In this work, we will review some recent advances in the study of the mechanisms involved in neural processing of AM sounds, and propose an integrated model that runs from the external ear, through the cochlea and the auditory nerve, up to a sub-circuit of the cochlear nucleus (the first processing unit in the central auditory system). We will show that varying the amount of inhibition in our model we can obtain a range of best modulation frequencies (BMF) in some principal cells of the cochlear nucleus. This could be a basis for a synchronicity based, low-level periodotopic organization.

In vitro construction of scaffold-free cylindrical cartilage using cell sheet-based tissue engineering. Tissue-engineered cartilage may offer a solution for the treatment of serious airway disease. This study developed a novel procedure to fabricate a scaffold-free cylindrical cartilage under in vitro conditions, while also evaluating the effect of a dynamic culture on the engineered construct. Auricular chondrocytes were harvested from New Zealand white rabbits and cultivated under high-density conditions to form a chondrocyte sheet. The sheet was looped around a silicon tube and cultivated for 6 weeks in dynamic or static conditions. The engineered cylindrical cartilages were evaluated macroscopically and histologically. The expression of collagen, glycosaminoglycan content and mechanical properties were determined. The cylindrical cartilage was sufficiently elastic and stiff to maintain the structure without disruption. Histologically, the construct contained a Safranin-O positive cartilaginous matrix accompanied by the expression of type II collagen. The glycosaminoglycan content increased and reached 72% of the native tracheal cartilage after 6 weeks of cultivation. A novel procedure was developed for fabricating engineered cartilage, which maintained the shape and a proper level of rigidity and flexibility, under in vitro conditions using sheet-based tissue engineering techniques. This procedure may allow for the development of a tailor-made autograft and a functionally engineered trachea.


The human papillomavirus type 58 E7 oncoprotein modulates cell cycle regulatory proteins and abrogates cell cycle checkpoints.

Pushing and pulling: microtubules mediate meiotic pairing and synapsis. Meiotic pairing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is facilitated by chromosomal sites known as pairing centers that are tethered to the nuclear envelope. Sato et al. (2009) and Penkner et al. (2009) provide insight into how proteins linking pairing centers and the microtubule cytoskeleton mediate homolog pairing and restrict synapsis to homologous pairs of chromosomes.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in liver disease: a systematic review. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) may develop in patients with liver disease, a fact highlighted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcements cautioning against the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in select liver disease patients. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to characterize the risk of NSF in patients with liver disease. All published articles on NSF from September 2000 through August 2008, were identified via PubMed searches and examination of articles' reference lists. Two reviewers independently read each article and identified unique patients with biopsy-proven or suspected NSF. Data on demographics, liver status, renal status, and GBCA exposure were collected. A total of 324 articles were reviewed, with 108 articles containing case descriptions of 335 unique NSF patients. After excluding the 95/335 (28%) patients in whom the presence or absence of liver disease was uncertain, liver disease was confirmed present in 41/239 (17%) patients. Renal insufficiency could be assessed in 35 of the liver disease patients; severe renal insufficiency, defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or estimated GFR (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or dialysis requirement, was present in 34/35 (97%) patients. The lone patient who developed NSF with mild/moderate renal insufficiency was atypical and received a total gadodiamide load of 0.76 mmol/kg over a 10-week period periliver transplantation. The published medical literature demonstrates that patients with liver disease who develop NSF also have severe renal insufficiency, suggesting that liver disease does not confer a risk for NSF beyond that of the underlying renal insufficiency.

Intraoperative grafts assessment. Graft patency strongly influences early and late outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The current standard of care in CABG surgery does not require intraoperative imaging. Because coronary angiography is rarely available in the operating room (OR), other techniques have been developed to assess graft integrity intraoperatively. The 2 most commonly used are the transit time flow measurement (TTFM) and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging (IFI). The TTFM is a quantitative volume flow technique, whereas the IFI is based on the fluorescent properties of indocyanine green. TTFM cannot define the degree of graft stenosis nor discriminate between the influence of the graft conduit and the coronary arteriolar bed on the mean graft flow. IFI provides a "semiquantitative" assessment of the graft patency with images that provide some details about the quality of coronary anastomoses. Both methods are valuable in identifying only at the extremes, that is, either patent or occluded grafts, and can confirm very good grafts; however, neither method is sensitive or specific enough in identifying more subtle abnormalities. These abnormal grafts most likely have poor long-term patency and are predestined to fail. The hybrid suite has the capability of serving both as a complete surgical OR and as a catheterization laboratory. It allows for routine completion angiogram following CABG surgery and identifies abnormal grafts, providing the opportunity to revise them with percutaneous coronary intervention or surgery before leaving the OR.

Iberia: from fable to the bench. Developmental Biology in Portugal and Spain has been running along mostly parallel tracks - until recently.

Roles of NADPH oxidase in occurrence of gastric damage and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 during ischemia/reperfusion in rat stomachs. NADPH oxidase is an enzyme that converts molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, which cause severe damage in several organs. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is an inducible enzyme that is important in gastric mucosal defense and repair processes. It is unclear whether NADPH oxidase is related to COX expression in the gastric mucosa, so we investigated the correlation. Under urethane anesthesia, a male Sprague Dawley rat stomach was mounted in an ex-vivo chamber, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was performed through a cannula in the femoral vein. I/R significantly increased NADPH oxidase activity, H(2)O(2) production, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In contrast, ischemia alone clearly enhanced both NADPH oxidase activity and H(2)O(2) production but not MPO activity. Pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) suppressed I/R-induced mucosal damage. On the other hand, the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib exhibited a tendency to enhance the severity of gastric damage induced by I/R, although the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 and the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin had no effect. I/R also increased the expression of COX-2, and this increase was suppressed by pretreatment with DPI. These findings suggest that the increase in NADPH oxidase activity is involved in the occurrence of gastric mucosal damage induced by I/R and that this enzyme activity may be causally related to the upregulation of COX-2 during I/R.

Incidence and seasonal variation in hip fracture incidence among elderly women in Norway. The HUNT Study. There is a substantial variation in hip fracture incidence between populations. The Scandinavian countries have the highest incidence of hip fractures worldwide, and latitude and seasonal variation have been discussed as possible reasons for the high fracture incidences. The purpose of this study was to investigate time dependent and seasonal variation of hip fractures in a population based cohort of women aged 65+ residing in a rural county in Norway and followed for 9.3 years. Information at baseline was collected as part of The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) during 1995-97, and 8362 women with no previous hip fracture and with a mean age of 74.3 years were included in the study. All hip fractures occurring after inclusion in the health study were registered (mean follow-up: 9.3 years) by medical journals and x-ray reports. A total of 5661 of the women had their forearm bone mineral density (BMD) measured by single energy x-ray bone densitometers (SXA) as part of HUNT. In total, 782 women sustained a first hip fracture during follow-up, and the overall hip fracture incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 13.1 (95 % CI: 12.2-14.1). The hip fracture incidence increased exponentially by age from 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2-3.8) in the age group 65-69 years to 49.7 (95% CI: 41.2-59.8) among the women aged 90+, respectively. In age-stratified analyses no changes in the incidence of hip fractures were observed during the nine years of follow up. The occurrence of fractures varied by season of the year, characterized by higher fracture rates during the winter months. In conclusion, the hip fracture rates in this population of elderly women are highest in the winter months. There was, however, no indication of an increasing hip fracture incidence in this rural area. Compared to similar studies from more urban areas in Norway, the hip fracture rates in this population seem somewhat lower.


What can isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments tell us about the self-organization of surfactants into micelles?

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the thyroid. Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as significant targets for novel cancer therapies. For patients with differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventional treatments, multiple novel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials. Partial response rates up to 30% have been reported in single-agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilisation is more commonly seen. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Sorafenib and sunitinib have had promising preliminary results reported and are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. Treatment for patients with metastatic or advanced thyroid carcinoma now emphasises clinical trial opportunities for novel agents with considerable promise. Adverse effects on thyroid function and thyroid hormone metabolism have also been seen with several TKIs, necessitating prospective thyroid function testing for all patients starting therapy.

Gene expression analyses of essential catch factors in the smooth and striated adductor muscles of larval, juvenile and adult great scallop (Pecten maximus). The scallop adductor muscle consists of striated fibres responsible for the fast closure of the shells, and smooth fibres able to maintain tension in a prolonged state of contraction called catch. Formation of the force-bearing catch linkages has been demonstrated to be initiated by dephosphorylation of the key catch-regulating factor twitchin by a calcineurin-like phosphatase, while the involvement of other thick filament proteins is uncertain. Here we report on the development of catchability of the adductor smooth muscle in the great scallop (Pecten maximus) by analysing the spatio-temporal gene expression patterns of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLCr), twitchin, myorod and calcineurin using whole mount in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR. The MLCr signal was identified in the retractor and adductor muscles of the pediveliger larvae, and the juvenile and adult scallop displayed abundant mRNA levels of MLCr in the smooth and striated adductor muscles. Twitchin was mainly expressed in the smooth adductor muscle during metamorphosis, whereas the adult striated adductor muscle contained seven-folds higher twitchin mRNA levels compared to the smooth portion. Calcineurin expression predominated in the gonads and in the smooth adductor, and five-folds higher mRNA levels were measured in the smooth than in the striated fibres at the adult stage. In contrast to the other genes examined, the expression of myorod was confined to the smooth adductor muscle suggesting that myorod plays a permissive role in the molluscan catch muscles, which are first required at the vulnerable settlement stage as a component of the predator defence system.

Pitfalls in appendicitis. The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

Short-term training adaptations in maximal motor unit firing rates and afterhyperpolarization duration. In this study we investigated age- and training-related adaptations in maximal motor unit firing rates and the duration of the motoneuron afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot. Subjects included 30 young (21.9 +/- 3.1 years) and 30 older (72.9 +/- 4.6 years) individuals, who were randomly assigned to a control or training group. Maximal voluntary force (MVC), maximal motor unit firing rate, and motoneuron AHP duration were measured on two occasions. The training group participated in six dorsiflexor exercise training sessions between test and retest. At baseline, young subjects had higher MVC force and maximal motor unit firing rate, and shorter AHP duration, compared with older subjects. Young and older subjects in the trained group demonstrated a respective 17.4% and 19.8% increase in MVC force, a 6.8% and 24.3% increase in maximal MUFR, and a 7.4% and 14.2% decrease in AHP duration. These results indicate that age-related changes in neuromuscular function are not a necessary consequence of aging.

Blending technology and teamwork for successful management of product recalls. Patient safety programs have been developed in many hospitals to reduce the risk of harm to patients. Proactive, real-time, and retrospective risk-reduction strategies should be implemented in hospitals, but patient safety leaders should also be cognizant of the risks associated with thousands of products that enter the hospital through the supply chain. A growing number of recalls and alerts related to these products are received by health care facilities each year, through a recall process that is fraught with challenges. Despite the best efforts of health care providers, weaknesses and gaps in the process lead to delays, fragmentation, and disruptions, thus extending the number of days patients may be at risk from potentially faulty or misused products. To address these concerns, Duke Medicine, which comprises an academic medical center, two community hospitals, outlying clinics, physicians' offices, and home health and hospice, implemented a Web-based recall management system. Within three months, the time required to receive, deliver, and close alerts decreased from 43 days to 2.74 days. To maximize the effectiveness of the recall management process, a team of senior Duke Medicine leaders was established to evaluate the impact of product recalls and alerts on patient safety, to evaluate response action plans, and to provide oversight of patient and provider communication strategies. Alerts are now communicated more effectively and responded to in a more consistent and global manner. This comprehensive approach to product recalls is a critical component of a broader Duke Medicine strategy to improve patient safety.

The cAMP assay: a functional in vitro alternative to the in vivo Histamine Sensitization test.

Activated glutathione metabolism participates in protective effects of carnosic acid against oxidative stress in neuronal HT22 cells. In our previous studies, we have reported that carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (CS) originating from rosemary protects cortical neurons by inducing phase 2 enzymes, the induction of which was initiated by activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway , , . In the present study we address the nature of the effector of these neuroprotective effects downstream of the phase 2 enzyme induction. From our results we conclude that activated glutathione (GSH) metabolism may participate in these protective effects. First, we performed cDNA microarray analysis in order to identify the gene(s) responsible for the actions and found that various enzymes involved in the metabolism of GSH (glutathione S-transferase, alpha 4; glutathione S-transferase, alpha 2; and formylglutathione hydrolase) constituted 3 of the top 5 CA-induced genes. The other 2 genes encoded phase 2 enzymes [NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase1and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3, subfamily A1]. Next, we compared the physiologically-active compounds originating from rosemary (CA, CS, luteolin, genkwanin, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, and verbenone) by 3 criteria (enhancement of total glutathione levels, transcriptional activation, neuroprotective effects). By all of these criteria, CA and CS were the most active. In contrast, the other compounds were only weakly active or totally inactive. These results suggest that pro-electrophilic compounds such as CA and CS may protect cortical neurons by causing the following sequential events: S-alkylation --> activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway --> transcriptional activation --> induction of phase 2 enzymes --> activation of GSH metabolism --> neuroprotection.


Animal transgenesis: an overview.

High glucose stimulates macrophage SR-BI expression and induces a switch in its activity from cholesterol efflux to cholesterol influx. Diabetes is associated with atherogenesis and macrophage-foam cell formation, due in part to a decrease in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. This study examined the expression of proteins involved in cholesterol transport, i.e. ABCA1 and SR-BI, under diabetic conditions. ABCA1 expression was similar, whereas SR-BI expression (mRNA and protein) was significantly increased in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) harvested from C57Bl/6 diabetic mice, compared to MPM from control non-diabetic mice. Similar results were obtained in vitro in J-774A.1 macrophage-like cell line incubated with high (30 mM) vs. low (5mM) glucose concentrations. Accordingly, association and internalization of HDL to MPM from diabetic mice, or to J-774A.1 macrophages grown under diabetic conditions was significantly higher compared to control cells. Unexpectedly, however, increased macrophage SR-BI expression was associated with a substantial reduction in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Moreover, total cellular cholesterol content was increased by 28% in macrophages incubated with HDL under high glucose concentrations, compared to low glucose concentrations. This effect was abolished by a rabbit polyclonal anti-SR-BI, which blocks binding to the receptor, or alternatively by using BLT1, a specific inhibitor of lipid transport via the SR-BI. Diabetes stimulates the expression of SR-BI in macrophages and leads to a shift in its activity from HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL-mediated cholesterol influx. These effects may lead to increased foam cell formation and atherosclerosis development.

[Hepatitis A virus detection in shellfish from Tunisia by reverse transcription-nested PCR--investigation of a correlation between viral and bacterial contamination]. We aimed at evaluating the contamination by hepatitis A virus (HAV) of 54 shellfish samples collected from five Tunisian shellfish harvesting areas and finding a correlation between bacterial and viral contamination. Fifty-four shellfish samples were analysed in our study. Two methods of viral extraction were evaluated by reverse transcription-nested PCR. The first one was based on elution by glycine solution and the second one used a beef extract solution. Bacteriological determination (Samonella and E. coli) was carried out for all shellfish samples. Glycine extraction showed a higher detection rate of HAV compared to the saline beef extraction method. The hepatitis A virus was detected in 32 % of shellfish samples analysed. None of the samples revealed the presence of Samonella. From 17 samples positive for HAV, we found six samples showing a number of E. coli below the European legislation. An important HAV contamination was observed in our study. No correlation between bacterial and viral contamination was found.

Prevalence of blood lipid disturbances in Swedish and foreign-born 60-year-old men and women in Stockholm, Sweden. Some immigrant groups in Sweden show a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease. There is a lack of data of pattern of blood lipids among these. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dyslipidaemia in men and women of foreign-born origin compared to Swedish-born. A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the population in Stockholm County, Sweden, with total of 4228 60-year-old men and women. Medical, lifestyle and socio-economic data were collected by questionnaires, and anthropometric and laboratory data through medical examination. Outcomes were odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dyslipidaemia in different groups, with Swedish-born as reference group, with adjustment for anthropometric, medical, lifestyle and socio-economic factors. Among non-European immigrants, the fully adjusted OR of high cholesterol was 0.57 (95% CI 0.37-0.88), of high LDL-cholesterol was 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.96), and of low HDL-cholesterol was 2.06 (95% CI 1.35-3.15). When only adjusting for sex, Finnish-born and non-European immigrants showed higher risk of high triglycerides, OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.01-1.71) and OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.34-2.93), respectively, and of high apoB/apoA-I ratio, OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.00-1.66) and OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.06-2.33), respectively. The finding of blood lipid disturbances among immigrants in this study partly explain the higher cardiovascular morbidity shown in previous studies. Non-European immigrants showed a different lipid pattern, with lower HDL-cholesterol, which could possibly be of genetic background.

Slight abduction/adduction deviations in femur positioning for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry are inconsequential. Straight femur alignment during dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) acquisition is assumed to help ensure accurate bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Use of bilateral femur positioners may not result in straight femur alignment. To assess the effect of a bilateral femur positioner on DXA results, we compared a standard fixed-width bilateral femur positioner with an adjustable-width positioner that allowed for straight femur alignment. BMD values obtained from the adjustable-width bilateral femur positioner were highly correlated (R(2)=0.98-0.99) with those obtained using a fixed-width positioner. The mean bias in BMD between the fixed- and adjustable-width positioner was low (-0.001 to +0.006g/cm(2)) at all proximal femur regions of interest. In this study, the use of a fixed-width bilateral femur positioner and associated deviations in femur alignment have little consequence on BMD measurement.

Do media players cause interference with pacemakers? Electrical devices generate electromagnetic fields that may interfere with pacemakers. Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but it is not known whether they cause direct interference with pacemakers. The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction between pacemakers and 3 different media players. In this prospective, randomized study, 54 patients with dual chamber pacemakers who were in sinus rhythm underwent baseline observation, followed by observation under telemetry communication. These patients were then randomly evaluated with 3 media players (iPod 3G, iPod Photo, and iPod Touch Apple, Cupertino, CA) with and without telemetry communication for 1 minute each. Patients were monitored for pacemaker malfunction using a single-channel ECG during exposure to media players. The pacemaker was interrogated after each exposure and an interrogation report was printed for evaluation. Pacemaker interference was categorized as type I, II, or III. Types I and II interference described telemetry interference and type III interference was defined as any direct interference with pacemaker function or programmed parameters. A total of 54 patients (29 men and 25 women; mean age 77.2 +/- 9.3 y) were evaluated. In total, of the 162 tests (for telemetry interference) 36.4% were positive (Type I and II). Type III interference was also evaluated in 162 tests and none showed any evidence of direct interference. Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but they do not directly interfere with pacemaker function.

Circadian regulation of a-type potassium currents in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In mammals, the precise circadian timing of many biological processes depends on the generation of oscillations in neural activity of pacemaker cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Understanding the ionic mechanisms underlying these rhythms is an important goal of research in chronobiology. Previous work has shown that SCN neurons express A-type potassium currents (IAs), but little is known about the properties of this current in the SCN. We sought to characterize some of these properties, including the identities of IA channel subunits found in the SCN and the circadian regulation of IA itself. In this study, we were able to detect significant hybridization for Shal-related family members 1 and 2 (Kv4.1 and 4.2) within the SCN. In addition, we used Western blot to show that the Kv4.1 and 4.2 proteins are expressed in SCN tissue. We further show that the magnitude of the IA current exhibits a diurnal rhythm that peaks during the day in the dorsal region of the mouse SCN. This rhythm seems to be driven by a subset of SCN neurons with a larger peak current and a longer decay constant. Importantly, this rhythm in neurons in the dorsal SCN continues in constant darkness, providing an important demonstration of the circadian regulation of an intrinsic voltage-gated current in mammalian cells. We conclude that the anatomical expression, biophysical properties, and pharmacological profiles measured are all consistent with the SCN IA current being generated by Kv4 channels. Additionally, these data suggest a role for IA in the regulation of spontaneous action potential firing during the transitions between day/night and in the integration of synaptic inputs to SCN neurons throughout the daily cycle.

Management of schizophrenia with obesity, metabolic, and endocrinological disorders. People with schizophrenia have an increased prevalence of overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Part of this increased risk is attributable to the use of antipsychotic medications, especially second-generation antipsychotics. Antipsychotic drugs differ in their potential to induce weight gain, with clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting the highest weight gain liability; evidence for differing effects of antipsychotics on glucose and lipid metabolism is less convincing. Individuals with schizophrenia may develop hyperprolactinemia, with or without clinical symptoms, after starting antipsychotic medications. This effect is particularly frequent with first-generation antipsychotics and with the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone and paliperidone. Psychiatrists should be aware of metabolic and endocrine side effects of antipsychotics and should make every effort to prevent or minimize them to improve the patients' compliance and quality of life.

Radioprotection of plasmid and cellular DNA and Swiss mice by silibinin. The radioprotective effect of a non-toxic bioactive component in plant milk thistle, silibinin against genotoxicity induced by gamma-irradiation was investigated in vivo/in vitro. Under in vitro conditions of irradiation, silibinin protected plasmid pBR322 DNA against gamma-radiation-induced strand breaks in a concentration dependent manner (0-200microM). Under cellular conditions of radiation exposure (3Gy), silibinin offered protection to lymphocyte DNA as evidenced from reduction in DNA damage and micronuclei formation, which showed correlation to the extent of intracellular reactive oxygen species reduction. Our extended animal studies suggest that oral administration of silibinin (70mg/kg for 3 days) to mice prior to whole-body gamma-exposure (7.5Gy) resulted in significant protection to radiation-induced mortality and DNA damage in blood leukocytes. However, silibinin treatment after irradiation was not as effective as pre-administration. In conclusion, present study indicated that silibinin has a strong potential to prevent radiation-induced DNA damage under both in vitro and in vivo.

Effects of floc aluminum on activated sludge characteristics and removal of 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol in wastewater systems. The effects of floc aluminum (Al) on activated sludge performance and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal were studied using bench-scale activated sludge systems. The results showed that higher Al-fed activated sludge led to better settling, dewatering, and effluent quality with better EE2 removal. EE2 concentrations in the effluent revealed correlations with effluent suspended solids and large particulate/colloidal effluent biopolymer (protein+polysaccharide). Furthermore, a significant correlation existed between effluent proteins and EE2 for all size fractions, indicating that hydrophobic proteinaceous colloids provide binding sites for EE2 and washout together into the effluent. These results suggest that aluminum plays a crucial role in bioflocculation of activated sludge and the efficacy of flocculation influences the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater treatment systems.

Self-control with spiking and non-spiking neural networks playing games. Self-control can be defined as choosing a large delayed reward over a small immediate reward, while precommitment is the making of a choice with the specific aim of denying oneself future choices. Humans recognise that they have self-control problems and attempt to overcome them by applying precommitment. Problems in exercising self-control, suggest a conflict between cognition and motivation, which has been linked to competition between higher and lower brain functions (representing the frontal lobes and the limbic system respectively). This premise of an internal process conflict, lead to a behavioural model being proposed, based on which, we implemented a computational model for studying and explaining self-control through precommitment behaviour. Our model consists of two neural networks, initially non-spiking and then spiking ones, representing the higher and lower brain systems viewed as cooperating for the benefit of the organism. The non-spiking neural networks are of simple feed forward multilayer type with reinforcement learning, one with selective bootstrap weight update rule, which is seen as myopic, representing the lower brain and the other with the temporal difference weight update rule, which is seen as far-sighted, representing the higher brain. The spiking neural networks are implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with learning based on stochastic synaptic transmission. The differentiating element between the two brain centres in this implementation is based on the memory of past actions determined by an eligibility trace time constant. As the structure of the self-control problem can be likened to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game in that cooperation is to defection what self-control is to impulsiveness or what compromising is to insisting, we implemented the neural networks as two players, learning simultaneously but independently, competing in the IPD game. With a technique resembling the precommitment effect, whereby the payoffs for the dilemma cases in the IPD payoff matrix are differentially biased (increased or decreased), it is shown that increasing the precommitment effect (through increasing the differential bias) increases the probability of cooperating with oneself in the future, irrespective of whether the implementation is with spiking or non-spiking neural networks.

Hippocampus abnormalities in at risk mental states for psychosis? A cross-sectional high resolution region of interest magnetic resonance imaging study. Hippocampal volume (HV) reduction is well documented in schizophrenia. However, it is still unclear whether this change is a pre-existing vulnerability factor, a sign of disease progression, a consequence of environmental factors, such as drug use, antipsychotic medication, or malnutrition. The timing of HV changes is not well established, but a lack of macrostructural hippocampal brain abnormalities before disease onset would rather support a neuroprogressive illness model. To investigate the timing of HV changes in emerging psychosis. A cross-sectional MRI study of manually traced HVs in 37 individuals with an At Risk Mental State (ARMS) for psychosis, 23 individuals with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), and 22 Healthy Controls (HC) was performed. We compared left and right HVs corrected for whole brain volume across groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with gender as a covariate. Sixteen of 37 ARMS individuals developed a psychotic disorder during follow up (ARMS-T). The mean duration of follow up in ARMS was 25.1months. The overall ANCOVA model comparing left HVs across FEP, ARMS and HC indicated a significant general group effect (p<.05) with largest volumes in ARMS and smallest in FEP. ARMS-T subjects had significantly larger left HVs compared to FE but no HV differences compared to HC (p<0.05). Over all groups, we found an asymmetry between the left and right mean HVs and a strong effect of sex. The present study suggests that macrostructural hippocampal abnormalities probably occur in the context of the first psychotic breakdown.

A study was conducted to assess the effect of substituting high levels of dietary fish oil (FO) and fishmeal (FM) for vegetable oil (VO) and plant protein (PP) on the intestinal arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in the carnivorous fish species Atlantic salmon. Four diets were fed to salmon over a period of 12 months, including a control FMFO diet, with varying replacements of plant-derived ingredients: 80 % PP and 35 % VO; 40 % PP and 70 % VO; 80 % PP and 70 %VO. Subsequently, fish were examined pre- (0 h) and post- (1 h) acute stress for blood parameters and intestinal bioactive lipidic mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins). Plasma cortisol responses were greatest in the FMFO group, while 80 % PP and 70 % VO fish exhibited increased plasma chloride concentrations. The n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio in intestinal glycerophospholipids from 70 % VO groups significantly decreased in both proximal and distal regions due to elevated levels of 18 : 2n-6 and the elongation/desaturation products 20 : 2n-6 and 20 : 3n-6. Increases in n-6 PUFA were not concomitant with increased AA, although the AA:EPA ratio did vary significantly. The 40 % PP and 70 % VO diet produced the highest intestinal AA:EPA ratio proximally, which coincided with a trend in elevated levels of PGF2alpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in response to stress. PGE2 predominated over PGF2alpha and 6-keto-PGF1alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2) with comparable concentrations in both intestinal regions. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression was an order of magnitude higher in distal intestine, compared with proximal, and was significantly up-regulated following stress. Furthermore, the 80 % PP and 70 % VO diet significantly amplified proximal COX-2 induction post-stress. Results demonstrate that high replacements with plant-derived dietary ingredients can enhance COX-2 induction and synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids in the intestine of salmon in response to acute physiological stress.

Ammonia oxidizing bacteria community in activated sludge monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Biological treatment based on activated sludge is efficient in municipal wastewater treatment. The removal of nitrogen compounds is crucial for sewage purification. Due to the fact that ammonia is toxic for a water environment and causes eutrophication, ammonia oxidation is of the utmost importance in wastewater treatment. Observing the changeability of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and identifying their most abundant species can be helpful in the optimization of wastewater treatment. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), combined with cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA and AmoA gene fragments in order to estimate AOB biodiversity and temporal community changes. Activated sludge samples were collected from the municipal WWTP in Gliwice (Poland) at 2-week intervals. Ammonia concentration in the influent during the experiment was 30.2-57.6 mg N-NH4+/L. The research revealed a high diversity of uncultured bacteria. It is suspected that these bacteria could be involved in the nitrification, which points to the fact that these bacteria might be efficient in the process. However such a situation is not confirmed and it requires further research. The appearance of Ferribacterium-like bacteria together with Nitrosomonas sp. as the most abundant bacteria was found.

Optimization and quantification of protein synthesis inside liposomes. Synthetic biology aims at reprogramming existing, or creating new, biological systems, with the ultimate aim to obtain artificial cells whose functions can be tailored. For the latter, encapsulation of complex biochemical reactions into cell-sized compartments, such as liposomes, is required. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that proteins of interest can be produced de novo within liposomes by entrapping cell-free protein-synthesis systems and DNA templates inside liposomes. Although detectable, intraliposomal protein synthesis was generally poor. Here, we have optimized intraliposomal cell-free protein synthesis by changing several variables, including lipid composition as well as liposome, pyrophosphatase, and T7 RNA polymerase concentration. Further, by using an activity-based assay, we have quantified the amount of full-length protein that was produced from DNA templates inside liposomes before and after optimization of aforementioned variables. Based on the model protein beta-galactosidase, it is demonstrated that liposomal protein synthesis can yield microgram quantities of protein (30-40 microg/mL liposomes).

Altered regulation of glutamate release and decreased functional activity and expression of GLT1 and GLAST glutamate transporters in the hippocampus of adolescent rats perinatally exposed to Delta(9)-THC. The long-term effects of perinatal Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) exposure - from gestational day (GD) 15 to postnatal day (PND) 9 - on hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission were studied in slices from the 40-day-old offspring of Delta(9)-THC exposed (Delta(9)-THC-rats) and vehicle-exposed (control) dams. Basal and in K+-evoked endogenous hippocampal glutamate outflow were both significantly decreased in Delta(9)-THC-rats. The effect of short Delta(9)-THC exposure (0.1microM) on K(+)-evoked glutamate release disclosed a loss of the stimulatory effect of Delta(9)-THC on hippocampal glutamate release in Delta(9)-THC-rats, but not in controls. In addition, l-[(3)H]-glutamate uptake was significantly lower in hippocampal slices from Delta(9)-THC-rats, where a significant decrease in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) protein was also detected. Collectively, these data demonstrate that perinatal exposure to cannabinoids induces long-term impairment in hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission that persist into adolescence.

The role of expanded coverage of the national vitamin A program in preventing morbidity and mortality among preschool children in India. Higher food prices increase the risk of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children in poor families, because a larger part of the household food budget is spent on grain foods and less on vitamin A-rich foods. Vitamin A supplementation is an important source of vitamin A for children. Our objective was to characterize coverage of the India national vitamin A program for preschool children and identify risk factors for not receiving vitamin A. Anthropometric and demographic data were examined in 23,008 children aged 12-59 mo in the India National Family Health Survey, 2005-2006. Within the last 6 mo, 20.2% of children received vitamin A supplementation. The prevalence of stunting, severe stunting, underweight, and severe underweight was higher among children who did not receive vitamin A compared with those who received vitamin A (P < 0.0001). In families with a child who did and did not receive vitamin A, respectively, the proportion with a history of under-5 child mortality was 8.4 vs. 11.4% (P < 0.0001). By state, vitamin A program coverage was inversely proportional to the under-5 child mortality rate (r = -0.51; P = 0.004). Maternal education of > or =10 y [odds ratio (OR) 2.22; 95% CI 1.69-2.91], 7-9 y (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.57-2.53), or 1-6 y (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.28-2.13) compared with no education was an important factor related to receipt of vitamin A. Poor coverage of the vitamin A supplementation program in India has serious implications in the face of rising food prices. Expanded coverage of the vitamin A program in India will help protect children from morbidity, mortality, and blindness.

[Evaluation of obstructive interval, presence of sperm granulomas and patient age as predictors of spermatogenesis in a cohort of men undergoing vasectomy reversal]. For more than 50 years vasectomy reversal is a routinely performed procedure in the field of urology. However, there is no scientific agreement about morphological changes of the testes caused by vasectomy. The existing evidence for reduced fertility rates following vasectomy reversal demands a clear statement regarding potential histological changes and impaired spermatogenesis following vasectomy. Thus far there is little knowledge about potential histological changes of the testis caused by vasectomy. 330 consecutive patients who underwent vasectomy reversal had bilateral testicular biopsies which were evaluated utilising semi-thin sections. The number of mature spermatids per seminiferous tubule was considered the variable of interest as it represents an objective and reproducible parameter of spermatogenesis. The number of mature spermatids per tubule was correlated with patient age, obstructive interval and the presence or absence of sperm granulomas via the chi-square test. Overall, 570 sections of 285 patients were eligible for evaluation. The mean patient age was 41.2 years (range 27-63 years, SD +/- 6.5 years) with a mean obstructive interval of 105.9 months (range 12-328, SD +/- 66.1). 56 patients (19.6 %) had a sperm granuloma on the right and 22 (11.6 %) on the left ductus deferens. There was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of a sperm granuloma with the number of mature spermatids per tubule (p = 0.717). Furthermore, there was neither an association of obstructive interval (p = 0.144) nor patient age (p = 0.168) with spermatogenesis. Regular spermatogenetic activity in all examined samples with development of mature spermatids was shown. Furthermore, for the first time we were able to demonstrate in a large cohort of patients that neither patient age nor obstructive interval nor sperm granuloma have a significant impact on spermatogenesis.

Evidence regarding the need for a diagnostic category for a coercive paraphilia. Evidence relevant to a potential diagnosis of Paraphilic Coercive Disorder is reviewed. Salient cues indicating that their partner is feeling coerced normally at least partially inhibit male sexual arousal while cues indicating mutual interest heighten arousal. However, for a minority of males, this pattern reverses with salient coercion cues leading to heightened arousal. This unusual pattern of arousal and fantasy is associated with a self-reported willingness to rape among non-convicted samples and is more common among convicted rapists than in other offender groups. It is inconsistently associated with Sadism as defined by the DSM-IV-TR and only weakly associated with psychopathy or general criminality. Evidence for it as an abnormal and persistent sexual interest comes from behavioral patterns, self-reported sexual fantasy, and laboratory tests. Two possible ways of incorporating it into a future version of the DSM are outlined.

Efficacy of four enrofloxacin treatment regimens against experimental infection in turkey poults with avian pneumovirus and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale. Drinking-water treatment with enrofloxacin is widely used to cure respiratory infections in turkeys. The current treatment regimen advises a 5-day treatment at 10 mg/kg body weight. Since enrofloxacin exerts a concentration-dependent activity it might be useful to provide the total treatment dose of 50 mg/kg total dose in a single-day treatment regimen. We therefore assessed whether single-day treatment regimens with 50 mg/kg body weight were clinically equivalent to the advised multiple-day treatment regimen with 10 mg/kg body weight for 5 days. For this purpose, five groups of 16 turkeys, 22 days old, were experimentally inoculated with avian metapneumovirus (APV) and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and subsequently treated in the drinking water with enrofloxacin, using either a single-day treatment regimen at 50 mg/kg body weight during a 5-h, 10-h or 20-h period or a standard 5-day treatment regimen at 10 mg/kg body weight/ day for 20 h. Although initially all dosage regimens cleared O. rhinotracheale from the trachea, 4 days after onset of treatment O. rhinotracheale bacteria were re-excreted in the single-day regimens but without worsening of the clinical symptoms. The 5-day treatment with 10 mg enrofloxacin/kg in turkeys provided the best results for the treatment of an O. rhinotracheale infection in turkeys by shortening the course and reducing the severity of clinical disease and by eliminating O. rhinotracheale from the respiratory tract without re-emergence. None of the used treatment regimens promoted the selection of bacterial clones with reduced susceptibility or resistance.

Diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by mucosal inflammation affecting both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses; its causes are potentially numerous, disparate, and frequently overlapping. The more common conditions that are associated with CRS are perennial allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and anatomical mechanical obstruction (septum/turbinate issues). Other less common etiologies include inflammation (eg, from superantigens), fungal sinusitis or bacterial sinusitis with or without associated biofilm formation, gastroesophageal reflux, smoke and other environmental exposures, immune deficiencies, genetics, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. A diagnosis of CRS is strongly suggested by a history of symptoms (eg, congestion and/or fullness; nasal obstruction, blockage, discharge, and/or purulence; discolored postnasal discharge; hyposmia/anosmia; facial pain and/or pressure) and their duration for > 3 months. A definitive diagnosis requires physical evidence of mucosal swelling or discharge appreciated during physical examination coupled with CT imaging if inflammation does not involve the middle meatus or ethmoid bulla. Multivariant causation makes the diagnosis of CRS and selection of treatment complex. Furthermore, various types of health care providers including ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists, allergists, primary care physicians, and pulmonologists treat CRS, and each is likely to have a different approach. A structured approach to the diagnosis and management of CRS can help streamline and standardize care no matter where patients present for evaluation and treatment. A 2008 Working Group on CRS in Adults, supported by the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy (AAOA), developed a series of algorithms for the differential diagnosis and treatment of CRS in adults, based on the evolving understanding of CRS as an inflammatory disease. The algorithms presented in this paper address an approach for all CRS patients as well as approaches for those with nasal polyps, edema observed on nasal endoscopy, purulence observed on nasal endoscopy, an abnormal history and physical examination, and an abnormal history and normal physical examination.

Contribution of chronic diseases to disability in elderly people in countries with low and middle incomes: a 10/66 Dementia Research Group population-based survey. Disability in elderly people in countries with low and middle incomes is little studied; according to Global Burden of Disease estimates, visual impairment is the leading contributor to years lived with disability in this population. We aimed to assess the contribution of physical, mental, and cognitive chronic diseases to disability, and the extent to which sociodemographic and health characteristics account for geographical variation in disability. We undertook cross-sectional surveys of residents aged older than 65 years (n=15 022) in 11 sites in seven countries with low and middle incomes (China, India, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, and Peru). Disability was assessed with the 12-item WHO disability assessment schedule 2.0. Dementia, depression, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were ascertained by clinical assessment; diabetes, stroke, and heart disease by self-reported diagnosis; and sensory, gastrointestinal, skin, limb, and arthritic disorders by self-reported impairment. Independent contributions to disability scores were assessed by zero-inflated negative binomial regression and Poisson regression to generate population-attributable prevalence fractions (PAPF). In regions other than rural India and Venezuela, dementia made the largest contribution to disability (median PAPF 25.1% [IQR 19.2-43.6]). Other substantial contributors were stroke (11.4% [1.8-21.4]), limb impairment (10.5% [5.7-33.8]), arthritis (9.9% [3.2-34.8]), depression (8.3% [0.5-23.0]), eyesight problems (6.8% [1.7-17.6]), and gastrointestinal impairments (6.5% [0.3-23.1]). Associations with chronic diseases accounted for around two-thirds of prevalent disability. When zero inflation was taken into account, between-site differences in disability scores were largely attributable to compositional differences in health and sociodemographic characteristics. On the basis of empirical research, dementia, not blindness, is overwhelmingly the most important independent contributor to disability for elderly people in countries with low and middle incomes. Chronic diseases of the brain and mind deserve increased prioritisation. Besides disability, they lead to dependency and present stressful, complex, long-term challenges to carers. Societal costs are enormous.

Validation and clinical application of a molecular method for identification of Histoplasma capsulatum in human specimens in Colombia, South America. The conventional means of diagnosis of histoplasmosis presents difficulties because of the delay to the time that the diagnosis is made, indicating the need for the implementation of molecular assays. We evaluated 146 clinical samples from 135 patients suspected of having histoplasmosis using a previously reported nested PCR assay for the Histoplasma capsulatum-specific 100-kDa protein (the Hc100 PCR). In order to determine the specificity of this molecular test, we also used samples from healthy individuals (n = 20), patients suspected of having respiratory disease with negative fungal cultures (n = 29), and patients with other proven infections (n = 60). Additionally, a sizable collection of DNA from cultures of H. capsulatum and other medically relevant pathogens was studied. A panfungal PCR assay that amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 region was also used to identify all fungal DNAs. All PCR-amplified products were sequenced. Of the 146 clinical samples, 67 (45.9%) were positive by culture and PCR, while 9 samples negative by culture were positive by PCR. All the sequences corresponding to the 76 amplified products presented > or =98% identity with H. capsulatum. The Hc100 PCR exhibited a sensitivity of 100% and specificities of 92.4% and 95.2% when the results were compared to those for the negative controls and samples from other proven clinical entities, respectively; the positive predictive value was 83% and the negative predictive value was 100%; the positive and negative likelihood rates were 25 and 0, respectively. These results suggest that the Hc100 nested PCR assay for the detection of H. capsulatum DNA is a useful test in areas where mycosis caused by this organism is endemic.

Effect of a plant stanol ester-containing spread, placebo spread, or Mediterranean diet on estimated cardiovascular risk and lipid, inflammatory and haemostatic factors. Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Use of plant stanols decreases low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. We compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet and plant stanol esters on vascular risk factors and estimated CVD (eCVD) risk. In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 150 mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects were randomized to Mediterranean diet, a spread containing plant stanol esters (2 g/day) or a placebo spread. Vascular risk factors were assessed every month for 4 months and the eCVD risk was calculated using the PROspective- Cardiovascular-Munster (PROCAM), Framingham, and Reynolds risk engines. Placebo had no significant effect on risk factors or eCVD risk. Mediterranean diet gradually induced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, triglycerides, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), blood pressure and eCVD risk (24-32%). The plant stanol ester spread reduced (by 1 month) TC (-14%), LDL-C (-16%), hsCRP (-17%), and estimated CVD risk (26-30%). eCVD risk reduction was sustained at 4th months when the gradual Mediterranean diet eCVD risk reduction became comparable to that of the stanol group. Plant stanol esters yielded an early, by 1st treatment month, reduction of eCVD risk that resulted from a TC, LDL-C, and hsCRP decrease. eCVD risk reduction on the Mediterranean diet resulted from a change in several CVD risk factors and equaled that of plant stanol at 4 months. The consumption of plant stanol esters by moderately hypercholesterolaemic patients may be a useful option to reduce CVD risk in those who do not adopt a Mediterranean diet.

Cognitive impulsivity in animal models: role of response time and reinforcing rate in delay intolerance with two-choice operant tasks. Impulsivity, a key symptom of ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), is also common in obsessive-compulsive and addictive disorders. There is rising interest in animal models of inhibitory-control impairment. Adolescent rats were tested daily in the intolerance-to-delay (ID) task (session 25 min, timeout 20 s), involving choice between either immediate small amount of food (SS), or larger amount of food after a delay (LL). The mixed 5-HT(1A/7) agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 0 or 0.060 mg/kg i.p.) was administered acutely just before the last three sessions at highest delays. In addition to the classical choice parameter (percent LL preference), the spontaneous waiting (termed response time, RT) occurring between end of a timeout (TO) and next nose-poke was calculated. The pace between consecutive reinforcer deliveries is given by the mean inter-trial interval (mITI, i.e. TO + RT). Hence, the impact of any given delay may be proportional to this pace and be expressed as delay-equivalent odds, i.e. the extent by which delays are multiples of the mITI. Data revealed that RT/mITI increased sharply from around 15 s/35 s to around 30 s/50 s when imposed delay changed from 30 s to 45 s (i.e. odds from 0.91 to 1.06). This suggests that rats adopted a strategy allowing them to keep in pace with perceived reinforcing rate. The increasing delay constraint directly influenced the length of rats' spontaneous waiting (RT) before next decision. For higher delays, with odds >1, rats shifted to a clear-cut SS preference, which is devoid of any exogenous temporal constraint. A challenge with 8-OH-DPAT (0 or 0.060 mg/kg i.p.) decreased impulsive choice but also increased RT. Thus, tapping onto 5-HT(1A/7) receptors slightly enhanced RT/mITI values, possibly reflecting ability of rats to cope with slower reinforcing rates and/or with delay-cancelled reward paces. In summary, delay-induced states of aversion may arise from the innate tendency to rely on a regular rate of reinforcement. Conversely, a drug-enhanced capacity to cope with delay may involve an internal ability to adjust expectancy about such a reinforcing rate.

Not interferon, but interleukin-6 controls early gene expression in hepatitis B virus infection. With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication. Our results demonstrate recognition of HBV patterns by nonparenchymal liver cells, which results in IL-6-mediated control of HBV infection at the transcriptional level. Thus, IL-6 ensures early control of the virus, limiting activation of the adaptive immune response and preventing death of the HBV-infected hepatocyte. This pattern recognition may be essential for a virus, which infects a new host with only a few virions. Our data also indicate that therapeutic neutralization of IL-6 for treatment of certain diseases may represent a risk if the patient is HBV-infected.

Radiation dose to the thyroid gland and breast from multidetector computed tomography of the cervical spine: does bismuth shielding with and without a cervical collar reduce dose? This study aimed to assess the radiation dose reduction that could be achieved using an in-line bismuth shielding over the thyroid gland and breast and to determine the effect of a cervical spine collar on thyroid dose reduction and image noise when performing computed tomography of the cervical spine using automatic tube current modulation. An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned using a commercially available 64-channel computed tomographic scanner. A standardized trauma cervical spine protocol was used. Scans were obtained with and without a standard cervical spine immobilization collar and with and without bismuth-impregnated thyroid and breast shields. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were placed over the thyroid gland and breasts for each scan. A paired t test was used to determine whether the skin entry dose differed significantly between the shielded and unshielded thyroid and breast and to determine whether placing the thyroid shield over a cervical immobilization collar resulted in a significant dose reduction. Region of interest of pixel values was used to determine image noise. The average measured skin entry dose for the unshielded thyroid gland was 21.9 mGy (95% confidence interval, 18.9-4.7). With a bismuth shield applied directly over the skin, the dose to the thyroid gland was reduced by 22.5% (P < 0.05). With the bismuth shield applied over the cervical spine collar, the dose reduction to the thyroid was 10.4%, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.16) compared with the dose reduction without the cervical collar. Skin entry dose over the breasts was significant, although they were outside the primary scan range. Without bismuth shielding, the skin entry dose was 1.5 mGy, and with bismuth shielding, the dose was significantly reduced by 36.6% (P < 0.01). Image noise increased most when shielding was used with an immobilization collar. There is a significant dose reduction to the thyroid gland and breasts when a bismuth shield is placed on the skin. The dose saving achieved by placing the shield on the cervical collar is approximately halved compared with placement on the skin, and this did not reach statistical significance, and this was accompanied by an increase on image noise. Bismuth shields should not be used in combination with cervical immobilization collars.


Post-exercise heart rate recovery independently predicts mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure.

Alzheimer's mechanisms in ischemic brain degeneration. There is increasing evidence for influence of Alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology on ischemic brain injury. This review investigates the relationships between beta-amyloid peptide, apolipoproteins, presenilins, tau protein, alpha-synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal survival/death decisions in brain following ischemic episode. The interactions of these molecules and influence on beta-amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to ischemic brain degeneration and finally to dementia are reviewed. Generation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptide and tau protein pathology are important key players involved in mechanisms in ischemic neurodegeneration as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence suggests that inflammatory process represents next component, which significantly contribute to degeneration progression. Although inflammation was initially thought to arise secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators may stimulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism by upregulation of beta-secretase and therefore are able to establish a vicious cycle. Functional brain recovery after ischemic lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury-related increase in the amount of the neurotoxic C-terminal of amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid peptide. Moreover, ischemic neurodegeneration is strongly accelerated with aging, too. New therapeutic alternatives targeting these proteins and repairing related neuronal changes are under development for the treatment of ischemic brain consequences including memory loss prevention.

Raman and neutron scattering study of partially deuterated L-alanine: evidence of a solid-solid phase transition. Raman and neutron experiments using specific isotope labeling were combined in order to study the dynamics and structure of L-alanine. Inelastic neutron and Raman scattering data of C(2)H(4)(ND(2))CO(2)D are discussed in relation to the doubling of the lattice parameter a observed by means of neutron powder diffraction in C(2)D(4) (NH(2))CO(2)H. The major changes accompanying the phase transition are found in the vibrational frequencies involving the torsional vibration tau(CO(2)(-)), which is clearly affected by the hydrogen bonds between the protons of the ammonium group and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group. At lower temperatures the rearrangement of identifiable hydrogen bonds induces changes in the bending vibration delta(ND(3)), confirming some orientational disorder.

Effects of arginine on photostability and thermal stability of IgG1 monoclonal antibodies. This study demonstrates that arginine is a highly effective solvent additive which significantly reduces the light induced aggregation of four IgG1 type monoclonal antibodies (named as IMC-1A, IMC-1B, IMC-1C and IMC-1D) as measured by size exclusion chromatography. All experiments were performed in a phosphate buffer system containing either sodium chloride or arginine hydrochloride. The protein samples were exposed to light in a photo chamber according to ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) guidelines. Thermal unfolding transition temperature (T(m)) of IMC-1A as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was significantly decreased ( approximately 3.3 degrees C) in the presence of arginine hydrochloride as compared to in sodium chloride. However, a noticeable increase in thermal stability was observed for IMC-1B, IMC-1C and IMC-1D in the presence of arginine hydrochloride. The photostability of all these molecules was significantly enhanced by arginine hydrochloride and both a direct and inverse correlation was observed between conformational stability and photostability. To our knowledge, this paper for the first time, demonstrates that arginine hydrochloride considerably reduces the light induced aggregation of monoclonal antibodies. Arginine hydrochloride is also known to increase protein solubility and its ability to extensively reduce light induced aggregation makes it a potential solvent additive for the formulation development of therapeutic proteins.

MRP2 mediated drug-drug interaction: indomethacin increases sulfasalazine absorption in the small intestine, potentially decreasing its colonic targeting. We have recently shown that efflux transport, mediated by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is responsible for sulfasalazine low-permeability in the small intestine, thereby enabling its colonic targeting and therapeutic action. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between indomethacin and sulfasalazine, in the mechanism of efflux transporter competition. The concentration-dependent effects of indomethacin on sulfasalazine intestinal epithelial transport were investigated across Caco-2 cell monolayers, in both apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and BL-AP directions. The interaction was then investigated in the in situ single-pass rat jejunal perfusion model. Sulfasalazine displayed 30-fold higher BL-AP than AP-BL Caco-2 permeability, indicative of net mucosal secretion. Indomethacin significantly increased AP-BL and decreased BL-AP sulfasalazine Caco-2 transport, in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 75 and 196 microM respectively. In the rat model, higher sulfasalazine concentrations resulted in higher intestinal permeability, consistent with saturation of efflux transporter. Without indomethacin, sulfasalazine demonstrated low rat jejunal permeability (vs. metoprolol). Indomethacin significantly increased sulfasalazine P(eff), effectively shifting it from BCS (biopharmaceutics classification system) Class IV to II. In conclusion, the data indicate that concomitant intake of indomethacin and sulfasalazine may lead to increased absorption of sulfasalazine in the small intestine, thereby reducing its colonic concentration and potentially altering its therapeutic effect.

Rotavirus infection and intussusception in Tunisian children: implications for use of attenuated rotavirus vaccines. A licensed rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from use because of an increased risk of intussusception. The association of rotavirus vaccination with intussusception raised concerns about a potential link between natural rotavirus disease and intussusception. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether an epidemiological association with natural rotavirus infection existed. From 1984 to 2003, all children younger than 5 years with intussusception were retrospectively identified by medical charts, and from 1995 to 2003, a prospective surveillance study of rotavirus infection in children younger than 5 years was independently conducted. Epidemiological characteristics of intussusception and rotavirus infection were then compared. A total of 533 cases of intussusception and 146 cases of rotavirus infection were identified. The incidence of intussusception for infants younger than 1 year was 62/100,000 child-years. The age distributions of intussusception and rotavirus gastroenteritis overlapped, and a masculine predominance was noted in both cases. No significant association was observed between the monthly distribution of intussusception and rotavirus infection. The present study has not convincingly shown that rotavirus diarrhea plays a major role in intussusception. However, data about age and sex distributions supported the biologic plausibility of such an association.


Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice.

DNA hypermethylation of tumors from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is associated with gender and histologic type. We previously identified a number of genes which were methylated significantly more frequently in the tumor compared to the non-cancerous lung tissues from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Detection of methylation profiles of genes in NSCLC could provide insight into differential pathways to malignancy and lead to strategies for better treatment of individuals with NSCLC. We determined the DNA methylation status of 27 genes using quantitative MethyLight assays in lung tumor samples from 117 clinically well-characterized NSCLC patients. Hypermethylation was detected in one of more of the genes in 106 (91%) of 117 cases and was detected at high levels (percentage methylation reference (PMR)> or =4%) in 79% of NSCLC cases. Methylation of APC, CCND2, KCNH5 and, RUNX was significantly more frequent in adenocarcinomas compared to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), while methylation of CDKN2A was more common in SCC. Hypermethylation of KCNH5, KCNH8, and RARB was more frequent in females compared to males. Hypermethylation of APC and CCND2 was inversely associated with proliferation score assessed by Ki-67 level. Our findings of differential gene hypermethylation frequencies in tumor tissues from patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell cancers and in females compared to males suggests that further investigation is warranted in order to more fully understand the potential disparate pathways and/or risk factors for NSCLC associated with histologic type and gender.

The giant extracellular matrix-binding protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis mediates biofilm accumulation and attachment to fibronectin. Virulence of nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is essentially related to formation of adherent biofilms, assembled by bacterial attachment to an artificial surface and subsequent production of a matrix that mediates interbacterial adhesion. Growing evidence supports the idea that proteins are functionally involved in S. epidermidis biofilm accumulation. We found that in S. epidermidis 1585v overexpression of a 460 kDa truncated isoform of the extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) is necessary for biofilm formation. Embp is a giant fibronectin-binding protein harbouring 59 Found In Various Architectures (FIVAR) and 38 protein G-related albumin-binding (GA) domains. Studies using defined Embp-positive and -negative S. epidermidis strains proved that Embp is sufficient and necessary for biofilm formation. Further data showed that the FIVAR domains of Embp mediate binding of S. epidermidis to solid-phase attached fibronectin, constituting the first step of biofilm formation on conditioned surfaces. The binding site in fibronectin was assigned to the fibronectin domain type III12. Embp-mediated biofilm formation also protected S. epidermidis from phagocytosis by macrophages. Thus, Embp is a multifunctional cell surface protein that mediates attachment to host extracellular matrix, biofilm accumulation and escape from phagocytosis, and therefore is well suited for promoting implant-associated infections.

The time course of exogenous and endogenous control of covert attention. Studies of eye-movements and manual response have established that rapid overt selection is largely exogenously driven toward salient stimuli, whereas slower selection is largely endogenously driven to relevant objects. We use the N2pc, an event-related potential index of covert attention, to demonstrate that this time course reflects an underlying pattern in the deployment of covert attention. We find that shifts of attention that occur soon after the onset of a visual search array are directed toward salient, task-irrelevant visual stimuli and are associated with slow responses to the target. In contrast, slower shifts are target-directed and are associated with fast responses. The time course of exogenous and endogenous control provides a framework in which some inconsistent results in the capture literature might be reconciled; capture may occur when attention is rapidly deployed.

Functional implication of Netrin expression in malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma cells are known to have altered expression of genes supporting proliferation and invasion, however, the expression of molecules of the Netrin family of repellent factors has not been analyzed in melanomas until now. Here, we show that Netrin-1 expression is strongly induced in melanoma cells compared to melanocytes in vivo and in vitro controlled at the transcriptional level via ETS-1. In addition, the expression of the netrin receptor UNC5B was induced and that of UNC5C was reduced in the tumor cells. In order to determine the functional relevance of Netrin-1 expression in malignant melanoma, Netrin expression in melanoma cells was reduced by siRNA attempts and primary human melanocytes were treated with recombinant Netrin-1. The cells showed no changes in proliferation or apoptosis, however, a strong reduction of migratory properties was observed in the melanoma cells after reduction of Netrin expression whereas melanocyte migration was strongly induced by treatment with Netrin. Our study suggests that Netrin-1 promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role in the progression of malignant melanoma.


Spinal cord compression by ligamentum flavum hematoma in the thoracic spine.

Lithium and thyroid. One in 200 people receive lithium for treatment of bipolar disorder. The common clinical side effects of the drug are goitre in up to 40% and hypothyroidism in about 20%. Lithium increases thyroid autoimmunity if present before therapy. Treatment with levothyroxine is effective and lithium therapy should not be stopped. Lithium may cause hyperthyroidism due to thyroiditis or rarely Graves' disease. As lithium inhibits thyroid hormone release from the thyroid gland it can be used as an adjunct therapy in the management of severe hyperthyroidism. It also increases thyroidal radioiodine retention and may be effective in reducing administered activity in hyperthyroidism. There is no clinical benefit of lithium therapy in thyroid cancer. More research is required on the cellular proliferative effects of lithium as well as its impact on the immune system.

Microwave oven: how to use it as a crystalloid fluid warmer. Hypothermia is a common complication in the hypovolemic patient. Warm intravenous fluids have proven valuable at preventing this complication during volume replacement. The microwave oven is considered an applicable alternative method for warming fluids but no protocol has been established. To evaluate the efficacy and affected variables of the microwave oven in warming crystalloid fluids and to determine the appropriate formula for calculating the warming duration. The important variables influencing the operation of the microwave oven include the difference between the crystalloid fluid and room temperature, the microwave oven's capability, variations in microwave irradiation, and fluid shaking. The appropriate formula for calculating warming duration is: Duration (sec) = Volume (cc) x 4.2j.g(-1).K(-1) x Raised temperature DeltaT (K) x 1.1 (Adjusted power) / Mivcwrowave power (W). The microwave oven is a safe and practical method for warming crystalloid fluids.

Sublingual immunotherapy efficacy of Dermatophagoides farinae vaccine in a murine asthma model. Allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy is a potential treatment for allergic diseases. Its effective dose and underlying mechanism are still to be explored. Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of sublingually administered Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) vaccine in a murine asthma model. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with Der f extract absorbed to alum, followed by sublingual treatment with Der f vaccine for 6 weeks. The mice were subsequently challenged intranasally with Der f extract for 1 week. We analyzed their clinical symptoms, antibody levels, cytokine levels, T-cell proliferation and the regulatory T-cell numbers. Mice treated with high-dose Der f sublingual vaccine prior to challenge displayed alleviated symptoms such as airway hyperreactivity, lung inflammation and mucus production, as well as less eosinophilic cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Interestingly, reduced responses of Der-f-specific IgE and increased responses of Der-f-specific IgA and IgG1 were aroused in the high-dose Der f sublingual vaccine group. We also observed that interleukin-4 was reduced and interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 were increased among splenocytes and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which inhibited Der-f-specific T-cell proliferation of the spleen and increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cells in the spleen. However, mice treated with low-dose Der f sublingual vaccine developed allergic asthma. Our results illustrate that high-dose Der f sublingual vaccine may play a role in immunologic protection in murine allergic asthma, possibly by inducing regulatory T cells and Th1 reaction.


The role of co-culture systems on developmental competence of preimplantation mouse embryos against pH fluctuations.

The pathophysiology of pituitary adenomas. The pathogenesis of tumour formation in the anterior pituitary has been intensively studied, but the causative mechanisms involved in pituitary cell transformation and tumourigenesis remain elusive. Most pituitary tumours are sporadic, but some arise as a component of genetic syndromes such as the McCune-Albright syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, Carney complex and, the most recently described, a MEN1-like phenotype (MEN4) and pituitary adenoma predisposition syndromes. Some specific genes have been identified that predispose to pituitary neoplasia (GNAS, MEN1, PRKAR1A, CDKN1B and AIP), but these are rarely involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic tumours. Mutations of tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes, as seen in more common cancers, do not seem to play an important role in the great majority of pituitary adenomas. The pituitary tumour transforming gene (PTTG; securin) was the first transforming gene found to be highly expressed in pituitary tumour cells, and seems to play an important role in the process of oncogenesis. Many tumour suppressor genes, especially those involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, are under-expressed, most often by epigenetic modulation - usually promoter hypermethylation - but the regulator of these co-ordinated series of methylations is also unclear. Cell signalling abnormalities have been identified in pituitary tumours, but their genetic basis is unknown. Both Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are over-expressed and/or over-activated in pituitary tumours: these pathways share a common root, including initial activation related to the tyrosine kinase receptor, and we speculate that a change to these receptors or their relationship to membrane matrix-related proteins may be an early event in pituitary tumourigenesis.

Imaging the future of stroke: I. Ischemia. Envisioning the future of stroke appears daunting considering the milestones already achieved in stroke imaging. A historical perspective on the developments in stroke care provides a striking narrative of how imaging has transformed diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Multimodal imaging techniques such as CT and MRI, incorporating parenchymal depictions, illustration of the vasculature, and perfusion data, can provide a wealth of information regarding ischemic pathophysiology. Key elements of ischemic pathophysiology depicted with imaging include vascular occlusion, compensatory collateral flow, resultant hemodynamic conditions that reflect these sources of blood flow, and the neurovascular injury that ensues. The mantra of "time is brain" has been perpetuated, but this does not provide an entirely accurate reflection of ischemic pathophysiology and imaging insight shows far more than time alone. Maximizing the potential of perfusion imaging will continue to expand the nascent concept that cerebral ischemia may be completely reversible in certain scenarios. Novel modalities provide a fertile ground for discovery of therapeutic targets and the potential to assess effects of promising strategies. Beyond clinical trials, imaging has become a requisite component of the neurological examination enabling tailored stroke therapy with the use of detailed neuroimaging modalities. In this first article on ischemia, the focus is on the most recent imaging advances and exploring aspects of cerebral ischemia where imaging may yield additional therapeutic strategies. A subsequent article will review recent and anticipated imaging advances in hemorrhage. These thematic overviews underscore that imaging will undoubtedly continue to dramatically shape the future of stroke.

Parental combat injury and early child development: a conceptual model for differentiating effects of visible and invisible injuries. The injuries (physical and emotional) sustained by service members during combat influence all members of a family system. This review used a systemic framework to conceptualize the direct and indirect effects of a service member's injury on family functioning, with a specific focus on young children. Using a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesize the health research literature from a variety of disciplines, this review makes relevant linkages to health care professionals working with injured veterans. Studies were included that examined how family functioning (psychological and physical) is impacted by parental illness; parental injury; and posttraumatic stress disorder. The synthesis of literature led to the development of a heuristic model that illustrates both direct and indirect effects of parental injury on family functioning and the development of young children. It further illustrates the contextual factors or moderating variables that buffer detrimental effects and promote family resilience. This model can be a foundation for future research, intervention, and policy.


Salt affects plant Cd-stress responses by modulating growth and Cd accumulation.

A rapid, valid and inexpensive assay for measuring epiphyseal plates in mouse tibia. One of the most accurate indices of changes in somatic tissue growth rate in rodents is the width of tibial epiphyseal plates as unlike most mammals, rodent growth plates never ossify. Unfortunately, the original procedure to measure tibial epiphyseal plate width (TEPW) was developed for rats and yields poor results with mice. This paper demonstrates a simple method for silver staining growth plates that can be used to inexpensively and quickly measure the TEPW of mice. Poor visualization due to overstaining and the shattering of growth plates necessitated several revisions to the original protocol. These include exposing the growth plate prior to acetone dehydration, reducing the silver nitrate concentration from 2% to 1.5% and staining time from 2 min to 10 s and finally, the use of reflective light rather than transmissive light when imaging. The optimized protocol was then validated by generating an age-dependent TEPW growth curve that matched changes in tibia length. A total of 120 tibias were processed in a combined time of less than one day and for less than $30. By contrast, histological processing in the university's core facility would have cost $1440 and taken approximately three weeks. Thus, the revised protocol is vastly more cost effective, reliable and can be performed considerably quicker with minimal training.

Intermolecular interactions during complex coacervation of pea protein isolate and gum arabic. The nature of intermolecular interactions during complexation between pea protein isolate (PPI) and gum arabic (GA) was investigated as a function of pH (4.30-2.40) by turbidimetric analysis and confocal scanning microscopy in the presence of destabilizing agents (100 mM NaCl or 100 mM urea) and at different temperatures (6-60 degrees C). Complex formation followed two pH-dependent structure-forming events associated with the formation of soluble and insoluble complexes and involved interactions between GA and PPI aggregates. Complex formation was driven by electrostatic attractive forces between complementary charged biopolymers, with secondary stabilization by hydrogen bonding. Hydrophobic interactions were found to enhance complex stability at lower pH (pH 3.10), but not with its formation.

Isolation and characterization of a very virulent Infectious bursal disease virus from turkey. Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious disease of chickens caused by Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). In turkeys, however, infection with classical virulent IBDV strains lead only to subclinical forms of the disease. We attempted to isolate IBDV from the bursa of turkey and characterize it. Amplification of a 743-bp fragment of VP2 gene by RT-PCR and restriction analysis of the product showed a pattern compatible with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV). Comparison of the sequence of this isolate with those of other IBDVs and phylogenetic analysis confirmed very virulent nature of the isolate. This is the first report on the isolation of vvIBDV from turkey in Iran.

Climate change epidemiology: methodological challenges. Climate change is now thought to be unequivocal, while its potential effects on global and public health cannot be ignored. However, the complexities of the causal webs, the dynamics of the interactions and unpredictability mean that climate change presents new challenges to epidemiology and magnifies existing methodological problems. This article reviews a number of such challenges, including topics such as exposure assessment, bias, confounding, causal complexities and uncertainties, with examples and recommendations provided where appropriate. Hence, epidemiology must continue to adapt by developing new approaches and the integration of other disciplines such as geography and climatology, with an emphasis on informing policy-making and disseminating knowledge beyond the field.

[Soluble expression, purification and immunoreactive identification of mouse zona pellucida 3 fusion protein]. Mammalian zona pellucida 3(ZP3) plays an important role in the induction of capacitating sperm acrosome reaction. In this study, we obtained the soluble mZP3 fusion protein and identified its immunoreactivity. mZP3 cDNA was cloned into plasmid pMAL-p2x, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. To get the soluble mZP3 fusion protein, we tried to optimize the expression conditions, including additives, IPTG concentrations, temperatures and induction duration. Then, Western blotting and ELISA were used to identify the immunoreactivity of the purified protein. Based on the optimization experiments, we concluded that the best soluble expression conditions for the mZP3 fusion protein involved incubation to an A600 of 0.6, addition of glucose to a final concentration of 0.02 mol/L, addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.6 mmol/L and then further incubation for 4 h at 25 degrees C. Western blotting and ELISA showed that the mZP3 fusion protein retained immunoreactivity. The fusion protein can be used as solubility antigens for developing the immunocontraception vaccines of mZP3 and detecting the immune effects of the vaccine.

Transrectal ultrasound-guided implantation of Adjustable Continence Therapy (ProACT): surgical technique and clinical results after a mean follow-up of 2 years. Treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after radical prostatectomy (RP) with the male Adjustable Continence Therapy (ProACT) system, implanted using fluoroscopy for guidance, has been described with promising clinical results. This retrospective study aims to describe the surgical technique in detail and to evaluate the continence recovery and complication rate of a cohort of male patients with SUI after RP. All patients were treated with a modified technique that uses transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guidance and that may be performed under local anaesthesia. Between June 2005 and March 2009, we operated on 79 consecutive patients with post-RP urodynamic intrinsic sphincter deficiency. ProACT system implantation was performed with TRUS guidance under general or local anaesthesia. Perioperative data and adverse events were recorded in all patients. Outcome data (24-h pad test, number of pads per day (PPD) used by patients, a validated incontinence quality of life questionnaire) were analysed in the 62 of 79 patients who completed the postoperative system adjustments. In this group of patients, the mean follow-up is 25 mo. According to the 24-h pad test and the mean number of PPD used, 41 patients were dry (66.1%), 16 patients improved (25.8%), and 5 patients failed treatment (8%). The dry rate in previously irradiated patients was 35.7%. Complications included intraoperative bladder perforations (2 of 79; 2.5%), transient urinary retention (1 of 79; 1.2%), migrations (3 of 79; 3.8%), and erosions (2 of 79; 2.5%). According to the degree of incontinence, the dry rate in patients with mild, moderate, and severe incontinence was, respectively, 85%, 63.6%, and 33.3%. TRUS guidance for ProACT implantation results in success and complication rates that compare favourably with published data using fluoroscopy for guidance. Previous radiotherapy and severe incontinence seem to be a relative contraindication. Larger series and longer follow-up are progressing to establish long-term efficacy.

Extreme hyperalphalipoproteinaemia in a patient with a solitary paraspinal lipoma. Increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (hyperalphalipoproteinaemia; HALP) is commonly genetic, but may have secondary causes. An association between multiple lipomatosis and HALP has been reported; however, the mechanism for this is unclear. We report the case of a 69-year-old Cook Island woman with extreme HALP who presented with a large paraspinal lipoma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no other lipomas. She had the metabolic syndrome, a family history suggestive of lipomas and was on lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy. Her plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was 4.9 mmol/L (>95th percentile for age and sex) and was not explained by typical secondary causes. HDL(2) and HDL(3) subfractions were increased, with HDL(2) predominance. The excised lipoma histology demonstrated benign tissue and normal karyotype. Postoperative lipid profiles showed no change in HDL-cholesterol concentrations. In summary, we report a case of extreme HALP that persisted after excision of a solitary paraspinal lipoma.

L-type calcium channel blockers reverse docetaxel and vincristine-induced multidrug resistance independent of ABCB1 expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs significantly impedes chemotherapeutic treatment. The purpose of this study is to characterize docetaxel (DOC) or vincristine (VCR) selected A549 and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) sublines that exhibit MDR phenotypes and followed by re-sensitization study. Although all drug resistant sublines showed cross-resistance to DOC, VCR, and doxorubicin (DXR), the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter B1 (ABCB1) gene was found to be strongly induced in DOC but not in VCR resistant A549 sublines by quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In DOC and VCR resistant H1299 sublines, moderate expression of ABCB1 was detected. The levels of ABCB1 protein and efflux activities were further examined by immunoblotting and rhodamin-123 staining assay. The results showed that both ABC and non-ABC mediated MDR are existed. Furthermore, verapamil (VER), an inhibitor of ABCB1 and an L-type calcium channel blocker, is capable of reversing the resistance in all drug-resistant sublines independent of ABCB1 expression. Importantly, VER only sensitizes resistant sublines but has no effect on parental cancer cells. Other L-type calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (DIL) and nifedipine (NIF), also sensitize MDR sublines without interfering with ABCB1 activity but with lower efficacy than VER. Our data showed that in addition to ABCB1, calcium channel activity may play a crucial role in DOC- and VCR-acquired MDR. Therefore, inhibition of calcium influx may provide a new target to modulate MDR in chemotherapy.

The contemporary uses of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms: a qualitative exploratory study carried out in France. This qualitative research implemented in France between 2004 and 2007 is based on 30 in-depth interviews carried out with individuals who consumed hallucinogenic plants or mushrooms at least six times during the year preceding the interview. The interviews were recorded, retranscribed, and an analysis of their content applied for the textual data. The study focuses on drug users and the meanings they attach to their drug use. These meanings involve three different representations of the drugs: "enchanting plants," "disorientation plants," and "visionary plants."

Highly fluorous complexes of ruthenium and osmium and their solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide. A series of ruthenium and osmium complexes containing highly fluorous diphosphine ligands (F)P(wedge)P(F) = (F(13)C(6)C(6)H(4)-p)(2)P(CH(2))(2)P(p-C(6)H(4)C(6)F(13))(2) (dfppe) and (F(13)C(6)C(6)H(4)-p)(2)P(CH(2))(3)P(p-C(6)H(4)C(6)F(13))(2) (dfppp) has been prepared. The fluorous diphosphine ligands incorporate four C(6)F(13) "fluoro-ponytails", and these have been effective in solubilizing the complexes in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). Precise solubility measurements in scCO(2) were performed for some of the complexes. The new complexes [MX(2)((F)P(wedge)P(F))(2)] and [MX((F)P(wedge)P(F))(eta-C(5)H(5))], M = Ru, Os, X = Cl, Br, have been characterized by a number of spectroscopic techniques and their electrochemical properties measured, three of the ruthenium complexes also being characterized by single-crystal X-ray studies. The noncovalent interactions observed in the X-ray structures have been analyzed by the Hirshfeld surface approach, putting them on a more solid footing. The fluorinated complexes show significantly different solvation properties from those of the analogous unfluorinated compounds, particularly with respect to their behavior in common organic solvents and their good scCO(2) solubility.

Crop and non-crop productivity in a traditional maize agroecosystem of the highland of Mexico. In Mexico, the traditional maize cultivation system has resisted intensification attempts for many decades in some areas, even in some well-connected regions of the temperate highlands. We suggest that this is due to economics. The total useful biomass of several fields in Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, are evaluated for productivity and costs. Maize grain production is low (1.5 t ha(-1)) and does not cover costs. However, maize stover demands a relatively high price. If it included, a profit is possible (about 110 US $ ha(-1)). We show that non-crop production (weeds for food and forage) potentially has a higher value than the crop. It is only partially used, as there are constraints on animal husbandry, but it diversifies production and plays a role as a back-up system in case of crop failure. The diversified system described is economically rational under current conditions and labor costs. It is also stable, low-input and ecologically benign, and should be recognized as an important example of integrated agriculture, though some improvements could be investigated.

Secretions from seminal vesicles lack characteristic markers for prostasomes. Prostasomes are suggested to be produced in the prostate gland. Although biochemical studies support this, some immunohistochemical findings indicate that also the seminal vesicles could be a source of prostasomes. Therefore, we have compared the secretion of the vesicles with that of the prostate using biochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Ultracentrifuged pellets of substance from seminal vesicle secretions were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and flow cytometry. The secretory cells of the seminal vesicles were examined with transmission electron microscopy. These findings were then compared with published results from similar studies of the prostate secretory cells. In SDS-PAGE, the seminal vesicle pellets lacked the three prostasome-characteristic CD-markers, namely CD10, CD13, and CD26, but expressed two proteins of about 55 kDa and 70 kDa, corresponding to clusterin and heat shock protein (HSP70). Flow cytometry showed the presence of secretion particles in the seminal pellet, although of a smaller size than that of the prostasomes. Electron microscopy of the luminal part of the cells in the seminal vesicles demonstrated many secretion granules, each enclosed in a vesicle with a size of about 1 microm. Pelleted seminal vesicle secretion is different to prostate secretion in several ways. No prostasome characteristics were detected in the pelleted seminal vesicle secretion.

Human skeletal muscle drug transporters determine local exposure and toxicity of statins. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are important drugs used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. Interindividual differences in the activities of hepatic membrane drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are known to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics and risk for myopathy. Interestingly, little is known regarding the molecular determinants of statin distribution into skeletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. We sought to identify statin transporters in human skeletal muscle and determine their impact on statin toxicity in vitro. We demonstrate that the uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) and the efflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates of these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity.


DNA recognition by thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors: 3,4,5 rule modified.

Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1) viruses detected in Europe during season 2007-8 had epidemiologic and clinical characteristics similar to co-circulating susceptible A(H1N1) viruses. During the 2007-08 influenza season, high levels of oseltamivir resistance were detected among influenza A(H1N1) viruses ina number of European countries. We used surveillance data to describe influenza A(H1N1) cases for whom antiviral resistance testing was performed. We pooled data from national studies to identify possible risk factors for infection with a resistant virus and to ascertain whether such infections led to influenza illness of different severity. Information on demographic and clinical variables was obtained from patients or their physicians. Odds ratios for infection with an oseltamivir resistant virus and relative risks for developing certain clinical outcomes were computed and adjusted through multivariable analysis. Overall, 727 (24.3%) of 2,992 tested influenza A(H1N1) viruses from 22 of 30 European countries were oseltamivir-resistant. Levels of resistance ranged from 1% in Italy to 67% in Norway. Five countries provided detailed case-based data on 373 oseltamivir resistant and 796 susceptible cases. By multivariable analysis, none of the analysed factors was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection with anoseltamivir-resistant virus. Similarly, infection with an oseltamivir-resistant virus was not significantly associated with a different risk of pneumonia, hospitalisation or any clinical complication. The large-scale emergence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses in Europe calls for a review of guidelines for influenza treatment.


Monitoring bacterial indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot waste by real-time PCR.

A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations. Mindfulness meditation (MM) practices constitute an important group of meditative practices that have received growing attention. The aim of the present paper was to systematically review current evidence on the neurobiological changes and clinical benefits related to MM practice in psychiatric disorders, in physical illnesses and in healthy subjects. A literature search was undertaken using Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane collaboration database and references of retrieved articles. Controlled and cross-sectional studies with controls published in English up to November 2008 were included. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed a significant increase in alpha and theta activity during meditation. Neuroimaging studies showed that MM practice activates the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and that long-term meditation practice is associated with an enhancement of cerebral areas related to attention. From a clinical viewpoint, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown efficacy for many psychiatric and physical conditions and also for healthy subjects, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is mainly efficacious in reducing relapses of depression in patients with three or more episodes, Zen meditation significantly reduces blood pressure and Vipassana meditation shows efficacy in reducing alcohol and substance abuse in prisoners. However, given the low-quality designs of current studies it is difficult to establish whether clinical outcomes are due to specific or non-specific effects of MM. Despite encouraging findings, several limitations affect current studies. Suggestions are given for future research based on better designed methodology and for future directions of investigation.

[Transient diplopia]. Transient binocular diplopia is a frequent complaint in an everyday ophthalmic practice. Since the objective clinical examination is most often within normal limits between the diplopia attacks, a thorough history is mandatory to determine the possible causes and precipitating factors. Although transient diplopia can herald visual or even life-threatening associated conditions, it is most often related to benign diseases. An appropriate work-up depends on the history and the clinical evaluation, targeting specific underlying causes.

[The moderating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between public self-consciousness, social anxiety and exhibitionism in Japan and South Korea]. This study examined the moderating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between public self-consciousness and social anxiety, and on the relationship between public self-consciousness and exhibitionism in Japan and South Korea. The participants were 213 university students in Japan and 234 university students in Korea. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that self-esteem was a moderator of the relationship between public self-consciousness and social anxiety and of the relationship between public self-consciousness and exhibitionism in Korea, but not in Japan. In Korea, public self-consciousness was related to social anxiety for people with low self-esteem, while for people with high self-esteem, public self-consciousness was related to exhibitionism.

Inherited thrombophilia in infertile women: implication in unexplained infertility. Many studies evaluating a possible relationship between inherited thrombophilia and the etiology of unexplained infertility have been performed recently. No significant difference in the prevalence of three genetic mutations associated with the increased risk of thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] C677 T) was found in 100 infertile women with unexplained infertility when compared with 200 control fertile women without an infertility history.

A new transient sham TENS device allows for investigator blinding while delivering a true placebo treatment. This study compared a new transient sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) that delivers current for 45 seconds to an inactive sham and active TENS to determine the degree of blinding and influence on pain reduction. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPT), heat-pain thresholds (HPT), and pain intensities to tonic heat and pressure were measured in 69 healthy adults before and after randomization. Allocation investigators and subjects were asked to identify the treatment administered. The transient sham blinded investigators 100% of the time and 40% of subjects compared to the inactive sham that blinded investigators 0% of the time and 21% of subjects. Investigators and subjects were blinded only 7% and 13% of the time, respectively, with active TENS. Neither placebo treatment resulted in significant changes in PPT, HPT, or pain intensities. Subjects using higher active TENS amplitudes (> or =17 mAs) had significantly higher PPTs and lower pain intensities to tonic pressure than subjects using lower amplitudes (<17 mAs). HPTs and pain intensities to tonic heat were not significantly changed. The transient TENS completely blinds investigators to treatment and does not reduce pain, thereby providing a true placebo treatment. This article presents the benefits of a new transient sham TENS device for use in prospective, randomized, clinical trials. This device facilitates blinding of subjects and investigators to eliminate expectation bias and determine the true efficacy of TENS for use in clinical populations.

Degradation of TDP-43 and its pathogenic form by autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is a nuclear protein functioning in the regulation of transcription and mRNA splicing. TDP-43 is accumulated in ubiquitinated inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseased brains. However, the pathways involved in the clearance of TDP-43 and its pathogenic form (TDP-25), a truncated form of TDP-43, are still not elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that the protein levels of TDP-43 and TDP-25 were increased in cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, or an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, whereas, they were decreased in cells treated with an enhancer of autophagy, trehalose. Furthermore, more protein level changes of TDP-25 than TDP-43 were observed in cells treated with above inhibitors or enhancer. Thus, our data suggest that TDP-43 and TDP-25 are degraded by both proteasome and autophagy with TDP-25 being more regulated.

High-throughput resequencing in the diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutations using oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays. Breast cancer is the most frequent form of carcinoma in European females (incidence 65 per 100,000). In about 10% of all cases, pedigree analysis predicts a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) to be causative for the disease. Frequently, mutations in two genes, BRCA1 (Chr. 17q21) and BRCA2 (Chr. 13q12), are associated with HBOC. In females, mutations in these genes result in a lifetime risk of 80-85% for breast cancer and 54% (BRCA1) or 23% (BRCA2) for ovarian cancer. Current genetic diagnostic tools for BRCA1 and BRCA2 remain laborious and expensive. Here, we present the first oligonucleotide resequencing microarray covering the complete coding sequence of both genes. In total, 36 previously characterized DNAs were resequenced; all 11 patients with single-nucleotide mutations and, due to a special mutational design, eight patients with heterozygous deletions were detected correctly. In total, 47 different single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found. A newly developed software, SeqC, reduced the number of ambiguous calls with the help of a statistical module comparing the acquired data to an online-database. SeqC improved the average call rate to 99% (GSeq: 97%) and reduced time and efforts for manual analysis. SeqC confirmed the results obtained by GSeq and found an additional 33 sequences changes representing 14 SNVs. In total, 945 kb were screened and the overall turnaround time for each patient took approximately 3 days, including analysis.

Mumps outbreak - New York, New Jersey, Quebec, 2009. Mumps is a vaccine-preventable viral infection characterized by fever and inflammation of the salivary glands and whose complications include orchitis, deafness, and meningo-encephalitis. In August 2009, CDC was notified of the onset of an outbreak of mumps in a summer camp in Sullivan County, New York. The outbreak has spread and gradually increased in size and is now the largest U.S. mumps outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced a resurgence of mumps with 6,584 reported cases. On August 18, public health departments in Sullivan County, New York state, and CDC began an investigation into the mumps outbreak, later joined by departments in New York City and other locales. As of October 30, a total of 179 confirmed or probable cases had been identified from multiple locations in New York and New Jersey, and an additional 15 cases had been reported from Canada. The outbreak primarily has affected members of a tradition-observant religious community; median age of the patients is 14 years, and 83% are male. Three persons have been hospitalized. Although little transmission has occurred outside the Jewish community, mumps can spread rapidly in congregate settings such as colleges and schools; therefore, public health officials and clinicians should heighten surveillance for mumps and ensure that children and adults are appropriately vaccinated.

Radiologic evaluation of the trachea. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) allows for an accurate, noninvasive means of evaluating tracheal anatomy and pathology. The integration of information obtained from axial images, multiplanar reformats and 3-D rendering enables precise anatomical localization of tracheal pathology, provides detailed information on surrounding structures, aids in surgical planning, and allows for assessment of posttreatment response. Although bronchoscopy remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of tracheal pathology, the proper utilization of radiologic imaging can allow for improved patient care.

Development of K(+) and Na(+) conductances in rodent postnatal semicircular canal type I hair cells. The rodent vestibular system is immature at birth. During the first postnatal week, vestibular type I and type II hair cells start to acquire their characteristic morphology and afferent innervation. We have studied postnatal changes in the membrane properties of type I hair cells acutely isolated from the semicircular canals (SCC) of gerbils and rats using whole cell patch clamp and report for the first time developmental changes in ionic conductances in these cells. At postnatal day (P) 5 immature hair cells expressed a delayed rectifier K(+) conductance (G(DR)) which activated at potentials above approximately -50 mV in both species. Hair cells also expressed a transient Na(+) conductance (G(Na)) with a mean half-inactivation of approximately -90 mV. At P6 in rat and P7 in gerbil, a low-voltage activated K(+) conductance (G(K,L)) was first observed and conferred a low-input resistance, typical of adult type I hair cells, on SCC type I hair cells. G(K,L) expression in hair cells increased markedly during the second postnatal week and was present in all rat type I hair cells by P14. In gerbil hair cells, G(K,L) appeared later and was present in all type I hair cells by P19. During the third postnatal week, G(Na) expression declined and was absent by the fourth postnatal week in rat and the sixth postnatal week in gerbils. Understanding the ionic changes associated with hair cell maturation could help elucidate development and regeneration mechanisms in the inner ear.

Feasibility of introducing genetic services in the National Family Welfare Programme in India. Genetic factors could play an important role in the outcome of pregnancy. This study was carried out to identify risk factors that result in adverse pregnancy outcome and to develop a system of screening and referral to a tertiary hospital equipped with facilities for diagnosis and management of such high risk pregnancies. District level hospitals close to the participating centers e.g. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, BJ Medical College, Pune, St. John Medical College, Bangalore and Genetic Research Center, (ICMR), Mumbai, were selected. Pregnant women < 28 wk gestation attending antenatal OPD of selected district hospitals were included. All eligible women who gave consent for participation in the study, were screened using a predesigned proforma based on family history, past pregnancy history, history of genetic disease/ congenital malformation in previous child and history of present pregnancy. Pregnancy outcome was noted. There was statistically significant difference in the outcome of pregnancy in the following groups: (i) past pregnancy history of 3 or more spontaneous abortions (RR= 3.9; CI=1.17-9.02); (ii) still birth (RR= 2.5; CI= 1.41-4.48); (iii) previous child with neurol tube defect (NTD) (RR=2.3; CI= 1.22- 4.60); and (iv) previous child with congenital malformation (RR=2.2; CI = 1.11- 4.35). A sample questionnaire may be used for screening of pregnant women at risk of having and adverse outcome. Also screening of pregnant women for thalassaemia carrier state and maternal serum a-foetoprotein (AFP) for NTD may be useful.
