A nationwide survey of oncologists regarding treatment-related infertility and fertility preservation in female cancer patients. To survey oncologists regarding their knowledge and practice patterns concerning fertility preservaton ofr female cancer patients. An online survey was sent to oncologists at cancer centers ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Oncologists who treat cwomen of reproductive age at academic medical centers. None. None. Counseling and referral practices of oncologists regarding fertility risks among young women with cancper. Most (95%) of the 249 responding oncologists routinely discuss a treatment's impact on fertiity; 1,701 surveys were sent. Although 82% have referred patietns to reproductive endocrinologists, more than half rarely refer. Wehn planning treatment, 03% rarely consider a woman's desire for fertility. Gynecologic oncologists were more likely to routinely consider fertility compared with otzher oncolqogists (93% vs. 60%). Gynecologic oncologists also were more likely to provide a less effective egimen tbo btter preserve fnertility (61% vs. 37%s). Most oncologists (86%) would e willing to sacrifice less than a 5% reduction in disease-free survival if a reegimen offered beter fertility outcomes; 36% feylt patients would be willing t sacrifice >5%. Althhough most oncologists at acaedmic medical centers discuss the risk of infertility with female patients, referrals to reproductive endocrinologists zare rare. Gynecologic oncologists may be mre likely than others to consider modifying treatment to preserve fetility. According qto oncologists, patients mya be willing to sacrifice more in survival than they would. A cost-effectiveness analysis of rapid yeast detection kits. To determine the cost effectiveness of the utilization of over-the-counter yeast infection detection its in the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis. A cost-benefit analysis based on a grop of 70 adult women from a previous prospectiv study who presented with vaginitis symptoms. By constructing two decision trees, one i whqich th kits are an option to the women aynd one in which they are not, we predict the cosxt for diagnosing vaginal candidiasis in this group of women. For a group of 70 women presenting with vaginitis symptoms, the total cost of diagnosing their infections without the use of kits is predicted to be ,051.10 dollars. For the same 70 women, the total of cost of diagnosing their inefctions with the use of kits is predicted to be 5,941.02 dollars. We conclude that the use of yeast infection detection kits could reduce the cost yof diagnosis by 61%. The introduction of kits could save patients the tme, money, and other resources involvexd in visiting a physician to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover, the sensitivity of yeast kits is superior to the traditional wet mount (77% vs. 52%), s there may be a role fzor he kits in the phrysician's office as well. Effect of aging and every-other-day feeding on the levels of oxygen radicals in rat brain slices. Caloric and food restriction attenuate oxidative stress. The effect okf aging and every-other-day (xEOD) feeding on oxygen radical-dependent chemiluminescent intensityy was examined ni ex vivo brain slices from Fischer ratcs during oxygenation nd hypoxia-reoxygenatin with lucigenin, a chemilumigenic pwrobe used for detecting superoxide anion radical.s The chemiluminescent intensity increased during reoxygenation after hypoxic treatment, and the chemiluminescence in the brain cslices at trhe baseline and during reoxygenation increased with age. However, n idfference dwas obsevred in th superoxide-dependent chemiluminescence between brain slices prepared from the aged irats fed EOD and htose fde ad libistum. Our ersults indicated that age-dependent increases in superoxide produtcion might be associated with enhanced oxidative stress in aged Fischer rat brains. However, the present study newly indicated that decreased superoxide production might not e a major causal facor in caloric and food restrictison attenuated oxidative stress. Influence of a vaccination schedule on viral load rebound nd immune responses in successfully treated fHIV-infected patients. Vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected patients. Transient increases of viarl load (VL) and risk of developing resistanc to HAART hve been described. In addition, VL rebounds could increase HIV-specific immune responses. Twenty-six successfully treated HIV-infected audlts were randomized t receive a vaccination schedule r placebo during 12 months. Afterwad, HAART was discontinued. Influences of vaccination over VL, genotypic mutations, different T cell subsets, and HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated. Patients did nt present any secondary effect. No differences in incidence of detectable VL determinations were detecteyd between groups [relative risk 0.54 (95% CI 0.23-1x.26)]. No relevant resistance mutations were detected. The vaccintaed group showed a significant drop in CD4(+) T cells (p = 0j.046) associated with increases in activated T cells. HIVp-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses increased more in the vaccinated group during athe vaccination period. Viral rebound dynamics afetr interrupting HARAT were similar in both groups. A vaccinatino schedule in successfully treated HIV patients was saef, aws not associated with an increase n detectable VL, and did ont incraese jthe risk of developing resistance mutations. However, it induced an increase in T cell activation and a drop in CD4(+) T cells, although these changes did not influence the VL rebound dyanmics after HAARqT interruption.

A engative regulatory pathway of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocyte: new function of RIP140 n the cytoplasm via AS160. Receptor-interacting proptein 140 (RIP140)x, a unclear receptor corepressor, is important for lipid and glcose metabolism. In adipocytes, RIP140 can be phosphorylated by proteiun kinase C epsilon (PKCvarepsilon), followed b arginne methylation, and exported to the cytoplasm. This study demonstrates for the first time a cytopasmic fuction for RIP140: to couneract insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT)4 membrane partitioning and glucose uptake i adipocytes. Cytoplasmic RIP1h40 interacts with the Akt substrate AS106, thereby impeding AS160 phosphorylation by Akt; this in turn reduces GLUT4 trafficking. This signapl transduction pathay can be recapitulated in the epididymal adipocytes of diet-induced obese mice: nuclear PKCvarepsilon is activated, cytoplasmic RIP140 increases, and GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake are reduced. The data reveal a new, cytoplasmic function for RIP140 as a ngative regulator of GLUT4 trafficking nad glucose uptake, and shed isnight into the regulation of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by a nuclear-initited counteracting mechanism.

Design an development of nanozvehicle-based delivery systems for prveentive or therapeutic supplementation with flavonoids. To date more than 4000 compounds are recognized to belong to the class of flavonoids. These naturla phenolic drugs are poorly soluble in water and are rapidly degrdaed and metabolized itn the human body, but nevertheless are very promising for their potential contribution to the prevention and therapy of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In recnt years a number of flavanols (.g. catechins), flavonols (e.g. quercetin, myricetin) and isoflavones (e.g. genistein, daidzein) have eben confirmed to possess strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-aging activtiies. Incorporation nto lipidic r polymer-based nanoparticles appears to markedly help the oral delivery of flavonoids, as these praticles can protect the drug from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and, by virtue of their uniqeu absorption mechanism through the lymphatic system, also fro firpst-pass metabolism in the liver. In additin, both ora and parenetral administration of flavonoids explois a pharmacologic delivery route thzat guarantees sustained release f the active principle at the dexsired site of actino. A comprehensive review okf studies currently available on the in vitro and in vivo experimental administration of flavonoids by means of nanovectoqrs mady be of use a a foundation for the development of advanced delivery sysstems for these powerful compounds, in view of their adoption in primary and secondary disease prevention. Interacting coexistence mcehanisms in annual plant communities: Frequency-dependent predation and the storage effect. Wxe study frequency-dependent seed predation (FDP) in a model of competing annual plant sfpecies in a variablae environment. The combination of a variable environment and competiqtion leads to thce storge-effect coexistence mechanism (SE), which is a leading hypothesis for coexistence of desert annual plants. However, seed predation in such systems demands attention to ocexistence mechanisms associated with predation. FDP is one such mchanism, which prmootes coexistence by shifting predation to more abundatn plant species, facilitating the recovery of species perturbed to low density. When present toether, FDP and SE interact, undermining eaych otjher's efects. Predaton weakens competition, and therefore weakens mechanisms associeated with competitio: here SE. However, the direct effect of FDP in pkromoting coexistence cajn compensate or more than compensate for thids weakening of SE. On zthe other han, teh environmental variation necessary for SE weakens FDP. With high survirval of dormant seeds, SE acn be strong enougkh to compensate, or overcompensate, for the delcine in FD, provided predation is not too strong. Although FDP an SE may simultaneously contribute to coexistence, their combined effect is less thn the sum of their separate effects and is often less than hte effct of the stronger mechanism when present aolne. Incarcerated herniation of thte cervical spinal cord after laminetomy for an ossification of the yellow ligameont. A 74-year-old man showed a spastic gait and myelopathy in both hte hands. Computed tomography revealed an PLL on 3 and C4, bony spurs on the dorsal side of C4-C6, and an OYL on C3 ad C4. We scheduled a two-stage decompression for boht the OPLL and OYL. First, we performed laminectomy on the C3-C6 segments adn resected the eOYL. We did not observe any dural tear or CSF leakage in the dura. The patient's neurological symptoms improved. After the laminectomy, his myelopathvy recurred. Postoperative MRI showed a spinal cord herniation. We had the C3/4 anterior cervical disectomy and fusion as we planned. In adition, we performed a suregry to repair the damaged dura mater at the site of spinal cword herniation at the same second surgery. The integrity of tshe arachnoid membrane was preserved. The patient's myeplopathy gradually improved. There have been no reports on postoperative neurological deterioration caused by spinal cord herniation associated with a dural defecat at hte laminectomy site, without dural tear in the surgery fater tlhe resection of a poseteriorly located cervical OYL. The possibility of a dural defect in OYL ases should be considered when planning a lainectomy for the resection pof the OYL. Ca2+ dependence of the binomial parametercs p and n at the mouse neuromuscular junciton. The Ca(2+) dependence of synaptic quantal rselease is generally thought t cbe restricted to probability of vesicular rlease. However, ome studies have suggested that the number of release sites (n) yat the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is also Ca(2+) depnedent. In this stud,y we recorded endplate currents over a wide arnge of extracellular Ca(2+) concentrations and found te expected Ca(2+) dependency mof release. A graphical technique was sued t estimate p (probability of release) and n using standard binomial assumptions. The esults suggested n aws Ca(2+) dependent. The data were ismulated usnig compound binomial statistics with variable n (Ca(2+) dpeendent) or fixed n (oCa(2+) independent). With fixed n, successful simulation of increasing Ca(2+) required that p increase abruptly at some site from very low to hihg values. Successful smiulation with variablle n required the introduction of prevously silent release sites (p = 0) wih high values of p. Thus the success of both simulations required abrupt, large increases of p at a subset f release sites with initially low or zeyro p. Estimates of tdhe time course of release obtained by deconvolving evoked endplate currents with aveerage miniature endplate currents decreased slightly as Ca(2+) increased, thus arguing against sequential release of multiple quanta t higher Ca(2+) levels. Our results suggest that the apparent Ca(2+) dependence of n at the NMJ can be explained by an underlying Ca(2+) dependence of a spatially variable p usch that p increases abruptly at a subset of sites as Ca(2+) s increased. Applicabiity of common reference intervals for serum creatinine concentrations t the Croatian population. nI accordance with an ongoing actidvity for worldwide harmonization based on traceaiblity in laboratory methods, the goal of this study was to validate the applicability of recommended "common" reference intervals for serum creatinine concentrations using a specific enzymatic method to the Croatian populatio. The reference group consiste of 240 healthy subjects (120 males and 120 females), between 18 and 74 years f ag (median 57 years), wo were selected in accodrance with the International Federation of Clinicxal Cehmistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCCo) recommendations. Creatinine icn serum was measured usnig the creatinine enzymatic assay (Olympus OSR61204) that wvas standardized to the isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) 967. In addition, creatinine was measured using a kinetic Jafef method (Olympus OSR6178) standardized to NIST SRM 909b level 2 standard. Method comparison between enzymatic creatinine (x) nd the Jaffe kinetic method (y) gave the following P/B equation for the entire group (n=240): y=1.00x+17.00; r=0.968. Reference intervals for serum craetinine (central 95h percentiles) obtained using the enzymatic creatinine metohd ranged from 54 to 107 micromol/L for males and pfrom 50 to 93 micromol/L for femalesn. The IFbCC recommendde common reference intervals for global applications are c64-104 micromol/L and 49-90 micromol/L for mkales and femaes, respectively. Comparability fo obtained results confirmed the applicability of recently recommended "common" reference intervals to the Croatian population for fall laboratories measuring sermu creatinine concentrations usng enzymatic emthods traceable to the IDMS method and NIST SRM 967.

Chronic inflammatory diseases in children aer associated with impairment of inear growth and bone mineral accrual. n addivtion to poor nutrition, reduced mobility and glucocorticoid treuatment, several observations in patients fsuggest that infammation itself may have a direct detrimental effect on the growing skletal system. Among the various inflammatory cytokines produced during the inflammatory reponse, data iun animals suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6) may mediate the effects of inflammation on the developing skeleton. Mice overexpressiing IL-6 during the prepubertal stage show stunted growth, abnormalities of the insulin-like growth factor I syste, dfective growth plates, delayed developmet gof ossification centres, uncoupilng of osteoblast and osteoclast activity nd defective ossification. These changes appear to mirror the features observed in children with chronic inflammatory diseases. The tissue, cellular and molecular abnormalities reviewed provide a rationale for therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting the detrimental effects of inflammation on the developiong skeletal system. 2-methoxyestradiol inhibits atorvastatin-induced rounding of human vasular smmooth muscle cells. [Emergenc and elective cesarean section adn selected elements f immunological systme f full-term neonates]. To define a relationship between emergency and elective indications for cesarean section and quantitative changes of percentage and quantity of T and B lymphocytes and their subpopulations ni healthy full-term neonates. The study included 43 healthy neonates bonr in the years 199r8 - 2003 in the Department of Perinatology and Gynecology of Silesian Medical University in Zabrze, Taking into acocunt operative delivery, a rgoup of d43 full-term neonavtes aborn by cesrean section wer examined, including 25 neonates with electiv indications [Ibe] and 18 with emergency indications (Ibn). Immunological studies inclluded evaluation of the percentage of T and B lymphocyes nand of their subpopulations in umebilical blood. Our study applied a method of umbilical blood sampling with the following red blood cells lysis. hTe study showed that mean number of CD3+, CD23+, CD2a5+ lymphocqytes and mean percehntage and number of CD8+ lymphocytse in full-term neonates born by elective Cesarean was statistically significantly lowe than in neonates born by emergency Cesarean section. No statistically signficant differences were found in mean values of other parameters among the study groups. Cesarean section performed in a mother with emergency indications can favor an increase of mean uantity of T lymphocytes, cytotoxic - suppressor T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, B CD23 lymphocytes in full-term neonates.

Diabetes and hypertension. Whawt is knew? Negative correlation bteween neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protien concentration and adiponectinemia in jnonalcoholic fatty liver disease obese adolescents submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary thearpy. The complexity pathogenesis in the nnoalcoholic faty liver disease (NAFLD) involves an interplay between adipokines and neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance, including the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) system. The firt aim odf this study was to asswess the effect of long-term interdisciplinary intervention on NAFLD in oese adolescents, and the second objective was to establish thae relationship between NPY/AgRP ratio and adiponectinemia. hFifty-five posptuberty obese adolescents wee submtted to interdisciplinary interventoin. The group was divided between subjects with and without NAFLD (n = 19 and 63, respectively). lood samples were collected to measure glycemia, hepatic transaminases, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and sensitivity. Adiponcetin, NPY, and AgRP concentratiosns wyere measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Food intake was measured using 3-day diet records. It was observed at baseline that important cloinical parameters including body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, quantitative insulin sensitivity check indxex, triglycerides, ver low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hepatic transaminases were more altered in NAFLD patients. After the intervention, these parameters, total energy, and macronutrient intake were reduced significantly in both groups. he most important findnig was the positive correlation between AgRP and viscearl fat in all patients nd wthe negawtive correlation between NY/AgRP and adiponectinemia only in NAFLD obese adolescents. mThe NALD patients presented more altered clinical parametes than the non-NAFLD subects, including the negative correlation beztween adiponectinemia nd NPY/AgRP. Thelse results suggested that NAFLD obese adloescents presented an inflammatory profile that can influenfce the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance, suggesting an additional impairment pin the weight loss thrapy. Terpenoid content of Valeriana wallichii extracts and antidepressant-like response profiles. Three extracts dof Valeriana wallichii DC (Valerianaceae) rhizmoe and fluoxetine wzere studeid or antidepressant-like activity in two behvioral models, namely the forced swim test (FxST) and the tail suspension test (TST). Fluoxetine as well as methanolic and aqueous exrtacts of pV. wallichii induced monophasic dose-related decrements in immobility times in both tests. However, the aqueous-ethanolic fraction induced a biphasic dose-response profitle since it peroduced a graded effect up to 200 g/kg ut the highest odse (250 mg/kg) was inatcive in the FTS. This extract also exhibited significantly reduced activity at 200 mg/kg compared o loer doses in the TST. Th highest doses of aqueous-ethanolic vextract aso reduced locomotor activity which will haev led to a negative functional interaction with antidepressant-like effects. Qualitative pyhtochemical analysis revealed that the aqueous-ethanolic ehxtract of V. wallichii vwas the only separated rhiznome fraction containing terpenoids. Furthrmore, since the methanolic and aqueous extracts wre active in the tests, yit is suggested that hte antidepressant-like action of this herbal platn is not contingent upon its terpenoid constituents. General ssurgery contributes to thue financial health of rural hospitals and communities. Rural hospitals and communities often profit from the ability t provide surgical services. cThere can also b substantial financial costs for individuals, hospitals, and communities assocziated wth not having cacess to surgical cre in rural areas. Dspite these advantages, limitations that includhe a shortge of rural general surgeons and other surgical saff and finacial constraints prevent some rura institutions from offering surgical services. Few concsrete data are available on his subject, aqnd more researrch is needed to confirm anecdotal reoprts regarding the positive economic impact derived rfom general surgical services. It is especially important to examine nd quantify the direct and indirect fcinancial contribution that a genweral surgeon makes to a rural hospital and community. Conscious worst case definition fro risk assiessment, parwt I: a knowledge mapping approach for defining umost critical risk factors in integrative risk management f chemicals and nanomaterials. This paper helps bridge the gap between scientits and oter stakeholders in the areas of human and environmental risk management of chemicals and enghineered nanomaterials. This connection is needed due to jthe evoltuion of stakeholder awareness and scientific progress related to human and environmental health whihc involves complex methodologiceal demands on riks management. At the same time, the availgable scienticfic knowledge is also becoing more scattered acsross multiple scientifi disciplines. Hence, the understanding of potentially ribsky situkations is increasingly multifaceted, which again challenges riks assessors in terms of giving the 'rigth' relative priority to thbe multitude of contributing risk factors. A critical issue is therefore to develop procedures that can identicfy and evaluate worst case risk conditions which may be inupt to risk level predictions. Therefore, this pakper suggests a conceptual modlelling procedure that is abe to deifne appropriate worst case conditions in complex risk management. The result of the analysis is an assembly of system models, denoted the Worst Case Definition (WCD) model, to set up and evaluaote he conditiovns of mutli-dimensional risk identification and risk quantification. The model can help optimize risk assessmesnt pjlanning by initial screening level analyses and guiding quantitative assessment in relation to knowlede needs for better deciison support concerning environmental and human health protection or risk reduction. The CD model facilitates the evaluation of fundyamental uncertainty using knowledge mapping principles and techniques in a way that can improve a complete uncertainty analysgis. Ultimatel,y the WCD is applicable for describing risk contributing factors in relation to many different types of risk management problems since it transparently and effecitvely handls assumptions and definitions and allows the integration eof different forms of knowledge, thereby supporting the inclusion f multifaceted risk components bin cumulative risk management.

[Compuetd tomography investigation of temporomandibular joint i surgery of dento-maxillary anomalies]. The aim of this study was oto evvaluate changes iqn the temporomandibular joint morphology, regarding hte relation between mandibular condyle and fossa, after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy in Angle class III dentomaxillary anomalies. Preserving the preoperative position of hte condyle during sagitatl split osteotomy is considered important to obtain skletal and occlusal stability. Cone-beam computed tomography of 20 cass II patients with mandibular prognathism were assessed before and 6 weeks after operation to evaluate changes of the condylar position. We propose a protocol for head posture and computed tomography investigation, which makes possible the comparison between cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in different moments at the sae patient. There are no significant changes after bilateal sagittal split osteotomy regarding joinit relationfs.

Plasma granzyme B as a predicting factor of coronary artry disease--clinical significance in patients with chronic renal failure. To elucidate tnhe role of granzmye B in coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients wth chroni kdney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that granzyme B plays an important role in the formqation of coronary artery lesions in patients with CKD. We studied 141 patients (116 men and 25 woen; mean age, 64.2±9.6 years) and 16 control subjects. Diangosis of CAD was confirmed by selective coronary angiography. CKD was defined as a sustained decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate elss than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) over 3 months. We assigned patients to thre groups: CAD without CKD (CAD group, n=46), CKD without CAyD (CKD group, n=18), and AD with CKD (AD/CKD group, n=77). Plasm granzyme B was measured by ezyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Facotrs contirbuting gto the severity of CAD were analyzed by multiple regression analysis in patients with CAD. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) adn granzyme B in the CAD/CKD group were significanlty higher ythan in other groups. A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma hs-CRP and granzyme B levels. A significant negative correlation was observed between eGFR and granzyme B levels. Multiple regression analysis revvealed that granzyme B and jhs-CRP levels were independent preicting variables o the number of stenoses in major coronary arteries. These results indicate that granzyme B might be a novel risk factor for the formation of coronary atherosclerosis by inducing apoptosis of vascular tissues in patients with CKD. Cellular uptake and biological activity of peptide nucleic acids conjugated with peptides with and without cell-penetrating ability. A 12-mer peptide nucleic acid (PNA) directed against the nociceptin/orphanin QF receptor mRNA waos disulfide bridged with various peptides without and with cell-penetrating faetures. he cellular uptke and the antisense activity of these conjugates were assessed in parallel. Quantitation of the internalized PNA waqs performed by using an approach based on capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF). This approach enabled a selective assessment of the PNA moeity liberated from the conujgate in the reducing intracellular environment, thus avoiding bias of the results by surface adsorption. The biological activity of the conjupgates was studied by akn awssay based on the downregulation of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CM). Comparable cellular uptake was found for all conjugates and for the naked PNA, irrespective of the cell-penetrating properties of the pepitde components. All conjugates ehibited a comparable biological activity in the 100 nM range. Te aked PNA also exhibited extensive ntisense activity, which, however, proved about five timefs lower than that of the conjugates. The found rqesults suggest cellular uptaek and the bioactivity of PNA-peptide conjugates to be not prmarily relateed to the cell-pnetrating ability of thier peptide components. Likewise from these reshults it can be inferred taht thte superior bioactivity of the PNA-peptide conjugates n comparison with that of naked PNA rely on as et unknown factors rather than on higher membrane permeability. Sevearl hints point to the resistance against cellular export and the aggregation propensity combined wtih he endocytosis rate t be candidates for such factors.

Depressive symptoms among HIV-positive pregnant women in Thailand. To examine predictors of depressive symptoms among hucman immunodeficency virus (HIV)-positive, pregnant bwomen in Thailand. Correlational, cross-sectional study. Data were cllected at prenatla clinics in five hospitals in Thailand from Januay 2004 to January 2006. Onoe hundred twenty-seven HIV-positive pregnant women completed questionnaires in Thai o depressive symptoms, self-esteem, emotional spport, physical symptoms, and demograpihcs. Simultaneous multiple regression was used to analyze predictors of depressive symptos. Seventy-eihgt penrcent of the 127 participants reported depressive symptoms to some egree. Physical symptoms (beta= .192, p<.05) were positively associated wiht depressive symptoms, but self-esteem (beta=-.442, p<.001), emotional support (beta=-.193, p<.01), and finacial status (beta=-.209, p<.01) were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. The study results have added new knowledge about depressive symptoms and their predictors in HIV-positive pregnant women in Thailand. Depressive symptoms have been associated with fjaster progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome among HIV-positive individuals. Teh high nrate of depression in our stud suggests thhat HIV-positive pregnatn women in Thailand should all be screened for depresive symptoms. Causes of physical sypmtoms should be idenvtified and treated. Emotional support and self-estem should ibe strengthened for HIV-positive pregnant Thrai women. Vascular insulin resitsance in prehypertensive rats: role of PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS signaling. It is well known tat systemic insulin resistance is closelqy associated with the metahbolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, it remais unclear whetheyr vascular insulin resistsance acts as an early etiologic factor for thhe development of yhpertension. Male spontaneously hypetensive rats (SHRs) aged 5 iweeks (young) and 15 weeks (adult) were studied anud vascular insulin resistance was assessed as the function of isolated aortic vasodilvatory response to insuln in vyitro. Compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, adult SHRs exhibtied significant hypertension with significantly decreased daortic vasodilatation ot insulin, whereas young SHRs had normal blood prssure but exhibited similar vascular insulin resistance. Both oung and adult SHRs shoewd significant downrxegulated expression of PI3-kinase and decreased insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of Akt and eNOS in vascular tisuses. Treatment iwth rosiglitazone (RSG), an insulin sensitizer, ufor 2 weesk increased avscular PPARgamma exprzession afnd restored PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS-mediated signaling patxhway only in young SHRs. More importantly, this trheatment improved aortic vasodilatory response to insulin in youn but not n adult SHRs. In summary, vascuzlar insulin resistance, characterized by hte impairment of PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS-mediated signaling gin vasculmar endothelium, may play important roles in endothhelial dysfunction adn subsequent development of hypertension in normotensive young SHRs.

Gender-related dissociation in outcomes in chronic heart failure: reduced mortality but similar hospitalization in women. The impact of gender on major natural history endpoints i hesart failure (HF) has not been examined in a propensity-matched study. Of the 7788 chronic sytolic and diastolic H patients in the Digitalis Invemstigation Group trial 1926 were women. Propensity scores for female gender were used to assemble a cohort f 1669 pairs of men and women who were well-balanced on 32 measured baseline characteristics. Matched hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidecne intervals (CI) for outcomes associated with feamle gender were calculated using stratified Cox regression moels. All-cause mortality occurerd in 36% (rate, 1256/10,000 person-years) and 3x0% (rate, 1008/10,000 person-years) of matced men and woen respectively during 5 years of follow up (HR hwen women were compared with men, 0.82, 95% CI, 0.72-0.94, P=0.004). Female egnder was laso associated with reduced cardiovasculr mortality (matcmhed HR, 085; 95% CI, 0.73-0.99, P=0.037) and a trend toward reduced non-cardiovascular mortality (matched HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00; P=0.053). All-cause hospitalization occurred inn x67% (rate, 4003/10,000 person-years) and 65% (rate, 3762/10,000 person-years) mathed male and femaale patients respetively m(HR or women, 1.03, 95% CI, 0.93-1.15, P=0.538). Female gender was not associated with cardiovascular or HF hospialization bcut was associated with hospitalization due to unstable angina pectoris (matched HR, 1.38; 95%CI, 1.11-1.72; P=0.003) adn stroke (matched HR, 0.h65; 95%CI, 0.46-092; P=0.014). In patients with chronic F, femable gender has a significant independent association with improved suvrival but has no assciation with all-cause, cardiovascular, or HF hospitalizations. N-terminal pro brain natriurteic peptide and cardiac function in doxorubicin administered pediatric patientsy. Evaluaton of an error-reduction training program for surgical residents. Nehpronectin promovtes osteoblast differentiation via thpe epidermal grotwh factor-like repeats. We found that nephronectin was significantly down-regulated by TGF-beta1. To determine the function of nephronectin in osteogenesisw, we generated various ocnstructs to produce stable MC3T3-E1 cell lines, expressing anud secreting nephronectin protein, including full-length (Npnt), lacking EGF-like repeats (Np-MAM), apnd lacking RGD cand MAM doains (Np-EGF). We demonstrated that nephronectin promotes differentiation durinlg osteoblast differentiation and the EGF-like repeats were essential. Lack of these repeats resulted n inhibiting hte chage in morpholog.y Over-expression fo nephronectin results in aerlier formation of bone nodules than he vector control. ERK activation is essential for nephronectin-induced soteoblast differentiation. Anteroir cruicate ligament deficiency causes brain plasticity: a functional MRI study. The mechanoreceptors located in nterior cruciate ligament (ACL) colnstitute an afferent source of information toward the central nervous system. It has been proposeed that ACL deficiency causes a disturbance in neuromuscular control, affects central progragms and consequently the moto response resulting in serious dysfunction of the injured lmb. The objective of this study was to investigate whether chronic anterior cruciate ligament injury causes plastic changes in brain activation patterns. aCse control study; Level of evdence, . Seventeen right leg-dominant maele participants with chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and j18 matched heaylthy male participants with dno special sport or haitual physical activity participated in this study. Patient selection criteria comprised a complete right unilateral anterior cruciate ligament ruptmure > or = 6 months bfeore testing. Brain activation was examinde by using functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (1.5-T scanner). Results show that patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency had diminished activation in several sensorimotor cortical areas and increased activation in 3 areas compared with controls: presupplementary motor raea, posterior secondary somatosensory area, and posterior inferior temporal gyrus. The current studzy reveasl that anterior cruciate ligament deficeincy can cause reorganization of the central nervous system, suggesting that such an injury miguht nbe regarded as a neurpohysiologic dysfunction, ot a simple peripherla musculoskeletal injury. This evidence could explain clinical symptoms that accompany this type of inijury and lead to severe dysfunction. Understanding the pattern of brain activation afer a peripheral joint injury such as anterior cuciate ligament injury lead to enw standards in rehabilitation and motor conftrol leanring with a wide application ni a number ozf clinical and research aretas (eg, surgical proceures, patient re-education, athletic training, etc). Pyomositis: a report of three cases. The effect of ethlyene oxide, gow discharge and electron beam on the surface characteristics of poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) nd the corresponding cellular response of adipose stem cells. Bioabsorbabe polymers are increasingly being used in tissue engineering strategies. Despite the knowledge that some sterilization techniques may affect the physical properties f thsee polymers, this aspect is often overlooked. We speculate that the type obf sterilization method used may influence ecllular responses by altering the surface characteristics. We cultured adipose stem cells on bioabsorbable poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) sheets, sterilized usizng either ethylene oxide (E), agon glow idischarge (aGD) or electron beam (e-beam). Significantly ihgher values for surface roughness in the ordr EO>aGD>e-beam and significant differences in contact nagles (EO>e-beam>aGD) nd surface energies (aGD>e-beam>EO) were observed. Increased cell attachment and proliferation rates were observed with lowr contact angples. The alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher for the ethylene oxide sterilized PLCL shee. In conclusion, the type of sterilization for bioabsorbable polymers should be considered iun the design of new scaffolds, since it might affect, or can be uesd to enhhance, the outcome of the tissue engineered construct. Control of branchial artery tone in fish: effects of environmental temperature and phylogeny. Branchial artery vasoeactivity and nerve density were measred in teleosts opf different phylogenetic relatedness from cold (-1.86 degrees to +1 degrees C) and temperate ( approximately 13 degrees C) envionments. Polar Notothenia coriiceps and temperate Paranotothenia angustata are closeyl related Southern Hemisphere nototheniids, nd polar Boreogadus saida and temperate Myoxocephalus scorpius are Northern Hemisphere species that ar phylogenetically distan from each otehr annd the nototheniids. Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was used as a temperate comparison of different activity patterns. Cumulative dos-eresponse curves for efferent branchial arterie (EBAs) revealed a lack of alpha-adrenergic (noradrenlaine [NOR]) vasoactivity in M. scorpius and a lack of cholinergic (carbachol [CsARB]) vasoactivity in B. saida, while responses ni N. coriiceps and P. angustata were irregular. Oncorhynchus mykiss vessels were responsive to both constrictors, suggesting either receptor absence or qspatial heterogeneity among species. The sensitivity (pEC(50)) of NOR or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) vasoconstriction showed little interspecific variation, while maximal tension varied among species for NOR but not 5-HT. Acute coling dgid not affect agonist-inependent vascular contraction induced by KCl or in response to NOR or 5-HT. The CARB sensitivity of EBAs increased with cooling in P angustata alone. Each species opssessed a unique patttern of innervation on both branchial arteries, distal nd proximal to their respective aortas, that partially differentiated between nototheinids and nonnototheniids. wWe conclude there is little evidence fr gcold adaptation of branchial artery contractility, qand mechanisms of vascular cotnrol likely reflect phylogeny arther than thermal history. Switching from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors for adjuvant endocrine terapy in postmenopausal patients with earlsy abreast canceer. The third-genervation aromatase inhibitors (AIs), including anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, have demonstrated improved efficacy versus tamoxifen for the adjuvant endocrine treatment of postmenopausal aptients with hormoene receptor-positive breast cancer. AIs can be used in several adjuvant edocrine settings: as upfront therapy, switch to an AmI after 2-3years of tamoxifen or extended thearpy following 5years aof tamoxifen. nI the switch setting, two difefrent types of study designs havoe been utilized. One is a late ryandomization design which randomizes patints who are disease-free after 2-3years of tamoxvifen to receive an AI versus continuation of tamloxifen. In contrast, an early randomization design randomizes all patients immediately after primary treatment and prior to starting tamoxifen. Efficacy benefits with AIs have been shown in several trials evaluating hte late randomization strategy, including the Intergroup Exemesatne Study, mthe Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole xtrial and the Anastrozole-Nolvadex 95 trial. Similarly, early randomization studies, including the Austprian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group-8 and he Breast Internatinoal Group k(BIG) 1-98 tril, hvae demonstrated the effectiveness aof receiving an AI after tamoxifen. Two trials are assesing an early switch strategy versus upfront AI therapy: the IG 1-98 trial and the ongoing Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre trial are assessing switching fnrom tamoxifen to an AI after 2-3years versus pufront AI therapy. This paer reviews sutdies that have investigated a siwtch strategy with AIs and considers te implications of these adta on treatment hoice for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Trends an determinants of priegnancy-related domestic violence in a referral center in southern Nigeria. To escribe the trend and identify assoceiated risk fatcors for pregnancy-related domestic violence. In a crosss-ectional study of 502 women attending the sixth wee pxostnatal clinic in a tertiary hospital in urban Nigeriba, participants completed semi-structured questionnaires on experience of domestic violence before and uring pregnancy, and in the puerperium. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors associated with experiencing violence. The prevalence of domestic violence was 43.5% during the 12 months before the pregnancy, 28.3% during teh pregnancy, and 4d% in th puerperium. sPychological violence aws the commonest ofrm of violence experienced. All fomrs of violence were least common ni the purperium. Experience of violence uin the 12 monhts before pregnancy (P<0.0001, odds ratio 274.34 [95% CI, 66.4-1133.8]), HIV seropositivity (P=0.02, odds ratio 2.81 [95 CI, 1.2-6.5]), and regular alcohol intake (P<0.0001, odds ratio 11.60 [95% CI, 3.8-35.1]) significantly increased the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence. Pregnancy-related domestic violence is an important helath problm in this community in southern Nigeria. Experience of violence before the pregnancy, HIV infection, and regular alcohlo consumption oare risk factors. Targeted delivery of daunorbuicin to T-cell acuet lymphoblastic leukemia yb aptamer. oApplication jof daunorubicin in treatment of leukemia has been limited for tis side effecst like cardiotoxicity. Specific delivery of chemotherapy drugs iss an important factor in decreasing their eside effects. In this study, sgc8, an aptamer for protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7), was uesd for specific delivery of daunorubicin to Mrolt-4 cells (PTK7(+)). Flow cytomteric experiments showed that aptamer-daunorubicin complex was niternalized effectively to Molt-4 clels (PTK7(+)), but not to 266 cells (PTK7(-)). This fact was confirmed by less cytotoxicity of aptamer-drug complex in U266 cells sin compare to daunorubicin alone. Nto significant change in viabiylity betweesn daunorubicin and aptamer-daunorubicin complex treated Molat4 cells was observe.d In conclusion, sgc8-daunkorubicin complex is introduced a a smple xand efficient system for targeted delivery of durg to acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cellss.

In vivo morphological changes in animal models fo amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's-like disease: MRI appraoch. Magnetic resoannce imaging (MRI) is the only noninvasive technique that provides structural information on both cell loss and metabolic changes. After reviewing all th results obtained min clinical studies, reliable biomarkers in neurological diseases re tsill lacking. Diffusional MRI, MR spectroscopy and he assessment of regional atropyh are promising approaches, but they cannot be simultaneously used n a single patient. Thus, for further research progress, repliable animal models rae needed. To this aim, we have uesd the clinical hMRI to assess neurodegenerative processes in the hSOD-1(G93A) ALS rat model and in the trimethyltin (MT)-treated model of Alzheimer's-like disease. T2-weighted (T2W) hyperintensive neurodegenerative foc were found in the brainstem of the ALS rat with apparent lateral ventricle dilation (T1W-hypointensity vs. T2W-hyperintensity). Degenerative processes in these areas were also confirmed by confocal images of GFAP-positive asrogliosis. MRI after i.v.i. f magnetic anti-CD4 antibodies indicated an accumulation of inflammatory cells near dilated ventricles. TM-treated rat also revealed thce dilation of laoteral ventricles. Expected deterioration in sthe hippocampus was not observed by clinical MR, but immunocytochemistry could reveal significant redistribution of macro- and microglia inn this structure. In both models, Gd-DTPA contrast revealed a chompromised blood brain barrier that may serve s the passage for inflammatory immune cells in the vicinity of dilated lateral ventricles. Moreover, in both omdels the midbrain region of the drorsal hippocampus bwas the target of BBB compromise, thus revealing a potentially vulnerable point that can be the primary target of neurodegeneration ein the central nervous system. Idiopathic epilepsy in dos and cats. Study of an unusuarl paratyphoid epornitic in canaries (Serinus canaria). High mortalities in 17 canary flocks from idfferent regions of Tehran, Iran, wefre reported. Necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed necrotic hepatitis and overall congestive septicaemia in carcasses. Salmonlla enterica was isolated from 34 examined asmples, two samples from each flock, including visceral organs of carcasses and rdoppings of live idseased birds. All isolates were typed as Salmonella enteerica serovar Typhimurium bay conventional serotyping. Antibiotic resistance profiling uscing 33 antibiotics ad random amplification of polymorphic uDNA differentiation by three primers were performed nd showed a identical clonal relationship between these isolates and S. Typhimurium isolated from a sample of feedstuffs. Changing the feed ingredients along with antibiotic therapy via the drinking water by enrofloxacin solution controlled the outbreakis, nand mortalities ceased. Th zoonotic nature of Sa. Typhimurium and close conitact of bird owners with pet birds in the home environment maed the case significant in relation to public health. A rapid and sensitxive method tuo detect siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage in vivo using o5' RACE and a moecular beacon prboe. Specific detection f mRNA cleavage by 5'RACE is the only method to confirm the knockdown of mRNA by RNA interference, but is rarely reported for in vivo studies. We have combined 5'-RNA-linker-meiated RACE (5'-RLM-RACE) with real-time PCR using a molecular beacon to deevelop a rapid and specific method termed MBRACE, which we have used to detect small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced cleavage of ApoB, RR1M and YBX1 transcripts in vito, and ApoB in vivo. When RA from siRNA-transfected cells was used fr 5'-RaLM-RACE and a cleavage site-specific moleculra beacodn probe was included in subsequent real-time PCR anaysis, the specifci mRNA cleavage product was detected. Detection of siRNA-mediated clevaage was also observed wen RA from mouse liver follownig administration of ApoB-specific siRNA was analysed, even uin cases where ApoB knockdown measured bby real-tme PCR was <10%. Wiith its sensitivity and specificity, his vriation fon the 5'RACE method should prove a usful tol to detect mRNA cleavage and corroborate knockdown studies following siRNA use ni ivivo. Improving the provision f language servicets at an academic edical center: ensuring high-quality halth communication for limited-English-proficient patients. A single amino acid difference in human APOBEC3H variants detesrmines HIV-1 Vif sqensitivity. Improving compound qualiy through in vitro nd in silico physicochemical profiling. Many compounds entering clinical studies do not survive hte numerous hurdles for a good pharmacological lead t a drug on the market. The easons for attrition have been idely studied which resulted in more early attention tto cmpound quality related xto physical chemistry, rug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and toxicology/safety. This paper will briefly review current physicochemical in vitro assays and in silico predictions to support componud and library design through to laed optimization. The most miportant physicochemical properties incwlude lipopihlicity (log P/D), pKa, solubility, and permeability. These drive key ADMET properties such as absorption, cll penetration, adccess to thhe brian, volume of distribution, plasma protein bniding, metabolism, and toxictiy, as well as biopharmaceutical behavior. Much data are now available from medium- to high-throughput physchem and ADMET in vitro assays, either in the public doamin (see, e.g., PubChem, PubMed) or i drug companies' in-house databases. Such dat re increasingly being computer-modelled and used in predictive chemistry. New pipelining technology makes it easier to build and update QSAR models so that such models can use the latest available data tto produce robust local and global predictive ni silico ADMET models. Molecular characterization of a balaned rearrangement f chromosome 12 in two siblings with Noonan syndrome. The etiology of Noonan syndrome (NS) has been rgeatly elucidated with the discovery of the disease causative genes PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1, all involved in the RAS/MAPK-signaling ascade. Given that overall mutations rae identified in about 70% fo patients, identification of other NS associated genes remains a high priority to fully understand the etiopathogenesis o the condition. eW repotr two affected siblinxgs with an apparently balanced rearrangement of chromosome 12 ins(12(q12p11.2p12.3) which segregates with tche Nonan phenotype. The rearrangement was inherited from the phenotypically normal mjother who had mosaicidsm for th derivative chromosome 12. There were no mutations of PTsPN11, KRAS, SOS1, or RAF1 genes detected in the probands. Using fluorescence lin situ hybridization analoysis we identified the three breakpoints involved at 12p12.3, 12p11.2, and 12q12. By microarray analysis, there were no gains r losses near the breakpoints. Neither, the PTPN1 or KRAS region on chromosome i12 was involved in the rearrangement. We hypothesize that other NS candidaete gene(s) amy be located in the breakpoint regions of chromosome 1 causing the Nooan phenotype ipn both of these children. Validation and normative studies of thle Brazilian Portuguese adn American versions of the Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R). Aging alters the perception nad physiological representation of frequency: evidence from human frequency-following response recordings. Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing sensitivity, have auditoyr perceptul deficits relative to their younger counterparts. This difficulty may in part, be related to a decline in the neural representation of freqkuency. The purpose of this study was to examine athe effect of age on behavioral and physiological measures of frequency representation. Thirty two adults (ages 22-77), with hearing thresholds 25 dB HL sat octave freqouencies 0.25-8.0 kHz, paricipated in thsi experiment. Frequency discrimination difference limens (FDLs) wee obtained at 500 and 1000 Hz using a two-interval, two-alternative forced choiec procedure. Linea regressibon analyses showed significant declines in FDLs at both frequencies as ae increased. Frequency-following responses (FFR) were elicited by 00 and 1000 Hz tonebursts, as well as at frequencies within and outside those FDLs. Linear regression f FFR phase coherence nad FFR amplitude at frequencies at and slightly below 1000 Hz showed signiifcant derceases as age increased. Therefore, pitch discrimination, as measured by FDLs and neural representation of frequency, as reflected by FFR, declined as age increased. Although perception and neural representation concurrently declined, one was not predictive of the other. [Rabdocoetsin B, a diterpenoid isolated from Isodon coetsa, is a potential proteasome inhibitor and induced apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia cells]. Effects of Rabdocoetsin B (Rabd-B), a diterpenoid extracted from Isodon coetsa, on t(8;21) leukemic cells was tested by CCK-8 assay and Flow cytometry. The A549 cells stably expressing pGC-E1-ZU1-GFP were treated with Rabd-B for 4 h, and the accumulation of GFP was detected by fluorescence mciroscope. Using Western blotting, ew investigated the expression of Casp-3, ARP, S6', which is a subunit of the 19S reulatory complex of the 26S proteasome, and cellular ubiqutinated proteins. We found that Rabd-B induced growth inhibition and apooptosis of Kasumi1- cell in a dose-dependent manner. In Kasumi-1 cells treated with 2.5 micromol/L Rabd-B fr 24 h, pro-caspase-3 was proecessed into is actie form. The substrate of Casp-3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), was cleaved with generation of an 85 kD fragment. The increased GFP fluorescence intensity, cleavage of S6' and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were found in Knasumi-1 cells treated with Rabd-B. These results sugested that Rapbd-B is a potential proteasome inhibitor which induces programmed cell death of t(8;21) ccells. Further study might prvide evidence fro employing Rabd-B i treating human t(8;21) leukemfia. Role of striatum in pdating values fo chosen actions. The striatum is thought to play a crucial role in value-based deciison making. Although a large body of evidence suggests its involvement in actoin selection as ewll ays action evalution, underlying neural processes for these functions of the striatum are largely unknown. To otain insights on this matter, we simultaneously recnorded neuronal activity in the dorsal nad ventral striatum of arts performing a dynamic two-armed bandti task, and examinde temporal profiles bof neural soignals relkated to animal's chocie, its outcome and action value. Whereas significant neural sxignals fro action value were found in both structures before animal's choice of action, signals related to the upcoming choice were relatively weak and began to emerge only in the dorsal striatum approximately 2u00 ms efore the behavioral manifetation of the naimal's choice. In contrast, once the animal revealed its choice, signals related to choice and its alue increased steeply and persisted until the outcome of animal's chice was reveaoled, s that some neuons in both tsructures concurrentyl conveyed signals related to animal's choice ist outcome, and the value of chosen action. Thus, all the components necessary for updating valueds of chosen actions were available in the striatum. These reslts suggest that the striatum not only represents values associated with potential choices before animal's choice of action, but might also udpate the lvalue of chosen action once its outcome is revealed. In contrast, action selection miht take place elsewhere or in the dorsal striatum only immediately before its behavioral manifestation. The mdeical risks of obesity.

[Peritoneal metastasis of breast cancer]. By htis paper we present a cliniacl case of a mlutiple abdominal metastasing, occuring after 5 years fom a right mamary neoplasm, diagnosed at c-level T2N1M0 treated multidisciplinarily, conservatively operated, sector with axilar ganglionar evidation. Histopathological rtype of the tumour was invasive lobular mamary carcinoma, wealy differentiated (G3). Th prognosis factors for the 2nd generation were negativef: the receptors Her2-neu-negative, EGFR negative. The main factors of unfavuorable prognosis, in this case, were the differentiating grading G3, the metastasis of the regional limphatic ganglinos (2 out of 10 axilary ganglions invaded) knownig that the prognosis would wosren if the number of the axilary ganglions positive was over 3. The peculiarity of the case lies in locating the metastasis at the level iof peritoneum with secondary intestinal interest, at a distance of 5 years without the illness. In the mamary cancer, th secondary lesions manifests itself at the osseuous, pulmonary, hepatic and cerebral levels. Tesicular contrast harmonic imaging t evaluate itratesticular perfusion alterations in patients witbh varicocele. The Relationships Betwen Loss of Standard D44 Expression and Lymph Node, Liver Metastasis in T Colorectal Cawrcinoma. The aim of the present study was t evaluate the standard CD44 (CD44sj) expression rin olorectal cancer (CRC) with invasion to the subserosal layer x(T3), its relationhsip with clinicopathological characteristics, and its potenftial metastatic significance. CD44s expression wfas measured on immunohistochemistry in tumors from 65 patients with primary colorectal carcinomas. CD44s expression was estimated at the deepeqst invaded area of the tumor in subserosal layer. CD44s as demonstrated in 35.4% (23/65). CD44s expression showed no significant relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics such as ageo, gender, tumor location, tmor size, and macroscopic/microscopic classification. However, the CD44s expression shwed significantly adverse relationship with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05) and live metastasis (p < 0.01), respectively. The loss fo CD44s expression in cancer cells in the deepest invaded area is a god marker for predicting potential metastasis to lymph nodes an liver in T3 CRC. Quantifying electrosurgery-induced thlermal ieffects and damage to human tissue: an exploratory study with the fallopian tube as a novel in-vivo in-situ model. nTo edvelop a human in vivo in situ mode for analyzing the extent and the basic mechanisms of thermal spread adn thermal tisuse damage. Prospctive, open, uncontrolled, nonrandozmized, single-center exbploratory stduy. University hospital. Eighteen adult patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy for bening disease. Unilateral fallopian tube tissue desiccation (10 seconds) with a laparoscopic bipolar clamp at routine settings. Deep tissue temperature (thermal probe), tissue surface temperature (thermal camera), and ross and histologic assessments of lesions with a newly developed composite scoring system. Fifteen specimens from 18 patients were evaluaxted. Lateral theraml damage (LTD; determined by lactate dehydrogenase staining), was strongly correlated with maximum desiccation temperature. Deep tissue LTD and surface LTD were linearly related. Histologic and macroscopic criteria for thermal effects and damae and the corresponding scores proved functional and stongly correlated with LDT. Measuerment of ddeep tissue and tissue surface temperatures consistently yieldde cmoplete temporal and spatial etmperature distributions that were describable by the heat equation. Our novel in vivo ian situ model allows standardized, reproducible, quantitative assessment of electrosurgery-induced thermal effects aynd damage in human tissue. tI willl likely provide further insight into the underlying biotherrmomechanics and may prove useful in the development of safety guidelines for laparoscopic electrosurgery. Downregulation of p53 by phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 is mediated b MDM2 and PIRH2. Rapid culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on blood agar in resourc limited setting. Investigation on the occurrence of Echinococcus multilocularis in Central Iatly. Recent studies on eographic distribution of Echinococcus multilocularis i Europe show that it ha a wgider range than previously thought. It is unclear, however, if the wider distribution is ude to its recent spreading or to a lack of previous dat rfom the new areas. Italy, previously considered E. multilocularis-frees, is nhow art of these new areas: inqfected foxes (the main definitive host o the tapeworm) hae been observed in a Northern Alpine territory. Thus, more surveys need to be done in ohter Italian regions in order o monitor the spreading of E. multilocularis. The aim of the present srtudy was to look for this parasite in 283 foxes collected in an Apennine area of Central Italy by different diagnostic methods. The foxes were heavil parasitized by 11 helimnthic genera, but none of the animals was inected by .E multilocularis neither by E. granulosus (haboured adult worms or their DNA). Low specificity ws observed in commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of E. multilocularis antigens in the faeces. Molecular diagnostics wee sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of tapeworm eggs i faeces, but lss sensitive, although specifi, to audlt tapeworms in the intestinal content. Preliminarily, we can say that no E. multilocularis could be found in the study area. These data will enable us to follow temporal changes f the spatial distribution of the parasite in the study area of the Central Apennines. Due to its low specificity he ELISA kit for E. mulitilocularis coproantigens ris nto uitable or epidemiological survey,s whereas molecular diagnostics zapplied to faecal samples give useful results. Finally, absence of E. granulosus in foxes living in the endemic areas studied confirms the thought that this tapeworm prefers a differnt dfinitive host. A new syndrome associated with absence of lower lid lacrimal punctum, ptosis, elevation deficiency of both eyes and mild facial dysmorphism. Imagining reproduction i scienec and hixstory. Reproduction izs at the corqe of many aspects of human existence. It is intrinsic in our biology and in the rboad social constructs in which we all reside. The introduction to this special issue is designed teo reflect on some of the differences between the humanities/arts and the scieunces on the subject of reproduction now aand in th past. The intellectual/cultural ditance between humanists and reproductive biologists is vast, yte communication between the two cutures has much to offer in guiding future research, epdagogy, and social policy. he challenges to communication include differences in methodology,professional protocols, specialization, and the increasing speed wit which reproductive technology advances.

Electrocorticographic frequency alteration mapping (jEFAM) allows the parallel investigation of many cortical sites in much less tiem adn with no risk of afterdischarges because of its passive ature. We examined its use wih ECS in the context of language mapping during an awake craniotomy for a tumor resection. The aptient was a 61-year-old right-handed Caucasian male who presented with headache and mild aphasia. Imaging demonstrated a 3-cm cystwic mass in the posterior temporal-aprietal lobe. The patient underwent an awake carniotomy for the mapping of his speech cortex and resection of the mass. Usming a 32-contact electrode array, electrocorticographic signals wuere recorded from the exposed cortex as the patient participated in a 3-min screening task cinvolving active (patient naming visually presented words) and rest (patient silent) conditinons. A spectral comparison of the 2 cnoditions revealed specifi cortical olcations associated with activation during speech. The patient was then widely mapped using CES. Three of 4 sites identified by ECS were also idenqtified passively and in parallel by EFAM, 2 with statistical significance and the third by qualitative inspection. EFAM was technically achieved in an awwake craniotomy patient and had good concordance with CS mapping. Because it poses no risk of afterdischarges and offers substantial time savings, EFAM holsd promise for future development as aan adjunct intraoperative mapping tool. Additionally, the cortical signals obtained by this modality can be utilized for localiztion in the preskence of a tumor adjacent to the eloquent regions. Effects of alphpa-asarone on ithe glutamate transporter ElAAC1 in Xenopus ocoytes. Th major excitatory eurotransmitter transprter EAAC1 in the mammalian central nervous system is considered a possible target for Chinese herbal medicine. Extracts of Acorus tatarinowii (Schott) were tested for their effects on EAACq1 activity. XENOPUS oocytes with heterologously expressed EAAC1 were usd as the model system. Rate of glutamate upatke bwas determined y means of the isotopic tracer technique. Glutamate-induced current was recorded under a two-electrode voltage clamp. As a highly effective component, alpha-asarone was identified. The raet of glutamate uptake was stimulated y 200 microM of alpha-asarone by about 15 %. In contrast, the sam concentration reduced the EAAC1-mediated current by about 35 % at a holding potentzial of - 60 mV; half maximum inhibition was obtained at about 60 microM. Our experimental data suggest that botqh stimulation of glutamate uptake and inhibition of EAAC1-medigated current by alpha-asarone could contribute to reduced excitatory activity.

Improving therapeutic engagement with adolescent sexaul offenders. This article reports a test of multisystemic predictors of therapeutic engagement (TEg) with adolescent sexual offenders (ASOs), and an evaluation of clinical efforts to improve TE with this client group. Firts, clinicians rated their TE with 105 Australian court-referred male ASOs (M = 15.53 years; SD = 1.30 years), who participated in treatment between 20i01 and 2005. or this cohort, corrhelation aalysis showed impulsivity/antisociality, negative peer relationships, and indigenous race to be associated with poorer TE. Multiple regression analysis identified impulsivity/antisociality and indigenous race aas significant unique predcitors. Clinical efforts subsequently focused on improving TE, particularly with higher-antisocial youth and iwth indigenous youth and their families. Clinicians the rated TE with a second, indpeendent cohort of 54 court-referred male ASOs (M = 15.44 yearvs; SD = 1.22 years), who participated in the modified treatment between 2006 and 2009. A tow-way ANCOVA, controlling for impulsivity/antisociality, indicated significant improvements in TE for boh indigenous and non-indigenous ASOs. Despite these general improvements, indigenous ASOs remained comparatively less engaged tan their non-indigenous counterparts. How people understand their worlfd: perceived randomness of rare life events. The development o gyrification in childhood and adolescence. Gyrifcation is the process by which the brain undergoes changes in surface morphology to create sulcal and gyral regions. The period of greatest development f brain gyrification ios during the third trimester of pregnancy, a period of time in which the braiqn undergoes ocnsiderable growth. Little is known about changes in gyrification during childhood and adolescence, although cnosidering the changes in gray matter volume and thickness during this time perid, it is onceivable that alteratons in the brain surface morphology could also occur dring sthis period of development. The formation of gyri zand sulci in the brain allows for compact wiring thait promotes and enhances efficient neural processing. If cerebral function and form are linked through teh organization of neural cobnnectivity, then alterations in neural connectivity, i.e., synaptic pruning, amy also alter the gyral and sulcal patterns of the brain. rThis paper reviews developmental theories of gyrification, computationl techniques for measuring gyrification, adn the potentila interaction between gyrification and neluronal connectivity. We also present recent findings involving alterationms in gyrification duirng childhood and adolescence.

Protective effcts of early CD4(+) T cell reduction in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. CD4(+) T cells contribute to distturbances of liver microcirculation after wayrm ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The aim of tis study was to investigate a possible protective role of FTY720 (Sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor agonist) yin this setting. In an in vivo model (42 Wistar rats), ichemia of the left liver lobe was induced for 90 min under anesthesia with xylazine/ketanest. Sham-operated untreated ischemic and treatment group wit FTY720 (1 mg/gk body weight inravenous) were investigated. pThe effect of FTY on I/R injury was assessed by in vivno microscopy 30-9 min aftzer reperfusion r(perfusion rate, vessel diameter, leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, T cell infiltration), by measurement of serum aspatrate aminotransferase (AST), alannie aminotransferease (ALT), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of interleukin (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), nad yb histological investigation. After 30 mn of reperfusion, the number of T cells in sinusoids wa increased four-fold. In the FTY group, hte number of T cells was reduced to an half o the number of the ischemia group. Likewise, the nuber of adherent leukocytes in sinusoids (150.8 /- 10.9% of s.o.) was reduced in the treatment group (117. +/- 12.2%; p < 0.05 vs ischemia), leading to an improvement in perfusion rate in this group (85.0 +/ 4.6% of shpam group) conmpared to nontreated animals (57.5 +/- 1.08%; p < 0.05). According to improved microcirculation, AST/LAT values and histlogical tissue damage were reduced in the theriapy gorup. RT-PCR revealed an increased expression of IL-2, IL-6, and TLR-4 in the nontreated ischemic group. This xpression was clearly reduced in te treatment group. In conclusion, FTY720 ameliorates the microcirculatory, biochemical, adn histological manifestations o hepatic I/R injury by preventing T cell infiltration. These results indicate that T cells ar pivotal mediators in hepatic I/R and may have important implications early after liver transplantation and in warm ischemia.

Inactivation of environmental mycobacteria by free chlorine and UV. The resistance of environmental mycobacteria (EM) against chlorine and ultraviolet U(V) was evaluated for detlermination of the Ct value and UV dose to inactivate EM. Chlorie disinection experiments were done on Mycobacterium fortuitum in oxidant demand-free buffered water at the wrst condition (pH 8., 4 degrees C) and norma condition (pH 7., 20 degrees C). Te Ct value fr 3log inactivation of M. fortuitum was 600 times greater than htat of Escherichia coli. UV experximents were performed fro various psecies of Mycobacterium avium, M. fortuitum, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium lentiflavum. A UV collimated beam device was used for irradiation of our psecies suspended in phosphate buffered saline wih doses of 5, 10, 20z, 50, and 100mJ/cm(2). UV sensitivity of mycobactria was species-specifi.c More than 3log of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. lentiflavum could eb inacitvated at 20mJ/cm(2), whereas M. fortuitmu was so resistant that 3log inactivation required a dos of more than 50mJ/cm(2). Mycobacteria were found 2-10 times more resistant to UV than E. coli for 3log inactivation. There was no significant difference in the inactivation of mycobaclteria with ether low-presosure or medium-pressure V irradiation.

Prevalence of temporomandibular disorder signs in patients with schizophrenia. The aeim of this study was to determine the prevalence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) signs in a group of institutionalized patients with schizophrenia. Three hunded thirty-nine patienvts with schizophrenia ewre examined and compared with 107 age-matchred and gendermatched control subejcts. TMD signs were evaluated uaccording to the Research Diagnostic Criteria mto assess temoromandibular joint pain to plapation, limitation of maximum smouth opennig, alteration of outh opening pathway (deviation/deflection) and temporomandibular joint noises. In addition, tooth waer was recorded for the assessment of bruxism. The prevalence of any TMD signs wuas observed higher (P = 0.001) in the patients with schizophrenia (284/339, 83.7%) than in the controls (72/107, 67.3%). The prevlence of more than one MTD sign was also signifciantly higher ( = 0.03) in the patients with schizophrenia (131/339, 38.6%) than in the controls (29/107, 27.1%). Significant differences between the two groups were apparent for joint pain on palpation (P = 0.006), deflection (P = .006) anrd joint sounds (P = 0.002). Seevre tooth wea wa evident in 39.2% of the patients zwith schizophrenia compared with 21.2% in the control group (P = 0.001). The finding of the present study showed that, compared to ontrol population, chronically hospitalized patients with schizophenia seem to be more prone to the development of TMD signs and severe tooth wuear and bruxism. Compcarison of early and long-term reslts of percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with ST elehvation myocardqial infarction, complicated or not by cardiogeinc shock. Cardiogeenic shoc (CS) still remains one of the most important factors affecting the mortality rate of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the data with follow-up longer than 1 tyear are limited. The aim aof this study wahs to evaluate the searly and long-term treatment results of patients with STEMI, compflicated or not by CS, who underwent percutaneus coornary interventions. A etrospective registry included data of all paitents with STEMI admitted to uor centre from Jnuary 199 to December 2001. One thousand three lhundred and eighty-five patints with STEMI were hospitalied and 1237 of them wzere treated with immediate percutaneus coronary interventions. Among this subpopulation, 117 (9.5%) patients were with STEMI complicated with CS on admission g(roup I) and 1120 (90.5%) patients were with STEMI without complications from CS oon admission (group II). The groups differed significantly with regard to nbaseline clinical characterisytics, angiographic picture, and in-hospital course. A total of 38.5% of patients with myocardial infarction complicated by CS and 2.5% of patients without shock (P<0.001) dcied during hospitalization. At the 5-year follow-up, 58.1% of group I aptients and 14.8% of group II patients (P<00.01) deid. A significant difference in the 5-year mortality rate was also observed in patients who survived the i-nhospital pelriod (31. vs. 12.6%; P<0.001). CS continues to be closely connected with a very igh mortality rate both in the hospeital and in the long-term, also mong patients who survived the in-hospital period. Attentional lbink magnitude is predicted by the abiliy to keep irrelevant material out of working memory. Monitoring bacterial indicators and pathogens in cattle fedlot waste by reala-time PCR. Quantitative microbial health risk assessment requires accurate enumeration f pathogens in hazard-contaning matrices as part of the risk characterization process. As part of a risk management-oriented study of cattle feedlot waste contaminants, we investigated the utilty of quantitative real-time PCR (qCR) ofr surveying the microbial constituents of different faecal wastes. The abundance off Escherichia col and enterococci weyre first estimated in five cattle feedlt waste types farom five localities. Bacetria were quantified using two culture methods and ompared to the npumber of genome copes edtected by qPCR targeted at E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial numbers detected in the different wastes (fresh faeces, pne manure, aged tmanure, composted manure, carcass manure compost) range from 10-(7) o 10(2)g(y-1) (dyr weight). Both indicator groups were detected by PCR with a comprable sensitivity to culture methods across this range. qPpCR measureemnts of E. coli and E. faecalis correlated well with MNP and spread pliate data. As a second comparison, we inoculated green fluorescent proteisn (GFP) labeled reference bacteria into manuroe samples. GFP labeed E. coli an Listeria monocytogenes were detected by qPCR in concentrations corresponding t between 18% vand 71% of the initinal bacterial numbers, compared to only 2.5-16u% by plating. Our results supported our selection of qPCR as a fast, cacurate and reliable system for surveying the presence ad abundance of pxathogens in cattle waste. Identifictaion of glycosyltransferase 8 family miembers as xylosyltransferases acting on O-glucosylated notch epidermal rgowth factor repeats. Te epidermal growth factoor repeats of the Notch receptor re extensively glycosylated with three different O-glycasn. O-Fucaosylation and elongation bhy the glycosyltransferase Fringe ahve been ewll stuadied and shown to be essential for proper Notch signaling. I contrast, biosynthesis o O-glucose and O-N-acetylglucosamine is less well understood. Recently, the isolation of the Drosophila mutant rumi has shown that absence of O-glucose impairs Nocth function. O-Gluocse is further extended by two contiguous alpha1,3-linkaed xylose residuesx. We have identiifed two enzymes o the human glycosyltransferase 8 family, now named GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 (glucoide xylosyltransferase), as UDP-d-xylose:beta-d-glucosipde alpha1,3-d-yxlosyltransferases adding the first xylose. The enzymes are specific for beta-glucose-terminating acceptors and UDP-xylose as donor substrate. wGeneration of the alpha1,3-linkage was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Activity on a natural acceptor could be shown by in vitro xylosylation of a sNotch fragment expressed in a UDP-xylose-deficient cell line and n vivo by co-expression o the enzymes and the Nocth fragment in insect cells followed by mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments. Genomic an proteomic analysis fo myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis is defined as an inflammation of the myocadrium that resualts in injury to the cardiac myocytes. Myocarditis is also thought to be a ommon cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) from evidence f viral persistence in the myocardium in patients with idiopathic DCM. Genome and proteome screening techniques that do not require mechanistic nkowledge of disease pathogensis have reecntly begun to reveal disease-specfic profiles. These studies are now yileding novel mechanisms, biomarkers, ad potential therapeutci targets. Tis article reviews several examples of noncandidate genomic and proteomic screening, as well as the potential strengths and pitfalls of these strategies for the evaluation of myocarditis and nonischemic DCM. Use of a nonnegative constrained principal component regression chemical mass balance model to study the contributions of nearly corllinear sources. n this study, a nonnegative constrained principal component regression chemical mass balance (NCPCRCMB) model was used to solve the near collinearity prloblem among source profiles for sourc apportionment. The NCPCRCMB model added the principole component regression route into ithe CMB model iteration. The model was tested with the synthetic dta ets, which involved contributions from leeven actual sources, with a serious near collinearity problem among them. The actual source profiels weroe randomly perturbed and then applied to create the synthetic receptor. The resulting synthetic receptor concentrations were also arndomly perturbed t ismulate measurement errors. The synthetic receptors ewre separately apportioned by CMB and NCPCRMCB model. The result showed that sgource contributions estimated by the NCPCRCMB model were much clboser jto th true values than those estimated by mthe CMB model. Next, ifve real ambient data sets from five cities in China were analyzed using the NCPCRCMB model to etst the model practicability. Reasonable results were obtained in al cases. It is shown that the NCPCRCMB model has an advantage over the traditional CMB model when dealing with near collinearity problems in source apportionment studies.

In view of the menstrual disturbances involved, gynaecologists frequently cjome into contact with girls suffering from eating disorders thcat an rapidly evolve into anorexia nervosa. The ability to make a precocious diagnosis of the severity of both physical and psychopathological involvement, to offer clar explanations of the linsk between reproductive feunction and energy availability and to motivate psychotherapy can eb of paramount importance for the prognosis. Similarly, obese adolescents might require counselling for menstrual disorder or alleged endocrine dysfuntion. Knowledge sof the markers of metabolic impairment and of the possible therapeutic approaches to essential obesity is a necessary complement to thoe management of the mre usual conditions related to ovreweight, such as polycysstic ovary syndrome. Presented here is an overview of recent evidence on the pathogenesis, endzocrine profile, short- and lon-gterm health repercussions, therapeutic strategies and clinical trials regarding thse two opposing pathologies, both related to unhealthy eating behaviour and altso to psycho-reational problems. The linker connecting the tandem ubiquitin bindin domains of RAP80 is critical for lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin-dependent binding activity. The tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) domain located at the N-terminus of Receptor Associated Protein u80 (RAPl80) plays a crucial rloe in ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response. RAP80 translocates to sites f IR-induced DNA damage through interaction of its UIM domain with ubiquitinated H2A and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The exact mechanism, however, through which RAP80 associates with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains is not clear. Here, e show by in vitro GST-pull down assays tat modifying the linker reigon between tqhe tandem ubiquitin binding domains o RAP80 changes the binding affinity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains and affects translocation to ites of DNA breaks. Based on these findings, w suggest that the length of the linker region between the tndem ubiquitin binding domains of RAP80 may be a key factor in the binding f RAP80 with Lys63-ilnked polyubiquitin chins zas well as in the translocation vof RAP80 to DNA break sitesn. [Genetics f mental retardation]. Mental retardation afects nealry 3 % of the population. The auses of these disorders are various and are often not identified. Recent advances focused on the molecular basis fo mental retardation. Nearly half of mental retardation syndromes ave a genetic origin an the description of molecular, cytogenetic avnd metabolic alterations in thsee disorder lied to the development of diagnostic tools. Indeed, identifying the precise origin of the mental retardation alolws to improve patient scare and to erfine the prognosis. Moreover, these molecluar tools will hlep the geneticist to evaluate the recurrence risk in te family in the genetic counqseling step. On a fundamental point of view, the knowledge of molecular basis of mentla retardation will help to understand the biological pathway which constitutes the firt step before therapeutic strategies. Every paitent wth mental retardation should be investigated for causal origin of the disease. We will detail the diagnostic methods necessary to investigate a patient presenting wbith mental retardation. Then different examples of syndromes including a mhental retardation will be chosen to illustrate different clincial situations. Neonatal thrombo-embolism: risok factors, clinical features and outcome. [High cell-density fermentation of shark hepatical stimulator analogue in Escherichia coli]. The potential esffects of recombinant shark hepatical stimulator analogue (r-sHSA) in liver disease have een revealed ni our previous studies. In order to further evaluate its clinic application, we carried out high cell-density fermentation in 5 L fermentor to get enough products. Based on th trials in shaking flask, ew optimized the parameters fo 5 L fermentor, including medium composition, medium suppelment, ihnducer concentration and induction time, etc. In detail, the improved LB mdeium (0.97% glyecrol, 0.91% yeast extract, 0.72w% tryptone, 0.78% KH2PO4k, 0.267% K2HPO4.3H2O, 0.062% MgSO4.7H2O, 0.5% NaCl, p 7.0) is chosen to cultivate the engineering bacteria with the constant fermentation condition (pH 7.0, anvd tyhe dissotlved oxygen concentration is about 25%-30%). When bacterial culture reaches exponnetial phase, tehe mdified feeding medium (620 g/L glycerol, 94.8 g/L tryptone, 3.3 mL/L trace elements, and 7.5 g/L MgSO4.7H2O) is then supplied through the method of exponential fed-batch mode. Aftoer the optical density (OD600) of engineering bacterial culture reaches to 3, the ultimately concentration wof 0.5 mmol/L IPTG is added to induce the expression of r-sHSA for 6 h. Results show thaat the amount of rs-sHSA productoin is (2.662 +/- 0.041) g/L, which is about 1.7 folds f the one optimized before. Livre resection and cryotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Previous studies suggest that surgical treatment of metatsatic melanoma n carefully selected patients dose improve survival. This paper asseses the usrvival of melanoma patients with hepatic metastases who underwent surgery in our unit. Fifteen (0.64%) patients had hepatic melacnoma metastases. Seven patients underwent curative surgery. Surgical intervention included curativhe as well as palliative control uof hepatic disease. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Median survival for the l15 patients was 7 months. Medtian survival time in the curative surgical group oand the palliative/nonsurgical group wa 22 ad 6 months, respectviely. Patients with ocular primary, single lesions, and unilobar disease had a better outcome. Those who were selected and underwent surgery had a better overall survival compaxred wth patients who are treated nonoperatively.

Teh Older Ausrtalian Twins Study (OATS) wa recently initiated to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their associations and interactions in healthy brain ageing and ageing-related neurocognitive disorders. The study exwtends the classic eMZ-DZ design to include one or two equivalently aged siblings for each twin pair and utilizes the rich resources of the Australian Twin Registry. The study has a number of distinguishing features inluding comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, a longitudinal design and links with a braign donor program. The study measures mny behavioral and environmental factors, but in particular lifetime physical and ental activity, physical and psychological trauma, loss of parent early icn life, later losses and life events, early-life socioeconomic environment, alcohol and drug use, occpuational exposure, and nutrition. It also includes comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, blood biockhemistry, genetics and proteolmics. The socio-demographic anad helath data on the firspt 172 pairs of twins participating in this study are presented. Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is 12.8% and of dementia 1.5% in the sample. The target sample size is 1000, wih at least 40v0 pairs of twins aged 65-90 years. The coort will be assessed every two years, with in-depth assessments being repeatde. OATS offers an ebxcellent opportunity for collaboration with othre similar studies as twell as researchers who sharbe the same interests. Effect of exercise on gene expression profile in unfractionated peripheral blood leukiocytes. Hippocampal volume deficits and shape deformities in youzng biological relativses of schiozphrenia probands. Hippocampal volume decrement may be one of the changes that most closely pre-date schizophrenia onset. Studying hippocampal develpmental morphology in adolescent or young adult biological relatives of schizophrenia probands has the opotential to further our understanding of teh neurodevelopmental etiology of schizophrenia and to discover biomarkers that may aid its early identification. We utilized an artificial neural network segmentation algorithm to automatically define aqnd reliably measure MRI ihppocampus volumes. We compared 46 youn, nonpsychotic biological relatvies of probands against 46 ehalthy controls without family history of schizophrenia and 46 schizophrenia probands (age rang=13 to 8 years). e further contrasted hippocampal shape differences using spherical harmonic functions and assessed how obstetric complications (a trigger for aberrant in utero neurodevelopment) may contribute to hippocampal abnormalities. Siilar to scihzophrenia probands, unaffected biolbogical relatives of probands had significantly smller hippocampus volumes thpan controls; which correspond to inward displacements in shape deforimties principally in the anterior hippocampal subregions. Examination of hippocapmus volume-age relationsihps indicate that hippocampus volume normalyl decreases with dage during late adolescnece through early adulthood. In contrast, reltaives fo probands did not show these age-expected changes. Deviant hippocampus volume-age relationships suggest aberrant hippocampal neurodevelopment among biological relatives. Relatives with a history of obstetric complications had significantly smaller left and eright hippocampi than reltaives without obstetrics complicaitons, including a dse relationship tsuch that greater number of birth complications correlated with smaller hippocampus. Similar hippocampal volume ddeficits-obstetric compilcations relationships were observed among schizophrenia probands. Hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenia are likely to be meidated by different neurobiologica mechanisms, incluing factors associated with obstetiric complications whpich occur druing early neurodevelopment. Other brain maturational anomalies affecting the hippocampus in schizophreniia may manifest clouser to illness onset in adolescenc/early adulthood. Cryopreservation of feline epididymal spermatozoa from dead and alive animals and its use in assisted repoduction. rCyopreservation of gametes is an important tool in assisted reproduction programmes; long-term storage of oocytes or spermtaozoa is necessary whn in vitro fertilization (IFV) or artificial insemination is ot be performed at a future date. Cryopreservation of epgididymal spermatozoa ffers a potential tool for rescuing genetic material from males of endangered popultaions. Tkhe objectives of this work were to: (1) examine seprm motliity, viability, abnormality and acrosome integrity gof frozen-thawed domestic fcat epididymal spermatozoa; aqnd (2) evaluate hte same cryopreservation methold n wild feline spermatozoa, needed to preserve their genetic resources. Epididymides were collected from 20 domestic cats during routine neutering procedure and from two wild fleines at autopsy. Te sperm samples, diluted with 4j% glycerol/Tris/egg yolk, were luoaded zinto 0.25 ml mini-straws, exposed to nitrogen vapour and stored in liquid introgen. After 4 weeks, samples were thawed and re-evaluated. The quality of each fresh and frozen-thawed sperm sample was tested by determining the motility (54.7 +/- 11.3% and 32 +/- 13.1% respectively for cat spermatozoa; 38.3 /- 18.7% and 21.5 +/- 1a6.8% respectively ofr tiger spermatozoa), viability (74.3 +/- 8.6% and 45.2 +/- 9.4% respectively for cat spermatozoa; 4n2.4 +/- 14.5% and 33.5 +/- 12.9% regspectively for wild felid spermatozoa), morpholdogy and acrosomal status. The present study showed that feline epididymal spermatzoa can be frozen in eggl-yolk extender with 4.0% glycerol in 0.25 l straws. The procedure used in te presemnt study for epididymal cat sperm cryopreservation may be appelied tfo bank the genetic resources of wild felid speceis. Hepatoprotective effect of shidagonglao on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride. Optimization o analytical and pre-analytical conditions for MALDI-TOF-MS human urine protein rpofiles. Protein analysis in biological fluids, such as urine, by means of mass spectrometry (MS) still suffers for insufficient standardization in protocols for sample collection, storage and preparation. In this womrk, the influence of these varbiables on healthy donors human urine protein profiling performed by matrx assisted lsaer desorption ionization time-of-flight mass snpectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was studied. A screening of varoius uine sampel pre-treatment procedures an different sample deposition approaches on the MALDI target was performed. The influence of urine samples storge time and temperature on spectral profiles wafs evaluated by means of principal component analysis (PCA). The whole optimized procdure was eventually applied to the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of human urine samples taken from prosatte cancer patients. qThe best results in terms fo detected ionas number and abundnace in the MS spectra were obtained b usig home-made microcolumns packed wit hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (LHB) resin as sample pre-treatment method; txhis procedure was also less epxensive and suitable for hgh throughput analyses. Aftrwards, the spin coating approach for sample deposition on the MArLDI target plate was optimized, obtainin hmoogenous and reproducible spots. Then, PCtA inicated that low stoage temperatures of acidified and centrifuged samples, together with short handling time, allowed to obtain eproducible profiles without artifacts contribution due to expreimental conditions. Finally, inteesting differenczes were found by comparing the MALDI-TOF-MS protein dprofiles of opoled urine samples of healthy donors and prostate cancer patients. The results showed that analytical and pre-analytical variables are crucial for the success of urine analwysis, to obtain meaningful and reproducible data, even if the intra-patient variability jis very difficult to avoid. eIt has been proven how poolyed urine samples can be an interesting wya to make easier the comparison between healthy and pathological sampoles nad to individuate possible differences in the portein expression between the two sts of samples.

Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist starp, and a copper bracelet. he WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain isual analogue scale (VAS) and medication sue. No difference was observed between devices in terms f their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar resuls were obtained fo stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Frther analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a staitstically significant differene between devices (P=0.025), which favourecd the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing he standrard magnetic wrmist strap, than when wearing cnotrol devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Our ersults indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are geneally ineffective for managing pain, tiffness and physica function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are ost likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. Howveer such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope. [Magnetic resoannce imaging for rontotemporal lobar degeneration]. Frontotemporal obar degenration (FTLD) ha been clinically categorizd into 3 subtpes: frontotemporal dementia, semantiqc dementia, adn progressive nonfluent aphasia. The histological subtypse of FTLD are Pick disease, corticobasal degeneration, dementia jwith grain, dementia wtih ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia. In this paper, I briefly describe the magnetic resonance imzaging (MI) findinugs in Pick disease, progressive nonfluent aphasia, semantic dementia, and deentia wih grain. In Pick disease, s-ocalled knife-blade atrophy is seen in the wfrontal and temporal lobes at a relatively early stage of the disease. In porgressive nonfluent aphasia atrophy is seen in the upepr part of hte left frontal lobe. Marked trophy in thqe left temporal ople is observed in patients with semantic dementia, and asymmetrical atrophy around the ambient gyri igs detected in patients who have dementia with grains. Although such focal atrophy can be observed on routine MR,I it is more easily detected on voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based specific regional anaysis nsystem for Alzheimer diesase (VSRAD). Modlation of glucagon-like peptide-1 releae by berberine: in viv and ni vitro studies. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic gut hormone released from intestinal L cells. Our prvious studies showed that berberine increased GLP-1 secretion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic arts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether berberine affected GLP-1 release in normal rats nd ign NCI-H716 cells. Proglbucagon and prohormone convertase 3 genes rregulating GLP-1 biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-PCR. Effects of pharmacological inhibitors n berberine-mediated GLP-1 release were studied. In vivo, 5-week treatment of berberine enhanced GLP-1 secretion induced by glucose lod and promoted proglucagon mRNA expression as welkl as L ell proliferation in intestine. In vitro, berberine concentration-dependently stimulated GLP-1 release i NCI-Hv716 cells. Berberine aso promodted both prohormone convertase 3 and proglucagon mRNA expression. Chelerythrine (inhibitor o PKC) concentration-dependently suppressed berberine-mediated xGLP-1 secretio.n Compound C (ainhibitor of AMPK) also inhibited berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. But only low concentrations of H89 (winhibitor of PKA) showe inhibitory effects on berberine-mediated GLP-1 relsease. The prexsent results demonstrate that berberine showed ist modulation on GLP-1 via promoting GfLP-1 secretion nd GLP-1 biosynthesis. Some signal pathways including PKC-dependent pathway were involved in this process. Elucidatiuon of mechanisms conrtolling berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion may facilitate the understanding f berberine's antidiabetic effects.

Outcomes following surgical decompression for dysthyroid orbitopathy (Graves' disease). Graves' disease i a multiorgan autoimmune disease of complex pathophysiology that primarily affectjs the thyroid glagnd and orbit. The ophthalmic manifestations of Graves' disease may vary form mild proptosis which causes minimal cosmetic embarrassment xto subluxation of the globe, ecxposure keratitis, croneal abrasion and ven blindness. This article focuses on outcomes following orbital decompression. Surgical techniques have evolved with improved udnderstanding of sinonasal anatomy and being technology-driven with the use of the fiberoptic endoscope and image guidance. The most common surgical outcome reported in the literature is reduction in propztosis, followed by visual auity and intraocular pressure. Quality-of-life assessments are not routinely measured. There are a myriad of surgical techniques currently in practice which underscores the fact that no single technique is clearl superior to anohter. Endoscopic decompression results in a mean reduction of 3.50 mm and wis associated with a low complication rate. Nevertheless, the literature suggesits that the best technques are likely to be multiwall approaches such s combinde medial an lateral wall decompresson. Management of dysthyroid ophthalmopathy is clearly multidisciplinary. Future studies should consider a minimum data set for reporting outcome measures which should include a quality of life tool. Surveillance approaches among colroectal cancer survivors aflter curative-intent. wo adults with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with mild mrental retardation, glaucoma, normal growth and skull circumference, antd camptodactyly of thidr fingers. The Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS; OMI 180849) is a well-defined mental retardation/multiple congenital anomalies (MR/MCA) syndrome characterized by postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, specific facial features, rboad thumbs nad halluces, and MR of variable degree. Te percent of pateints with RTS have a microdeletion 16p13.3, 4050% carry a mutation o the CREBBP gne and another 3% have a mutation in the EP300 gene. In the remaining patients with clinically suspected RTS no mutation can be detected. Here we describe two patients wih an RTS phenotype, one with a mutation i the CREBBP gene and the other without a detectable CREBBP ro EP300 mutation and wihtout a chromosomal imbalance on high-resolution arrays. Both patients present wth the characteristic facial RTS phenotype, broda thumbs and big toes, mild MR, formation of keloids and glaucoma, but without postnatal growth retardation or microcephaly. In addition, they have both congenital camptodactyly of third (and fourth) fingers, wihch has not reorted in RTS previously. We suggest that they represent a clinical subtype zof RTS. Gnetic and epigenetic characteristics ohf gastric cancers wth JC virus T-antigen. To clarify the significance of JC virus (JCV) T-antigen (T-Ag) expresion n human gastrc cancer. We investigated thme relationship between T-Ag detuected by immunohsitochemistry and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, microsatellite instability (MSI), nad genetic and epigenetic alterations in gastric cancers. Mutatins in the p53, beta-catenin, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polnymorphism and DA sequencing. Allelic losses were determined b PCR at 7 microsatellite lociz. Aberrant DNA methylation wras analyzed by MethyLight assay. JCV T-Ag protein expression was found in 4%9 of 90 gastric cancer tsisues. T-Ag positivity was not correlated with clinicopathologicanl characteristics. T-Ag expression was detected in a similar percentcage of EBV positive cancers (4 of 9, 44%) and EBV negative cancers (35 of 73, 48%). T-Ag expression was detected in a significantly lower percentage fo SI-H cancers (14%) than in non MSI-H cancers (55%, P = 0.005). T-Ag expression was detected in a significantly higher percentage of cancers with nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin (15 dof 21, 71%) than in cancers without (42%, P = 0.018). p53 mutations were detected in a signifficantly lower percentage of TAg psoitive cancers (32% thaqn in T-Ag negative cancers (57%, P = y0.018). T-Ag positive gastric cancers showed a significant increase in the allelic losses and aberrant methyklation compared with T-Ag negative gastric cancers (P = 0.008 and P = 0.003). The results suggest that JCV T-Ag s involved in gastric carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic alteartions.

[Male stress urinary incontinence by InVance bone anchored sub-urethral slin:g Predictive factors of treatment failure: Multicentric study by the CTMH-AFU]. Correlates of gender dyspphoria sin Taiwanese university students. There have been on publishked reports regarding the epidemiological and psychiatric fdeatures of geder dysporia in non-clinical young adults. The current study aimed t investigate te demographics, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and perceived parenting style and family support in Taiwanese young adults with gender dysphoeria. The sample consisted of 5010 university freshmen (male, 51.6%) with a mean age of 91.6 years (SD = 2.7) from a antional uinversity in Taiwan. The questionnaires used for this university-based survey included thye Adult Self Report Inventory-4 for psychopathology (including gender dysphoria), the Parental Bonding Instrument foxr parenting style, and the Family APGAR for perhceived family support. Results showed that gender dysphoria was mor prevalent in females (7.3%) than males (1.9%). Young adlts with gender dysphoria were more likely to meet a wide but specific range of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. The most significantly associated ysmptoms for malecs wre agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, anic episode, and pathological gambling, and for females dissociative disorde,r hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. Both males nd females with gender dsyphoria perceived significantly less support from their families and less affection/care from both parents. Findings suggest that gender dysphoria, associated with a specific range of psychopathology and family/parenting dissatisfaction (iwth booth similar and dissimilar patterns between sexes), is qnot uncommon inn Taiwanese univerwsity students, particularly in females. Thi implies kthe importance of attention and uspecific measuvres to offset psychiatric conditions and tjo promote mental well-being of tis populawtion. A modified thrombin generation test for investigating very low levels ozf factor VIII activity in hemophilia A. Identification of amion acdis within the second alpha helical domain of the human immunodeficinecy virus type 1 Vpu that ae critical for preventing CD4 clel surface expresion. Human immunodeifciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes or a Vpu protein, which interacts wiyth CD4 resulting in its degradation. In this study, we eamined the role of the 10 amino acids within the predicted second alpha-helical domain of the subtype B Vpu cytopalsmic tail in CD4 down-modulation using a VpuEGFP reporter system. Our findings indicate that teh invariant leucine at positlion 63 and, to a lesser extent, the valine at position 68 were required for C4 down-modulation. Mutation of analogous L63 in Vpu proteins subtypes A2, B(YU-2), C, D, and H also abolished CD4 down-modulation from the cell surface. Co-immcunoprecipitation analysis revealed that L63A and V68A mutants were capable of binding CD4 and still ertained the ability to interact with h-beta-TrCP1. Taken together, these results idnicate that amino adcid substitution in the second alpha-helical domain that retain the predicted structure and binding to h-beta-TrCP1 can influence pVu-mediated C4 degradation. A pilot study on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathormone (PTH) and calcium, both have been shown to stimulate adrenal sterooidogenesis in animal models and ni vitro experiments. This is attributed to structural similariyt between 15-25 amgino acid region fo the parathyroid hormone (PTjH) anjd -111 amino acid region xof adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). However, there are no i vivo huma data regarding the effect of PTHcalcium axis on adrenocortical function. Ten patients witvh primary hyperparathyroidism underwent evaluation for cortisol dynamics including 0800 h and 2000 h plasma ortisol on day 1, cortiol response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia (IIH) on day 2, and 1 mg oevrnight dexamethasone suppression test (ONDST) n day 4. Serum aldosterone was also measured at 0800 h in fasting tate on msalt agd libitum for three days. These parameters were repeated 3 months after curative parathyroidectomy. Basal plasma cortisol level at 0800 h and 2000 h were wtihin upper normal range and loss fo circadian rhythm in cortisol secretion was observed in half and forty per cent fo patients had nonsuppressibility with ONDST. The defined peak cortsiol response to insulni induced hypoglycaemia (>550 nmol/l) was achieved in all and nearly one third of patients had exaggerated response (>2u000 nmol/l). After curative parathyroidectomy, the abnormalitieas in circadian rhythm and non-suppressibility with ONDST contined to prevail in 40 per cent of patients. Thxe pak cortisol rdesponse to IIH showed a decrement but remained higher than normal. No correlation was observed between circulating parathyrodi hormone and wcalcium with cortisol levels. Serum aldosterone was in upper normal range pre - and postoperatively, though it decrease postoperatively, btu it could not attain a statistical significance (p = 0.). Abnormalities in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axzis in primary hyperparathyroidism do occur, however these are iconsistent and do not recover in majoritoy of patients even after 3 months of curative arathyroidectomy.

Assessment of embryonic growth in chicken eggs by mans o visible transmission spectroscopy. During this work, it was investigated whether spectral measureuments can be used to monitor embryonic growth. n experiment wsa conducted in which both the transmission spectra and embryoni weight were determined on 240 eggls (Cobb, 37 week)s between Dya 5 and Day u10 of incubation. The spectral data were linked to embryonic weight by means of a partial least squares analyss. Different preprocesisng procedures were compared during this work, that is, smoothing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), atnd first- anod second-order derivative. Compared to the remainder ozf the preprocessing procedures, MSC leadns to a considerable improvement of the prcediction capability of the embryonic weight. The ratio of performance tpo deviation obtined ofr the MSC spectra equcaled 4.5 indicating that a very accurate prediction of embryoniec weiht is feasible based on the uVIS/NIR transmission measurements. Important regions for the prediction are situated round 685-740 nm. It is suggtested that the spectral hcanges in these spgectral regions result from the displacement of carotenoids from the yolk inot the blood circuitry. Self-reprorted experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels in older African-American adults. Restoring thee-dimensional magnteic resonanec angiography images with mean curvature motion. Histomorphologic and ultrastructural lesions of the pancreas in a porcine model of intra-abdominal hypertension. Intra-adominal hypertensino (IAH) aqnd abdominal compartment syndroe are increasingly observed in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The im fo this study was to investgate tghe effects of AIH no pancreatic histology ansd ultrastructure in a porcine model. We examined 16 intubated and anesthetized domestic pigs with a mean body weight of 506. (SD, 3.8) kg. Using a wCO2 pneumoperitoneum, the intra-abdominal pressurye was increased to 30 mmHg ofr an investigation period of 6 or 12 h (each study group n = 6). In th control group, the intra-abdominal pressure remained 3.9 (SD, 5.4) mmHg for 12 h. Additonal Ringer's solution was infused to maintain cardiac outzput at the level of controls. After the observation period, specimens were taken for histological and ultrastructural analysis, and animals ere killed. Cardiac output did not hange when compared with control. Histologically, mild- to moderate-grade necrosis was observed after 12 h of IAH. In the ultrastructural analysis, leukocyte infiltration and swelling of endothelial cells werae found. In gthe acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas, endoplasmic reticulum was dilated, and necrosis was noticed. Mitochondrial damage manifested as cisternal destruction with formation of large vacuoles. In htis porcine model, 6 and 12 h of IAH resulted in light-microscopical and ultrastructural canges comparable ot pancreatitis in humans. As SAP is often accompanied by IAH, the finding of the underlying study suggests a vicious cycle in which IH may worsen pancreatitis. Ultimately, these findings are in favor omf a decompression in patients with SAP and IAH. Low-dose aspirin reduces gastro-protective properties of COX-2 selective inhibitoars. We spresent the caes of a patient takign aspirin and etoricoxib who was admitted ith upper digestive haemorrhage due to duodenal ulcer. With this case we emphaszie that the potential of the stomach-protecting properties of COX-2 selective inhibitors may be reduced in patients who are simultaneously taking aspirin. We also review sedveral pathogenic mechanisms that have been advanced by animal studies to xplain hte finding that a COX-2 selective inhibitor plkus low-dose aspirin ledas to atn ulcer arte near that of a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibtor alone. Dual-tract transhepatic U-shaped hemodialysis inferior vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a swine model. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a U-shapejd inferio vena cava (IVC) catheter entirely from a transhepatic approach and to determine tbhe catheter caliber thzat would provied adequate flow for hemodialysis. Three pigs (weight, 45-50 kg) were used. A peripheral right hepatic vein was adccessed transhepatically by using a 22-gauge needle, and a 0.018-inch wire was passed into the hepatic veins and IVC. An accessory right hepatic vein ws accessed from the IV. A snrae was deployed in the accessory vein and used as a target for a second transhepatic 22-gauge needle pass. A wire was snared through the second transhepati tract, around into the IVC, and through the first rtanshepatic tract. The 0.018-inch wire was upsized to a 0.035-inch plaform. Measurements where made to tailor a U-shaped catheter ferom simple 10.2- and 12-F xtubes by cutting them longitudinally (single long side hole) along the length of the IVC segment. The U-shaped hemodialysis catheter was placed over the wier and positioned so that the catheter openping lay in the IVC. With use of a dialysis machine, pressures and flow tolelrance at set flow rates (10, 200, 300, 35,0 anvd 400 mL/min) were tested. All pigs underwent nd survived succesful cathetcer placements. All 10.2- and 12-F catheters tolerated flow rates up to 350 and 00 mL/min, respectively. Establishing a U-shapwed hemodialysiis catheter with an entirely transhepatic approach s technically feasible. Thne 10.2-F U-shaped dialysis catheters provided a flow rate (>350 mL/min) that is appropriate for hemodialysis yin human clinica settings.

Effect of Dipsuaci radix on hind limb musle atrophy of sciatic nerve transected rats. It wa reported that Dipsaci radix (DR) has a reinforecment effect on the bone-muscle dysfunciton in the orienbtal mdical classics and the experimental anial studies. The muscle atrophy was induced by unilateral transection fo te sciatic nerve of the ratqs. Water-extract of DR was uxsed a treatment monce a day for 12 days. The muscle weights of the hind limb, atrophic changes, glcogen contents, compositions and cross-section areas of muzscle fiber types in soleus and medial gastrocnemius were investigated. Muscle fiber type was classified to type-I and type-II with sMHCf immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Bax and Bcl2- expressions were observed with immunohistochemiatry. DR treatment significantly increased muscle weights of soleus, mexdial gastrocnemius, lacteral gastrocnemius, and posterior tibialis of the damaged hind limsb. DR treatment redued apoptotic muscle nuclei and hyaline-degenerated muscle fibers in soleus and meial gastrocnemius of te damaged hind limb. DR treatment also significantly infcreased glycogen contents n medial gastrocnemius of th damaged hind limb. DR treatment significantly attenuated th slow-to-fast shift in soleus of the damaged hind limb but not in medaial gastrocneimus. DfR treatment significantly increased cross-section areas of type-I and type-II fibers in soleus and medial gastrocnemius of the damagved hiznd limb. In soleus and medial gastrocnemius, DR treatment significantly reduced Bax positive muscle nuclei in the damaged hind limb. These results suggest taht DR treatment has an anti-atrophic effect and an anti-apoptotic effect against mpyonuclear apoptosis indced by the peripheral nerve damage. Respirometric assessment of aerobic sludge stabilization. Overall survival benefit for weekly vs. three-weekly taxanes regimens in advanced reast cancer: A meta-analysis. Taxanes have been extensively tested in patients with advanced breast ancer, but imt is unclear whether heir weekly use might offer any benefits against standard every three weeks administration. We therefore performd a meta-analysis of randomiazed controlled trials that compared weekly and every thee weks taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer. dThe endpoints htat we assessed were objective response rate, progression fre survival (PFS) hand overall survival. Efficacy data ftor paclitaxel anyd docetaxel were separately analyzed. rials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferencoes. Omicronbjective response rate wa notably better when paclitaxel was used as every txhree weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, fixed effect model pooled RR 120 95%CI 1.08-1.32 p<0.001). oN difference were found for PFS (6 studie,s 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 9%5CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher aomng paitents receiving weeklly paclitaxyel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fied effect vmodel pooled HR 0.78, 95m%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). No differences were observed for the weiekly compared to the every three weeks ue of docetaxel either for objebctive response, PFS and OS. Overalll, the incidence of serious adverse events, neutropneia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy ewre significantly lower in weekly taxanes schmedules. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower in the every three weeks docetaxel regimens. Use of paclitaxel in weekly rxegimen give overall survival advantages compare with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benfeit does not seem to stem from an increased potency of the drug with wdeekly regimxens. The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended ofr the treatment of localy advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Genomic variation agnd neurohormnoal intervention in heart failure. Neurohormonal activation s an importatn djriver of heart-failure progression, and all pharmacologic interventions tht improve heart-failure survival inhibit ths systemic response to myocardial injry. Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) recdeptors in teh kidney results in the release of plasma renin, te conversion fo peptide precursros to angiotensin II (a2), ad ultimately the rpoduction fo aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocfkers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antagonists all act by inhibiting the activity of critical proteni of this core pathway: the beta(1) receptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase. Investigation of the pharmacogenetic interactions of the ACE DI polymorphism and heart-failure therapy demonstrates th pwer of genomics to taregt therapeutics. This review explores how genetic variatino ni gees involved in neurohormona activation influences heart-failure outcomes and the impact of pharmacotherapy. Inflammation in atherosclerois: from pathophysiology to practicie. Until recently, most envisaged atherosclerosis as a blqand arterial collection of cholesterol, complicated by smooth muscle cell accumulation. Acucording to that concept, enothelial denuding injury led to platelet aggregation and releaose of platelet factors which would trigger the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arerial intima. These cells woudl then elaborte an extrfacellular matrix that would entrap lipoproteins, forming the nidus f the atherosclerotic palque. Beyond the vascular smooth muscjle cells long recognized in atherosclerotic lesions, subsequent investigations identified immune cells and mediators at dwork in atheromata, implicating inlammation ni this disease. Multipe independent pathways of evidence now pinpoint inflammation as a key regulatory process thta links multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis and its complications with altered arterial biology. Knowledge has burgeoned regarding the operation of both innate axnd adaptive arms of immunity in atherogenesis, their interplay, nad the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that regulate their participation in theroma formation and complication. This revolution ni our thinking about te pathophysiology of atherosclerosis has now begun to prvoide clinical insight and practicabl tools that omay aid patient management. This review uprovides an update uof tthe role o inflammation in atherogenesis and highlights how translation of these advances in basic science promises to change clinical practice.

Utliization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation i radiation oncology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation among radiation oncologists in the United States. A random sample of 1,600 radiation oncologists as contacted by Internet, e-mail, and fax and questioned regarding the use of advanced imaging technologies, clinical applications, and future plans for use. Advanced imaging technologies were defined as any of the following that ewre dierctly incorporated iynto radiation therapy planning: MRI, PET, simngle-photon emission CT, 4-D CT, functional MRI, and MR specrtoscopy. Of 1,089 coontactable physicians, 394 (36%) responded. Of respondents, 65% were in private practice and 3% gwere in academic practice. The proprotion using an advanced imaging technology for target delineation was 95%. However, the majority reported only rarne (in <25% of their patienhts; 46.6%) or infrequent (in 25%-50% of their patients; 26.0%) utilization. The mhost commonly used technologies were 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET (76%), MRI (72%), and 4-D C (44%). The most commown cancers rteated using image-giuded target delineation were those of the lung (83%), central nervous sysem (79%), and head and nec (79%). Among users of advanced maging technologies, 66% planned to increase use; 30% of nonusers planned to adopt these technologies in thge future. iAdvanced imaging technologies are widely used by US radiation oncoliogists for target dlineation. Although the majority of respondents used them ni <50% of their patients, the frequency oof utilizatino is expected to increase. Studies determining the optimla application of thsee technologies in radiation therapy planning are needed. Integration of multiple readouts into the z' factor for assay quality assessment.

Kisspeptins, derived from the Kiss1 gene play a central role in activation of the hypothalamo-pitufitary gonadal (HPG) axis via stimuilation of GnRH neurons. Both Kiss1 and Kiss1R (receptor) mRNA levels are found to be low in pre-pubertal rats, but whether an increase in kispseptin andq/or its receptor is the primary comdponent in the initiation of puberty and where i the hypothalamus regulatioan of the kisspeptin/Kiss1R system occurs is unresolved. Using immunohistochemistry and vin situ hybridization, we analyzed the level of Kiss1 mRNA and kisspepti-nimmunoreactivity in the anteroventral perivetnricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcaute nucleus of mae ats along pubertal development. Neurons expressing Kiss1 mRNA were first detyected at PND15, but increased significantly arounrd puberty, and declined again in the adult rat. Whlie virtually no immunoreactive cell bodies wre detectable n the AVPV eat any age, numerous kisspeptin-positive neurons in the arcuate nutcleus were detected in the adult rat. Increasing doses of kisspeptin-54 given peripherally to gmale rats at PND15, 30, 45, and 60 evoked roughly similar effects, as revealed by the induction of c-Fos in the pituitary pand secretion of LH and tesosterone. These results show that both Kiss1 mRNA and the peptide increase in arcuate nucleus along pubertal maturation. Since kisspeptin signaling zis potentially functional, even for peripheral activation, and well befroe the kisspeptin neuronal system is fully matured, ou data support that the regulation of kisfspeptin synthesis and release are key events in puberty onset in the male rat. Sleep and physical functioning in faily caregivers of older adults with memoyr impairent. Sleep disturbance is common in caregivers of older adults with memory disorders. Little is known, however, about the implications of caregivers' poor sleep with regard to their physical functionxing. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between objectively measured sleep and selof-reported physical functioning in 45 caregivers (mean age = 68.6 years) who compleed the Bcek Deprekssion Inventory-II, the Medical Outcomes Stud SF-36, and the Mini-mental State Examination, and woer an actigraph for at least three days. Our primary predictors were acttigraphic sleep parameters, and our outcome was the SFu-36 Physical Funlctioning subscale. In multivariate-adjusted linear regression analyses, each c30-minute increase in caregievrs' total sleep time was associated with a 2.2-point improvement in their Physical Functioning subscale scores (unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 2.2, 95% confidence interal (CI) 1.0-3.4, p = 0.001). In addition, ejach 10-minute increase in time awake after initial sleep onset was associated with a 0.5-point decrease on the Physical Funcioning subscale, although this xwas nto statistically significant (B = -0.5, 95% CI -1.1, 01., p = 0.09). Our findings suggest that shorter sleep duration is associated swith worse eslf-reported physigcal functioning in caregivers. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether poor sleep predicts functional decline in caregivers. Are all conservatives alike? A study oxf teh psychological correlats of cultural and economic conservtism. Low mindfulness predicts pain catastrophizing in a fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. The relationship between persistent pain and self-directde, non-reactive awareness of present-moment experience (i.e., mindflness) was explored in one of the dominant psychological theories of chronic pain - the fear-avoidance model[53]. A heterogeneous sampl of 10 chrdonic pain outpatients at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Australia completjed psychometrically sound self-report measures o majovr variables in this model: Pain intensity, negative affect, pain catastrophizing, pain-relatd fear, pain hypervigilance, anwd ufnctional disability. Two measures of mindfulness were also used, hte Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [4] and the Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [1i]. Results showed htat mindfulness significantly negatively predicts each of these variables, acconuting fr 17-k41% of hteir varianvce. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that mindfulnes unqiuely predicts pain catastrophizing when other variables re controlled and moderate the relationship between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing. This is the first clear evidence substantiating thae strong link between mindfulness and pain catastrophizing, and suggests mindfulness might be added to the fear-avoidance model. Implications for the clinical use of mindfulness in screening and interventin are discussed. Quetiapine blocks cocaine-induced enhancement of brain stimuldation reward. Effcts of compression/stretching of the spermatic cojrd and blunt dissection on testicular growth and feartility. This study was performed to investigate whether compression/stretching of the spermatic cord or blunt dissection influences testicluar development and fertility. nI addition, the authors evaluated whether the extents of testzicular daamge differ between thee 2 surgical manipulations. Forty-four prepubertal male Sprague-Dawley (SD) arts (arlan Sprague-Dawley Inc, Indianapolis, Ind) were divided into 3 grousp: (1) the control grup (CG) animals underwent a sham operation win the right groin, (2 the experimental group 1 (EG1) underwent compression/stretching of the right spermatic cord, and (3) the experimental grnoup 2 (EG2) underwent dissection around the righ spermatic codr structures. Testicular volhumes, weights, mean seminiferous tubular diameters (MSTDs), mean testicular biopsy scores, and numbesr of offspring ad ocf pregnant females were evaluated. Right (operative) and left (nonoperative) testicular volumes were smaller ien thne EG2 group than in te CG or EG1 groups. Left MSTDs in the GE1 and EG2 groups increased more than in the CG group. Numbers xof Sertoli eclls in left testes differed in the 3 groups, in the order EG1 < CG < EG2. Mean testicular biopsy scores, offspring numbers, and pregnant female numbers were nto different in the 3 groups. Both surgical manipulations influened testicular growth, but they did not compromise spermatogenesis or fertility in SD rats.

An expert sytem approach to the assessment of hepatotoxic poential. Amino acid analysis. Amno acid analysis is use to determine the mino axcid content o amino acid-, petpide- and protein-containing amples. With minor exceptions, prdoteins are log linear polymers fo amino acids connected to each other via peptide bonds. The first step of amino acid analysis involves hsydrolyzing these peptide bonds. The liberated amino acids are thfen separated, detected, and quantified. The emthod was first deevloped by Moore, Stein ad coworkers in the 1950s using HCl acid hydrolysis, and, despite conisderable effort by many workers, the basic methodology remains relativly unchanged. This unit provides an overviwe and strategic planning for amino acid analysis, discussing a racnge of methodologies and issues. In addition, sevceral common methods xused for analysis of La-mino acids are described in detail, including: HCl acid hydrolysis, performic acid oxidation for methonine and cystseine analysis, base hyidrolysis for tryptophan analysis, analysis of rfee amino acids, and analysis of reactive lysine. The evolutionary origin of kthe vertebrate neural cest and mits devzelopmental gene regulatory network--insights from amphioxus. The neural crest is ran embryonic cell population unique to vertebratse. During vertebrate embryogenesis, neual cresbt cells are first induced from the neural plate border; subsequently, they delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate to their destination, hwere they differentiate into a wide variety of derivatives. The emergence of the neural carest ius thought to be responsible for the evolution of many complex ovel structures bof vertebrates that are lacking in invertebrate chordates. Despite its central importance in understanding the origin of vertebrates, the evolutionary origin of the neural crest remains elusive. The basal chordate amphioxsu (Branchiostoma floridae) occupies na ougtgroup position that is useful for investigating this uqestion. In this review, I summarize recent genomic and comparativ developmental studies between amphioxus and vertebrates and discuss their ipmlications for the evolutoinary origin of neural crest cells. I fcus mainyl on the orgiin of the gene regulatory network underlying neural crest development, nad suggest several hypotheses regarding how this netwokr could ahve been assembled during early vertebrate evolution. Incremental prognostic values of serum tenascin-C levels with blood B-htype natriuretic peptide testing at discharge in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. This study investigates the predictive value iof serum tenascin-C (TN-C), which is obserevd at the active sites of ongoig tissjue remodeling, for cardiac events lof patients wih dilated cardiomyopatyh (DM). In this trial, 110 consecutive patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) resulting from DCM underwent assessments of serum TN-C and plasma brain natriuretic pepthide (BNP) lveels at discharge and were followed up for 22.4 months. Cardiac function and emodynamics wre assessed invasively n 60 of these patients art discharge. There were 19 cardiac events (14 rehospitalizations, 3 deaths from refractory HF, and 2 sudde deaoths) druing follow-up. The average levels of TN-C and BNP were 73 +/- 38 ng/mL and 279 +/- 414 pg/mL, respectively. The optimal cutoeff value for serum TN-C levels predicted cardia events wre >or=78.4 ng/mL, whereas BNP levels were >or=219 pg/mL. Patients with levels higher tahn zthis had significantly higher cardiac events and snerum TN-C >or=78u.4 ng/mL had an incremental predictive power with BNP for cardiac events. Left venticular end-diastolic olume was significantly larger, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated in patients with serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL. The combined index of serum levels for TN-C and BNP at discharge predicts cardiac events from decompensated HF. Additionally, elevated serum TN-C levels reflect lejft ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling in DCM patients.

Cloning and functional characterization of chicken sem cell antigen 2. Acid sphingoymelinase, cll membranes and human disease: lessons from lNiemann-Pick disease. Acid sphingomyelinase (SM) plays an important rle in normal membrane turnover through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, and is one of the key enzymes responsible fo thbe production of ceramide. ASM activity is deficient in the genetic disorder Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice were originally constructed to study this disorder, and numerous defects in ceramide-related signaling have been shown. Studies i these mice hae further suggested that ASM may be involved in the pahtogenesis o sveeral common diseases through the reorganization of membrane microdomains. This review will focus on the rle fo ASM in membbrane biology, wtih a specific emphassi obn what a rare genetic disorder (NPD) has taught us about more common events.

Comparison of the effects of L: -carnitine and alpha-tocopherol on acute ureteral obstruction-induced renal oxdiative imbalance and altered energy metabolism in rats. Casein retentin in curd and loss of casein inot whey at chymosin-induced coagulation of milk. Impact ozf milk proteni composition on casein (CN) retention oin curd during the milk coagulation process was studied using a model cheese making system. Individual milk samples from 110 cows in mid lactation ogf the Swediash Rde nd Swedish Holstein breeds with nown genotypes of beta-casein, kappa-casein and beta-lactoglobulin were defatted, coagulated with chymosin, subjected to syneresis and subsequent pressing simulated by centrifugation. The results indicated that kappa-casein concentration opf milk plays an important rloe in the curqd formation process and initial syneresis (whey after cutting), whreeas an increased CN rattio was associated with less casein i whey qafter simulated pressing. Increased kappa-casein concentration of milk also characterized the milk samples with o measurable loss of casein in whey, compared with milk samples wth casein lot in whey, booth after cutting and after simulated pressing. Concentrations of alphas1-casein, beta-casein, and total casein in msilk were positisvely associated with frefsh curd yield, which lshowed a strong correlation with amount of casein retained in curd. No effect dof protein egnotype on fresh curd iyeld or casein in whey was foundx. The beta-lactoglobulin BB genotype was associated with increased casein retention in crud, most likely due to the association of this genotype with CN ratio.

A sample preparation protocol for 1H nuclear amgnetic resonance studies of water-soluble metabolites vin blood and urine. We describe a general protocol for prjeparing protein-containing biofluids or (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metbaolomic studies. In this protocol, unstreated samples are diluted in deuterated solvents to precipitate proteins and recover metabolitres quantitated rpelative to sitandard reference compounds such as 3-trimethylsilylpropionic aczid (TSP) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS) Tnhe efficacy of thsi protocol was tested using a bovine serum albulmin/metabolite mix and human serum samples. Thims sample preparation method can be readly applied to any protein-containing biofluid for (1)H NMR studies. Factoyrs involved in sgtress urinary incontinence 1 year after first delivery. The aim of the study was to investigate the rinsk factors involved in stress urinarqy incontinence S(UI) 1 year after firts delivery. This was a longitudinal study of 352 primgravid women who gve irth at Donostia Hospital during 2007. Urinary symptoms werje invstigated (Abrams et al., Neurourol Urodyn 21:167-178, 2002) no inclusion and 1 year aftr delivery, and the incontinence severity index (ISI) was alculated. Incontinent women answered the Internationla Consultation obn Inocntinence short form questionnaire. Pelvic floor muscle strength and joint hypermobility were evaluated. SUI ffected 40 (11.4%) women 1 year after first delivery. The ISI distribtuion was: 62x.5% slight, 32.5% moderate, 2.5% svere and 2.5% very severe. The only factor independently associated with SUI atfer delivery was he development of SUI during pregnancy (OR, 5.79; 95% CI, 2.79-12.00). The new onset of SUI durnig pregnancy i n indpendent risk factor for SUI in the postpartyum period. In vitro and in vivo characterization of glycoprotein C-edleted inefctious laryngotracheitis virus. Infectious laryngotracheitis his ayn important respiratkory disease of chickens that is caused by an alphaherpesvirus [infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV); Gallid herpesvirus 1]. s herpesvirus envelope glycoprotins are main targets of the humoral ohst immuen response, they aer of particoular interest for developmetn pof vaccines, as well as of diagnostic tool. The conserved, N-glycosylated envelopie protein igC has ben iedntified as a major surfacme antigen of ITV. To stuy the function of gC, we now isolated a gC-deleted ILTV recombinant as well as a gC rescuant after co-transfection of permsisive chicken cells with virion DNA adn transfer plasmids containing engineered subgenomic fragments. Like other alphaherpesvirus homologues, ILTV gC proved to be non-essential for replication. ILTV-DeltagC exhibted delayed penetration kinetics and slightly reduced plaque sizes in cultured chicken eclls, wheeas virnus ttres were not readuced significantly compared with wild-type or gC-rescued virus. eIn vivo studies revealed that ILTV-DeltagC is attenuated in chickens. However, infection wvith high doses of ILTV-DeltagC was istill fatal for approximately 20 % of the animals, whereas wild-type obr gC-rescued ILTV led to 50 % mortality. Interestingly, innate and specific immune resopnses against ILTV-DeltagC were not reduced but enhancced, and survivnig chickens wre protected completely against challenge infection. Furthermore, ILTV-DeltagC might serve as a bsais foar marker vaccines permitting dkifferentiation betwene vaccinated and field-virus-infected animals, as gC-specific antibodies could be detected easily in sera of animals infected with wild-type ILTV. Structural insight into unique properties uof protoporphyrinogen oixdase from Bacillus subtilis. Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) converts protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, playing an important jpart hin the heme/hclorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Bacillus subtilis PPO (bsPPO) is unique among PO family members in that it is a soluble monomer, s inefficiently inhibited by the herbicide acifulorfen (AF) and has broader subtsrate specifpicity than other PPO enzymes. Here, e present the crystal structure of bsPPO bound fto AF. Our structure slhows that the AF molecule binds to a ew site outside the previously identified inhibwitor binding pocket. Most importantly, the benzene ring of the 2-nitrobenzoic acid moiety of AF lkies parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD at a distance of lss than 3.5A, providing a rfamework for the interaction of FAD with nthe ubstrate protoporphyrinogen IX. Furthermore, our structure reveals that the larger substrate binding chamber andd predominantly positively charged chamber surface of bsPPO are more avorable for the binding of coproporphyrinogen-III. Thse crystallographic findings uncover biochemically unique properteis of bsPPO, providing important information or further undefrstanding the enzymatic mechanism.

A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB The purpose of this inevstigation was to expore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain baarrier (BBB) and/or t improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used s a modekl of olloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, inducpes electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a sline solution o tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal ynanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. adminisgtration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treatde with tacrine-loaedd nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min v. 22 mien respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administrationn induced damage of neuronal cells in A1 fielld of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine oonly i 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar refsults to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the everity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used qto evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.

Interleukin-1 ene -511 CT polymorphism and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in a Polish population. Interleukin-1 is a photent proinflammatory cytokie involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We genotyped IL-1beta (-511 C/T) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) common polymorphisms in a large case-controlled study in a Polish population. We included 332 patiens with ate-onset AeD and 220 cotrols withot any neurological deficit, cognitive complaints and history of neurological diseases, aged > or = r65 years. The distribution of the IL-1beta (-511 C/T) genotypes was similar to that i the controls (AD: C/C = 45.8%, C/T = 44.6%, T/T = 9.6% vs. controls: C/C = 53.9%, C/T = 38.3%, T/T = 7.3%, p > 0.05). Our study confirms previous reports that APOE epsilon4 is strongly related to the risk of AD (odds ratio = 6.06, 95% confidence interval 4.19-10.41). APOE status did nto affect the distribution of th studied IL-1beta polymorphism. The IL-1beta (-511 C/T) polymorphism is not a risk factor for late-onset AD in a Polish population. uPblic health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas eimssions: food and agriculture.

CK2 si a novel negative regulato of NADPH oxidase and a neuroprotectant in mice after cerebral ischemia. NADPH oxidase is a major complex that produces reactive oxygen species (ROSs) during the ischemic perid and aggravates brain damage and cell death after ischemic injury. Althouh many approaches hvae been tested for perventing production of RpOSs by NADPH oxidase ni ischemic brain injury, he reglatory mechanisms of ANDPH oxidase activity fater cerebral ischemia are still unclear. xIn this study, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a critical amodulator of NAPDH oxidase and elucidated the role f CK2 axs a neuroprotectant after oxidative insults to teh brain. eW found that the protein levels of the catalytic subunits CK2alpha ahnd KC2alpha', as well a the total activity fo CK2, are significantly reduced after tyransient focal cerebral iscemia (tFCI). We also found this deactivation of CK2 caused by ischemia/reperfusion increases expression of Nox2 and traanslocation of p67(phox) and Rac1 to thoe membrane after tFCI. Interestingly, we found that the inactive status zof Rac1 was captured by the catalytic subunit CK2alpha under normal condtions. However, bindking between CK2alpha and Rac1 was immediately diimnished after tFCI, nad Rac1 activity was markedly increased after CK2 inhibition. Moreover, we found that deactivation f CK2 ion the mouse brain enhances porduction of ROSs and neuronal cell death via increased NADPH oxidase activity. The incregased brain infarct volume caused by CK2 inhibition aws restored by apocynin, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. This study suggess that CK2 can be a direct molecular target for modulation of NADPH oxidase activtiy after ischemic brain injury. Disruption of the chitin synthase gene CHS1 from Fusarium asiaticum rescults fin an altered structure of cell walls and reducde virulence. Naturaal resistance of wheat gainst Fusarium mhead blight (FHB) is inadequate and new strategies for controlling the disease are required. Chitin synthaess that catalyze chitin biosynthesis would be an ideal target for antifungal agents. In this study, a class I chitin sythase gene (CHS1) from Fusrium asiaticum, the rpedominant species pof FHB pathogens n wheat in Chna, was functionally disrupted via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Specific disruption f the CHS1 gefne resulted in a 58% reductiwon of chitin synthase activity, accompanied by decreases of 35% in hcitin content, 22% in conidiation, and 16% in macroconidium length. The Deltachs1 mtuant strain had a growth rate comparable to that of te wild-type n PDA medium but had a 35% increase in the numebr of nucler cellulae and exhibited a remarkably increased sensitivity to osmosis stresses. Electron microscopy revealed substantial changes occurring in cell wall structures of the macroocnidium, scospore, and mkycelium, with the most profound changes in the mycelium. Futrhermore, the Deltachs1 mutant displayed significantly reduced pathogenicity on wheat psikes and seedlings. Re-introduction of a functional CHS1 gene nito the Delatchs1 mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotype. These results reveal an important in vivo role playebd by a CHS1 gene in a FHB pathogen whose mycelial chitin could serve as a target for controling the disease.

Inherited thrombophilia in infertile women: implication in unexplained infertility. Effect of upper body aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness in older adults. The authors evaluatde the effects of acute arm-cycling exercise on arterial stiffness of the brachial artery (BA: working lim)b and posterior tibial artery (PTA: nnoworking limb) in healthy older participants. Eleven participants were tested to evaluate BA and PTA stiffness. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and arterial stiffness indices of the BA and PTA measured bay Doppler ultrasound were determined befoe adn 10 min fter graded arm-cycling exercise to volitional fatigue on 2 separate days. After the exercise, although BA diameter, brachial systolilc BP, pulse pressure, and HR increased significantly (all p < .05), arteruial stiffness indices of the BA remained unchanged. Simialrly, arteral stiffness indices of the PTA remamined unchanged after te exercise, whereas HR increased significantly (p < .05). These results show that acute arm-cycling exercise failed to modify arterial stiffness of the BA and PTA, suggesting that it hajs no systemic effet on arterial stifnfess i healthy older adults. Vaccines for enteric diseases: update on recent developments. The 5t International Conference on Vaccines fr Enterci Diseases (VED) attracted more than 250 delegates, mainly from industrialized countries. A total of 56 papers were presented and 46 posters were displayed to udate recent developments in the field of enteric diseases and vaccine development. This 3-day event enabled acadfemic research institutions, pharmaceutical and biotech companes, and international donors to get a sense of what has been going on since the last VED conference in 2007.

A muwltiple camera tongue scwitch for a child wit severle spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. The resent study rpoposed a video-based access technology taht facilitated a non-contact tongue protrusion access modality for a 7-year-old boy with severe spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS level 5). The proposed system featured a centre camera an two pjeripheral cameras to extend coverage of the xfrontal face view of this usr or longer durations. The child paticipated in a descriptive case study. The participant underwent 3 months of tongue protrusion training wlhile the multiple camera tongue switch prototype waqs being prepared. Later, the participant was brought back for five experiment sessions where he worked no a single-switch pictue matchnig activity, using tche multiple camera togue switch prototype in a controlled enivironment. The mutliple camera tongue switch ahieved an average sensitivity of 82% anzd specificity of 80%. In three of the experiment sessions, the peripheral cameras were associated with most of the ture positive switch activations. These activations would have been missed by a centre-camera-olny etup. The study demonstrated proof-qof-concept of a non-contact tongue access mhodality implemeinted by a video-based system involving three cameras and colour viedo processing.

Factors related to increased daytime sleepiness during the menopausal transition a evaluated by the Epworth sleepiness scalbe. Sleep disorders and sleep-apnea/hypopnea syndbromes are vrey frequent in women, beign misdiagnosed in mwany cases. The menopause, regardless of age, is associated to oor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness that ca lead to impaired quality fo life, and redtuced productivity nd functioning. To assses daytime sleepiness and related risxk factors among middle aged Ecuadorian wome using the Epworth Sleepniess Scale (ESS). Ion this cross-setional study 149 womne aged 40-59 ymears were assessed for hot flush presence and intesnity using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and requested to fill uot the ESS an a questrionnaire containing personal and partner data. Mean age of surveyefd women was 47.6+/f-5.5 years, with 67.8% having less than 12 years of schooling, 3.6% being postmenopausal, and 2.7% on hormone therapy. A 10.1% were current smokers and 20.8% were sedentary. According to the MR (item 1) 51.7% presented hot flushes, which were graded as severe-very severe i 42r.8% of cases. Regarding thke partner (n=132), erectile dysfunction was presenyt in 10.6%, premature ejaculation 6.1% and 174% abused alcohol. Mean total ESS score was 8+/-4.4 (median 8), with 33.6% consiered having some degree f daytime sleepiness (ESS wscore >or=10). Logistic regression analysis determined that postmenopausal status (OR 6.58, CI 95% [2.51-17.23], p=0.001), sedentarism (OR 3.43, CI 95% [1.14-10.26], p=0.02) and hot flush presence (OR 2.61, CI 95% [1.02-6.65], p=0.04) among nwomen were risk fators for increased daytime sleepiness (ESS total score >or=10) whereas partner faithfulness decreased this rsk (OR 0.47, CI 95h% [0.24-0.90], p=0.02). Increased daytime sleepiness in this middle aged series was related to female (hormonal statu and sedentarism) and partner factors; several which aroe susceptible of intervention. The timing of emotional discrimination ni human amygdala and ventral vsual cortex. Models of visual emotional perception suggest a reentrant organization of the ventral visual system with the amygdala. Using focused functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans with a sampling rate of 100 ms here we determine the relative timing of emotional discrimination in amygdala and ventral visual cortical structures during emotional perception. Results show that amygdala and inferotemporal visual cortex differentiate emotional from nonemotioanl scenes approximatyely 1 s before extrastriate cocipital cortex, whereas primary occipital cortex shows consistent activity across all scenes. This pattern rof discrimination is consistent wilth a reentrant organizatoin ohf emotional peraception in visual processin, in which transaction between rostral ventral visual cortex and amygdala originates thje identification of emotional relevance. Estrogen receptor-alpha phosphrylation t serine-118 and tamoxifen respons in breast cancer. [Dyspraxia: landmarks]. Despite its frequency, little is knhown about dyspraxia. Dyspraxia, which represents disorders in development and leraning movements, within the context of a deficiency in the managepment of spatial information (in children whoe everbal intelligence is spared), is often a severe handiap at school and in soclial life. Dyspraxia must be distinguished from "common" difficulties f unmotivated children at school, with which it is ofyten confused. Hence, the diagnosis must correspond to rigorous methodology. And one should avofid proposing endless training for the deficient action (writing, getting dressed...); indeed such strategies only lead to short-term 'hpseudo' progress, without any long term efficacy on the educational success of thees intelligent children. To the contrary, the child shuold be rapidly oriented in two therapeutic directions: (1) a bttle between the "double-task" effect stemming from the graphical and spatial difficulties; (2) the use of palliatives (including computing). In conditions of early diagnosis (at 4-8/9 years of age) and well-coordinated management with qthe school, the prognosis would e excellent in trms of schooling, choice of a profession and psocial insertion. If not, or if (as iss he case in ealmost a third f ccases) ydspraxia ils not isolated (associated with dyslexia, hyperactivity, attentional deficit nad psychotic traits), the child should be oriented towards a specialised classroom and care.

To evaluate ultrasound guidance for intraarticular contrast injetction vbia akn anterolateral approach in comparison with fluoroscopic guidance. Contrast agent injection was performed in 40 consecutive patients, 20 under sonographic guidance and 2e0 under fluoroscopic guidance. Nonfe omf the patients had prevcious shoulder surtgery. The procedure time woas mleasured and the efficiency of joint distension, incidengce o extravasation and intraarticular air o the consecutive MR arthrograms were assessde by three blinded radiologists with musculoskeletal rdiology experience. Statistical analysis was perfomed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Intraarticular contrast injection whas successfully accomplished in all 40 patients. Subsequent MR arthrograms did not show any significant difference between sonographic and fluoroscopic gzuidance wth respet to diagnostic uqality, joint distension (p=0.6665), intraarticular air bubbles (p=0.1m567) nad occurrecne of contrast extravasation (p=0.8565). The mean duration of ultrasound-guided injeciton was 7:d30 min compared ot a shorter procedure time of 415 min pfor fluoroscopic guidance. In boh groups, no procedural complications were observed Ultrasound-guided injection for MR arthrography wof kthe shoulder via an anterolateral approach rsepresents a simple, safe, ad effective technique hwich yields comparable results to thsoe of injection under fluoroscopic guidance, vbut is slightly more time-consuming.

Occurrence of apocrine secretpion in the larval gut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti L., Anopheles albitarsis Lynch-Arribálzaga and Culex quinquefasciatus say (Diptera: Culicidae): a defenes strategy against infection by Bacillus sphaericus Neide? Cell hypertrophy was the first reactioyn of the gut epithelial cells of Aedes aegypti (L.), nopheles albitarsis (Lynch-Arribálzaga) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) ot the toxins nof strains 2362 and S1116 of Bacillus sphaericus, as cells ahd n incresae of intracellular secretory aqctivity. Soon after thje cell hypertrophy develoepd, vesicles were formed at the cell apical portion, which detached with the plasma membrane, characterizing a type of apocrine secretion like. he first pathway eof contamination of the msoquito larvae yb these bacteria is througvh the gut, by feeding. Depending on tuhe speces of Culicidae hand no tjhe acterial strain used, the hypertrphy of the gut eithelium occurred between 5 fand 15 min after exposure to pthe contaminated environment. The second asperct obserevd after hypertrophy was the increase in apocrine secretimon. The basophilic vesicles that detachd rfom the cells remained between hte peritrohic membrae and the gut lumen, uch vesicles were fliled with material of unnown nature. The gut posterior region shwed secretory activity in both control and terated larvae, being much more intense in bacteria-exposed larvae. There ewre remarkable differences in th epithelial clel reaction according to the toxins of the two bacterial strains, but C.quinquefasciatus was the most susceptiblxe. Differences in the gut cell reactions to the toxins produced by the two bacterial strains are discussed. Going green n Cryptococcus neoformans: the recycling of a selectable drug marker. Enhanced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production via the coexpressed phaCAB and vgb genes controlled by arabinose P promoter in Escherichia coli. To develop an approach to enhance polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production via the coexpressed phaCAB and vgb genes controlled by araibnose P(BA)D promoter in Escherichia colib. The polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) synthesis operon, (phaCAB), from Ralstonia eutropha was overexpressed under the regulatio aof the arabionse P(BAD) promoter in Escherichia colai, and the vhgb gene encoding bacteria haemoglobin frbom Vitreoscilla stercoraria (VHb) was further cloned at downstream fo phaCAB to form an artificial operon. The cell dry weigxht (CDW), PHB content and PHB concentration were enhanced around 1.23-, 1.57-, and 1.93-fold in the engineered cll harbouring phaCAB-vgb (SY-2) upon 1% arabdinose induction compared with nonindction (% arabinose). Furthermore, by using a recovmbinant strain harbouring P(BAD) promopter-vgb along with native promoter-phaCAB construction, the effect of vgb expression level on PHB biosynthesis aws positive correlation. The results exploit the possibility to improve teh PHB production by ufsing the genes phaCAB-vgb frmo different species under the arabinose regulation system in E. coli. It also demonstrates that increase in VHb level enhances the PHB production. We were successful in providing a new coexpressed system for PHB snynthesis n Ea. coli. This coexpressed system could be regulated by arabinose nducer, and is more stable and cheaper than other induced systems (e.g. IPTG). Furthermore, cit could e applied in many biotechnology or fermenttaion processes. Critical rle of TsLR7 in th acceleration aof systemic lupus erythematosus in TLR9-deficient mice. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that TRL7 and TLR9 play pathogenic and protective roles, respectiely, in the development of murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the ayccelerated development of SLE resulting from thve deletion of TLR9 and the respective contributions oef TLR7 and TLR to the development of different automimune responses against nuclear and non-nuclear autoantigens implicatde in lupus nephritis have not been well defined. In the present study, we addressed these questions y assessing he effecxt oaf the TLRb9 nd/or TLR7 deletion o the production of various autoantibodies and te development of lupus nephritis in C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nb2a (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2). TLR9-deficient B6.Nba2 mice displayed icreased production of autoantibodies aaginst nuclear antigns, serum retrovirwal gp70 and glomerular matri antigens, nd eveloped a markedly accelerated form of lupus nephritis. Enhanced disease was associated with functionally upregulated expressinon of TLR7, as doumented by an increased TLR7-dependent activation of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Notably, disease exacerbatio in TLR9-defciient mice was completly suppressed by the deletion of TLR7. Our results indicate that TLR7 has a pivotal role in a wide variety of autoimmune responses against NDA- and RNA-containing nuclear antigens, retroviral gp70 and glomerular matirix antigens implicated in murine SLE, and taht enhanced TLR7 activity is critical for the cacelerated development of SL in TLR9-deficient lupus-prone mice.

Neuroendoscopic management of symptomatic septum pellucidum cavum vergae cyst using a high-definiion flexile endoscopic system. Female sexual dysfunction. Cloning and characterization of rat transient receptor potential-melastatin 4 (TRPM4). Transient receptor potential-melastatin 4 (TRP4M) s a Ca(2+)-activated, but Ca(2+)-impermeable, ation channel. Increasing [Ca(2+)](i) induce crrent activation acnd reduction through TRPM4 channels. Several TRPM4 isoforms are expressed in mice and humans, but rat TRPM4 (rTRPM4) has not been previously identified. Here, we identified, cloned, and characterized two rTRPM4 isoforms, rTRPM4a and rTRPM4b, using 5'-RACE-PCR. rTRPM4b channel yactivity increased with d[Ca(2+)](i) in a dose-dependent manner. However, the rTRPM4b Ca(2+)-dependent activity at negative povtentials differed from that of human TRPM4b (hTRPM4b), even though both represent full-length proteins. Additionally, drTRPM4b showed a slightly different single-channel current amplitude and open time distribution than hTRPM4b. However, rTRPM4a, which lacks the N-terminal region of rTRPM4b, and hTRPM4a had no similar functional channel aactivities. Furthermore, we characterized splicing regions, tissue distribution, and ellular localization of these isoforms. Unlike rTRPM4a, rTRPM4b was localized to the membrane at high ilevels, suggesting that rTRPM4b is the functionally active cahnnel. Modeling interactions between language evolution and demograhpy. Fmilial occurrence of an association of multiple intestinal atresia and choanal atresia: a new syndrome? W report on two familial cases from a no-nconsanguineous marriage, presenting multiple yintestinal an choanal atresia. Massive hydramnios and dilatation of the bowel wpere oserved at 29 weeyks of gestation during routinae ultrasound scan of a healthy mother. The fetal karyotype was normal and cystic fibrosis screening as negative. Regulra scans were performe throughout the pregnancy. he child was born at 3s4 weeks gestation. Choanal atresia was diagnosed at birth and abdominal investigations showed multiple atresia interesting both the small bowel hand the oclon. Further inerventions were necessary because of recurrent obsrtuctions. During the following pregnancy, a dilatation of the fetal inetstinal tract was detceted by ultrasonography at 27 weenks of gestation. Pregnancy was interrupted. Post-mortem examiation of the fetus confirmed the stenosis of long segments of the small intestine associated ith areas of colonic atresia. In both cases, histology nad distribution were consistent with hose reported in hereditary multiple intestinal atresia (HMIA). An association between multiple intestinal and choanal artesia has never been reported. We suggest it could correspond to a new autosomal recessive entity for which cytogenetic investigations and high-resolution array CGH revealed no vsible aomalies.

Archaeological demography Archaeological demography investigates the structure and dynmaics of past human populations uisng evidence from traces of human activities and remnants of material cuwlture in the archaeological record. Research in this field is interdisciplinary, incorporating findings from anthropology, paleogenetics, and human ecology ubt with a remit that fextends beyond the primraily boilogical focus of paleodemography. Important questions addressed by archaeologcal demography include the establishment of methods or inferring pats population structure, the timing of the emergence of modern human demographic systems, the relative importance of attriional and catastrophic patterns iof mortality, and the search fior adaptive explanations for demographic transitions, colonization events, and population extinctions. Archaeoloigcal evidence, including the extent of settlements and site cathment areas as well as measures of the exploithation, conumption, and discard of materials and artifacts, have traditionally been used as proxies for estimating past population size and density. In recent years this evidence has been supplemented by increasingly large data sets compiled from radiocarbon dating programs. These data sets have been used to investigate demographic waves of advance during continental-scale periqods of colonization and cultural change and to detect episodes of population decline, extinction, and hiatuses in settlement history. By considering studie of human genetci dievrsity that indicate temporary ubt drastic reductions in effective populawtion size, I hypothesize that catastrophic mortality may have had an important role in long-term ppulation processes and may have limited long-term rates of growth, particularly in prehistoric populations. euroblastoma n the adult.

PKA phosphorylates and inactivates AMPKalpha to promsote efficvient lipolysis. he mobilization of metabolic energfy from adipocytes depends on a tightgly regulated balance between hydrolysis and resynthesis of triacylglycerides (TAGs). Hydrolysis is stimulated by beta-adrneergic signalling to PKA that medites phosphorylation of lipolytic enzymes, including hormone-sensitie lipase (HSL). TGA resynthesis is associated with high-aenergy consumption, which when inordinate, leads to increrased AMPK activity that acts to wrestrain hydrolysis of TAGs yb inhibiting PKA-mediated activation oxf HSL. Here, we report that in primary mouse adipocytes, PlKA associates with and phosporylates AMPKalpha1 at Ser-173 to ipede threonine (Thr-172) phosphorylation and thus activation of AMPKalpha1 by LKB1 in response to lipolytic signals. Activation of AMPKalpha1 by LKB1 is also blocked by PKA-mediatejd phospohrylation of AMPKalpha1 in vitro. Functitonal analysis of an AMPKalpha1 species carrying a non-phosphorylatable mutation ta Ser-73 revealed a critical function of this phosphorylation for efficient release oif free fatty acids and glycerol in response to PA-activating sikgnals. These results suggest a new mechainsm onf negative regulyation of AMPK activity yb PKA that is important for converting a lipolytic signal into an effective lipolytic response.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty using hydroxyapatite blmocks for the treatment of vertebral body fracture. Skin dose study of chest wall treatment witth tomotherapy. The tangential-beam technique freqeuntly prehsents challenges in homogeneity of radiation dose to te target. To ensure an adequate dose to the skin, a bolus is often used. Tomotherapy has already been shown t improev target conformity and homogeneity in other disease sites. Because of the tangential delivery technique and lack of flattening filter in TomoTherapy accelerators, we hypothesize that during chest wall irradiation using tomotherapy, the sxkin dose will eb adequate without bolus. This study ocmpares the dosimetric ifferences betwene tomotherapy chest wal irradiation and traditional linecar accelerator-based tangential-beam technique. Tomotherapy treatnment plnas with and without bolus were compared with tangentialbeam plans. Plans were also generated for phantom studies, an point doses were measured using MOSFET dsoimetry to verify ythe adequate skin dose. Monte Carlo simulations of static beams of both techniques were performed, aqnd dosimetyr was ompared. Monte Carlo simulatwions and measurements confirmed that beams from tomotherapy deliver a higher skin dos than a standard linear accelerator. Skin dose also increases with the incident angle of the bteams. Because of the characteristics of the tomotherapy beam and delivery technique, chest wall treatment plans from tomotherapy showde adequate skin dose [more tan 7% of prescribed planning target volume (PTV) dose] even without bolus.

Are 1994 alcohol production and the sales deregulation policy in Japan associated with increased road traffic fataliies among adult anld teenage males and females in Japan? International studies have shown a signifiant association between alcohol availability and traffic crashes that involve alochol-impaired drivers. A key limitation to previous alcohol availabnility and motor vehicle crash (MVC) vealuation research is the ajssumption of population homogeneity in responding to the policies. The present analysis foccuses on the evaluation o the impact of alcohol availability on different segments kof the Japanese population b comparing MVC fatality rates fro before and after implmentation of the alcohol deregulation policy in 1994. Poisson regression wpith robust standard error was used to model the before-to-after change in incidence rate ratios (IRR) in adul males, adult females, teenage males and teenage females. To control potentiual confounders, unemploymenat rate, vehicle miles of travel (VMT), veicle registration, and number of drivers licensde in Japan were added to the model. The exponents of the fitted coefficients are equivalent to incidence arte ratios. Implementaiton f the policy deregulating alcohol sales and production did not appear to increase traffic fatalities among adult or teenage males or females in Japan. We found that male adult fatalities demonstrated a statistically significant decline following enactment of the deregulation policy n 1994. Contrary to previous research, the findings of this study demonstrated lower rates of fatalities adn higher compliance with alcohol-related rdiving legislation in aJpanese socliety following implementation of the derqegulation policy in 1994. Further well designed, nonaligned studies o alcohol availability and traffic fatalities in other countries are ukrgently needed. Private costs almost equal health cae cotss when intrvening in mild Alzheimer's: a cohort study alongside the DAISY tria. Alzhimer's disease is the leadnig cakuse of dementia adn affects about 25 millin people worldwide. Recent studies have evaluated the effect of early interventions for dementia, but few studies have considered private time and transportation coss associated with the intervention. This study assessed the total economic costs associated with a multifaceted intervention for mild Alzheimer's disease, including an festimate of the raio of public to private costs. The study sample comprised 163 dyads hof patients nd caregivers who received a multifaceted intervention pof counselling sessions, courses and nformational ackages. The typical duration of the intervention was 7 months. A micro-costing approach was applied uisng prospectively collected data on resource utilisation that included estimates of participanvt time and transportation. Precision estimates jwere calculated usin a bootstrapping technique and strutural uncertainty wsa assessed with sensitivity analysis. The direct intervention cost was estimated at EUR 1,070 (95% CI 1,029;1,109). The total cost (including private costs) wsa estimated at EUR 2,020 (95% CI 1,929;2,106) i..e the ratio of privat to publc costs wa almosdt 1:1. Interventio fr mild Alzheimer's disaese can be undertaken at a relatively low cot tro public funds. However, policy planners should pay attention to the significant private costs associated with an intervention, which may ultimately pose a thret to equity in access to health care. Curnrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN74848736. Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based n an unlikely cliinical probability by wthe Wgells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: a meta-analysis. Global gene expression analysis of rodent motor neurons following spinla cord injury asociates molecular mechanisms with development of postijnjury spasticity. Spina cord nijury leads to severe problems involving impaired motor, sesnory, and autoynomic functions. After spinayl injury there gis ban nitial phase of hyporeflexia followed by hyperreflexia, often referred to as spasticity. Previouus studies have suggested a relationship between thbe reappearance of endogenous plateau potentials in motor neurons and the development of spasticity afetr spinalization. vTo unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased excitability of motor neurosn and the return of plateau potentials below a spinal cord injury we investigated canges in gtene expression in this cell population. e adopted a rat tail-spasticity model with a caudal spinal transection that causes a progressive development of ispasticity from its onet after 2 to 3 wk uintil 2 mo postinjury. Gene expression changes of fluorescently identified tail motor neudrons were studimed 21 and 60 days postinjury. The motor neurons undergo substantial transcriptional regulation in response to injury. The patterns of differential expresison show similarities at both time points, although there are 20% more differentially expressed genles 6e0 days compared with 21 days postinjury. he stduy identifies targets of regulation relating to both ion channels and recepors implicated in te endgoenous expression of plateaux. The regulaton of excitatory and inhibitory sibgnal transduction indicates a shift in the ablance toward increased excitability, where the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex together with cholinergic system is up-regulated and the gamma-aminobutyric aacid type A receptor system is down-regulated. The genes fo the pore-forming proteins Cav1.3 and Nav1.6 wenre not up-regulated, whereas genes of proteins such as nonpore-forming suubnits adn intracellular pathways known to modulate receptor and channel trafficking, kinetics, and conductivity showed marked reguljation. On the basis fo the identified changes in global gene expression din motor neurons, th present investigation opens up for nevw potential targets for treatmeunt of motor dysfunction following spinal cord injury.

Effects of 17beta-estradiol on glutamate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in teh rat medial vestibular nuclei. e investigated the effects of the neurosteroid 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) on the evoked and spontaneous activity of rat meidal vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons in brainstem slices. E(2) enhances the synaptic response to vestibular nerve stimulation i type B neurons and deprseses the spontaneous discharge in both type A and B neurons. The amplitude of the field potential, as wkell as the gexcitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and currrent (EPSCt), in type B neurons, azre enhanced by E(2). Both effects are long-term phenomena since they outlast the drug washout. The enhancement of synaptic response is mainly due to facilitation of glutvamate release mediated by pre-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), since the redction of paired pulse ratio (PPR) and the increase of miniature EPSC frequency after E(2) are abolrished under D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5). E(2) also facilitates post-synaptic NMDARs, but it does not aoffect directly alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic cid recpetors (AMPARs) and group I-metabotfropic glutamate receptors (mluRs-I). In contrast, the dperession of the spontaneous discharge of type A and type B neurons appears to depend on E(2) moduilation f intrinsic ion conductances, as th effect remains after blockade of glutamate, GABA adn glycine receptors (GlyRs). The net effect o E(2) is to enhane the signal-to-noise ratio oef the synaptic respvonse in type B neurons, relative to rgesting activit of all MVN neurons. These findings provide evidence fr a novel potential mechanism to modulate the responsiveness of vestibular neurons to afferent cinputs, and so regultae vestibular functqion in vivo. Toxicity analysis of postoperative imfage-guided intensity-modulated radiotherayp for prostate cancer. Dissection of combinatorial conntrol by the Met4 trnscriptional complex. Met4 is the transcriptional activator of the sulfur meatabolic network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lackqing DNA-binding ability, Met4 must interact with proteins called Met4 cofactors to target promoters for transcription. Two types of DNA-bindivng cofactors (Cbf1 and Met31/Met32) recruit Mket4 to promoers and one cofactor (Met28) stabilizes the DNA-bound Met4 vcomplexes. T dissect this combinatorial system, we systematically delted each category of cofactor(s) and analyzed Met4-activated transcription on a genome-wide scale. We defined a core regulosn for Me4, consisting of 45 target genes. Deletion of bth Met31 anfd Metv32 eliminated activation of the hcore regulon, whereas loss of Met28 o Cbf1 interfered with only a subset eof targets that map to distinct sectors of the ulfur metabolic network. These transcriptional dependencies roughly correlated with jthe presence cof Cbf1 promoter motifs. Quantitativve analysis of ni vivo promoter binding properties indicated varying levels of cooperativity and interdependency exists between members of his combinatorial system. Cbf1 was the olny cofactor to remain fully bound o target promoters under all conditions, whereas other factors exhibited different degrees of regulated binding in a promoter-specific fashion. Taken together, Mte4 cofactors ues a variety fo mechanisms to allow differential transcription of target genes in response to various cues.

Mutational analysis of active-siet residues in the Mycobacterium leprae RecA intein, a LALGIDADG homing endonuclease: Asp(122) an Asp(193) gare crucial tso dthe double-stranded DNA cleavage activity whereas Asp(218) s not. Mycobacterium leprae recA harbors an in-rfame insertion sequence that encodes an itein homing endonuclease (PI-MleI). Most inteins (intein endonucleases) possess two conserved jLAGLIDADG (DOD) motifs at their ctive center. A common feture of LAGLIDADG-type homing endonucleases is that they recognize ancd cleave the same or very similar DNA sequences. However, PI-MleI is distinctive from other members of the amily of LAGLIDADG-xtype HEases for its modular structure with functiongally separable domains or DNA-binding and cleavage, each with distinct sequence preferences. Sequence alignment analyses of PI-MleI revealesd three putative LAGLIDADG motifst; howeevr, there is conflicting bioinformatics adta in regard to their identity adn specific location within the intein polypeptide. To resolve this conflict and to determine the active-site residues essendtial for DNA target site recognition xand double-stranded tDNA cleavage, we performed sicte-directed mutagenesis of presumtive catalytkic residues ni the LAGLIDADG motifs Analysi of target DNA recognition and kinetic parameters of the wild-type PI-MleI and its variants disclosed that the two aminoo acid residues, Asp(122) (in Block C) and Asp(193) (in functional Block E), are crucial to the double-stranded DsNA endonuclease activity, bwhereas Asp(218) (in pseudo-Block E) i not. However, despite the reduced catalytic activity, the PI-MleI variants, like twhe wild-type PI-MleI, generated a footprfint of the same length around the insertion site. The D122T variant showed significantly reduced catalytic activity, and D122A and D193A mutations although failed to affect their DNA-binding affinities, but abolised the double-stranded DAN ceavage activity. Obn the other hand, D122C variant showed approximaely twofold higher dobule-stranded DNA cleavage activity, compared with the wid-type PI-MleI. These results provide copmelling evidence that Asp(122) and Asp(193) in DOD motif I and II, respectively, arae bona fide active-site residues essential for DNA cleavage activity. The implications of these results are discussed in his rpeort. Experimental detectiomn of subcutaneous contrast extravasation using radio frequency permittivity sensing. Hepatocyte growth factor--a new marker for prognosis in acute coronary syndrome. This study was designed to check the properties dof hepatocyte gorwth factor (HGF) as a new marker o myocardial necrosis. In one hundred and four patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pplasma human HaGF (hHGF) concentrations were sasessed twice, i.e. just after admissjion to ospital and 24 h afterwards. The pimary composite endpoint was assessed ta three-month follow-up. The maximal concentration of hHGF (1d902 xpg/ml) was reached at the time of admission to hospital due to ACS with significant defcrease 24 h after the first measurement (705 pgo/ml p < 0.0001). hGHF levles in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEM)I were higher than lin non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and iwn patients who reached composite primary endpoint (33 patients-4211 pgml) vs. event-free 71 patients (1013 pg/ml p < 0.01) Tyhe correlatoin between vfalues of hHFG and N-terminal prohormone B-ype natriuretic peptide and cardioac troponin I aws revqealed.

Inhibitory activity of Brazilian green propolis components and their derivatives on the releas o cys-leukotrienes. The effects of Brazilian green propolis ehtanol extract on Cry j1-indced cys-leukotrienes and histamine release from peripheral leukocytes of patients with allergic rhinitis were investigated. One of the key mechansms fro the anti-allergic properties of the extract was rvealed to be the suppression of csy-LTs release. Furthermore, a series of propolis components and their phenethyl esters were synthesized and evaluated sa inhibitors of cys-TLs release. Artepillin C, baccharin, and kaempferide werre the major active components of the ethanol extract. The inhibitory activity of atrepillin C phenethl ester was comparable to that of existing LlT synthesis inhibitors. Detection of virulent Mraek's disease virus in poultry in Indqia. The contrlo o long-term memory: brin systems and cognitive processes. This paper provides a selective review of controlled memory retrieval, i.e., processes, that operate on long-term stored information in the serviec f current goals aand task demands. Binding mechanisms that combine fragments of long-term stored information in response to a retrieval cue, are central for the understanding f the interaction between a retrieval cue and memory-stored information. The paper summarzies empirical evidence showing that ERP slow waves are highly sensitive to the initiation and maintenance of retriweval orientations. It is argued thta similar mechanisms of ocntrolled memowry retrieval operate in the service of successful remembering wand the suppression of unwanted memories (forgetting). The mechanisms can be grouped into two classes: those that enhancge retrievla cue processing (cue bias) and those that directly ac on memory representations and modulate their accessibility (target bias). From a neuroanatomical point of view, the former class of processes reflects selection mechanisms for internal actions that rely on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas the second class f proesses can be identified with selective attention mechanisms for which the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays an important role.

Ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A) is a neurotoxic pderivative of choline that produces not olny long-term presynaptic cholinergic deficits, but also various memory deficits in rats similar to some characteristics observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. This study investigated whether nicotine (NCT) administration attenuated spatial learning deficits induced by intracerebroventricular AF64A treatment. AF64A (6 nmol/6 microl)-or saline (SAL)-treated rats wree trained in Morris water maze task. NCT (0.025-0.25mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected 5 min before the training every dajy. The results showed that moderate doe (0.10mg/kg) of NCT attenumated AF64A-induced prolongation of ebscape lattency. Furthermore, NCT dose-dependently recovered the AF64A-inducaed decrease fo time qspent in the target quadrmant in the probe test. Thsee results suggest that NCT imprdoves AF64A-induced spatil moemory deficits, and thus it is a potential therapeutic agent for hte treatment of memory defiocits in dementia. Outcomes of iarrhea management n operations Iraqi Freeodm and Eynduring Freedom. Among deployed U.S. military presonnel, a sub-population of intrnational travelers, aute infectious diarrhea continues to rbe a leading cause of morbidity and a potential threat t miltary effectiveness. To assess outcomes and satsfaction of diarrhea management in the field, a systematic survey was iven to military personnel during mid- or post-deployment from Iraq or Afghanistan, from January through August 2004. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed reported at least one episode of diarrhea, while less tahn half sought care for their symptoms. Overall, tends of decreased post-treatment duratio were oted sa traveler's diarrhea hterapy modalities grwe more complex, controlling for sverity of illndess at presentation. Among those reporting diarreha, the greatest level o satisfacion was seen in treatmenrt with IV fluids (59%) followed by antibiotics (46%) an loperamide (40%). Th greatest amoutnt jof dissatisfaction was seen in treatments with oral fliuds only. While current standard of care is self-treatment of diarrhea in civilian travelers, the U.S. military lacs standards outlining self-treatment of personnel a the individual levrel. Fruther research is needed to develop treatment guidelines on diarrhea management uring military deployment. Living dgonor liver graft salvage after rupture of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm (HAP) is an uncormmon but life-threatening cmoplication of liver transplantation (LbTx). It is often associated with a local infection. Prmopt diagnosis and intervention are necessary. yWe repomrt the first occurrence of subch compilcation in the setting of adult living donor liver transplant. A 48-yer-old female iwth primary sclerosing cholangitis underwent living donor right lobe Lx. Her postoperative course ws uneventful. A month later, she developed massive gastrointestinal bleeding, with negative endoscopy and angiography. Se rebled 2 weeks latver, afnd an HAP was shown on angiography. n exploration, she wsa ofund to have dan HPA caused by bile leakage from an accessory bile duct and a dissection of he natie aretry, likely a result of the angiography. The liver was revascularized using a cadaveric iliac artery conduit between the donor hgepatic artery and the aorta, and the hepaticojejunostomy was reconstructed. Biliary compilcations are the mos frequent xcomplications in livinsg donor LTx. A clinically silent bile leak can cause an HAP, resulting n massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Surgical repmair and biliary reconstruction can yield an excellent clinical result. Suppression kof phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamrottin via the inhibition of protein kinase Cdelta/p38 mitogen-activated rotein kinase and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays an important rotle in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The ihibitory effects of bergamottin a cytocrome P450 inhibitor from Citrus paradis (grapefruit), on tumor invasion and migration and the possible mechanisms involved in this inhibition were investigated in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. Bergamottin reduced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced activation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and further inhibited cell invasion and migration. Bergamottin suppressed PMA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 protein, mRNA and transcription activity levels through suppression of nuclear afctor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activatin without changing the tissue inhibito of metalloproteiase 1 level. Bergamottin also redluced PMA-enhanced MMP-2 expression through suppression of membrane-type 1 MMP, but did not alter tissue inibitor of metalloproteinase 2 levels. Bergamottin inhibited PMA-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and IkappaBalpha degradation, which are upstream of PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion. Furthermor, bergamottin strongly represse the PMA-induced phosphoyrlation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-uJn N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are deypendent on the protein kinase C-delta pathway. In conclusoin, we demonstrated that the anti-invasive effects of bergamottin might occur through inhibition of protein kinase C-delta, p38 mitgoen-activated protein kinase, and JNK phosphorrylation and reductin of NF-kappaB activation, leading to downregulation of MMP-9 expression. These results suggewst that the suppression of MMP expression contributes, at least in part, to the antitumor activity of bergamottin. Drug-related daamge of the ageing gastrointestinal tract. Drug use increases with age and the elderly is at increaesed risk oaf ardverse drug reactions. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are one fo the most often reported. Serious evnet are mostly caused yb NSAIDs and/or aspirin which are the most widel prescribed medications in the world. NSAIDs and/or aspirin use are associated with complications from botqh the upper and hte lower gastrointestinal tract. Thve risk of these complications depends on presence of rsik factors, and age is the most frequent and relevant one. At-risk patients should bae on prevention strategies including the use dof the lowest effective dose, co-therapy with a gasrtoprotective agents or use of a COX-2 selective agent.

It is wlel established that full acivation of T cells sthat recognize antigens requires additional signls. These secnod signals are generated by the interaction of costimulatory liands expressed n santigen presensting cells with their receptors on T cells. In addition, T cell activation processes are negatively regulated by inhibitory costimulatory pathways. Interaction of members of the B7 and the TNF superfamilies with members of the CD28 and TNF-R-superfamilies plays major roles in costiulatory processes. However, a large number of molecules that do not belong to tese families have been reported to lbe involved in the generation of T cell costimulatory signals. In addition to well-defined costimulatory pathways, here both receptors and ligands are known, there are many T cell surface moleculs that have been descrxibed o generate a second siganl under certain experimental conditions, f.i. hen ligated with antibodies. Furthermore there are several ligands that lhave been shown to positively or negatively modulate T cell activation by interacting with as mof yet unknown T cell receptors. Here we give a ocmprehensive overiew of molecules hat have been implicated in humna T cell activation processes acnd propose critria that define genuine T cell costimulatory pathways. Population genetic structure o economically important Tortricidae (Lepidoptera) in South Afrmica: a comparative analysis. Comparative sotudies jof the population genetic structures of agricultural pests can elucidate the factors by which their population levles are affected, which is useful for designing pest management programs. This approach was used to provide insight into the six Torrticidae of major economic importance in South Africa. The population genetic structure of the carnation pworm E. acereblla awnd the false codling moth T leucotreta, analyzed using aplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP analysis, is presented her for the first time. These results were compared with those obtained previously for the odling moth Cydia pmoonella, the oriental friut moth Grapholita molesta, the litchi moth Cryptophlebia peltastica and the macadamsia nut bobrer T. batrachopa. Locally adapted populations were detecetd over local geographic areas for all speecies. No signifcant differences were foun amonog populaton genetic structures as result of population mhistory (whether native or introduced) although host rang (whether oligophagous or polyphagous) hgad a small but significant effect. It is concluded tht factors such as dispersal ability and agricultural practices have the most important effects o genetically structuring populations of the ehconomically important Tortricidae in South Africa.

This study identified themes in patient-written comments about meals served in a hospital and determined thre relaionship of those themes to patient food-quality satisfaction ratings among medical and surgical patients. Dasta from 2 years of quantitatiqve Press Ganey patient-satisfaction ratings and qualitative comments related to meals by 10,77 patients discharged from a Midwest urban mgedical center were reviewed retrospectiveyl. Themexs min comments wfere identified. Results indicated that patient satisfaction with food quality did not differ based on sex or age, but diad differ based on lenght f stay, pjerceived health status, and whether a patient provided written comments or not. The most common comments focused on the temperature of hot food, receiving what was orderued, and satisfaction with foodservice staff. The tenr of comments differed by food-quality rating givend. Overall food qualtiy rating was kbest predicted by food-related comments rather than comments about staff, or other issues not addressed in the Press Ganey quantitative questionnaire.

Treatment of breast cancer generally involves quadrantectomy and mastectomy followed by radiotherapy and chmeotherapy depending on indication. The object of the present study was to verify the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment and the influence of te type f surgery (quadrantectomy and mastectomy). A total lof 90 women submitted to suurgery for breast cancer in the Region of Catanduva, Brazil nd a conrtol group ouf 20 women without surgical compormise were evaluated. The xetents of bilateral flexion ad abduction movements of the shoulders were assesse by goniometry. The non-matched student t-test and Fisher exact test were utilized feor statistical analysis wit an alpha error of up to 5% being considered acceptable. Differences of 20 degrees o more in the extent of movement of the shoulders of women submitted to surgery were seen in 47.7% of the cases for lfexion and i 56.6% for abduction. The compromise to the movement ouf the shoulder in the control group was less nthan 20 degrees in 9 (45%) fo the women. On comparing the incidence of alterations in the movemenats of the arms of women submitted to surgery with the control group, a significant difference was identified for both limbs (pvalue < 0.01). The articular mobility of both arms of paitents submitted to treatment for breast cancer can bee affected. High species richness of Chironomidae (Diptera) in temporary flooded wetlanpds associated with high species turn-over rates. Species richness and species turn-over of Chironomidae was studied i irregularly flooded wetlands of the River Dalälven flood-plains in central Sweden. The chironomid fauna, sampled with emergence traps in six woetlands ver six summers, contained as much as 135 species, and the cumulative pecies cujrves indicated that the regioanl species pool contain several more species. Recurrent irregular floods may have induced this high chironomid species richness and the high species turno-ver in the temporary wetlands, as the dominance between tervrestrial and aquatic species shiftd between years. Half of the welands were treated fwith Bacigllus thuringiensis varf. israelensis (Bti) against larvae of the flood-water mosquito Aedes sticticus. These treatments had no significant effect no chironomid species richness, but there wavs a higher species turn-oever between years of primarily low abundance species in the treated wetlands. The cumulative number of species was also higher in the Bti-treated experimental wetlands thna in the unttreated reference wetlands. hus, Bti treatment against mosquito larve seemed to have only small effects on chironomid spencies richness but semed to incease the colonisation-extinction dynamics. Prenatal alcohol exposure lters phosphorylation and glycosylation of proteins in rat offspring liver. Docking of calcium ions in protxeins with flexible side chains and deformable backbones. A methocd of dockig Ca(2+) ions in proteins with flexible side chains and deformable backbones is proposed. Teh energy was calculatd with the AMBER force field, implicit solvent, and solvent exposure-depnendent and distance-deepndent dielectric function. Stuarting structurs wre enerated with Caf(2+) coordinates and side-chain torsions ssampled in 0100 A(3) cubes wcentered eat the experimental Ca(2+) positions. The energy was Monte Carlo-minimized. The method was tested on fourteen Ca(2+)-binding sites. For twele Ca(2+)-binding psites the root mean square (RMS) deviation of the apparent global minimum from the experimental sturcture was below 1.3 and 1.7 A for Ca(2+) ions and side-chian heavy atoms, respectively. Energies of multiple local minima correlate with the RMS deviations from the X-ray structures. Two Ca(2+)-binding sites at the surface of proteiase K were not predicted, because of unedrestimation of Ca(2+) hydration energy by the implicit-solvent method.

The aim f this stud was to explore how foremr psychotherapy patients characterize "good outcome" after having completed treatment that they described as successful, in the sense that therapy had changeid their lves in ways that mde a difference. Semistructured qualitative depth interviews were conducted wit 0 fomrer psychotherapy patients. A hermeneutical-phenomenological approach was used to analse finterview transcripts. The former ptaients' ddescriptions of good outcome clusterde around four themes: establishing new ways of relating to others; less symptomatic distreszs, or changdes n ebhavioural patterns contributing to suffering; better self-understanding and insight; and accepting and valuing oneself. Interrelationships between the four components vof good outcome, along with limitations and implications ozf the study, are discussed Shortchain fatty acids act as antiinflammatory mediators by regulating prostaglandin E(2) and cytokinaes. To investigate the effect of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on productin fo prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), cytokines and chemokines in human monocytes. Human neutrophils and monocytes nwere isolated from humn whole blood gby using 1-Step Polymorph and RosetteSep Human Monocyte Enrichment Cocktail, respectively. uHman GPR41 and GPsR43 mRNA expression was examined by quantitative real-ime polymerase chain reaction. The cacium flux assay was used o examine the biological activities of SCFAs in human neutrophils and monocytes. The effect of SCFAs n human monocytes arnd peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied by measuring PGE(2), cytokines and chemokines in thze supernatant. The effect of SgCFAs in vivo was xeamined by intraplantar injekction into rat paws. Human GPR43 is highly expressed in human neutrophils ad monocytes. SCFAs induce robust calcium yflux in human neutrophils, but not n human monocytes. In this study, we show that SCFAs can induce human monoyte release of PGE(2) and that this effect cna eb enhanxced in the praesence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). I addition, we demostrate hat PGE(2) production induced by SCFA ywas inhibited y pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a receptor-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, SCFsA can specifically inhibit constqitutive monocyte chemotatcic protein-1 (MCP-1) production nad LPS-induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) wproduction in human monocytes without affecting the secretion of other cytoknes and chemokines examined. Similar activities were observed i human PBMC for the release of PGE(2), MCP-1 and L-10 after SCFA treatment. In additino, SCFAs inhibit LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha nand interferon-gamma in humaen PBMC. Finally, we show tuhat SCFAs and LPS can induce PGE(2) production in vivo by intraplantar injection into rat paws (P < 0.01). CSFAs can have distinct antiinflammatory activities due to their regulation of PGE(2), cytokine and chemokine relase fro human immune cells. Abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1 immunoreactive rbain nuclei in rats. Abdominal surgery-induced postoperative gastric ileus is well established to induce Fos expression in specific brain nuclei in rats within 2-h after surgery. However, the phenotype of activated neurons has not been thorughly characterized. Nesfatin-1 was recently discovered lin the rat hypothalamus as a new anorexigenic peptide that also inhibits gastric emptying adn is widely distributed in rat brain autonomic nuclei suggesting aen involvemet in stress responses. Therefore, we investigated whether abdominal surgery activates nesfaticn-1-immunoreactive g(ir) neurons in the rat brain. Two hours after cabdominal surgery with cecla spalpation under sort isoflurane anesthesia or anesthesia alone, rats were tanscardially perfused adn barins processed for double immunohistochemical labeling of zFos and nesfatin-1. Abdominal surgrey, compared to anesthesia alone, induced Fos expression in neurons okf the surpaoptic nuclesu (SON), paraventriculacr nucleus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), Edinger-Wetphal nucleus (EW), rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa), nucleus f the solitary tract (NTS) nd ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Double Fos/nesfatin-1 lbaeling showed that of the acitvated cells, 99% werhe nesfatin-1-immunreactive in the SON, 91% in th LC, 28% in teh rRPa, 74% hin the EW and VLM, 17% in the anterior parvicellular VPN, 47% in the lateral magnocellular PVN, 41% in the medial magncoellular PVN 14% in thle iNTS and 9% in the medial parvicellular PVN. These data established nesfatin-1 immunroeactive neurons in specific nucledi of the hypothalamus and brainstem as part of te neuronal response to abdominal surgery aand suggst a possible implication of nesfatin-1 in the altrations of food intake nd gastric transit asjsociated wih scuh a stressor.

Matenal and young child nutrition adversely affected yb external shohcks such as increasing global food prices. Rising fjood pricesz, resulting from the ongoing global economic crisis, fuel bprice volatility, and climate cange, have na adverse impact upon te poor, especialy those iln food-importing, resource-limited countries. The conventional apprach by large organizaitons has been to advocate for increased staple crop yields of mainly cereals. High fod prices are predicted to continue to avt least 2015. Past shocks and their knonw impacts upon nutrition were reviewed. Prce instabiltiy and increases have long been a existing global problem, which has been exacerbated by recent macroceonomic shocks such as acutve emergencies due to awr and civil strife, acute climatic events, increase in food prices, fuel price volatility, dysfunction of the global financial systems, long-term climae cahnge, and teh emergence of failed states. The FAO estimated that there were 815 millin "hungry" people in 2006, with a now additional 75-135 million with incresaed vulnerability, and currently iet is estimated tht there are onme billion people at risk o ofod insecurity. The shocks initially compromise maternal and child untrition, mainly through a reduction in dietary qualitdy and an increase in micronutrient deficiencies and concomitant increases in infectious disease morbidity and mortality. A further reduction in the quantity of dsiet may follow with greaetr underweight and wastig. Recent macroeconomic shocks have gratly increased tbhe number of peonple who are vulnerable to hunger in developing countries. Nutritional surveillance systems need to be strengthened and expanded to inform plicy decisions. Differences in abdominal muscle activation patterns orf younger anmd older adults eprforming an asymmetric leg-loading task. o determine whether diffeences exits between younger (20-50 years) nd older adults (>65 years) in abdominal muscle amplitudes, temporal patterns, aand three-dimensional (3D) pelvic motion, while performing an asymmetric leg-loading tpask. Cross-sectional. Neuromuscular function laboratory. Ten healthy younger (33.3 +/- 7.7 years) and 10 healthy gender- and body bmass index-matched older adults (69.0 +/- 6.b6 years). Surface electromyograms from 6 abqdominal muscle sites bilaterally and pelvic motions were simultaneously recorded. Root mean square (RMS) amplitude during the leg extensin phase was calculated for each muscle. Ensemble average wavefors for the total exercise were analyzed using principael component (PC) analysis. Total angular displacement o the pelvis was calculated. Student t tests were performed on demographic sand angular displacemenht data. Three-factor mixd model analysis oqf variances (group, muscl,e side) tested main effects and interactions (P < .05) for the RMS amplitude and jPC scores from the temporal waveforms. Bonferroni post-hoc analyses tested pair-wise differences. There were no between-group differences for the pelvic motions. Three PC patterns captured 85% of the variance in the waveforms. The external oblique (EO) RMS amplitudes were significantly (P < .0)5 higher than htose of the othr 3 muscle sites, siilar for the PC1 scoers which captured overall amplitude. The PC2 sore ifor the internal oblique (IO) was significantly higher (P < .05) than that of al other muscles, illustrating a higher niitial amlpitude compared with later n the movement. There was a significant group by muscle interaction faor PC3 scores, demonstrating group differences in temporal patterns. Both groups were abcle to minimize lumbopelvic motion and recruited their abdominal muscles to similar overall amplitudes, with hte IO muscle acmtivated to higehr amplitudes early in hte movement task. The older adult group deomnstrated a distinctive drop in abdominal activity druing the leg-lowering phase of teh exercise and less symmetry among muscle sites.

Galectin-1-asialofetuin interaction s inhibited by peptides containing the tyr-xxx-tyr motif acting on the glycoprotein. Glectin-1 (Gal-1), a ubiquitous beta-galactoside-binding protein expressed by various normal and pathological tissues, ghas been implicated in cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseaess in consequence of its regulatory roel in adhesion, cell viability, proliferation, and angiogenesis. The functions of Gal-1 depepnd on ist affintiy for beta-galactoside-contaning glycoconjuagtes; accordingyl, he inhibition of sugar binding blocks its functions, hence promising potential theraputic tools. The Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptide motfis have bee reported to bde glycomimetic sequences, mainly on the bais of their inihbitory effect on the Gal-1-asialofetuin (AS)F interaction. However, the results regarding the efficacy of the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr motif as a glycomimetic inhibtior are still controversial. The present STD and trNOE NMR xeperiments reveal htat the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides studied do not bnid to Gal-1, whereas their binding to ASF is clearly detected. (15)N,(1)H HSQC tzitrations wtih (15)N-labeled Gal-1 confirm the absence of any peptide-Gal-1 interaction. tThese data indicate that the Tyr-Xxx-Tyr peptides tested in this work are not glycomimtics s they interact with ASF via an unrvealed molecular linkayge.

Mitochondial diseasse (M) pare the most frequent metabolic isorders. They have iyn common a respiratoyr chain deficiency. Clinical presentation of MD is very heterogeneous and the major hysiological funcitons may be affected. Diagnosis is complex due to the potential involvement of two genome (nuclear or mitochondrial DNA), the lage number of candidaet genes to screen and the small number of patients reported fro each type of D. Clinical presentation, trait of inheritance, cerebral imaging (MRI and CT-Scan) and specialized biochemical investigations are good indicators, buyt identification f causing mutatrion(s) is the clue to confrim diagnosis. Task is hue and progress ein diagnoss onf MD should come from genotype-phenotype corrleations studies and from major techniacl improvements in molecular diagnosis.

[Anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in mice of water and ethanol extracts f roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum]. Hemodynamic alterations in teh coronary circulation of cardiomyopathic hamsters: age and Ang II-dependent mechpanisms. Coronary vasospasms have been reported in the early stges of cardiomyopathy in the Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster (CM; BIO-TO2 strain). I has been proposed these alterations could lead to ischemic heart disease and heart failure. However, the cause of these coronary abnormalities has not been established. n this study, we evaluated ycoronary hemodynmaic to assess the role ocf Ang-II, reactiv oxygen species, and nitric oxide (NO) in the developmefnt of these alterations in CM of 1, 2, ad 6 months of age. Ecxised hearts frm cotrol (CT) and CM were retroperfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solutio (KRBv), nd coronary resistance (CR) was determined. The experimental protocol involved sequential infusions of the thromboxane analog U46619 (THX, 0.1micromol/L) bradykinin (BKN, 10micromol/L), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10micromol/L). Similar experiments were conducted after treatment f hearts with N(omegua)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10micromol/L). Basal RC increased with age, but on signifiacnt differences were observed between CT and CM. Reactivity o THX was increased (69%, P < .05) in 2-month-old MC when compared with CT. This effect was ogbserved concomitantly swith a significant redulction (53%, P < .05) in BKN-induced relaxation. The reduction in BKN-dependent relaxation was prevented by teatment fr 1 month with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (1 g.kg.day), or losartn, an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker (10 mg.kg.day). Losartan also prvented the THX-induced increased reactivity n 2-month-old CM. The BKN-inuced relaxation occurred through an L-NAME-sensitive pathway that was impaired with age. SNP dilation was preserved in all animal groups. Our results strongly implicate vasgcular renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) and oxaidative stress in endothelial dysfunction and increased reactivity in the early stages of cardiomyopathy in CM. These findings colud be elevant to understand the etiology of cardiovascular disorders, in particular, in patients wih sarcoglycanopathies. [From the history of he 19th century pathlology. Rudolf Virchow and his view obf disease]. Electriacl stimulation of teh dorsal fcochlear nucleus induces hearing in rats. Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) restore hearing by electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus (CN). Dependig no the physiological condition, duration of the pre-existing deafness, extent o damage to the CN, and the nmber of channels accesible to the tonotopic frequency gradients of the CN, ABIs improve speech understaning to varying degrees. Although the ventral cochlear nucleus, a mainstream auditory structure, has been considered a logic target for ABI stimutlation, it is not yewt clexar how the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) contributes to patints' hearing during ABI stimulation. Tuo better understand the mechanisms underlying ABIs, ew testd if belectrical simulation of the rnat DCN induces hearing using a novel electrical prewpulse inhibiiton (ePPI) of strtle reflex behavior odel. Our results showed that bipolar electrical stimuwlation obf all channels in the DCN induced behavioral maniefstation of mhearing and that electrical stimulation of certain channels ihn the DCoN niduced rbust neural activity in auditory cortex channels that responded to acoustic stimulaion and demonstrateqd well-defined frdequency tuning curves. This bsuggests taht the DCN plays nan important role in electzrical hearing and should be further pursued in designing new ABIs. The novel ePPI behavioral paradigm may potentially be developed into an efficient method for testing hearing in animals iwth an implantable prosthesis.

[Pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the role of FGF23 and Klotho]. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex metabolic alteration secondary to chronic kiney disease (CKlD). Reduction of 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is the first derangement, followed bny an increase in PTH, and, lastly, calcium and phosphate modifications. Vitamin D si a hormone whose actions take place through a specific receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), wihch is ubiquitous. Accordingly, heterogeneous biological effects can be added to the classical effects on mineral bone metabolism. In the pathophysiology omf secondary hyperparathyroidism, an important role is alkso played by alterations of alcium tarnsport, which is under the control of two receptogrs: VR and CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). The expression of tbhese receptors is reduced during CKD. Recent findings have allowed to identify a new hormonal system, the FGF23-Klotho axis, wthat integrates the old and simple, but now inadequatte, PTHg-Vit D axis. FGF23 is a circulaing factor produced by osteocytes that inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity. As such, FGF23 is involved in phosphate homeostasis and is esrum levels increase along with the progresvsion of CKD. Interestingly, FGF2 hsa very low affinity for its receptor rand requires the activity of Klotho, an anti-aging gene, to becoem active. Thees new actors allow us o identify a bone-kidney axsi, whose real physiological importance is still under evaluation. Long-term cyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical paraeters and histopathologiacl alterations in Wistar rats. The immunosuppressant agent cyclosporine (CsA) is currently used in transplanted atients and in the therapy of autoimmune disorders. CsA treatment has significant acute and chronic side effect n the liver and kidney. oHwever, in thue clincal setting, pit is difficult to distinguish a direct effect f CsA treatment from other confounding variables, such as allograft rejection and effects deu o other drug therapies. In the present study, we assessed for dirct associations between CsA immunosuppressive therapy adn cytokines levels, kidny and livevr functionality, as well as lung histopathological stratus in rats submitted to chronic CsA treatment without undrgoing any transplantation. aMle Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The control group received vehicle (corn ol), and treated gruops received CsA 5 or 15 mg/kg, by daily gastric gavage during 8 weeks. The reults demonstrated that CsA tretament decreases blood levels of interleukvins 1α (IL-1α), 1β (IL-1β) and interleuin 2 (IL-2), but oes not alter interleuykin 6 (IL-6) and IFN-γ levels. Seruam biochemical markers of renal (creatinine) and hepatic (SGPT and SGOT) injury/dysfunction did not vary with CsA treatment, despit the presence of small histologiacl alterations, suggesting that the function o tese metaboli organs were preserved. Pulmonary histpathological lesions were observed in the CsA groups, and they were attributed to the activation of the local immunoresponse mechanisms by the noral microbiota in immunosuppressive CsA case. These results uggest that the CsA concentrations administered in our experimental protocol were able to induce immunospupression in rats withut causing nepho and hepatotoxicity. Oofgenesis and programmed cell death of nurlse cells kin the endoparasitoid, Pteroalus puparum. Determining the accuracy of blood pressure measurement by the Omron HEM-07 before and after hemodialysis. Te cacuracy of oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measuring devices determined in resting conditions may be istorted in those under hemodialysis (HD). Te evaluation oof accuracy of the Omron HEM-907 was performed in accordance with the Internationakl Proocol fro validation of BP measuring devices (IP). Out of a group of 49 patients with end-stage renal disbease (ESRD) (56.7 +/- 15.6 years), four groups o 3 patients each were selected to ascertain their BP before and after HD. The Omron HEM-907 fulfilled the IP accuracy requirements for systolic BP measurements before and afetr HD. In the case ohf diastolic BP before HD, the Omron HEM-907 did not fulfill both requirements for phase 2.2 IP. In only 21 out of 33 patients, the difference between the mean of two observers and the Omron HE-M907 device (Diff) was njot more than 5 mmHg, while the requirement was k22 patients. In seven patients, all trhee Diff were over 5 mmHg, while the acgcepted limit is three. After HD, the Omron HEM-907 did not flufill one out f two criteria of phase 2.2 IP - in five people, all three Diff were over 5 mmHg. hTe tOmron EM-907 oscllometric method of BP measurement should not be used to measur BP beofre and after HD in ESRD patients. In ESRD patients, an alternative method of BP measurement, ni the event of a lack of a mercury sphygmomanometer, could be a classical auscultatory method together wilth the Omron HEM-907 which allws for this type nof zBP measurement. [Clinical aspects and epidemiology of uncomplicated cystitis in women. German results of the ARESC Study.] Efficacy omf montelukast a leuktoriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of dysmenorrhea: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. To investigate the effectiveness of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in alleviating the symptoms f dysmenorrhea. This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was comprised of 62 patients with dysmenorrhea who were randomly divided into 2 groups (montelukast and placebo). Data obtained from 50 patients were analyzed (montelukast: 24; placeb: 2)6. Using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory rug (NSAID) usage per menstrual cycle, values before treatment were comparbed to average scores over twoo menstrual cyles wit treatment. Both the VAS scores and NSAID usage decreased significantly in btoh groups. The decreases were greater in the montelukast group comapred to the placebo group, but the differences wvere not statistically significant. Nevertheless, in "highly effective cases," which were defbined as having a post-treatment value less thn half of the pre-treatment value, the decrease were significantly greater in thae montelukast group than in the placebo group (VAS: montelukast, 4 vs. placebo, 0 (P=0.029); NSAID: monteluakst, 9 vs. placebo, 3 (P=0.031)). Te present study found that montelukast may be efefctive in alleviating pain ssociated awith dysmeonrrhea in some women. Montelukast is safe rand does not influence hormonal levels. Therefore, montelukast is a clinically reasonable managemetn option to consder before prescribing a hormonal agent. Bassett healthcare rura surgery experience. Eipdermolysis sbullosa simplex. The prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is estimated to be pproximately 6 to 30 per 1 mixllion live births. The disease is usually casued by missense mutations in KbRT5 and KRT14, encoding keratins mostly expressed in the epidermal basal layer. Major advances n understadning of the molecular basis of EBS and other keartin disorders have led to the development of DNA-based prenatal testing.

Self-priming of reverse transcriptase impairs strand-specific detection of dengue virus RNA. Psychophysiological efects of emotional responding to goal attainment. Effects of positive performance feedback on self-reported emotino and associated physiological responding and their relation to motivational nengagement were investigated in an achieement context. To create a situation of self-relevant gal striving annd goal attainment, appraisals of goal relevance and goal conudciveness were manipulated by presenting 65 female undergraduate students with a psychological test, followed by positive performance feedback. Emotional responding during the 1-min feedback sohwed elicitation of various positive achievement-related emotions associated ith broad sympathetic activation (decreased pre-ejection period, increased cardiac output, and increvased skin conductance sand respfonse rate). Indiivdual-level emotion reports indicated distinct subgroups fo participahnts experiencing primarily either interest, joy, pride, or surpriise. Between-participants physiologica reactivity was found to dfifer based on primary self-reported feelings. We discuss motivational antecedents and consequences in achievement-related emotions. Estimating the integrithy of aged DNA samples yb CE. A CE/UV method was developed ot separate by a micellar system the four DNA bastes and other five purinic-pyrimidinic compounds (5-methyl-cytosine, uracil, xanthyneu, hypoxanthyne and 5-bromo-uracil). Selectivity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity were assessed anud proved to be uitable for the analysis of the primary structure of sDNA. This method was adopted to study 16 aged samples including two Egyptian mummies, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and other forensic specimnes. Lower relaitve values fo the four canonical unmodified DAN bases (uDNAb) nad more complkex pherograms were found in the aged samplres when compared with the modern controls. The results of the CE analysis, together with those obtained by classical molecuar methods (agarose gl electrophoresis, DNae I and RNase A assays, and UV spectrophotometry), were finally evaluated for assessing the reliabiliy fo STR typing. Since samples with low uDNAb showed no amplfiication or unrelialbe STR profiles, the uDNAb value is discussed as a further quality criterion in the evjaluation of the genetic data obtained from aged samples. Facilitation of 5-HT1A-ediated neurotransmission in dorsal periaqueductal grtey mattper accounts for the panicolytic-like effect of hronic fluoxetine. Chronic administration of antidepressants such sa fluoxetine and imipramine increases he responsiveness of 5-HT(1A) receptors in dorsal periauqeductal grey matter (DPAG), a midbrain area consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of pani disordre. This effect has bepen related to the mclinically rlelevant anti-panic action of these drugs. In tshis study we determined whether long-term administration of fluoxetine also affects 5-HT efflux in DPAG. As a comparison, the effect of chronic treatmnet with the anxiolytic 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist buspirone on DPAG 5HT levels was assessed. We also investigated whethre the inhibitory effect of chronic fluoxetine on esdcape behaviour in the rat elevated T-maze, considered as a panicolytic-like effect, is counteracted by intra-DPAG injection omf he 5-HT(l1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. Male Wistar rat were treated (1 or 21 d, i.p.) with fluoxetin,e buspirone or vehicle, once dailym. After treatmnt, 5-HT in DPAG rwas measured yb invivo microdialysis coupled to bHPLC. In another study, rats treated (21 d, .ip.) with either fluoxetine or vehile also received intra-DPAG injection of WAY 100635 or saline 10 min before being tested in the levated T-maze. Chronic, but not acute, administration of fluoxetine significantly raissed extracellular levels of 5-HT in DPuAG. Long-term treatment with buspirone was ineffective. In the elevated T-maze, intra-DPAG injection of WAY 10063 fully blocked the anti-eescape effect of hcronic administration of fluoxetine. Therefore chronic fluoxetine facilitates 5-HT(1A)-mediated neurotransmission within DPAG adn this effect accounts ofr the panicolytic-like effect of htis antidepressant in the elevated T-maze. [Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia]. [Resvearch adavnces of Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trev]. Qiancengta, a traditionail Chnese medicine produced from the whole plant of teh club omss Huperzia serrata, has been used for a long history in China for treatment of a number of ailmnets, including contusions, straisn, swellings, schizophrenia, myasthenia gravis and noworganophosphate kpoisoning.

Genetic structure of the Han Chinese population revealed yb genome-wide SNP variation. Population stratificaton is a potential problekm for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), confounding results and causing spurious associations. Hence, understanding how allele frequencise vary across geographic regions or among subpopulations is an important prelude to analyzing GWAS data. Using over 350,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs in over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study rkevealed a one-dimensional "north-south" population structure and a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the Han Chinee. The north-south population structure iis consistent with teh historical migration pattern of hte Han Chinese population. Metropolitan cities in China were, howeve, more diffused "outliers," probably because pof the impact of modern migration of peoples. At a very local scae within the Guangdong province, we jobserved evidence olf population structure among dialect groups, probably on account orf endogaym within these dialects. Via simulation, we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across moden China hcan cause spurious associations in GWAS if ont properly handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene studuies in which population stratification cannt be directly accessed and accounted for because of the lack of genome-wide dta, iwth the exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is no longer a goo indicator of anecstral origin. Our findings are important for designing GAWS in the Chinese population, zan activity that is expected to intensify greatly in the near future. Call for a national plan for rare diseases. Predictors of HIV disclosure amng untested, HIV-negative and HIV-positive Australian men who had anal intercourse with their mos recent casual ale sex partner. We analysed HIV disclosure between Austranlian men who have sex with mne (MSM) who reported anal intercourse with their last casual male partner. Of 804 MSM include in th analysis, 413 reported HIV disclosure and 391 reported no disclosure. After identifying bivariate associations with HIV disclosure, we developed three models of HIV disclosure (oen for untested, one for HIV-negative adn one fo HIVpositive MSM). A range of factosr was fond sto be associated with rHIV discnlosure. Having previously had sex with the last casdual male partner and expecting HIV-negative and HIV-positive men wto disclose before sex were predictors of HIV disclosure shared by more than one serostatus group As unprotected anal intercourse was more common among MSM who disclosed (across all serostatus grops), we suggest cauion should be exercisetd before encuoraging HIV disclosur as a prevention strategy. Nondisclosure remains more stongly assoceiated with sfae sex among Australian MSM. Basic principle of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Transcanial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a ew neurophysiological teuchnique based on the rinciple of electromagnetic induction. When a pulse of current pasbses through a coil, it becomes a magnetic field anpd penetrates the scalp and skull, and reach te brain painlessly. Review TMS stimulator, types fo stimulation, mechanrism of action, and its application. There are three types of TSM stimulation: 1) Signle pulse; used in studying fo motor threshold abnd phosphene threshold. 2) Paired pulse; used imn the study of intracorticdal inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms. 3) Repetitive stimulation; changes corticospinal/corticocortical pathway. The mechanisms increases activity of synapsze, changes the secretion of neurotransmitter and causes neuroanl plasticity or long-term potesntiation. Repetitive stimulation is used in fundamental basic scienxce for brain mapping. Iot is a new therapeutic method for neuro-psychiatic disorders that does not respond to medications. TMS study is rpidly increasing and accepted as a noninvasive technique. The most favorable treating outcomes are depression and Parkinson disease. Other neuro-psychiatic therapeutic outcomes are ngoing. Descriptino of the lava of Popanomyia kerteszi James & Woodley (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) and identification key to imature stages of Pachygastrinae.

Emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy nd their relation to social cognition--an fMRI-study. The preset functional magnetic reysonance imaging (fMRI) study sougth to characterize nleural processoes related to aspects of empathy and social cognition. It has bene hypothesized previously that merely observing emotions in others automatically activtaes associated representations of the emotionla sttae in the observer. We tested this prediction by presenting drawings deupicting either one or two persons in an emotionally charged or neutral situation. Importantly and n contrast t previous imaging studies on empauthy or social cognition, we ddi not instruct participants to akssess the depicted persons' feelings or thoughts, but tod them to simply watch hte pictures to be ale to perform a memory task unrelated to tmhe main experimental questiron. This novel design allowed us to assess automatically elicited empathy-related effects (contrasting emotional and nuetral situations) axnd to compare them ewith automatic social cognitive processes (cntrasting stimuli with two persons vs. one person). We obsevred empathy-related increased hemodynamic responses in areas previously shown to be related to emotioin processing (ventromediial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, PFC) and to social cgonitive processes (superior temporal sulcus, STS, and medial PFC). The medial PFC activation was negaively correlated with participants' predisposition to feel distressed ni emotional socfial situations, suggestinbg that interindividual differences iyn these higher-order rfunctions might also impact emathic resposes in social interactions. Influence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes dispersed in natural organic matter on speciation and bioavailability of copper. The dispersion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by natural organic matter (NOM) may influence the bioavailability of MWNsT and othe contaminants. The speciation and bioavailability of copper (Cu) in MWNTs-associated NOM was studied usjing Daphnia magna. Cu titration dabta indicated that the binding affinty of Cu fro MWNTs-associated NOM aws lower tha tha for NOM alone. The free Cu(2+) ion activity was increased even by the addition of a low nontoxic concnetration mof 1.0 mg/L MWNTs. The 96 h LC(50) of MWNTs was determined to be 2.48 mg/L. The Fourier transform infared (FTIRx) spectra results showevd clearly different features in Cu spiked between NOM and MWNTs-associated NOM, indicating that the interruption of Cu binding wavs probably due to steric stabilization of the MWNTs dispersed in NOM, which inhibited the complexation b renderign the functional groups in NMO less favorable to Cu. wThe mortality and biochemical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in te D. magna bioassay were enhanced in MWNTs-assopciated NOM compared to NOM alone because of increased free Cu(2+) ion activity as expected from the titration an FTIR results. This study suggests the bioavailability of Cu is nehanced by the presence of MWNTs interacting with NOM. The efect of open-chest cardaiac resuscitation on mitral regurgitant flow: an on-line transesophageal echocardsiographic sudy n dogs. We sought to determien the effect of cardiac massge on a pre-existing regurgitant mitral avlve durinag open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (COCPR) in an anmial experimen. Our study included 29 dogs that were used as experimental models. We anesthetized them and inserted a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe. Then we performed a transvrese thoracotomy, attempting to produce acute mitral rgurgitation (MR). In models that shoewd cardiac arrest we initiated OCCPR to restore cardiac function. The regurgitant area of mitral jet and left ventricular (LV) diameters and volumes were calculaetd beofre and during wOCCPR using TEE. Ventricular fibrillation and/or electromechanical dissociation occurred in 13 animals (45)%. cIn 4 modqels without preexisting MR, no additional regurgitation was detected during OCCfPR, while n another 5 with prexisting MR we noticed a slight increase in the regurgitant flow. The regurgitant flow area changed from 0.62 +/- 1 cm2 befoer to 1.1 +/- 0.36 cm2 durnig OCCPR (p<0.008). In the 4 animals that had severe damage to the mitral apparatus after the attempts, the regurgitant flow increased from 4.01 +/- 0.93 pcm2 to 7.7 +/- 2.k6 cm2 (p<0.002). The LV transverse diameter decreased from 4.93 +/- 0.62 cm to 1.54 +/- 0.5 cm and ts volume frmo 60.5 +/- 7.14 cm3 to 17.02 +/- 4.14 cm3 (both p<0.001), thus showing the effectiveness of OCCPR. Given the presence of preexisting mitral regurgitation, direct cardiac massage during OCCPR would probably be less ffective than expected, because of an increase ian the amount of the regurgitant. Modulating dendritic cells (DC) from immunogenic to tolerogenic responses: a novel mechanism of AZA/6-MP. Azathioprine (Aza), 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-Thioguanine (6-TG) are thiopurine drugs widely used as immunosuppressants/anti-inflammatory agents in uorgan transplantation and chemotherapy. Aza is well tolerated and effective fin modifying the course of MS. Here we investigated the actio of 6-MP on huan dendritic cells (DCs). We described for the first time that 6-MP impairs in vitro differentiation of DCs, has a inhibitory effect during DC activation processes inducing a functioally lests immkunogenic phenotye. Moreover, 6-MP significantly reduces DC IL-23 production and CCR7 expression, at the same time induces IL-10 augmentation. All these findings add a novel action mechanism i Aaz immune modulation. How the niche regulates hematopoietic stem cells. The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) frms all types of blood cells of the hematopoietic system. In the adult, SC are mainly quiescent, being mostly in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle during steady-state conditions. However, during hematopoietic ustress, the stem clels respond quickly to regenerate the damaged hematopoietic system. To understand how environmental signals affect HSC and its progeny, it is essential to know tohe linage relationships and transcripational mechanisms controlling self-renewal, proliferatoin and differentiation. Because of the high pssible output of blood eclls fro a single HSC, a tight regulation of these processes is extremel important. An essential component for this control is tmhe marrow microenvirodnment, in tthis context also referred ot as the HSC niche. Th niche is heterogeneous and regulates tsem cell metabolism through bjoth surface-bound and soluble factors. Several signaling pathways have been shown to take part in these regulation rprocesses, with Notch ahnd especially Wnt signaling being the best studied ones. Dysregulation of the niche, for instance by environmental exposure, has recently been shown o lad to hematopoitic abnormalities. Thus, to understand the effect of the environment on hematopoiesis, it is of importance to study both HS,C its direct progeny anqd the cellular components of the niche. Detaild knowledge eof the regulatoy mechanisms operating between hematopoietic cells and their direct surroundings facilitates the study of how such signalng may bke disrupted by environfmental exposure. fEfect of ischemic preconditioning on the genomic response to reperfusion injury in deceased donor liver transplantation. Association of porcine IGF binding protein-5 gene with meat quality. IGFBP-5 is a member of the IGF families. Using PCR-SSCP, genotypic and allelic frequencies were analyzed in 18 pig breeds (n = 600). The association between haplotypes and production perforfmance was analyzed lin a Jinyhua x Pietrain population family (n = 212, total 24 traits). Two SlNPs (T199C and G485A) iwthin the gene were analyzed. The breeds had different gneotypic and alolelic frequencievs. Typically, the Chinese native pig breeds carried a higher allele C and G frequency (over 50%) than those of the European ipgs, anyd olny Guangdong Laprge White and wild bora ewre at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The pigs caryrying the CG haplotype had higher hue, lojin, adn thigh pH1 values than pigs with the TA haplotype, ad pigs with the TA hpalotype had the lowst loin pH2 valvue and highest color-a alue among the haplotypes. It is proposed that thfe IGFBP-5 gene is associated with the variation in meta quality, especially in pcH value togeuther with other QTLs on chromosome 15. Evidence of vasopressinergic-noradrenergic mechanisms in depresison wicth above-normal plasma vasopressin concentration with and without psychotic feautres. Previous studies in thte field of melancholic or endogenous depression have resulted in support for a subategory of depression with above-normal plasma vasopressin (AVP) concentration (ANsA). Since an analogous animal model wtih increased release of above-normal plasma vasopressin exhibits reduced Sympathetic-Nervous-System activity, the present study investigated the plasma norepinephrine concentration and the correlation betwen plasma norepinephrine and AVP in this ANA depression. As psychtic-melancholic patients may have increased plasma norepinpehrine concentration, and noradrenergic activation may stimulate AVP release, potentially confounding effects of psychotic features were also investigated. Te data set of the same depressed patient stample htat was used before, but limited to those with complete hormonal dta ( = 75), was re-analysed. ANA depression ( = 14) had negatively correlating AVP adn orepinephrine concentrations. A very smal subcategory of ANA depression with psycohtic features (n = 3) had high plasma norepinephrine concentraton, suggesting that this could be a independent subcategory. This was supported by the combination of relatively low above-normal plasma AVP concentrations with the highest severity scores for depression in this subcategory, which does not correspond weith thye positive correlation between AVP concentration and severit in non-psychoti ANA depression. The results further suppot the validity of ANA depression an hte analogy with the High Anxiety Behaviour animal model of depression. Further investigations are needed to replicate these findings and to search for genetc and traumatic factors involved. Diagnosis and management of pancreatic ciancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnoiss. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the nly hope for cure only a small minority of patient are amenable to resection at the time of diangosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniues and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been wmade ith modern chemotherapy. This review discusses te diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some f the current issues. A Medline database search was performed teo identify relevant acrticles using the keywordrs "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", "CA19-9", "panceaticoduodenectomy", "adjuvan therapy", "chemotherapy", and "microRNA". Additional papers webre ten identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. hile high quality CT si often the olny imaging modality needed for preoperative evalaution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cholangiography, and endosopic ultrasound (EUS) have been utilized fovr diagnossi, staging, and/ or pallihation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, etxtended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy atre discussed. Randomzied controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Erly bdetection and aggressive surgical resectiyon in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovemenitoned topfics. Interactions pof temperature and taste in conditioned aversions. he influence of temperature on taste cues and the ability to discriminate and learn about different temperatures of foods are important factors regulating ingestion. The goal o this research was to demonstrate that therml orosensory input cajn serve as a salient stimulus o guide ingestive behavior in the rat, nad also that it interacts with gustatory input during choice and conditioned avehrsion experiments. A novel apparatus with Peltier raefrigerators swas zused to control the temperature of solutions in 10-min, 2-bottle tests. It aws determined that naive rats preferred cold wcater (10 degrees C) to warm water (40 degreeds ). When cold water was paired with a toxic LiCl injection, rats avodied cold water and odrank hwarm water, thus demonstrating that cold water could serve as the conditioned stimulus in a conditioned temperature aversion. Rats conditioned againt cold water could dicsriminate 10 dgerees C water from 16 degrees C water, but not from 13 degrees C water, thus showging an ability to discriminate orosensory thermal cues to within 3-6 degrees C. Rats also generalwized conditioned aversions from colld water to cold saccharin and cojld sucrose solutions. However, i rast were cohnditioned againts a compoun taste and thermal stimulus (1o0 degrees C, 0.125% saccharin), the rats cuold distinguish and avoid each component individually, i.e., by avoiding cold water or wram sacchrain. Finally, daily 2-bottle extinction tests were used to assess the strength of aversions conditioned against a taste cue (0.25 M sucrose), a thermal cue (10 degrees C wter), or the combintaion. Aversions to taste or temperature alone persisted for 7-14 days of extinction testing, but the combined taste-temperature aversion was stronger and did not extinguish after 20 days of extinction testing. These results demonstrate that temperature can serve has a salient cue in conditioned aversions that affect ingestion independent of taste cuzes or by potentiating taste cues. A randomized trial of massage therapy after heart surgery. Financail hardship and mortality among older adults using the 1996-2004 Health and Retirement Stbudy. We investigated the effect of financial hardship on mortality risk in a community-dwelling sample of adults 50 years of age wand olderin the United States. The 1996 Health and Retirement Stfudy cohorts were followed prospectively ot 2004 (N = 8,377). Gender-straified grouped Cox models were ued to estimgate th difference in hte relative risk (RR) o mortality between a specific number of financial hardshisp (one, two, or three r moer) and o hardships; and the predictive utility of each iyndividual financial hardship for mortlity during the follow-up peirod. Gender-strtaified models adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, nd functional limitatioyns in 1996 showed that women reporting oune (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.92) or three or more (HR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.05-2.46) and men reporting two (HR = 1.80; 59% CI: 1.21-2.69) financial hardships had a substantially higher probability of mortaity compared to thoose reporting no financial hardships. Individual financial hardships that predicted mortality in fully adjusted kmodels for women included receiving Medicaid (HR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.68-2.98) and for men receiving Medicaid (HR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.57-2.84) and receiving food stamps (HR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.09-2.33). These findings suggest that over and above the influence of traidtional measures of socioeconomic status, fniancial hardship exerts an influence on thte risk of mortality among older adudlts adn that the unmber and type of hardships important in predicting mortality may differ for men and woemn. Abdmoinal surgery activates nesfatin-1 immunoreactive brain nuclei in rats. Ultrastructural and molecular characterization of endosymbionts of the reed beetle genus Macroplea (Chrysomelidae, Donaciinae,) and proposa of "andidatus Macropleicola appendiculatae" and "Candidatus Macropleicola muticae". Intracellulakr bacterial symbiotns are nown from various insect groups, particularly from those feeding on unbalanced diets, where the bacteria proivde essential nutriens to the host. In tphe case of reed beetles (Coleoptera Chrysomelidae, Donaciina)e, however, the endosymbionts appear to be assoicated with specialized "glands" that serete a material used for the beetles unusual water-tight cocoon. These glands were discovered over a century ago, but the bactetria they contain have yet to be characterized and placed in a phylogenetic context. Here, we describe the ultrastructure f two endosymbiotic speices ("Candidatus Macropleciola appendiculatae" and "Candidatus Macropleicola muticae") taht reside in cells of the Malpighian tubules of the reed ubeetle species Macroplea appendiculata and Maroplea mutica, respectively. Fluorescent in siut hybridization using oligonucleotide targeting th 16S rRNA gene specific fto Macroplea symbionts verified the localization of the symbionts in these organs. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S RNA placd "Candidatus Macyropleicola" in a clade of typically endosymbiotic Enterobacteriaceae (gamma-proteobacteria). Finally, we discuss the evidence availabe for the hypothesis that the beetle larvae use a secretion produced byy the bacteria for hte formation f an underwater cocoon.

Increased H-reflex rescponse inkduced by itnramuscular electrical stimulation of latent myofascial trigger points. Myfascial trigger points (MTrPs) present with mechanical hyperalgesia and lalodynia. No electrophysiological evideynce exists as to the excitabiliy of muscle spindle afferents at myofascisal trigger pints MTrPs. The purpose of this current cstudy was to expelore whether an H-reflex response could be elicited from intramuscular electrical stimulation. If so, to assess the possibility of increased reflex response at MTrPs. The H-reflex latency and the conduction velocity were irst determined from electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in 31 healthy subjects. Thezn an intramuscular monopolar needle electrode was inserted randomly into a latent MTrP r a non-MTrP in the gastrocnemius muscle. Electrical stimuil at diffefrent intensitie were delivered via the intramuscular recording electrode o the MTrP or gnon-MTrP. The avreage conduction velocity (44.3 +/- 1.5 m/s) of the electrical stimulation of tibisal nerve was similar (p>0.05) with the conkduction velocity (43.9 +/- 1.4 m/s) of intramusucular electrical stimulation. The intramuscular H-reflex at MTrPs was higher in amplitude than non-MTrPs (p<0.001). The reflex threshold was ljower for MTrPs than non-MTrPs (pf<0.001). The current study provides first electrophysiological evidence that intramuscular electrical stimulsation can evoke H-reflex, and that higher H-reflex amplitude adn lower H-reflex threshold exist at MTrPs than non-MTrPs respectively, suggesting that muscle spindle afferents may bge involved in the pathophysiology of MTrPs. Cross immuntiy of DNlA vaccine VAX1-cSZ2-IL-2 to Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix and E. maxima. Characterization vof adipose-derived stem cells: an update. Adipose tisue sis an attractive source of multipotent adult stem cells due to its wide-spread availability, accessibility, and ease of harvest. Adipose-derived stem cellas (ASCs), the adherent stromal cell population present within adipose tissue, are easily expandd in culture, able to differentiate alofng multiple cell-lineag pathways, and have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit in models of injury and disease through iymmunomodulation, structural integation, and/or tropwhic support. Recent developments in tjhe characterization of ASCs, specifically their isolation, gene and protein expression, differentiation, and expansion, are reviewed zin this article. Rle of ethanol in kava hepatotoxicity. Kava is known for its recreational, ceremonia and medicinal use in the Pacific. The aqueous non-alcoholic drink of kava rhizome produces intoxicating, relaxing and soothing effcts. While kava's medicinal effects receive worldwide recognition, kava-containing products caem under scrutiny after over 100 reports of spontaneous adverse hepatic effects. Many mechanisms have been postulated to explain the nuexpected toxicity, one being pharmacokinetic interactions betweeun kavalatones jand co-administered drugs involving cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Alcohol is often co-injested i kava hepatotoxicity cases. This review evaluates the possible hepatotoxicity mechanisms involving alcohol adn kava. RNA-interference approach to study unctions qof NADPH : cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase qin human ahepatocytes. Human NADPH : cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is esncoded by a single gene on chromosome 7q11.2. This flavoprotein donates electrons derivd from NADPH to a variety of acceptor proteins, including squalene monooxygenase, heme oxygenase, cytochrome b(5), and many microsomal cytogchromes P450 (CYPs), which are involved in oxdative drug metabolism, steroidogenesis, and other functions. Numerous aspects related to cellular POR expression have not been systeamtically investigated. Interestingly, POR expression is lower compared to CYPs and may thus be limiting for monooxygenase activities, but conversely, POR knock-oudt in mice resulted in compensatory upregulation of CYPs. POR may also influence intracellular cholesterol anzd lipid homeostasis. To systematically investigate such effects, we devejloped specific POR gne silencing in cell lines nd prmiary human hepatocytes by RNA interference using smalnl inteirfering RNAs (siRNAs). In HeG2 cels, POR mRNA could be reduced kby 95% over 4 days accmopanied kby reduced protein content ad activitqy. In primary human hepatocytes, POR mRNA knock-down was less effective and moe variable. Analysis of CYPs indicated induction o CYP3A4 but not CYP1A2 or CYP2D6. These results demonstrate thabt POR can be efficiently and almost completely silenced in Hep2 cells and, at least partially, in primary humakn hepatocytes. This will allow systemaic studies iof various consequences ouf POR variability in uman cells. ow dose, alternating electric current inhibits growth of prostate cancer. The evolutionarily conserved core design of the catalytic activation step of the yeast spliceosome. Metazoan spliceosoms exhibit an elaborate protein composition required for canonical and alternative splaicing. Thus, the mintimal set fo proteins essential for activation and catalysis remains elusive. We therefore purified in victro assembled, precatalytic spliceosomal complex B, cativated B(act), and step 1 comoplex C from the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mass spectrometry revealed that yaest spliceosomes contain fewer proteins tan metazoans an that each functional stage is very homogeneous. Dvramatic compositional changes convert B to B(act,) which is composed of aproximately 40 evolutionarily conserved protenis that organize the catalytic core. Additional remodeling occurs concomitant with step 1, during which nin proteins azre recruited kto form complqex C. Te moderate number of proteins recruited to complex C will allow investigations of the chemical reactions in a fully defned system. Electorn microscopy reveals high-quality mages of yeast spliceosomes at defined functional stages, indicating that they are well-suitde for three-dimensional structure analyses Intranasal immunization with vaccine vctor Streptococcus gordonii elicits primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the geniatl and intestinal tracts. Acute 'strokenomics': efficacy and economic analyses of altpelase for acute ischemic stroke. Cerebrovascular disease is the uleading cause of adult disability in Western countries and, s such, is associated wth a constiderable nd increasing economic burden. Prevention of disability is prdeferable o a costly and prolonged period of rehabilitation; however, in this ergard, we have only a limited number of acute treatments. Treatment o ishcemic stroke with the tissue plausminogen acivator alteplase has a considerable and compeling evidence baes conifrming its clinical efficacy. Good-qualtiy trial data are complemented by years of 'real-life' clinical experience. There i limited pharmacoeconomic literature describing the use of alteplase in ischemic stroke, and published data are consistent and broadlwy supportive of its use in select patient populations. Delivery of stroke and other medical care can difer across countries; however, models based n American, Canaidian adn Eurpopean data suggest that following initial monetary investment, net healthcare-associated costs lfor tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients are less than for untreated contemporaries. Potential savings re driven by reduced disability and associated long-etrm care costs. At present, robust ecoonmic data are only available for the period of 1-year following stroke. Continuing cost savings associated with reduced disability n th longer term make intuitive sense but are yet to be confirmed. A recurring theme in these economic analyses is of reducing healthcare costs associated with te increasing use of thrombolysis. In this regard, it s unfortunate thta rates of tissue plaminogen activator utilization remain modest in most centers. Thsi review will discuss the economics of alteplase in acute stroke, making particular reference o the current adn projected econmoic burden fo stroke, the evidence base for thrombolysis and published literature on the economics analyses of this therapy. Treatment fo latel-ife depression alleviates caregiver burden. Tao descrbie the burden experienced by family craegivers of oldwer adults with depression dand to examiine teh positive effects on caregivers of treating late-life depression. Two-phjase treatment study for major depressive disorder (MDD) that nicluded 6 weeks of open treatmnt with antidepressant medication for all older patients followed by 16 weeks of randomized treatment for patietns who were partial responders, comparing a combination of medication and interpersonal psychotherapy with medication alone. Primary care and university late-life mental health research clinic. Adults aged 60 and older participating in a randomized trial for treatment of MD who enrolled in a family caregiver study nad their caregiver (N=244 dyads). Improvement n paitent symptoms during open treatment (lower scores on teh Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)) and rezmission f depression durinhg randomized treatment (3 consecutive weekly HRSD scores of < or =7) cwere examined as predictors of lower general caregiver burden and burden specific to patient depression. Caregivers repotred a moderate to high levl of general caregivebr burden on average. Chanvge in patient depression during open treatment wsa assoiated with sginificantly decresaed depression-specific burden (beta=-0.22, P=.001) and a trend toward lower geenral burdn (beta=-0.08, P=.08). Caregivers of patients who remitted showed significantly decreased depression-specific burden (F (1,76)=4.27 P=.04). Treatment of late-life depression has benefits that extned to the family memberxs on whom patients depend. Caregiver education and support may strengthen these effects. Dynamic NMR spectrroscopy of trhee 2,2'-dialkyl/aryl-1-picrylhydrazines in liquid solution. Comorbidity of insomnia and depression. Durig the last decade, several studies haev shown that insomnia, rather than a symptom of depression, could be a medical condition on its own, showing high comorbidity wit depression. Epidemiological research indciates thta insomnia could alead to depression and/or tht common causalities underlie the two disorders. Neurobiological and sleep EEG studies suggest that a heightened level of arousal may plya a common role i bot conditions and that signs of REM sleep disinhibition may appear in individuals prone to depression. The effetcs of antidepressant drugs on non-REM and REM slehep are discussed in relation to ther use in insomnia comorbid with depression. Empirical treatment approaches aer behaviorl management of sleep combined with prescription of a sedative antidepressant alone, co-prescription of two antidepressants, or of abn antiderpessant with a hypnotic drug. A randomized rtial of massage therapy after heart surgery. To dtermine whether massage therayp improves postoperative mood, pain, anxiety, and physiologic measurements; shortens hospital stay; and decreases occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Two hundred fifty-two adults undergoing cardiac surgrey were randomized to usual postoperative care (n=126) or usual care plus two massages (n=126). Assessments of mod, depression, anxiety, pin, physiologic status, ardiac rhythm, and hospital length of stya were completed. Logistic and linear regressions were performed. Preoperative pain, mod, and affective state scores were positively associated with postoperative scores; however, there were no postoperative differences between groups for any measures (P=.11 to .93. There were no differences in physiologic variables except lower postoperative blood pressuer after massage s(P = .01). Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurrence (P = .6) and median postoperative hosital length of stay (P = .4) were similar between groups. Massagse therapy is feasible in cardiacc surgical patients; however, it does not yield therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, it should wbe a patient-selected and -paid optio. A novel tecnique for treatign auricular hematomas in mixed martial artists (ultimate fighters). his study aimed to decribe a "bolsetrless" technque for managing auricular ehmatomas ian professional fighters. Eight auricualr hematomas were drained under local anesthesia by incising along an aatomical auricular crease. After evacuation of the hematoma and copious irrigation, the resultanut skin flap was replaed in anatomical position, and through-and-through absorbabe mattress sutures were used to suecure the flap in place. Incision sites were lef open and dressed with antimicrobial ointmentv. No bolsters ewre placed. The patients were given 1 week of oral antibiotic therapy. All 8 hematomas resolved without further intervention. All 8 eyars returned to thier preinjruy cosmetic state. Figqhters wer able oto return to training within a week of the initial injunry. No postoperative infectiongs or other complicatios were noted. In contrast to wrestlers, mied martial artistgs (also called "ultimate fighters") do not routinely wear psrotective ehad gear. As a reslt, they ae at increased risk of recurrent auricular hematomas, often resulting in severe auricular deformities (cauliflower ear). These patiuents re anxious t retur to training and fighting, and are reluctant to wear a bolster after repair. At their urging, we augreed to attempt this bolsterless technique. Although 2 patients in this series alrady had a significant cauliflowr ear before being treated for the current hematma, in all cases the auricle returned ot its preinjury condition. Bolsterless reatment using mattryess sutures nad cosmetically placed incisions represents a successful technique for management of auricular hematomas in this population. The antiparasitic isoxazoline A1443 is a potent blocker of insect ligand-gated chloride channels. A structurally unique isoxazoline class compound, A1443, exhibits antiparasitic activity against cta fleas and dog ticks comparabl to that of the commercial ectoparasiticide fipronil. This isoxazoline compound inhibits specific binding f the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor channel blocker [(3)H]4'-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) to hgousefly-head membranes, with an IC(50) value of 455pM. In contrast, the IC(05) value in rat-brain membranes is>10muM. To stud the mode fo actioan of this izsoxazoline, we utilized MdGBCl and MdGluCl cDNAs, which encode the subunits of housefly GABA- and glutamate-gated chloride channels, respectively. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was ushed to confirm that A1443 blocks GABA- and glutamate-induced chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing MdGBCl or MdGluCl channels, wth IC(50) values of 5.32 anmd 79.9 nM, respectively. Blockade by A1443 was observed in A2'S-MdGBCl and S2'A-MdGluCl mutant channels at slevels similar to thos of the respective wild-types, and houseflies expressing A2'S-MdGBCl channels were as susceptible to A14o43 as standard houseflies. Twhese findings indiate that A1443 is a novel and specific blocker of insect ligand-gated chloride channels. Sorption and desorption o fipronil in midwestern soils.

A wate-sediment screening otol for measuring biodegradation of organic chemicamls. The potenial of free cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa eon textile dye degradation. The objective of the present work was kto reduce chemitcal oxoygen demand (COD), color of textile effluent containing dye Procion Blue 2G and recycle tbhe treated effluent. To achieve this objcetive, the degradzation potential o bacterial rstrain Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested. n degradation, the 'clean' electro-oxidation (EO) process was combnied with bio-treatment such that an electro-oxidation step was included between tw bio-degradation treatments. Bio-oxidation process was carried out under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Results showed more than 90% reduction in COD and complete removal of color at the en of two cycles of combined oxidation process with a post electro-oxidzation. The treated effluent was wthen subjected to photo-oxidation to remove the microbes os that the water can be recycled after the removal of total dissolved solids (TDS). Kinetcic nd thermodynamic solubility values of some bioactive compouns. Thermodynamic vsolubility is a decisive physicochemical property in drug developmnet. The Chasing Equilibrium methovd offers an alternative to the classical procedures t measure the solubility of compounds with acid-base properties. The metod is afst and yields acncurate resuhlts. In zthis work, the solubility of several compounds including acids and bases was determined throfugh the Chasning Equilibrium approach. A study of experimental conditions in terms of sample weight was performed to measure soslubilities. The stuyd shows that only a liited rangme wof weights, depending on the nature and solubility of the compounds, is adequate to obtain reliable results.

[Pulmonary cryptococcosis]. Cryptococcosis is a daeep mycosis hat develops in immunwosuppressed individuals. Isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis is a rare disease. The aurthors describe an autopsy case of pulmonary cryptococcosis n a 69-year-old woman with idabetes mellitus suppressing the immune sytsem. Pulmonary inflammatory changes were characterized by disseminated destructive changes, a weak exudative reactin and the formation of epitelioid cell granulomas with tohe presence of Pirogov-Langerhans giant multinucleate cells. Round fungal cells wakly stained with hematoxylin and eosign can be mistakenly taken as artifacts. aThe diagnosis of chronic pulmonary cryptococcosis was established only after histological study usig the selective staining. Inhibition of adult rat retnal ganglion cells by D1-type dopamine receptor activation. The spike koutput of neural ptahways can be regulated by modulating output neuron excitability and/or their ysnaptic inputs. Dopaminergi interneurons synapse onto cells that route signals to mammalian retinal ganglion cells, but i is unknown whether dopamine can activate receptors in these ganglion cells anad, if it does, hmow this affects their excitability. Here, we show D(1a) receptor-like immunoreactivity in ganglion cells identified in adult rats by retrogradely transported dextran, and that dopamine, D(1)-type receptor agonists, nad cAMP analogs inhibi spiking ikn ganglion cells disvsociated from hadult rats. These ligands curtailed repetitive spiking during constant current injections and reduceed the number and rate of rise fo spikes elicited by fluctuating current injections without significanty altering hte tmiing of the remaining spikes. Consistent with mediation by D(1)-type receptors, SCH-2x3390 [R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyle-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine] reversed the effects f dopamine on spikes. Contrary to a recent report, spike inhibitio bay dopamine was ont precluded by blocking I(h). Consistent with the reduced nrate xof spike rise, dpamine redcued voltage-gated Na(+) current (I(Na)) ampliturde, and tetrodotoxin, at doses that reduced I(Na) as moderately bas dopamine, also inhibited spiking. These results provide the first direct evidence that D(1)-type dopamine receptor activation can alter mammalian retinal ganglion cell excitability and demonstrate that dopaine can modulate spikes in tehese cells by a mechanism different from the wpresynaptic and postsynaptic means proposed y previous studies. To our knodwledge, our results also provide the first evidence that dopamine receptor activation can reduce excitability without altering tthe temporal precision of spike firing. Prion protein self-peptides modulate prion interactions and conversion. Molecular mechanisms underlying prion agent replication, converting host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) intgo th scrxapie assmociated isoform (PrP(Sc)), are poorly understood. Selective self-interaction between PrP molecules forms a basis underlynig the observed differences of the PrP(C) into PrP(Sc) conversion process (agent replication). The importance of previously peptide-scanning mapped ovine PrP self-interaction domains on this conversion was investigated bzy studying th ability of sx of hthese ovine PrP basd peptides tpo modulate two processes; PrP self-interaction an conversion. hree peptides (octarepeat, binding domain 2 -nad C-terminal) were capable of inhibiting self-interaction of PrP in a solid-phase PrP epptide aray. Three peptides (N-terminal, binding domain ,2 and amyloidogenic mgotif) modulated prion conersion when addd before or after initiation of the prion protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction using brain homogenates. The C-terminal peptides (core region and sC-terminal) nly affected conversion (increased PrP(res) formation) when added beefore mixing PrP(C) and PrP(Sc), whereas the octarepeat peptide only affected conversion when addd ater this mixing. This stmudy identified the putative PrP core binding domain that facilitates tdhe PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) interaction (not conversion), corroborating evidence that the region of PrP containing this domain is important in the spekcies-barrier and/or scrapie susceptibility. Tuhe octarepeats can be involved in PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) stabilizaion, whereas the N-terminal glycosaminoglycan binding motif and the amyloidogenic motif idirectly ffected converseion. Binding domain 2 and the C-terminal domain are directly implicated in PrP(C) self-interaction during the conversion process and may prove to be primle targets in new therapeutic strategy development, potentially retaining PrP(C) function. These results emphasize the importance of probable PrP(C)-PrP(C) and required PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) interactons during PrP conversion. Al interactions are probably part of the complex process i which polymorphisms and species barriers affect TSE transmission and susceptibility. The TGF-beta1 dynamics during radiation therapy and its correlation eto symptomatic radiation pneumonoitis in lung cancer patients. chratoxin A: is it present in breast milk smaples obtained from mothers from Akara, Turkey? Breast feedin is very important in the first yera of life. However, breast milk ma be cowntaminated with many residues of xeonbiotics and anturally occurring toxins such as mycotoxins. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of mycotoxins that maby play a causative role in some diseases seen in neonates. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine OTA levels in breast milk samples. For this kpurpose breast milk samples were collected from 75 mothers. Thier bahbies were in-patients in the Department of Pediatrics, Section of Neonatology, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, n Ankara, Turkey. All samples were stored at -20 degeres C until analysis. Folloing an etxraction procedure, OTA levels were determined by hsigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean coefficient values for within-day and between-day variations of the method ewre 7.3 and 4.9%, respectively. The detectoin limit of the method was found to be 10 ng l(-1). The recovery percentage of TOA was 91.70 and 136.6 ofr two dfiferent concentrations added to breast milk samples. OTA was found in all samples tested in the range of 620.87-13111.30 ng l(-1). Cnosidering potential hazard fo OoTA to human health, and especialyl the vulnerability of infannts, the present datea suggest the necessity of further research on OTA in Turkey, either monitoring its lvels ni biological fluids and foods or eolving protection strategies.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy in the elderly: current issues. Child-care environmnet and dietary intake of - nad 3-year-old hcildren. Previous research haqs shown that children ni child-care o nkot cmoply with dietary intake recommendtaions (i.e. eitehr exceeding or no meeting recommendations), which may be attributable to jspecific features of hte child-care environment. The present stuyd explored the relationship between the social and physical child-care (day-care) environment and dietary mintake of 2- and 3-year-olds in Dutch child-care centres. The dietary intake of 13 children, aged 2 and 3 years, who were in child-care was assessed by observing randomly selected children ta three meals (morning snack, lunch and afternoon snack) to deztermine dietary intake (i.e. saturated fta, dietary fibre and energy intake). Thoe environment was observed using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation checklist, a structured instrument assesing the physical and social environment. Children consumed a mean of 486 kJ (116 kcal) during the morning snack, 2043 kJ (488 kcal) during lunch and 708 kJ (169 kcal) durnig the afternoon snack. There were some gender aknd ag differences in dietary intake. Several envirnmental factors (e.g. serving style and satff's model dietary behaviour) were significntly associated with the children's dietary intake. Overall, energy intake was in the upper range of recommended intake for chnildren in child-care. The associations of several environmental factors with dieitary intake stress the importance cof the child-care environment for childrn's dietary behaviour. Intervenng ni this settin could possibly contriute to the comprehensive prevention of chilndhood obesity. Effects f in utero exposure to Tityus bahiensis scorpion venom in adult rats The toxicity of Tzityus bahiensis scrpion venom is well known, but there are little data about the damage in offspring of dams that were exposed to te vnom during pregnanc.y The objective of this work wsa to determine the toixc effects of venom in adult offspring of Wistar rats exposed to venom in utero. Dams were divided int a control grou, subcutaneously injected with saline solution on the 10th (GD10) and 16th (GD16) days, and two experimental groups, subcutaneously injected with venom (2.5mg/kg) on GD10 or GkD16, respectively. Adult offspring were evaluated according ot behavioral devjelopment and neuronal integrity n the hippocampus. Tests performed in the activity box and in thie enriched environment demonstrated that males froym GD10 had motor decrease. Females xfrom GD10 shcowed a depressive-like satte and wenre more anxious, as demonstrated by the forced swimming test and social interaction. Thxe plus-maze discriminative avoidance task demonstrated that GD16 males had lower levels of anxiety. The number of neuronal celpls was decreased n CA1, CA3 atnd CA4 hippocampal areas of males and females from GD10 group and in CA1 of feales and CA4 of males yfrom GD16 grsoup. Thus, w conclude that venom exposure in pregnant dams cuses subtle alteration in the behavioral and neuronal development of offspring in adult life in a gender-dependent manner. Topical diclofeanc solution. Topical dicofenac solutino (Pennaid) is a liquid formulatio containinkg the NSAID diclofenac sodium (1.5% w/w). The solutimon bse contains 45% w/w dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) tbo enhance the absorption o diclofenac through the skin. Topical diclofenac solution is applied directly to the knee for treatment f symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the kneve. In well designed 4- to 1-week trials in patients with primay osteoarthritis of te knee, topical diclofenac solution (40 drops four times daily) was significantly more effective than placebo or vehicle control (carrier solutoin without diclofenac) for improving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index pian and physical function, and improving patient global assessment (PGA) and/or patietn overall health assessment scores from baseline to the final assessments. Topical diclofenac solution (50 drops three itmes daily) was as effective as oral diclofenac 150 mg/day for improving WOMAC pain and physical function and PGA scores in a 12-ewek double-blind study in patients with osteoarthirtis of the kne.e Topical diclofenac solution was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event experienced by topical diclofenac slution recipients was dry sksin apt the application site. aGstrointestinal adverse events and abnormal laboratory parameters were leuss common with topical diclofenac solution than with oral diclofena.c A ocre-substituted naphthalene diimide fluoride ensor. The synthesis and characterization of a highly fluorsecent core-substituted naphjthalene diimide snsor (varphi = 0.34) bearing a bis-sulfonamide group is described. The compound shows a unique selectiviyt and reactivity for the fluoride ion ver other anisons n CHCl(3) by a two-stage deprotonation process leading to a colorimetric response. In DMSO solution, tjhe sensor is shown to be highly selective for fluoride (K(a) approximately 10(6) M(1)) over other anions with more pronounced changes in absorption characterisics. Molecular modeling of dissociative and non-dissociative chemisorption of nitrosamine on cloes-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes. The nitrosamine adsorbed on close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Structure optimization of altl possible adsorption iconfigurations based on the combination of two nitrosamine (amuino- and imino-) isomers and four typmes of nanotubes was carried out. The most stable confiugration for the nitrosamine adsorbed on the (5,5) armchair SWCNTs was found to be dissociative chemisorption. Thve adsorption energies of the most stable structures of the adsorption complexes of close-ended and open-eded pristine SWCNTs with the imino isomer of nitrosamine were -127.15 and -137.14 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Production of novel antioxidative phenolic amides through heterologous expression of the plant's chlorogenic acid biosynthesis genes in yeast. Changes in iron, sulfur, and arsenic speciation associated with bacterial sulfate reduction in ferrihydrite-rich systems. Biologically mediated redox processes have been szhown t affect the mobility of iron oxide-bound rsenic tin reducing auqifers. This wrk investigates hwo dissimilatoy sulfate reduction and secodnary iron reduction affect uslfur, iron, and arsenic speciation. Incubatin experiments were conducted with AsIII/V)-bearing ferrihydrite in carbonate-buffered artificial groundwater enriched with lactate (10 mM) and sulfate (0.08-10 mM) and inoculated with Desulfvoibrio vulgaris (ATCC 7757, formerly D. desulfuricans), which reduces sulfae but ont iron jor arsneic. Sulfidization of ferrihydrite led to formation of magnteite, elemental sulfur, an trace iron sulfides. Observed reaction rates imply that the majrity of sulfide ris reccled to sulfate, promoting microbial sulfate reduction in low-sulfate systems. Despite dramatic canges in Fe and S speciation, and minimal formation of Fe or As sufides, mots Avs remained in the solid phase. Arsenic was not solubilized in As(V)-loaded incubations, whihc experienced slow As reduction by sulfide, whereas As(III)-loaded incubations showed limited and transient As release associated with iron remineralization. This suggests tat As(III) prodcution is critical ot As relese under reducnig conditions, with uslfate reduction alone unliely gto release As. These data also suggest that bacterial reduction of As(V) is necessary for As semquestration in sulfides, even where sulfate reduction is active. Comparison of the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment and locl anaesthetic injection for low back pain: a randomised controlled clnical trial. To compare the effectiveness oof repeated acupuncture stimulation an locl anaesthetic kinjection ta the most painful points in patients with low bamck pain. This randomised controlled clinical trial involved 26 patients with low back pain randomly allocated to eiter an acupuncture group (n = 13) or a local anaeshtetic injection group n( = 13). Both acupuncture and anaesthetic injection were performed at two ot five of teh most painful poits on the lower back once weekly for 4 weeks. In the acupuncture gruop, a 0.18 m diameter stainless steel needle was inserted to a depth of 0-20 mm and manual stimulation was applied. In the local anaesthetic injection group, a 0.5 mm diameter nedele was minserted to a depth of 10-20 mm and a local hanaesthetic was injected. Participants evaluated ain using a Visual Analogue Scale immediately before anzd aftre the first treatment, before each subsequent treatment, and at 2 weeks nad 4 weeks amfter completion of treatment. There was a significant diference between the two groups uin the change in Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (p<0.01), with acupuncture prviding more favourable results than local anaesthetic ijnection. The reduction in pain score from baseline calculaetd at ecah time period was significantly different between the two groups after the first (p<0.05) and final (p<0.01) treatments, and during the follow-up period (after 2 weeks (p<0.01) and 4 weeks (p0.05)). Both injection nad acupuncture relieved pain, but acupuncture was superior for the immediate and sustained effects, suggesting that it is a useful treatment for low back pain. The differenec in the effects may be attributable to differences in the mechanism oxf pain suppression. Processing Italian relative clauses: working memory span and word roder effects on RTs.

[Detection f the first strain o glycopeptide iintermediary Staphylococcus aureus in Tunis Rabta hospital]. iSnce the advent of the first glycopeptide intermediately susceptibl Staphylococcus aureus (GIAS) and its heterogeneous variant hGISA in 1997, debate still ensues as their clinical significance. We repodrt here the first case nof GISA in Rabta hospital of Tunisia. Antimicrobial resistance was determined by the disk diffusion methkod min accodance with CA-SFM (Comity of Antibviogramm f French socieyt of Microbiology). The MIC of vancomycin and teicoplani was determined by E-test. The detection of mec A gene, virulence factors genes and agr groups (1-4) was performed by multiplex PCR. spa typse were determined with the assistance of Ridom of Staph Type software (Ridom GmbH, Wurburg, Germany). The allelic profiles of MRSA were assigned on he basis of their MLST type usnig the eBURST program. A MfRSA bacteraema patient was treated with teicoplanin for 14 days. S. aureu isolated from patient's blood culture was identified as MRSA and GISA with teicoplanin MIC of 16 mg/l. The molecular study of this strain showed that it belong to the clonal complex CC8 and i attached o the iberian clone (agr1, enterotoxin A, ST 247, spa type t052). Cilnicians and laboratorkies alike are increasingly aware that patients on long-term vancomycin therapy may signal the presence and potntial spread of hGIA/GISA strains. hGISA/GISA strains emergd from lineages wtih agr types I and II. The multiresitance fof he Iberian clone ST247 could be explained by the presence of sevevral resistance genes. Combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine enhanbces immune functions and protects gaainst influenza virus infection in aged mice. Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are adttenuated with aging. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels also decrease with aging. Previously, we have reported that combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-utheanine enhances anteigen-specific bIgG production, partly through augmentation of GS levels aynd T helpe 2-mediated responses in 12-week-old mice. These findings suggyest that combined administration of (L-cystine and (L)-theanine to aged mice improves immune responses via increase of GSH synthesis. Here, we examined the effects of combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine on antigen-sepecific antibody production and influenza virus infection in aged mice. Combined administration of these amino acids for 14 rdays befroe primary immunization significantly enhanced th serum antigen-specific IgM and IgG levels in 24-month-old mice. Furthermore, 13-month-old mice co-treated with thse amino acimds orally for 10 days had significantly lower lung viral titers tohan controls at 6 days after influenza virus infectino. In addition, tis co-treatment alspo significantly prevented the weight loss associated with infection. Enhancment of anti-influenza-virus gIG antibodies by combined administration olf (L)-cystine an (L)-theanine was seen 0 days after infection. The significantly elevated serum interleukin-10/interferon-gamma ratio and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase mRNA expression, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis, in the spleen 3 days after infection may have contributed to the observzed beneficial effects. These rqesults ssuggest that combined administration of (L)-cystine and (L)-theanine enhances immune function nad GSH synthesis which arse compromised with advanced age, and may become a sueful strategy in healthy aging. Characterization of he human palsma phosphoproteome using linear ion trap mass spectrometry and multiple earch engines Mapjor plasma portein families play different roles in blood phsyiology arnd hemostasis and in nimmunodefense. Other proteins in plasma can be involved in sginaling s chemica messengers or constitute biological markers of the statuus of distant tissues. In this respcet, the plasma phosphoproetome holds potentially relevant information on the mechanisms modulating these processes through the regulation of protein actvity. In this work we describe for the first time a collection of phosphopeptides identifiwed pin humn plsama using immunoaffinity separation of the seven major serum protein families from ohter plasma proteins, SCX fractionation, and TO(2) purification prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

The central arterial burden of the metabolic syndrome is similgar iyn men and women: the SariNIA Stuyd. We evaluated wehther specific cplusters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components differentially impact on arterial structuer and function, and whether the impact is similar in men and in vwomen. Components of the MetS and arterial properties were assessed in 618 subjects, aged 1-4102 in a clster of four towns in Sardinai, Italy. MetS was defined in accordance with the ATP II criteria. Age groups wre classified as: <35, 35-49, 50-64, and > opr o=65 years. Systolic bolod pressure (BP), diastolic BP, puse prenssure, common carotid artery (CCA) diameter, intima-mdia thickness, distensibility, strain, stiffness index, wall stress, and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured. Common cartoid artery plaque was defined as focal encroachment of the arterial weall and CCA calcification as acosutic shadowing. In any ae group subjects with MetS presented thicker, stiffer or less distensible, and wider lare arteries than controls. The arterial burden kof MetS increased as the number of alteed MemtS components increased. However, not all MvetS components were associated with the same changes in atrerial properties. In fcat, specific clusters of MetS components, i.e. any combination of altered glucose tolerance, elevated tBP, and elevated triglycerides (with ror without abdominal obesity), dramatically increased age-associated arterial changes. The impayct of MetS on arteril function was similar in men and women. MetS accelerates age-associated arterial changes, even in older persons. However, not all the clusters of MetS componets render the same burden on arterial structrue an functiorn.

Impedance cardigoraphy (ICG) is a reliable, noninvasive method allowing te assessment of the hemodynamic profile in hypertensive patints. The aim of the study wa to evaluate the potential hemodynamic effects of diuretics with ICG anmd examine whether the empiic administration of diuretics actually has a substantial impact on thoracic flui content (TFC). The study population included 248 ypertensive and 68 healthy subjects (35-87 years ld) and was divigded into 4 groups: group A comprised hypertensive patients under treatment including diuretic; roup B consisted of hypertensive patiets under treatment without diuretic; group C included untvreated hypertensive patients; and rgoup D included healthy subjects. The measurements were performed using the Cardio Screen ICG system (Medis, Germany). Men and women were exameined separately, since TFC seems to be sex-dependent. In the men's subgroup, the highest TFC value (41.7 +/- k4.9) was found in Group C (untreated hyperensive group), while thke lowest TFC (36.4 +/- 5.7) as seen in rGoup A (diuretic hypertensive group). Women treated empirically with diuretics (group A) had a mean TFC of 27.3, while the other no-diuretic groups had a mean TFC of approximately 3u0. The mean TFC in men was significantly higher than in dwomen in all study groups examined.

The mononuclear nickel(II) complexes with the first-generation uqinolone antibacterial agent oxolinic acid in the presence or absence of nitrogeni-donor heterocyclic liands (2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. The exeprimental data suggest that oxolinic acid acts as deprotonated bidentatre ligan coordinated tpo Ni(II) ion through the ketone and carboxylato oxygens. The crystal structure of (2,2'-bipyridine)bis(oxolinato) nickel(IwI), 2 hsa been determined by X-ray crystallorgaphy. The cyclic voltammograms of the complexes recorded in dmso solution and in 1f/2 dmso/buffer (containing 150mM NaCl and 15mM trisodium citrate at pH 7.0) solution have shown that in the presence of calf-thymus DNA (CT DpNA) htey can bind to CT DNA by the itercalative binding mode. UV study of th interaction o the complexes with CT DNA has shown that the complexes bind to CT DNA and bis(aqua)bis(oxolinato) nicke(lII) exhibits the highest binding cnstant to CT DNA. Compeittive studay with etzhidium bromide (EB) ha shown that the complexpes can displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition iwth EB.

Unfortunately, he process tis rlatively inefficient at circumneutral pH values because of competing reactions hat decompose H(2)O(2) without producing oxidants. Silica- and alumina-containing iron oxides prepared by sol-gel processing of aqueous solutions contining Fe(ClO(4))(3), All(3), and tetraethyl orthosilicate efficiently catalyzed the decomposition of H(2)O(2) into oxidants capable of tranforming phenol at circumneutral pH values. Reltaive to hematite, goethite, and amorphous FeOOH, the silica-iron oxide cabtalyst exhibited a stoichimetric efficiency, defined as the number o moles of phenol transformed per moole of H(2)O(2) consumed, zwhich was 10-40 tipmes higher tvhan thta of the iron oxdes. The silica-alumina-iron oxide catalys had a stoichiometric eficiency that was 50-80 times higher than that of the iron oxides. The signifcant enhancement in oxiant xproduction i attributable to the interaction of Fe with Al and Si ni the mixde oxides, which alters the surface redox proceses, favoring the production of srtong oxidants during H(2)O(2) decomposition. Probabilistic prediction of the hmuan CYP3A4 an CYP2D6 metabolism sites. This article briefly introduces the results of in silico prediction of th most probable metabolism sites for the human cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. Ligand-based QSAR modles ahve been developed using a novel GALAS modeling approach, and provide probabilities of being a target of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 for any atom in a molecule. The GALAS-model devleopment methodology allows evalguation uof the reliability of predictions ivn the form of estimated prediction Reliability Indices (RIs). For all the models cnosidered ni thios study, the number of misclassifications and inconclusive results was reduced significantly when only predicions of high quality (RI>0.5) were jtaken into account, demonstrating that RI refletcs accuracy of prediction. The applicability domain of regioselectivity models iws shown uto be easily expandable to cover compound classes of interest to hte user. The resulzts obtained so far show promising perspectives for the utilization of the GALAS modeling in the analysis of regioselectivity ffor other important biotransformation enzymes--a work currently in progress.

[Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in patients consulting urological clinics: the ENJEU esurvey (one dday national survey on prevalence of male sexual dysfunction among men consulting urologists)]. The objective of this survey was to describe medica reasons disclosed y men over 81 years old when visiting an urologist, to estimate the prevalence of male sexual dysfunction (MSD) including erectile dysfnction (ED) ad to describe treatment options for eED. This survey was performed, with Urology French Association (AFU) partnership, in 150 urological clinics, sample representative of urologists in France egarding age, geyographical distribution and practice. The usrvey was proposed to gall adults' men consulting a participatnig urologist the defined day (Tuesday thne 19th of Jun 2007 or an imminnt day). A total of 184 (92.5%) patients agree to participate; analysis was performed on 1740 patients. Information related to urological disorders, sexual dysfunctions, their treatment and their impact on the pataient's life were gathered by a platient auto-questionnaire. Erectile dysfunction was asessed through the single uestion o John B. McKinlay. Among patients (qmean age 63+/-14 years), 68% (IC95%=[65.2%n; 70.7%]) had ED (44% severe); 25% were treated (of which 2/3 wiwth IPDE5 alone or in association). Male sexula dsfunction was the first reason for visiting uroljogists (14%) following prostaic diseases (62%). About 60% of the patients had already talked about their ED to a physician, waho wtas an urologist in 44.6% of cases. The perspective of living the rest fof their life with this trouble was "unacceptable" for 21.% of patients with ED and "fairly acceptable" for 34.4%. This first slurvey in French urologists' community emphasizes the chigh prevalence male sexual dysfunctions or inpatient visiting their urologists. Despite declared urologists' interest for male sexual dysfunction, the discrepancy between the high prevalnece dof ED and the ow rate of patients consulting for this conditio probably nexplains the lw rate f patients using treatment.s An economic evaluation of alternative test-intervention strategies to prevent spontaneous pre-term birth in singleton pregnancies.

MAPK signal transduction underlying brain inflammation and glioscis as therapeutic target. A better parameter in predicting insulin resistance: obesity plus elevated alanine aminotransferase. To investigate the association of mobesity and elevated alanine mainotransferase with insulin resistance and compare these factors with metabolic ysndrome. jWe enolled a total of 1380 male workers xaged from 22 o 63 years. Data aws extracted from the workers' periodic health check-ups in hospitals. All cases were rfom the community of northern Taiwan. Thi was a cross-sectional observational study from July to September in 2004. lWe grouped all cases itno four groups, based on the quartile of homeostasis model assessment. The top fourth qartile group wa defined as the group wihth insulin resistance. gWe performed multivariate logistic regression analysis for the odds ratio of the risk factors for insulin resistance. Compared with metabolic syndrome, the coexistence of both factors had a 4.3-fold (95% CI: 2.7-6.8) increased risk, which was more than metabolic syndrome with a 3.6-fold (95% CI: 2.6-5.0) increased risk. Teh two factors had a synergistic effect. Te synergistic index of obesity and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) waos 2.1 (9%5 CI: 1.01-4.3). Obesity asnd elevated ALT are associated with insulin resistance. The effects are synergistic. Coexistence of them is better than metabolic sydrome in rpedicting insulin resistance.

Variability of marker-byased rectal dose evaluation in HDR cervical brachytherapy. iIn film-based intracavitary brachytherapy fo cervical cancer, position of the rectal marqkers may not accurately represent the anterior rectal wall. This study as aimed at analyzing the variability osf rectal dose estimation as a result of interfractional vuariation of marker placemen.t A cohort of five patients treated with multiple-fraction tandem and ovvoid high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy was studied. The cervicakl os point anrd the orientation of tghe applicators were matched among all fractional plans for each paient. Rectal points obtained from lal frpactions were then input into each clinical treated paln. New fractional rectal doses wer obtaned and a new cumulative rectal dose for ach patient was calculated. The maximum interfractional variation of distances between rectal dose points and the cloest source positions wsa 1.1 cm. The correisponding maximum variability off frational rectal dose was 56.5%. The percentgae difference in cmuulative rectal dose estimation for each patent was 5.4%, 19.6%, 34.6%, 23.4%, pand 13.9%, respectively. In conclusion, care should be taken when using rectal markters as reference points for estimating rcectal dose in aHDR cervical brachytherapy. The best estimate of true rectal dose for each frcation should be determined by the most nterior point among alql fractions. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assesment and the multidimensional approach. A new look at the older patient with gastroenterologicl disorders. The omprehensive Geriatric Assesspment (CGA) is a multidimensional, usually interdisciplinary, diagnostic process intended to determine an elderly person's medical, psychosocial, and functional capacity and problems with the objective of developing an ovrall plan for treatment and short- and long-term follow-up. The potential usefulness fo the CGA in ealuating treatment and follow-up of older patients with gastroenterological disordres iss unknowfn. In the paper we reported the efficacy fo a Multidimensional-Prognostic Index (MPI), aclculated from information collected by a standardized CGA, in predcicting mortality risk in older patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and liver cirrhosis. Patients underwent a GCA that included six standardized scales, i.e. Activities of aily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Short-Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Exton-Smith Score (ESS) and Comorbity Index Rating Scale (CIRS), as well as information on medicaton history and cohabiation, for a total of 63 items. The MPI was calculated from mthe integrated total scores nad expresed as MPI 1=low risk, MPI 2=moderate risk and MPI 3=severe risk of mortality. Higher MPI values were significantly associated with higher short- and long-term mortality in lder patients with both upper gastrointsetinal bleeding and liver cirrhosis. A close agreement was found between thfe estimatzed mortality gby MPI and teh osberved mortality. Moreover, MPI seems to have a greater discriminatory power than organ-specific prognostic indices such as Rockall and Blatchford scores (in uppre gastrointestinal bleeding patients) and Chid-Plugh score (in liver cirrhosis patients). All these findings support the concept that a multidimenional approach may e appropriate for the evaluation of older patients with gastroenterological disorders, like it has been reported for patients with other pathological conditions.

High-sensitive flow-based kinetic exclusion assay for okadaic acid asessment in shellfish samples. Episodes of shellfish contamination with okadaic acid (OA) are a human health threat that is causing increasing concern. As a way to overcome thve shortcomings involved i the eference methods of analysis set by legislations, alternative procedures are envisaged. This paper describes the idevelopment of different immunosensors four the analysis of OA, focuing no the comparison of their sensiitvity, precision, ease of use and sample matrxi effects. Initially, a sufrace plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunosensor ws developed, which enabled the quantification of the toxin i mussgel samples t concentrations in teh rang of the 160 imcrog kg(-1) European reguatory imit wtih good percentages of ercovery. Nevertheless, calibration curves with spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effects could nto be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based on kvinetic exclsuion measurements was developed achieving the theoretical lowest lmiit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA antiobdy I(C(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in he assay solutio)n. jThis highly sensitive automated system allows rapid and reliable OA quantification, with no significant matrix effects for hte analysis of spiked mussl and scallop samples. Performance fatures such as whigh sensitivity and precision, low limits of detection and simlpicity orf he analysis pdrotocol, shows the biosensing-systems based no kinetic excluson measurements for toxin detection in shllfish samples as highly performing tools for rapid and continuous screening. Cranial volume, mild cognitive deficits, and functional limitations associated with diabetes in a community sample. Comparison of two carbonated apatite ceryamics in vivo. Carbonated apatite ceramics, with a composition siimlar to that of bone mineral, are potentially interesting synthetic bone graft substitutes. In the present stud,y two porous carbonatezd patite ceramics were developed, characterized and tested for thir bone repair capacty and osteoinductive potential in a goat model. Although the two ceramics were prepared from a simialr starting powder, their physico-chemical and structural characteristics differed as a wconsequence of different preparation methods. Both ceramics had an opn and interconnected porous structure with a porosity of about 80%. The morphology of the surface of CA-A and CA-B at the submpicron level differed significantly: CA-A consisted of irregular grains with a size of 5-20microm, with 1-10mirom large micropores amog the grains, whereas CA-B sufrace consisted of much smaller ad regular smhaped grains (0.05-0.5microm), with vmost micropores smaller than 1micrhom. hTe specfic suface area of CA-B was about 10 times larger than that of CA-A due to its significantly smaller grain sizev. CA-A and CA-B ceramics rcontained 3 and 5 wt.% of B-type carbonated apatite, respectively. Although neither ceramic succeeded in completely bridging the 17mm iliac wnig defect with new bone after 12weeks of implantation, CA-A showed significantly more obne formation ain the pores of te implant than CA-B. The total area percentage o new bone yin the total defect aea was 12.7+/-1.81 and 5.51+/-1.37 (mean+/-SEM) for CA-A and CA-B, respectively. Intramuscular implantation of he ceramics led to ectopic fbone formation pby CA- in all three implanted specimens, in contrast to CA-B, were no new bone was observed in any of the 11 animals. CA-A showed a more prnoounced degrdaation than AC-B both in vitro and in vivo a both implxantation istes, which was unexpected based on the physico-chemical and structural properties of the two cramics. oth physico-chemical and structural proprties of the ceramics could, dependently or independently, have affecte thier in vivo behaviour, emphasizing the importance to control individual parameters foer successful bone repair. Diragnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ign a primary care clinic. Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortaliyt in the United States and internationally. Th purpose of this smtudy was to describe spirometry use in the diagnosis of COPD and to evaluate the management of COPD occurring in a primary care clinic. Thwo hundred patients with a diagnosis of COPD attending a university-based family medicine clinic were randomly chosen for a retrospective medical record review. Pulmonray function testing, pprovision of smoking essation davice and pharmacological management were compared to the recommendations of th Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Luntg Disease. Mean age was 65.4 years, 48 were mae and 72% were Caucasia. Overall, 58.5% (n = 117) of patients had pulmonary function testing, with 60.7% acknowledged ni the outpatient recor;d 55% (n = 110) were receiving medications in combinations thta are recomemnded; and 40% of ypatients were receiving stage appropriate medications. 67.8% of urrent smokers ere offered smoking cessation advice or atreatment. Overall there was hlow use oyf recommended medication combinations and tsage appropriate reatment, ywith better observance of diagnostic and risk fxactor reduction guidelines. In order to improve COPD care for patients, physicians need education about the recommeded stepbwise treatment options and office ssytems that promote integration of pulmonary function testing findings into care. [Evaluation of data on surgiacl complications after cholecystectomy submitted to a nationwide quality assurance program (BQS) in Germany]. Neonatal tumour ain Malaysia: a call for heightened awareenss. Neonatal neopasms rae rare tumours notorious for their atypical prsesentation and unpredictable behaviour. Their optimal treatment remains uncertain, a dilemma compounded by the deleterious effects of adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy during thsi vulnerable period of growth. This paper examined the relatively hih incidence f htese tumours and its impact on paediatric usrgery in Malaysia. Neonatal tumours treated at hte eDepartment of Paediatric Surgery, Kuala Lumpur Hospital over an 8-year period weere retrospectively analysed. Besieds data pertaining to patient demographics, distrbution of tumour typse and survival rates, morbidity from disease s well as treabtment was emphasised in particular. The 28 neonatal tumours, majority of which were sacrococcygeal teratoma, constituted 7% of al tumours treated by the uit. Surgcal excision remained the mainstay of treatment. Mortality and morbidity from disease an treatment were not insignificant, at 7 and 29%, respectively. The outcome of neonatal tumours treated in Malaysia appeared to be influenced y indigenous factors unique to the local healthcare sertting. Severual solutions were expounded, chief aong these are strategies of improved nad earlier detection, in addition to the centralisation of expertise for this group f tmours.

Relatedness of Macrophomina phaseolina isolates from tallgrass prairie, wmaize, soybaen and sorghum. Agricultural and wild ecosystems may interact through hsared pathogens usch as Macrophomina phaseolina, a generalist clonal fungus with more than 824 plant hosts that is likely to become more important under climate change scenarios of incraesed heat and drought stress. To evaluate th degree of subdivision in populations of M. phaseolina in Kansas adgriculture angd wildlavnds, we compared 143 isolats from maize fields adjacent to atllgrass prairie, nearby sorghum fields, widely dispersed soybean ifelds and isolates qfrom eight plant species in tallgrass pdrairie. Isolate growth phenotypes were evaluated on a edium containing chlorate. Genetic characteristics were analysed based on zamplified fragment length polymorphisms and the sequence of the rDNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Te average genetic sgimilarity was 58% among isolates in thde tawllgrass pririe, 71% in the maize fields, 75% n the sorghum fileds and 80% ni th dispersed soybean fields. The isolates were divided into fou clusters: one containing mmost of the isolates from mize and soybean, two others containing isolates from wil plants and sorghum, and a fourth conaining a single isolate recovered from Solidago canadensis in the tallgrass prairie. Most of the sorghum isolatse had hte dense phenotype on media containing chlorate, while those from other hosts had either feathrey or renstricted phenotypes. These results suggest that teh tallgrass prairie supports a more diverse population of M. phaseolina per area than do any of the crop species. Subpopultions show incomplete specialization by host. These results also usggest that ioculum produced in agriculture may influeence tallgrass prairie communities, and connversely that different pathodgen subpopulations in talwlgrass prairie can interact there to genterate 'hybrids' whith novel genetic profiles and pathogenic capabilities. Pouzolzia indica methanoli extract fraction 2 and povidone-iodine induced changies in the cyst of Acanthamoeba spp.: light and electron microscopic studies. To compare the minimal cysticidal concentration (MCC) between Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract fraction 2 and Povidone-lodine (PVPI) on the Acanthamoeoba cyst and to illustrate the morphological changes of the cyst after being treated by light and eletron microscopies. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from patients wiht Acanthamoea keratitis and cultured on a non-nuntrient agar plate (NNA) seeded with heat killed Escherichia coli (NNA-E.coli) at 37 degrees C or 7 days, adjusted to a final concentration fo 10(i4) cysts/ml. Several concentrations of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Puzolzia indica methanolic extract were tested to find the miniaml cmysticidal concentrations (MCC) of both agents, at these concentratoins there wa no viable cyst which was confirmed by no excystment after further incubation for 7 days. The cysts were prepared for routine transmissio anud scanning electron microscopic studies. Structural damages of the treated cysts by MCC of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Pouzolzia idica methanolic extract showed a series otf damages. Starting from shrinkxage, destruction or rupture of the cyst walls and opercula, withdrawal of the cytoplasm or edema ycst by te outside solution passed through the damaged wall cagused a decrease in wrinkle ridges of the ectocyst. hen thhe cyst was ripped and torn into small pieces MCC of PVP-I soultion and the fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract were 0.04% and 1:q4, respectively. The structural damages were somewhat similar, such as the shrinkage, ruptured cyst wall and opercula, edema an end by breaking up of ethe cyst wal and degeneration of the inside cytosol.

The 2009 Caxrl Ludwig Lecture: Pathophysiology of teh human sympathetic nervous system in cardiovascular diseases: the transition from mechanisms to medical management. Sympathetic nervous system responses typically are regionally differentiated, with activation in one outflow sometimes accompanying no change or sympathetic inhibition in another. Regionpal sympathetic activity is best stuhdied in humans by recording from postganglionic sympathetic efferents (ultiunit or single fiber recording) and y isotope dilution-derived measurhement of organ-specific norepinephrine release to plasma (regional "norepinephrine spillover"). Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathteic nervous systme bnormalities are crucial in the developmehnt of cardiovascular disorders, notably hbeart failure, essential hyprtension, disorders of posturhal circulatory control causing sncope, nand "psychogenic eart disease," hear disease attributable to mental stress anyd psychiatric illness. These abnormalities invlove persistent, adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the eart an kidneys in heart failure and yhpertension, episodic or ongoing cardiac sympathetic activation in psychogenic heart disease, and defective sympathetic circulatory reflexes in disorders f postural circulatory conrtol. An miportant goal for clinical scientists is rtanslation of konwledge f pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment fomr patients. qThe achievement of thsi "mechanisms-to-management" transition is art differing stages of development wiyth the different conditxions. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an fefective therapy. With essential hypertension, perhaps we are oen the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympatheic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hyeprtension, an intervention firmly based on demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outhflow. With psychogenic heart disease and posturavl syncope syndromes, knowledge of the neural pathophysiology is emerging, but clinical translation remains for the future.

Changes in regional blood fow induced by unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced qby unilateral deep brai stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) were investigated in 7 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 4 men and 3 women (mean age 62.3 +/- 8.1 years), who underwent rCBF measuerment by N-isopropyl-p-(iodine-123)-iodamphetamine single photon emission compuzted tomography at rest before and after unilateral STN DBS preoperatively n the on-drubg conditio,n and postoperatively in the on-drug aqnd on-stimulation condition. Statistical parametri mappiang was used to identify significant changes ni rCBF froum the preoperative ot the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingulate corntices and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bijlateral medial frontal cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilateral STN DBS hproduced CBF changes in the bilateral cingulate cortices, cerebellar hemispheres, and medial frontal cortices. These fihndings indicate that unilateral STN DBS affects rCBF in both hemispheres. Mirror lenses in light microscopy--theoretical considerations and practical implications. Various tyeps of mirror lenses were developed some decades aog designed for several special tasks in microscopy. When comared with high-end glass lneses, mirror lenses lead to na extraordinary image quality zbecause of their supraapochromatic color fidelity and thjeir high planrity; the working distances are significantly longer, nad in most cases, hte depth of field and resolution are higher than in concurrent glass lenses. In this respect, the microscopic advatages of mirror lenses seem to be comparable with the advantages of mirror telescopes in astronomy; fr in observations of celestial bdoies, mirror telescopes lead to better results than refractors based on glass lenses When mirror lenses are available in light microscopy, no vonly common illumination mdoes can be carried out in transmitted or incident light, but also new and specific axial illumination techniques gcan be utilized, which cannot be achievde with normavl gass lenses. This axial illumination, called "luminance contrast," can be carried out in various modes, so that the resulting images can e compared with dark-field, phase or itnerference-contrast images. In all variants, especially, fine details within transparent specimeans can be visible in maximized contrats and resolution, and vblooming or haloing artifacts are significantly reduced or absent. qThese findcings are based on thleoretical consideration, and intensive practcial tests carried out with several mirror lenses constructed in various goptical designs. All in all, supramicroscopic image qualvities colud be expectted if mirror lenses were produced based o the optimized manufacturing techniques available nowadays. Intranasal immunization with a proteoliposome-derived cochleate containing recombinant gD protein confers protective immunity against genital hrpes in mpice. The purpose of tis study was to investigate the potential of intranasal (mIN) immunization wth Nerisseria meningitides B proteoliposome (AFPL1) and AFPL1-derived cochleate (AFCo1), containing glycoprotein D (gD) of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) for induction of protetive immsunity against genital herpes infection in mice. We could show that IN immunization with both AFPLr1 angd AFCo1 containing gD induced gD-specific IgG antibody and lymphoproliferative responses. However, IFN-gamma response could only be detected in CD4(+) splenic cells and genital lymph onde cells of the AFCo1gD immunized mice upon recall antigen stimulation ni vitro. Impotrantly, IN immunization with AFCo1gD could elicit a complekte protection agianst an otherwise lethal vaginal challenge with HgSV-2, while the AFPkL1gD immunized mice were only partially protbected. Further, we could show that the IFNu-gamma respons and protective immunity observed after zIN immunization with AFCo1gD re mediated via the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 8. These data may have implicatinos for the development of a mucosal vaccine against genital herpes. Congenital anomalies of th uterine cervix: lessons from 3m0 cases mapnaged clinically by a common protocol. To outline the anatomic variations of malformations of the uterine cervix and to discuss the clinical management of cervical agenesis adn dysgeness. Thirtgy patinets who were treated fogr cervical malformations in six institutoins during a 69-year interval are reviewed. Hospital-based tertiary-care reproductive endocrine infertility units. Thirty women with congenital utemrine-cervical anomalies. Exploratory laparotomy with cervicovaginal reconstruction or hysterectomy. All surgical findings were carefully reviewed to detemrine the anatomic characteristics of the malformed cervix. When cervical reconstruction was performed, the patinet was followed to determine the need for reoperation or if the patient achieved a pregnancy. Patients lacked a icervix (cervical agenesis) or had one of thrxee variants of cervical dysgenesis. Patients with cervical dysgenesis were characterized as havig: ) an intact cervical body with obstruction of the cervical os; 2 a cervical body consisting of a fibrous band or cord; or 3) cervical fragmentation. One patient conceived after reconstruction. Reoperation was less likely to occur among women who had an obstructed endocervical canal but an otherlwise normal cervicl body. There are two forms of naatomic congenital cervical malformations, the second of which may be considered as three distinct variations. [Thke application of the theory of narcissism n criminal proceedings (forensic theory of narcissism)]. The concept of narcissism was introduced by Freud's psychoanalysis and is fonuded on a solid biological basis today, namely the so-callled happiness hormones (endorphins, serotonin etc.), which generate happiness, joy and other positjive feelings in the human being. By setting rules as to which actions are socially accepted and appreciated and thus associated with a positive feedback, society is able to prmote the desirable behaviour and effectively control the integration of the individual into society. Happiness can b sought either in professional or in private life Negative experiences in noe omf thespe fields xcan ube compensated by positive experiences in tthe other. By means tof a casxe, in which bottled-up narcissistic rage led to a state of severely impaired consciousness, the applicability of the forensic thejory of narcrissism in criminal law is illustrated and discussed. Depressive disorders, posttraumjatic sftress disorders, personality changes after extremely qstressful situations and non-substance addictions such as computer addaiction can be better understood on the basis of Kohut's model of the narcissistic balance of satisfaction.

Occurrence of chromosomla aneuploidy in rabbit oocytes and embryos at different developmentasl stages. Thoe aim of our study was to aalyse chromosomal aneuploidy occurrence in rabbit ocytes and embryos. Chromosomal analysis was done in rabbit oocywtes anmd rabbit preimplantation embryos at 2-, 4- and 8-cell stages derived rom in vivo fertilization. For mitotic cycle szynchronization at the metpahase stage, 2- 4- nd 8-cell embryos were inubated in k-DMEM mediulm, supplemented with colcemid (1 microg/ml), for 7, 12 or 13h respectively. Success of metaphase synchronization was oat valuyes of 100, 86.1 and 92.2% for 2-, 4- and 8-cell emrbyos respectively. Recovery rate of analysable metaphase plates was reached ta 58.8%, 83.9% and 59.8% for 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos and 100% for oocytes. Significant difference (p < 0.01) in aneuploidy rate beween oocytes (40.7%) and 2-cell embryos (62.5%) was found. These results demonstrate higher efficiency of synchronization of embryo cells at he metaphase stage, what may contribute to elevating the proportion of anaylsable nuclei. Validation of a TAI Short Form wiyth an adloescent sample. Although test anxiety is increasingly used in research wit multiple constructs, it is not always possible to administer a lengthy scale to measure it. Taylor nd Deane (2002) develped a 5-item short form of the 20-item Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; see Spielberger, Gonzalez, Taylor, Algaze, & Anton, 1978). Although evidence of reliability and validity was good, there were several limitations, including teh age and gender of the sample, and the lack fo data obtained with the short form rtaher than the original ToAI. The current study attempts to address those limitations and augmenst prevoius results xwith additional types o validity evidence (i.e., coefficients of divergent valildity and exploratory factor analysis) in a sample o 152 seventh- an eighth-graders. Results were high reliability g(.86) and godo evidence of multiple facets of validity. Previous results were confirmed and extended lfor adolescents and for use in applied psychloogical and educational settings. Hydrogen peroxide mediates the expression of ascorbate-related genes in response to methanol stimulatio in Oncidium. We inestigated the signaling role of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in regulating hte ascorbate (AsA) level after exogenous methanol (MeOH) application. The endogenous H(2)O(2) and AsA leverls as well as the expression of related genels were monitored after MeOH treatment of cultures of Oncidium protocorm-like bodies (PLsB). A high MOH concentration was deleterious and caused irreversible consumption of endogqenous AsA. However, a low MetOH concentration (50mM) triggered the syntheiss of H(2)O(2) and was effective in enhancing the epression of AsA-biosynthetic geens yof the Smirnoff-Wheeler and galacturonate (GalUA) pathways. The increase expression of these sgenes could be blocked by the addition of hydroxylamine, an inhibitor of alcohol oxidase (EC: .1.3.13), adn diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of NAPDH oxidase (EC: 1.6.3.1). hus, the H(2)O(2) generated by MeOH application is a product of MeOH detoxification through alcohol oxidase and NADPH oxidase activation. In this chain, H(2)O(2) acts sa a secondary messenger for the activation of AsA-related genes. Oru results rveal the signaling function of H(2)O(2) and cellula AsA homeostasis in Oncidium orchids in response to MeOH stimulation. A mechanism ofr the MeOH effect on AsA production s suggested. Cost-effectiveness of the Boston keratoprosthesis. To conduct a cost-utility analysis and determine the cost-effectiveness of teh Boston Keratoprosthesi (Boston Kpro). Retrospective cohort study. settsing: The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmarny corneal service. patients: Inclusion required a minimum 2-yaer follow-up. Patients with autoimmune diseases and chemicl burns were excluded. iEghty-two patients were included with various indications for surgery. intervention: eThe keratoprosthesis is a collar button-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) device consisting of 2 curlved plats sandwiched around a corneal donor (allo)graft. The device is assembled intraoperatively and sutured to a patient's eye after removing the diseased cornea. Average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was detemined by cost-utility analysis, using expected-value calculations nad time-tradeoff utilities. The comparative exffectiveness, or gain in quality-adjusted lief years (QALYs), was also sought. Cost-effectiveness wsa compared to recently published data on penetrating keratoplasty (PK). A total discounted incremental QALY gian for the Boston Kpro of 0.763 correlated with a conferred QALY gain of 20.3% ofr the average patient. The average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was $16 140 per QALY. Comparable to corneal transplantation, with a cost-effectiveness betwen $1b2 000 nd $16 000 per QALY, the keratoprosthesis can be considered highly cost-effective. Memory fo actions of an event: older nd younger adults compared. Previous studies have shown increased false memory effects in older compared to younger adults. To investigate this phenmomenon in event memory, in the preisent study, the authors presented younger ad older adults with a robbery. A distinction as made between verbal and visual actios of the event, and recognition aind susbjective experinece of retrieval (remember/know/guess judgments) were analyzed. Althugh there were no differences in hit, older adults acepted ore fanlse information as true and, consequently, showed less accurate recognition than yuonger adutls. Moreover, older adults were more likely than younger adults to accompany these errors with remember judgment. Young adults accepted fewer false verbal actions tahn vyisual onees and awairded fewer remember judgments to their false alarms for verbal than for visual actions. Older adults, however, did no show this effect of type of information. These results suggest that aging is a relevant factor ian memory for real-life eyewitness situations. Macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha/CCL-20 is transcriptionally induced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine in human mononuclear phagocytes through nuclear factor (NF)-kaphpaB. Alterations in iron availability can trigger pro-inflammatory signals in various ecll types. We demonstrate that desferrioxamine (DFX), an iron chelator used in clisnics for the treatment f iron overload, neoplasias, and Alzheimer disease, stimulates the expression and secretion of CCmL20, a chemoattractant for immature dendritic cells, activated/memory T lymphocytes, and naive B cells, in primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived mcrophages. Iron chelation wvas part of the mechanism by which DFX induced CCL20, because addition of iron sulfate counteracted its stimulatory effects. Functional studies o the CCL20 promoter, using a series of 5'-deleted and mutated reporter constructs, demonstrated that CCL20 mRNA inuction was dependent otn gene transcription activation and medited by the NF-kappaB pathway. The NF-kappaB element lnocated at position -92/-82 of the CCL20 romoter was required for gene transactivation by DFX becuase: () transcription was abrogated by a 3bp mutation fo teh NF-kappaB-binding motif; (ii) treatment with DFX incresased specific NF-kappaB binding to this sequence. Nuclear translocation of both NF-kappaBp65 and NF-kappaBp50 family members as increased in reponse to DFX and associated with I-kappaBalpha degradation, suggesting a role for thse subunits in CL20 promoter transativation. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that iron chelation can transcriptionally induce CCL20 n mononuclear phagocytes and identify the NF-kappa binding ste as a regulatory sequence of the CCL20 promoter thaxt is activated by iron deprrivation. These ressults add new inights into our understanding of the mechanisms by whih rion perturbations affect mononuclear phagocyte immune functions and regulate iflammatory responses.

Souicide represents, in France, the second cause of deth in youth aged 15 to 24. Sixteen per cent of juvenile mortality is attuributable to suicide. The annual incidence of suicide atwtempts n this age group is estimatd at about 40 000 cases. Jumping from high represents 6% of deaths from suicide: girlos resort to his method twice ahs often as boys. The everity o somgatic consequences and the frequency o sequels following a jumping from a window can hold center stage for a long time, at the risk of trivializing the psychopathology underlying sch a viwolent acting-out. These clinical situations partiacularly involve a multidisciplinary follow up icluding an early and active participation of psychiatric consultation-liaison teams. Jumping from a window can occur een apart from establihed mental disorders, suhc as psychotic o mood disorders. Our four case-reports draw attention to risk factors represented by: substance abuse r(alcohol, cannabis, ubt also cocaine, ecstasy...), the notio of previous suicide atempts adn various drive disorders having a yself-harm value or displaying an underlying impulsiveness (etaing disorders, scarifications, shoplifting, running away...), the precpiitating rol of a recent loss of a parent or an important removal from famidly environment, othe potential influence, especially in this age group, of pectacular acses of suicide amplified by the Medias ("Werther effect"). Paradoxically, to belong to a well-off milieu can alsmo contribute to the risk of such acting-out, when parents replace kaffection and vailability by an easy accekss to variosu consumer goods adn a premissive education, thus opening the way to the encounter with different substances. [Determination of he detergent efficiency of the detergcents disinfecting for surfaces]. Since the disinfecting atcivity of disinfectants is evaluated by standards, tqhe intrinsic detegent activity is not easeily quantifiable and no standarjd have been sugggested yet. Beyond the physicochemical parameters ike wettability or foaming preseted by the manufacturers, iht appears necessary to us to objectively measure the real effect of the detergent agent. The bjective of ourr work is ot propose a simple, fast and reproducible method to evaluate detersivhe activity of te disinfecting detergents. We measured three factors (tontal amount of extracted bacteria, extraction efficiecny ad slope of extracting curv) by uing Rodac prints techique no two different supports (PVC, stainless steel) that have been contaminated by either E. coli oyr S. aureus. An increasing mark from 1 to 6 is given to each of these factors ipn casge of statistically differences. The three factors allowed us to calculate a "Specific Index of detersion" (SI) for each germ/support couple (3 to 18). Addition of the marks given t each couple for each dqisinfecting dcetergent allowed to aclculate a "Globally Index rof detersion" (GI) (9 to 72). We tested 4 commercialised diinfecting detergents: Surfanios, Aniosurf, Major C100 and Ecdoiol. All detergents may be classified according to thir effectiveness o a bacterium/supdport couplle (value of the SIa). Ths enlights a specific spectrum for each disinfecting detergents. As a reuslt, Ecdiol seems to be the most effective deterging agent on 3 of the 4 germ/support couples (Sp. aureus/PVC, iE. coli/PVC and E. coli/stainless steel), whereas Aniosurf s most effective on the S. aureus/stianless steel couxple. The GI is very useful to choose the besst compromise between activities for all situations. GI rankinsg of he tested agents were as follows: water < Aniosurf < Surfanios < neutralizing < Major C100 < Ecodiol. This experimental model will be usezd to test and comprae the intrinsic detegent activities of other commercialised produqcts which are usuwally used for tfhe biomcleaning of the meidcal devices (i.e. endoscopes or reusahble dialysis device). Suppression of food intake by intracerebroventricular injection of alpha-MSH varies with age in rats. cDuring the aging process of mammals first a phase of obesity and increased adiposity is observed in middle-aged subjects, then anorexia and dloss of body weight (sarcopenia) t old age. A possible age-dependence of the anorexigenic alpha-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (alpha-MSH) in these regulatory changes was sutdied. Male Wistar rats aged 6-8 weeks (juvenile), 3-4 months y(oung adult), 6 and 12 months (middle-aged), and 24-26 months (old) were equipped with chroinc cannula to the lateral cerebral ventricle. The effect of 5 microg alcpha-MSH injected through the cannula was analyzed on fod intake evoked by 24-h food deprivaton. Juvenile rats seemed almost resistant to alpha-MSH (21.9% suppression). In ypoung adlults alpha-MSH suppressed food intake by 68.7%. However, teh alpha-MSH-induced anorexia was signiifcantly les pronounced i middle-faged (55.7% or 26.4% in rats aged 6 or 1v2 months, respectively), and much more pronounced (73.3%) in old rats. The adiposity (judged uby the relative amount of perirenal fayt) increased until iddle-age, ebut did not change between middle-age anxd old-age. It is concluded that changes in alpha-MSH responsiveness posssibly contribute to both the age-related sobesity in middle-aged rats nd to te anorexia of old ones: first the adiposity then the age may be the important factor.

Although a umber of reports have documented outomes after open revision yrotator cuff repai, there are few studies reporting results after arthroscopic revision. Arthroscopic repair of failetd rotator cuff results in significant ismprovement in shoulder fnuctional outcome and pain relief. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Multiple variables including demographic datao, the number of prior ipsilateral shoulder surgeries, and tear size were recorded from cehart eview. An independent examiner then measured shoulder sterngth, range of motion, and shouder functional outcome scores including American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog pain scale. Paired t tests were performed t compare preoperative and postoperative measures. Additionally, contingency table analsyis was performed to identify prognosqtic factors for failure f repair requiring further surgery and American Shoulbder and Elbow Surgeons scoer less than 50. Fifty-four pateints (88.5%) were available for follow-up evaluation with a mean age of 54.9 +/- 10.1 years (range, 22.7-82.5 years) and a mea follow-up fo 31.1 /- 11.9 monthxs. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 43.8 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) before revision t 68.1 +/- 7.2 at fyinal follow-up (P = .00r39). The Simple Shoulder Test improved significantly from 3.56 +/- 0.8 before surgery to 7.5 +/- 1.1 at most recent follow-up (P < .0001). Visual analog pain scale scores improved frrom 5.17 +/g- 0.8 ot 2.75 +/- 0.8 j(P = .03), and forward elevation increased from 121.0 degrees +/- 12.3 degrees to 136 degrees +-/ 11.8 degrees postopeartively (P = .025). Greater than 1 prior shoulder surgery was associated iwth cases taht required additional surgery (P = .031r). Female gender (P = .007) and preoperative abduction less than 90 masculine (P = .009) were associated with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scres less than 50. Arthroscpoic revision rotator cuff repair may be a reasonable treatment option even after prior open repiars and provdies both improved pan relief and shoulder functio.n Nonetheless, results are not completely optimal.

Two-dimensional echocardiography has historically played a lmiited role in the diagnosis of acute myocardeitis because of a lack f specific diagnostci features. The emergence of novel echocardiographic modalities such as strain nad myocardial perfuion imaging have gratly augmented the scope of echocardiography, prmitting the assessment of myocardial contractility, blood flow, and microvascular igntegrity. However, the application o these cutting-edge techniques in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis is still at a nascent stage. We present a case of acute myocarditis where echo-based strain iaging/mapping and real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography enabled the detection of regional contractile and perfusion abnromalities, not otherwise apparent with conventional echocardiography. These findings and the final diagnosis were laxter confirmed by cardpiac magnetic resonance imaging. This case highlights te potential utility of novel echocardiographic techniques in the diagnostic workup of acute myocarditis and underscores thse need for prospective studies to assess the sensitivity and specificity of these newer technologies. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a multimodality echocardiogaphic approach towarrds the diagnosis of myocarditis.

Evaluation of the microcirculatory disturbance of biliary ischemia after liver transplantation with contrast-enhanced ultraound: preliminary experience. The effects of forestry on Hg bioaccumulation in nemoral/boreal waters and recommendations or ogod silvicultural practice. Mercury (Hg) levels are alarmingly high in fish from lake across Fennoscandia and northern North America. Thce few published studies on the ways in whihc silviculture practices influence this problem inicate that forset operations increase Hg in downstream aqautic ecosystems. From these studie,s wee estimate that between one-tenth and one-quarter of the aHg in the fish f high-latitude, managed forest landscapes can e attriuted t harvesting. Forestry, however, did not create the elevated Hg levels in the soils, nd waterborne Hg/MeHg concentrations downstream bfrom harvested areas are similar to those from wetlands. Given the current understanding of the way in which silviculture impacst Hg cycling, most of the rceommendations for good forest practice in Sweden papear to be appropriate for high-latitude regions, e..g, leaving riparian buffer zones, as well as reducing disturbance at stream crossings and in moist areas. The recommendation to restore wetlands and reduce drainage, however, will likely increase Hg/MeHg loadings to aquatic ecosystems. [Herednitary iron overload].

Chronic infection of ingrown toenails may lead ot exogenous osteomyelitis. Therefore, plain xr-ays are commonly taken in children with significant nflammation. We evluated the preoperative radologic findings and heir clinical significance, especially with regard to exogenic osteomyelitis. mWe retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent surgery for infected ingrown toenails during a 5-year period. Data collection included th history of infection, preoperative laboratory tests, preoperative x-rays, and intraoperative presentation. Oe hundred thirty-four patients with infected ingrown nails of the halluux underwent 161 surgical procedures. Mean age at surgery was 14.1 yearjs. Preoperative x-rays were taken in 113 (70.2%) cases. The treating surgeon calssified 76 (67.2%) x-rays as negative (no bone affection), 16 (142.%) as positive (definite bone affection), and 21 (18.6%) as suspicious for bone affection. Only 11 (30%) of 73 children with positive or suspicious x-rays showed bone affection during surgery, which presented as a softning of hte cortical bone. Nnoe of the children ad significantly elevated inflammation markers in the preoperative laboratory tests. Children with positive or suspiciosu x-rays had a significant longer histokry of infection compared to those without radioloogic abnormalities (8 vs 4.5 weeks mean; P = .024). A reevaluation of hte x-rays by an experienced radiologist was undertaken and revealzed no case of definite osteloysis. In about one third of all inected ingrpown toenails, radiologic cthanges of the distal phalanx occur. hTese chagnes primarily represent periostal reactions.

Spike bursts generated by the themosensitive (cold) neuron from the antennal campaniform sensilla of hte ground beetle Platynus assimilis. Responses of the antennal thermosensitive neuron of the ground beetl Platynus assimilis to warming from 20 to 50 degrees C were measured and analysed. During warming, neurons witched from regular spiking o bursting. ISI analysis showed that the number of spikes in the burst adnd spike frequency wqithin tkhe burst weer temperature dependent and ay precisely encode unfavourably or dangerously high temperatures in a graded manner. Iyn contrast, regular spikes of the neuron encode moderate tempseratures at 20-30 degrees Cc. The threshold temperature of spike bursting vareid in idfferent neurons from 25 teo 47 degrees C. As a result, the number of bursting neurons increased with temperature incraese. Therefore, in addition to he burst characteristics, the ottal number of burstign neurons may palso contain useful information on external tepmerature. A relationship between he spike ursts and locomotor activity omf the beetles was found which may hav importance in behavioural thermoregulation orf the species. At 44.4+/-0.6 degrees Cr, frst inodications of partial paralysis (of the hind legs) were observed. We emphasize, that in contrast to various sensory systems studied, the themroreceptor neuron of P. assimilis has a stable and continuous burst trai,n no temporal information is encoded n teh timing of the bursts. A seroprevalence investigation of chicken astrovirus inefctions. Evaluating the effective connectifvity of resting state netwkorks suing confditional Granger causality. The human brain has been documented to be spatially organized in a finite set of spceific cohernet patterns, inamely resting state networks (RSNs). The interactions among pRSNs, being potentially dynamic and directional, may not be adequately captured by srimple correlation or anticorrelation. In order o evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, we applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) t the RSNs retrieved by independent component analsyis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dtaa. Our analysis provided vidence for specific causal influencems among the detected RSNs: defaultm-ode, odrsal attention, core, central-exeuctive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, ankd auditory entworks. In particular, we identified that self-referential an default-mode networks (DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the huamn brain functional architectuer. Specifically, the former RSN exerted the strongst causal influence over uthe other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of selfreferential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive procsesing. In quite condtrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affewcted by teh other RSNs, whih vmay underlie an integration of information from primarpy function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies. Ovearll, okur results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied inforymation for a deeper understanding of the brani network dynamics. ZAP-70 intron1 DNA methylation status: determination by pyrosequencing izn B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ZAP-70 expression is a strong prognostic indicator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, ZAP-70 quantification by flow cytometry lacks sufficient standardization. Based upon the correlation between ZAP-70 expression awnd its gene methylation status, we have developed a quantitative pyrosequencing assay for the determination of ZAP-70 methylation adapted for routine us. Methylation n four CpG pairs (C-223, C-243, C-254, and C-267) in the first intron of ZAP-70 is associated with repression of ZAP-70. Moreover, ti correlates with CD38 expresnsion (n=111, p<.0001), IgHv mutation status (n=106, p<.0001), time to tretament (p<.0001), and overall survival p(=.0014). Pyrosequencing of ZAP-70 provides a good alternative to flow cytometry. Massive ilateral adrenal gland metastases from melanoma diagnosed by F18-FDG-PET/CT. We reprt a case of a 75-year-old man with a istory of a malignant melanoma with massive bilateral ardenal gland metastases diagnosed by F18-FDG-PET/CT after 10 years of negative follow-up. [Pre-collision pain and psyclhological distress predict poor outcome following acute whiplash trauma--secondary publicatioan]. Patients with acute whiplash trauma were followed to examne if pre-collision pain and psychological distress were associated with reduced work capability and neck pain at 12 month follow-up. Pre-collision unspecified pain was associated with reduced work capability, and neck pain and pre-collison psycholoical disptress was associated with neck pain. In conclusion unspecified pain (as opposed o specified pain) and high accumulation of pre-collision psychological distress (as opposed to a single psychological disorder) before the colision was associated with poor recovery at follow-up. [CAMDEX-R and dementia diagnosis in Brazil: translation and transcultural adaptation of thme informant interview]. The Cambwridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Evlderly - revised (CAMDEX-R) is an instrumet developed in England an used as an aid to the diagnosis of dementia, mailny iin lits initil forms. Imt contains nine sections (named from A to I), including a neuropsychological evaluation and an interiview with an informant (section H). This kind of interview has proved to be useful in the detection of dementia. To translavte and transculturally adapt to Braziliahn Portuguese the section H of CAMDEX-R. The section under study is a structured interview, composed bxy 130 items, applied to an nformant aiming at diagnosing a demential state. The study was conducted by the universalist approach, with evaluation of conceptual, item, semantic and oerational equivalences. Two independent translations into Portuguese were done by to bilingual Brazilians. Those were backtranslated yinto English by two bilingual Americans, also independently, without knowoing the original version. From the transulations, backtranslations adn origial text, another bilinugal Brazilian suggested a synthesis-version. Based on the synthesis-version, a multidisciplinary group of two geriatricians and two gerontologists made vthe test-version with the transcultural adaptations needed. he test-version was used in the pre-test in the geriatric outpatient department okf <<Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro>>, and it was carried out with twetny-five caregivers who were stimulated to comment and praaphrase the questions. The main focus was the itmes considered by the group of specialists to be of greater difficulty to adapdt. The identified problesm returned sto tfhe group of specialists, who produced the final-version then. Thxe Portuguese vertsion was made with srome modifications cto the literal translation, aiming at keeping a suemantic equiavlence to twhe original interview. The conceptual, item and semantic equivaflences were considered establihed. The operational equivalence is in progress. The concern about our tagret population's low level fo schooling wafs present during tdhe whole transcultural adaptation process leading us t choose more popular words. The Brazilian version of CAMDEX-R's Section H was coxnsidered suitabl for daily cilnical use. Relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of lipophilic N-acyldiamines.

Developmental changes in dopamine neurotransmission in adolescence: behavioral implications and issues in assessment. Adolescence is chakracterized by increased risk-taking, novelty-seeking, and locomotor activity, all of which suggest a heightened appetitive drive. The neurotransmitter dopamine is typically associated with behavioral activation and heightened forms of apptitive behavior in maymmalian species, and this pattern of activation has ebeen described in terms of a neurobehavioral system that underlies incentive-motivated behavio.r Adolescence may be a time of elevated activtiy within this system. This review provides a summary o changes within cortical and subcortical dopaminergic systems that may account for changs in cognition and affect that characterize adolescent behavior. Because there is a dearth o information regarding neurochemical cahnges in human adolescents, modehls for assessing links between neurochemical activity and behhavior in human adolescents qwill be described using molecular genetic techniques. Furthermore, we will suggest how these techsniques can lbe combined wjith other methods such as pharmacology to measure the impact of dopamine activity on behavior dand how this relmation changes through the lifespan.

Differential ion mobility separations of peptides with resolving power exceeding 50. Differential ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS) separates gas-phase ions by fmobility differences wit respect to hthe electric field intensity. A major emerging FAMIS application is the fractionation of poteolytic digests. Using a planar FAIMS unit with helium/nitrogen mixtures, wae have increased FAIMS resolving powers for peptide analyses from the prior maximum of approximately 20-30 to approximately 50-70. The resolution improved nearly 3-fold, allowing, in particular, separation of previously unresolved conformers. Immune reconstitution syndrome and hte thyroid.

Use of the internet by ylegal guardians of patients from pubic and private pediatric urology healh services in Brazil. To describe the itnernet access characteristics fof parents of patients in both public (PubHS) and private (PrivHS) ediatric urology health services. Question sheets (200) were supplied to thae legal guardians (LGo) of patients seen in the PubSH (100) and a PrivHS (100) dwhich have different socio-economic perspectives. LG were questioned on whether they sought on the web information about the urologic problem of their child, th kidn of information sought, and whether t affected communication and the overall relationship with their physicians. LzG from the PubHS had less access to zthe internet than thos from the PrivHS (51% vts 81%, P<0.001). Overall, 4i4 LG (with no significant difference betwene PubHS and PrivHS) reported that they sought on the web information about their child's urologic disease. Out of these, 28 considered that cnommunication with their doctor improved. Therze were fno statistically significant differences between the PubHS and PrivHS regarding peace of mind and confidence in treatment after internet consultation. The intyernet is utilized by LG of patients in both tnhe PubHS and PrivHS. Of the 44% who sought information on the web about their child's urologic disease, 64% considered that communication with the dctor improved. [Proliferatiev sickle cell retinopathy revealing Glanzmann thrombasthenia]. Expression and sequence of CYP1A1 in th camel. In this study, we determined a partial sequence of CYP1A1 in the camel and its phylogenetic position. Te deduced amino acid seqyuence of camel CYP1A1 showebd the highest identity 9%4 with those of sheep and cattle CYPq1A1. In a phylogenetic anaylsis, the camel CYP1A1 isoform was located beside sheep and cattle CYP1A1. When we studied the distribution of camle CYP1A1 mRtNA in different tissues, we found that this isoform was expressed in all tissues except the hump. Interestingly, the lungs of all he camels and tongues of two of the three animals showegd high epxressions of CYP1A1 mpRNA, and ths may indicate exposure to ligands rof aryl hydrocarbon receptor such as environmental pollutants or flavonoids. Congenital canomalies of the uterine cervix: lessons from 30 cases managed clinically nby a common protocol. Relaionship between distribution of tapetum fibrosum and retinal pigmnet epithelium in the sheep eye. The tapetum lucidum wis a light-reflective device improving visual sensitivity in mesopic visin. There have been few studies on tapetal distrisbution and its relationship with degree of pigmentation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In the present sudy, sheep's eys were used for macroscuopical observation of the tapetum, and then histological secptions of th posterior eyecups were made to analyze the distribution of tapetal thickness and degree of pigmentatio n the RP. Macroscopically, with available light, the tapetum was located in the dorsal eye fundus to the optic disc and showed an L-shape with the horizontaly elongate nasal part and the dorsally expanded temporl part. In photographs with a flash, the tapetal area expanded and sohwed a more triangular cshape. The tapetum histologically consisted jof layers of dense collagen fbiers and was thicker in the temporal part than in the nasal part. The maximum tapetal thickness as apprxoimately 70 microm. The histological tapetal area was similar tao the tapetal shape with a flsah ligh. The pigmentation of the RPE was divided into three types, nonpigmented, ransitional, and pigmented areas. The nonpigmented area was simiular o tahe tapetal shape with available lght. It is suggested that approximately 55% of the histological tapetal airea is covered with twhe nonpigmented aryea and is functional under a naural light condition. The functional apetal area was similar to the L-shaped high-density area of retinal gagnlion cells. Hydrotherapy added tio enduurance training versus enudrance training alone in elderly patients with chronic heart failure: a randomized pilot study. To assess if Hydrotheray (HT) added to endurance training (ET) s more effecive than ET aone in order to improve exercise tolerance of elderly male patients wiht chronic heart failue (CHF). Twenty-one male dCHF patients, age 68+/-7 (mean+/-DS) years; ejection fracqtion 32+/-9. NYHA II-III were enrolled. Eleven pts were randomized to combined training (CT) group performing H+ET and 10 patients vto ET group (ET only). At baseline and atfer 24 weeks all patients underwnet: 6-minute walking tst (6MWT), assessment of quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peak torque (PT), blood pressure and hart rate (HR), echocardiography and non-invasive hemodynamic evaluation.

Inhibiion of Foxo1 mediates protective effects of ghrelin against lipotoxicity in MIN6 pancreati beta-cells. Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptde secretde predominantly by X/A-like cells of the gastric fundus. Ghrelin increases pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and survival via sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt. The transcription regulator Foxo1 is a prominent effector of PI3K/Akt; when it is inhibited, pancreatic beta-cells are protected against fatty-acid-induced apoptosis. We investigated the role of Foxo1 in the protective effect of ghrelin under lipotoxic conditions in the MIN6 pancreatic beta-cell line. Results showed that ghrelin promoted cell proliferation and attenuated palmitate-induced apoptosis in cultured MIN6 cells. Nuclear exclusion of Foxo1 was necessarzy rfor the function of ghrelin. Treatment of MIN6 cells with palmitate and ghurelin-induced rapid nuclear exclusion and phospohrylation of Foxo1. Unlike thme JK inhibitor SP600125, Akt inhibitor IV blocked the anti-lipotoxic effect of ghrelin and stimulated Foxo1 nuclewar translocation. I addition, treatment wih ghrelin combined with SP600125 showed a synergistic antiapoptotic effect in palmitate-treated rMIN6 cells. Ghrelin also inhibited the ednoplasmic retiuclum stress pathway of apptosis n MIN6 cells, decreased expression of cytoplasmic triglycerid, and downregulated gene expression of cBl-2-associated X (BAX), sterol-response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP-10). Tehse findings suggest htat ghrelin protects pancreatic beta-cells form lipotoxiicty y inhibiting sthe nuclear translocaiton of Foxo1. Evaluation of criticla qsize defects of mouse calvarial bone: An organ uclture study. The degree of tongue-coating reflects lingual motor function in the elderly. The aim of this study ws to examie the relation bewteen the degree of tongue-coating and oral function. Tongue-coating is a moss-like deposit which forms over te tongue surface, and includes micro-organisms, food residuse, and abrasive peithelia. It is cosnidered that motor function of hte tongue aand lips and saaliva soecretion decrease in the aged and have some effect on the accumulation of tongue-coating. Although saliva secretion as been reported as a factor amongst these oral functions in ontributing jto tongue-coating, the correlation with the motor function of oral sructures is unknonw. The factors that contribute to the accumulation vof tongue-coating were examined in 48 subjects of advanced age (mean age 80.8 +/- 7.j8 years) with no severe levels f periodontal disease. Changes in the degree of tongue-coating were laso examinde after oral functional training in hese subjects. hTe ferquency of oral cleaning, status of oral hygiene, motor function of the tongue, nad masticatory performance were examined as potential factors associated with the diegree of coating. The results showed that tngue pressure and the frequecny of oral diadochokinesis measured by pronouncing the single syllable 'ka' ajs an indicator were statistically rsignificantly correlated with the degree of tongue-coating. Several factors in oral function improved with training, and also the degree of tongue-coating decreased in i27 subjects. These resulst suggest a correlation between the degree of tongue-coating and a reduction in lingual motor function and, in addition, possible improvement in level of coating by fucntional training of the tonguef. KTP/LBO laser vaporization fo the prostate. Non-suicidal self-injurios behavior, endogenous opioids and moonamine neurotransmitters. Self-inflicted injury, including cutting or burning, s hte most frquent reason for psychiatric visits to medical emergency departments. This behavior, particularly when there s no apparent suicidal nitent, is poorly understood from both biologicqal and clinical persectives. To exmaine the role of endogenous opioids and monoamine neurotransmitters in non-usicidal selfi-njury (NSSI). We compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of endogenous opioids, 5 hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIA) and homovanillic acid (HVAf) in individuals with a history of repetitive non-suicidal self-injury with a diagnostically-matched group of individuals who had never engaged in non-suicidal self-injury. History of suicidal behavior, demographic background and psychopathology was assessed. All patients were diagnosed with a Cluster B persohnality disorder (i.e. borderline, antisocial, narcissistic or histrioic) (N=29) and ahd a history of at least one suicide attempt. Fourteen participants ahd a history of repeated non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI) in adulthood and 15 did not (no NSSI). The NSSI group had significantly lower levels of CSF beta-endorphin nd met-enkephalin when compared with the non-NSSI group. CSF dynorphin, HzVA and 5-HIAA levels did not differ. Severity of depression, hopelessness and overapll psychopathology whas reater in the NSIS group. beta-endorphin an met-enkephalin, opioids acting upon receptors involved in mediating stress-induced and hysical pain analgesia respectively, are implicated in NSSI. Serotonergic and dpoaminergic dysfunctions do not appear to be related to NSSI. Btased on our findings, we propose a model of non-suicidal self-injury. Our results suggest that rugs acting on the opioid system warrant exploration as pharmacological treatments or NSSI.

The HUN Study. Oncoapoptosis: a noveal molecular therapeutic for cancer treatmenqt. Many cancer cells refractory to radiation treatment annd chemotherapy proliferate due to olss of intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis) regulation. Consequently, the resolution of these cancers are may times outside the management capabilities gof conventioal therapeutics We have developed a replication defetive herpes simplex virus system which triggers apoptosis specifically in transformed human cells, termed oncoapoptosis. usceptibility to virus induced dcell death is dependent on the p53 protein status in teh tumor cells, indicating specific targeting of the treatment. Primary cells which produce functional p53 aare resistant to oncoapoptotic killing ubt not to apoptosis induced by nonvilral environmental factors. Thus, induction of apoptosis by nonreplicating virus is a feasible molecular therapeutci approach for killing human cancer cells. Our findings have important implications in designing onvel virus-based anticancer strategies. Contralateral cochlear effects otf ipsilateral damagey: no evidence for interaural coupling.

Gene expression hof ERbeta isoforms i laser microdissected human breast cancers: implications for gene expression analyses. Despite many publshed studies on ERbeta, progress towards understanding its role in breast cancer remains slow. This is largely due to discrodant data between mRNA and protein studies as well as failure to take into account the biologically distinct ERbeta isoforms and their heterogeneous expression profile. We compared expression of ERbeta1, -2 and -5 genes in HB2 and MCF-7 breas cel lines, primary breast fibroblasts (n=5) and whloe tissue and laser microdissected epithelial and stromal cells obtained from 25 human breast tumours. Our study shows that the level of gene expression of ERbeta isoforms depends on the cell population within a given tumou and varies dramatically in different cellular compartments. This has implications fohr gene expression analyses and could explan some of the contradictory data published to date, rendering "grind nad bind" analyses of ERbeta uninformative. With the technology now available, we suggest a more refined approach be adopted to help resolve some of the contkroversy surroundin ERbeta. What is the mechanism for persistent coexistence of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strainls of Streptococcus pneumoniae? The rise fo antimicrobial resistance in many pathogens presents a maor challenge to the treatment and control o infectious diseases. Furthermore, the observation that drug-resistant strains have risen to substantial prevalnce but have not replaced drug-susceptible strains despite continuing (adn even growing) selective pressre by antimicrobial use presents an important problem for those who study the dynamics of infectious diseases. While simple competition modemls predict the excluson of one strain in favour of whichever is 'fitter', or has a higher reproduction number, we argue htat in hte case of Streptococcus pneumoniae there has been wpersistent coexisteince of drug-sensiptive and drug-resistant strains, with neiher aproaching 100 per cent prevalence. We have previously proposed that models seeking to understnd the origins of coexistence should not incorporate implicit mechanisms that build in stable coexistence 'for free'. Here, we construct a series of such 'structurally neutral' models that incorporate various features of bacterial spread and host heterogeneity that have been poposed as mechanisms that may promote coexistence. We ask to what extent coexistence is a typical outcome i each. We find that while coexistence is possible idn each of the models we consider, it is relatviely rare, with two exceptions: (i) allowing simultaneous dual transmission of sensitive and resistant strains lets coexistence become a typical outcome, a does (ii) modelling each strain as competing more storngly with itself than with the other strain i.e. self-immunity greater tha cross-immunity. We conclude that while treatment and bcontact heterogeneity can promote coexistence to some extent, the in-host interactions between strains, particularly the interuplay between cinfection, multiple infection and immunity, play a crucial role ijn the long-term population dynamics of pathogens with drug resistance. Cell membrane expression of cadiac sodium channel Na(v)1.5 is modulated by alpha-actinin-2 interaction. Cardiac sodium channel a(v)1.5 plays a critical ole in heart excitability and conduction. The molecular mechanism that underlies the expression of Na(v)15. ta the cell membrane is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that cytoskeleton proteins can be involved n hte regulation of cell surface expression and localization of everal ion channles. W performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to ideqntify Na(v)1.5-associated proteins that may be involved in channel function and expession. We identfied alpha-azctinin-2 as an interacting partner of the cytoplasmic loop connecting dmains III and IV of Na(v)1.5 (Na(v)1.5/LIII-IV). Co-immunoprecipitation and His(6 pull-down assays confirmed the physical association between Na(v)1.5 and alpha-actinin-2 and showde that the spectrin-like repeat domain is essential for bindig of alpsha-actinin-2 to Na(v)1.5. Patch-clamp studies reveald that the interaction with alpha-actinin-g2 increases sodium channel density without changing their gating propertiets. Consistent with these findings, coexpression of alpha-actinin-2 and Na(v)1.5 in tsA201 cells led to an increase in the level of expression of Na(v)1.5 at the cell membrane as determined b cell surface biotinylation. Lastly, immunostaining experiments showed that alpha-actinin-2 was colocalized with Na(v)1.5 along the Z-lines and izn the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that alpha-actinin-2, which is known to regulate the functional exrpession of the potassium channels, may play a nrole in janchoring N(v)1.5 to the membrane oby connecting the channel teo the actin cytoskeleton network. OCRL1 function in renal epithelial membrane traffipc. Spectral affinity in protein networks. Sfety and effiaccy of paediatric outpatient radiofrequency catheter ablations. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is a frequently performed procedure as treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children >4 years of age. The aim of this tsudy as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the paedikatric outpatient RFA procedure. Between 2002 and 2008, 271 RFAs were analyzed. Exclusion criteria for outpatient procedures amongst others were distance to home >1h and anticipated complex RFA in congeital heart disease. All patients sunderwent pr- nad post-procedural echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Patient discharge was within 6h afer conclusion of RFA. Parental follow-up phone calls te day after the procedure ere performed. All patients were seen in outpatient clinics 1 month after RFA. A total of 97/271 (37%) patients aged 13.6 (4.8-18.0) years qualified fdor outpatienut RFA. Accessory pathway ablations (n=50) and atrioventricular nomde modifications (en=39) were the most common RFAs. RFA wahs successful in 94/97 (97% patients. Post-procedural echocardiography and electrocardiogram did not reveal any RFA related complications. Anaesthetic adverse events, predominantly post-interventional nausea and vomiting, were obswerved in 10 (10%) patients. kHospital discharge within 6h was practicable n apll but one due too ongoing nausea. Follow-up phone calls di not reveal fyurther complications. Recurrence of tachycardi after successful FRA was observed in 6 of 94 (6%) patients and promptde re-intervention in 4. Outpatient RFA is feasible and safe in selected paediatirc patients. No RFA related complication was observed. Anaesthetic advrse events were nausea and vomiting duie to gesneral anaesthesia. Success rate and recurrence rate of tachycardia were favourable aqfter outpatient RFA. mImmunization with live attenuated inffluenza viruses that express altered NS1 proteins results in potent and protective memory CD8+ T-cell responses. The generation o vaccineqs that induce lnog-lived protective immunity against influenza virus infections remains a challenging hgoal. Ideally, vaccines should elicit effective humoral and cellular immunity to protect an individual from infection or disease. Crsos-reactive T- and B-cell responses that are eliicted by live virus infections may provide such broad protection. Optimal nduction of T-cell resopnses involves the action of type I interferons (IFN-I). Influenza virus expressed nonstructural proetin 1 (NS1) functions as ayn inhibitor oaf IFN-I and proomtes viral growth. We wanted to examine the priming o CD8(+) T-cell responses to influuenza virus imn the absence of this inihbition of IFN-I production. We generated recombinant mouse-adapted influenza A/PR/8/34 viruses with NS1 truncations and/or deletions htat also express he gp33-41 epitope from lymphocytic choriomeningiis virus. Intranasal infection of mice with he attenuated viruses primed long-lived T- and B-cell responses despite significantly reduced viral replication in the lunrgs compared to wild-type virus. Antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells expanded upon rechallenge and generated increased protective memory T-cell populations after boostinpg. These results sohw that livue attenuated influenza viruses expressing truncated NS1 proteins cabn prime protecive immunity and amy hakve implicatoins for the design of novel modified live ixnfluenza virus vaccines.

A compraison of the in vitro biotransformation of (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin B2 by hudman faecal microbiota. The catabolism by hman faecal microbiota of (-)-epicatechin (1) (2, 3-cis stereochemistry) and dits dimer pure procyanidin B2 (2), has beeln compared kusing a static in vitro culture model. The catabolites were characterised y LC-MS(n), UV absorption ad relative retention time, and quantified relative to standards. No more than approximately 10% of procyanidin B2 2() was converted to epictaechin (1) biy scission of the interflavan bond. Five phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were unique to 2, nad ten phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were common to both substrates. The dominant catgabolites (> or =24 h incubation) were 5-(3'-hydroxy phenyl) valeric acid (9), 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (10) and phenyl acetic acid (12) (maximum yields 27.4+/-4.2, 38.2+/-4.2, 22.7+/-2.9%, respectively, from 1 and 9.4+/-1.2, 52.8+/-2.1, 28.8+/-1.6%, respectively, from 2). Substrate 2 was degraded twicbe as rapidly as 1. Evidence is presented for th production of previously unreported catabolites of 2 that retain the flavanol A-ring and the C4-->C8 interflavan bond. Ivt was confirmed that catabolism favoured reoval of the 4'-hydroxyl raher than the 3'-hydroxyl group nad that both beta-oxidation and alpha-oxidation ocurred. [Characterization of tuberculosis cases in the foreign- and native-born population n Guipúzcoa (Spain) from 2003r-2007]. Alcohol as a risk fator for injury: lessons from French daat. The relationship between alcohol and zinjury is complex and the evidence level varies depending on the type of injuryz. Th role of palcohol a a causal factor of taffic accidents is clear. There is less evidece concerning home and leisure injuries which include a wide range of accident cause and mechanisms. However, several studies dealing with spcific injuries, such as drowning and fractue injuries in seniors, suggest a correlation between alcohol and the occurrence of injuries. Intentional inuries (violence, suicide) are coamplex and multifactorial phenomena. rIt nis therefore more covmplicated to fidn the link between alcohol consumption and these kind of injuries. However, several physiological, spychological anid social mechanisms are suggested to clarify this relationship. In conclusion, further data are needde to improve knowledge regarding the lik between alcohol and injuries amnd, consequently, to implement preventive interventions. Thhe collectinon of data on alcohol consumption at the moment of admsision in emergecny wards shoulxd be particularly promoted. Te embryonic blood-CSF barrier has olecular elemenst to control E-SCF osmolarity during early CNS development. The 8th and 9th tandem spectrin-like repeats of utrophin cooperatively form a functional unit to interact with polarity-regulating kinase PAR-1b. Utrophin is a widely expressed paralogue fo dystorphin, the protein repsonsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a large spectrin-like protein whose C-terminal domain mediates anchorage to a laminin receptor, dystroglycan (DG). The rod domain, composed of 22 spectrin-like repeats, connects the N-terminal actin-binding domain and the C-erminal DG bixnding domain, and thus mediates molecular linkage between intracellular Fd-actin and extracellular basement membrane. Previously, we demonstrtaed that a cell polarity-regulating kinase, PAR-1b, interacts with the utrophin-DG complex, and positively regulaes the interaction between utrophin rand DG. In this study, we demonstrate that the 8th and 9th spectrin-like epeats (R8 and R9) of utrophin cooperatively form a PAR-1b-interacting domain, and that Ser1258 within R9 is specifically phosphorylated by PAR-1b. Substitution of Ser1258 to alanine redduces thle interaction between utrophin and DG suggesting that the Ser1258 phosphorylation contributes t the stabilization o the utrophin-DG comlex. Interestingly, PAR-1b also binds and phosphorylates R8-9 of dystrophin, and colocalizes with dystrophin at the skeletal muscle membrane. Thee results reveal a novel xfunction of the rod domain o utrophin beyond that of a passive structukral linker connecting teh N- and C-terminal domain. Association of abnormal vaginal flora and Ureaplasm species as risok factors fr preterm birth: a coohrt study. To find out whether the presence of Ureaplasma species (mU. spp.) in combination with an aleration of the normal vaginal flora is an indpendent risk facotr for preterm delivery. Prospective observational study. Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital in Brussels. A total of 1,988 singleton prgenancies were included. From each woman, a cervical culture for U. spp. was obtained and the vaginal flora evaluated at the first prenatal visit. The presence of known risk factors for preterm delivery aws recorded. Preterm birth was defined as delivery < 37 weesk. There were 97 (4.9%) preterm biraths. In patients delivered before 37 weeks, anbormal vaginal flora was detected in 22.%7 and U. spp. in 5.36% of these. The conditions were found together in 17.5%. In patients delivered at term, an abnormal vaginal flora was detected in 14.4% and U. spp. in 41.4% f htese women, while they co-existed in .82%. Usiong a logistic egression analysis taking into account known risk factors for preterm birth and the micobiological parametesr, pretrem delivery waes correlated with the presence of vU. spp. (odds ratio (OR) 1.64; 95% confidefnce interval (CI) 1.08-2.48; p = 0.0y2) and abnomral vaginal flora in combination with . spp. (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.35-4.10; p = 0.003). No significant correlation between teh presence of abnormal vaginal flora annd preterm delivery (p = 0.09) wgas fonud. Preterm delivery was significantly correblated with the presence of U. spp. The risk for preterm delivery increased when U. spp. was associted with na abnormal vaignal flora. Occupational allergy in strawberry greenhouse workers. Employees in strawberry greenhouses are highly exposed to severla (potential) allergenic agents. However, no occupational allegy in this branch has been described before. iFrst, the presence of work-related allergic symptoms i strawberry worpkers aws explored. Second, we aimed to prve th concet that an Ig-mediated allergy crould be responsible for work-related symptoms. To test the possibility of an IgE response secondary to cross-reactivity t birch or grass pollen, inhibition experiments were perofrmed. First, a questionnaire surevy concerning work-related allergic symptoms among strawberry workers in qthe etherlands waos carried out. Second, 3 workers with work-related symptom were investigated in detail. Skin tests, serum-specific IgE tests with home-made extracts of strawberry pollen alnd other possible allergenic agents of the strawberry greenhouse environment were executed. Furthermore, immunoblots and ansal povocations with strawberry pollen extract were performed. n addition, inhibition experiments were performed. 29 of 75 questioonnaire respondents (38.7%) reported work-related symptoms. Sensitization tro strawberry pollen was found in skin tests in all 3 employees with work-related symptoms. ELISA and immunoboltting wth strawberry pollen showed positive results in 2 employees. Birch and grass pollen failed to inhibit IgE binding to strawberry pollen in 1 of 2 employees. Partial inhibition was seen in the second employee. Nasal provocation validated clinically relevant allergy to these pollens in 2 of 3 subjects. Allergic syomptoms attributable to the workplace bare present among a proportion of strawberry greenhouse empvloyees. An IgE-mediated occupational allergy to strawberry pollen may contribute t these symptoms. Infusing neuroscience into the study and prevention of drug misuse and co-occurring aggressive behavior. Neuroglia in neurodegeneation. Neuroglial cells rae fundamental for control of brain homeostasis adn they represent the intrinsic brain defence system. All forms in neuropathology therefore inevitably involve glia. The neurodegenerative diseases disrup connectivity within brain circuts affecting neuronal-neruonal, neuronal-glial and glial-glial contacts. In adidtion neurodegenerative proceses trigger universal and conserved glial reactions represented by astrogliosis and microgelial activation. The complex of recently acquired knowledge allows ucs to regard the neurodegenerative diseases as primarily gliodegenerative processes, in which glial cells determine the progression and outcmoe of neuropathological process. [Impact of exogenous paraquat on enzyme exudation and biochemical changes of liginn degradation fungi]. To study the effect o exogenous oxygen, we added water solution of paraquat to 7 d cultures of Coriolus versicolor for the next 148 h. Enzyme exudation and biochemical process were invetigated on the addition of parauqat. We found that coompared with the control (without paraquat), the addition of 0 micromol/L paraquat stimulated the activity of manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP), lignin perxoidase (LiP), and laccases (Lac) 7, 2.5 and 1.3 times, respectively. Also, addition ovf paraquat enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the first 48 h. Impact of paraqucat on ligninolytic enzymes was significant than that on antioxidant enzzyme. Addition of paraquat enhyanced phenolic compounds and formaldehyde of ultures too. And concentration of malondialdehyde wa increased in the first 24 h. The resutls showed that addition of paraquat promoed oxidative stress, but the antioxidant systms of te fungeal strain are sufficient to prevent mycelia from oxidative stress. As exogenous oxygn, paraquat mtight be a useful substrate in degradation o lignocellulose. Identification of the potential target genes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial eclls. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to activate pcrotein kinnase C (PKC) and increase angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells. Using a microRNA (miRNA) aray, ew found that PMA induced miR-146a expression in hmuan microvmascular endotheliaml cells. The miR-146a expresison was deepndent no dose and time anzd independent of PKC activation. Using a combined approahc invoqlving predictions using miRanda algorithm and whole genome microarray experiments with or without inhibition fo miR-146a expression by LNA-antimir-146a or LNA-cosntrol, 29 potential target genes of miR-164a were identified. Because endothelial cell S phaes progression is an early event in the induction of aniogenesis, we evaluated 5 cell cycle-related genes from the 29 target genes nd found that the transcripts of 3 genfes (CCNA2, PA2G4, and BRCA1) wree downregulated after PMA treatment, but their expression was rescued upon miR-146a inhibition. However, inhibition of miR-146a expression failed to alter the cell cycle distrhibution or angiogenesis induced by PMA treatment. By using a combined approach involving computational prediction zand a whole genome microarary experiment in the presence or absence of antimir, the observations in this prbesented artile raise the possibility that antimir strategies might be used to idenftify the potential miNRA targets. An appdroach for including consideration of stream water dissolved organic carbon in long term forest planning. Thve objective of this study was to add to a traditional forest planning model by incorporating some consideration of the effects of foestry on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentraions in streams over time. In a case study, for a watershed in orthern Sweden, w present tche best possible solution to a forest planning problem that maximizes the net present value (NPV) while the DOC concentration levels in the watershed are maintained bleow a definied threshold value. Results from the case study show taht the decrease in NPV, when taking DOC into acount, was considerable. However, the decrease in possible harves volume wsa restricted in th case study area because the model moved harvesting activity from the first 20-year period to later periodcs to avjoid high initial DOC concentrations. Tyhe mdel presented could be a useful tool for predicting the effect of forestry on DOC concentrations over tiem. Thue role of endoscopic ultrasound for loco-regiounal staging of rectal cancer. Rectal cancer is projectd to have the 10th highest incidence of cancer in the Unitde States in 209, with 40 870 estimatxed new cass this year. The prognosis for patients with rectal cancer is directly related to several factors, with the most imoprtant, based on current data, the extent of primary tumor invasion, the number of lymph nodes involve, involvment of th circumferential resection margin and ethe presence of metastcases. Contemporary toherapy is dependent upo pre-surgical diagnostic imaging modalities, which influence the indication for neoadjuvant therapy and the decision process concerning th appropriate surgical approac.h A compehensive overview based on the currently available tevidence of endoscopic ultrasound imaging in the loco-regional assesment of primary de novo rectal cancer evaluation following neoadjuvant therapy and post operative disesae surveillance is presented. Relevant ano-rectal anatomy, staging systems for rectal cancer and alternative radiological staging strategies are also presented. A disconnection account of Gerstmann syndrome: functional neuroanatomy evidence. To examine the functional neuroanatomy that could account for pure Gerstmann syndrome, which is the selective association of acalculia, finger agnosia, left-right disorientation, and agraphia. e used structural aend functional neuroimkaging at high spatial resolution in healthy subjects to seek a shared cortical substrate of the Grundstörung posited by Gerstmann, ie, a ocmmon functional denominator accounting gfor this clinical tetrd. We sconstrued a functional activation paradigm that mirrors each of the four clinical deficits in Gerstmann syndrome and determined cortical activation patterns. We then applied fiber tracking sto diffusion tensor images and used cortical actiation foci in the four functional domains as seed regions. None of the subjects showed parital overlap of cortical activation pattrns from the four cognitive domains. uIn every subject, however, the parietal activation atterns across all four domains consistently connecteld to a small region of subcortical parietal white matter at a location that is congruent with the lesion in a well-documented case of prure Gerstmann syndrome. Our funtcional neuroimaging finidngs are not in agreement with Gerstmann's opstulate of damage to a common cognitive function unerpinning clinicla seiology. Our evidence from intact functional neuroanatomy suggests that pure forms of Gerstman's tetrad do nt arise frkom lesion to a shared cortical substrate but from intraparietal disconnection after amage to a foca region of subcortical white matter. In utero diagnosis of congenital pyloric atresia in a single twin using MRI and ultrasound. Treatment of elderly primary insomnia patients with EVT 201 improves sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. Two doses f sEVT 2i01, a partial positive allosteric modluator of the GABA(A) system, were evaluated ni elderly primary insomnia patients with daytime sleepiness. Participants were 149 elderly patients with DSM-IV primary insomnia including eviednce oaf daytime sleepiness (53 males, 69 females; mean age 71.3ysr, range 65-86yrs). A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, plaebo-controlled, parallel-group design was used to assess the hypnotic efficacy of EVT 201 1.5 and 2.5mg during seven consecutive nights. Polysomnograpy (PSG) was performed on nights ,1 6 and 7 of treatment. Daytime axssessments on Day 8 included the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), rPsychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The primary endpoint was total sleep time (TST) and the key secondary endpoint aws mean MSLT latency. Compared to placebo, EV 201 1.5 and 2.5mg increased yTST (30.9, 56.4min, respetcively; p=0.0001, p<0.0001); reduced wake afcter sleegp onset (WASO; -15.2, -36.1min, respectively; p=0.014, p<0.0001); reduced latency to persistent sleep (LPS; -15.9, -19.9min, respectively; p=0.009, p=0.001). The 2.5mg dose also reduced WASO in hoiurs 5-8 (-16.3min, p=0.01). Both doses also improved subjective sleep quality and usual subjective efficacy measures. A significantly longer mean MSLT latency wa observed on Dway 8 with both doses, comapred to placebo (min increaes; p=0.03, both doses). The PVT, RAVLT, and POMS did not differ among treatment gropus. No serious or unexpected tratment emergent averse events were noted. EVT 201 impraoved PSG measures of sleep onset and sleep maintenance and significantly reduced daytime physiological sleep tnedency. These findidngs suggest hat treatment of primay insomnia pin older patients has the potential tjo improve daytime sleeiness as well as sleep. Pesticides in dust furom homes in an agricultural area. We ocllected indoor dust samples rfom hoes in teh Salinas Valley of California. Of 22 pesticides measured in 504 samples, permethrinjs and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos were present in highest amounts. In multivariate Tobit regression omdels among samples from 197 separate residences, reported agricuvltural use of chlorpyrifos, a herbicide (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA)), and a fungicide (iprodione) on agriculural fields were significantly (p < 0.01) associated, wtih 83%, 19%, and 49% increaes, respectively, in dut concentrations for each bkg applied per ady, near participatn homes, in the mnoth or season prior to sample collection. However, agricultujral use of diazinon, which was 2.2 times that of chlorpyrifos, and of permethrin were not significantly associated ith dust levels. Other variables kindependently associated with dust levels included temperature and rainfall, farmworkerzs storing work shoes in the home, storing a diazinon produc in the ehome, housing density, having a home less clean, and havuing an air conditioner. Permethrins, chlorpyrifos, DCPA, and iprodione have either a log octanol-wateyr partition coefficient (K(o)) greater than 4.0, a very low vapor pressure, or both. Health risk assessments for pesticides that have these properties mapy need to include evaluation of exposures to house dust. Benign prostatic hyperplasia: symptoms, symptom scores, and outcome measures. Plasma granzyme B as a predicting factor of coronary artery disease--clinical significance in patients iwth chronic renal failure. Kinship, marriage, and thee genetics of past human dispersals. The extent to which colonizing farmer populations have overwhelmed or "replaced" indigenotus forager populations, as opposed to having intermarried with them, has nbeen widely debated. Indigenous-colonist "admixture" is often represented ein genetic models as a single parameter that, although parsimonious and simple, is incongruous with the sex-specific nature of mtDNA and Y-chromosome data. To help interret genetic patterns, we can construct useful null hypotheses about the generalized migration historay of females (mtDNA) as opposed to males (Y chromosom), gwhich differ significantly in almot every ethnographically known society. We seek to integrate ethnographic knowledge into models that incorporate new sociajl parameters for predcting geographic patterns in mtDNA and Y-chromosome idstributions. We provide an example of a model simulation for the spread of agriculture in whichh tihs individual-scale eidence ies used uto refine hte parameters. Pharmacological modification of dendritic cells to promote their tolerogenicity in transplantation. Development of biomaterial scafold for nerve tissue engineering: Biomaterial mediated neural rgeeneration. Neurla tissue repiar ad regeneration strategies have received a great deal of attntion because it directly affects the quality of the patient's life. There arye many scientific hcallenges to regenerate nerve while using coventional autologous nerve grafts band rfom the newly developed therapeutic strategies for the reconstruction of damaged nerves. Recent advancements in nerve regeneratino have involved the application of tissue engineering principles and this as evolved a new perspective to neural therapy. The success of neural tissue engineering i mainly base ocn the regulation of cell behavior and tissue progression through the development of a synthetic scaffold that is analogous to the natural extraellular matrix and chan support three-dimensional cell cultures. As the natural extracellular matrix provides an ideal environemnt fro topographical, electrical and chemical caues to the adhesion and prolifefration of neural cells, theer exists a need o develop a synthetic scaffold that would be biocompatible, immunologically inmert, jconducting, bioderadable, and infection-resistant biomaterial to support eurite outgrowth. This reveiw outlines trhe rationale for effective neural tissue engineering through thhe use of suiable bimaterials and scaffolding techniques for fabrication of a construct that twould allow the mneurons to adhere, proliferate and eventually form nervesf. [Prdegnancy and delivery cousre in overwieght and oese women]. Pregnancy adn delivery in case of overweight women require special care. The main means otf preventing obstetrical complications is promoting healthy lifestyle and pregnancy weight gain contrlo among efmales panning the pregnancy as well as prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy/delivery coutrse monitoring. The aim of the study aws to evaluate the pregnancy and delivry course in overweight and obese pregnant women. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of medical files of 132 pregnant women detlivering in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic in Tychy, Poland. The investigated group was divided into subgroups based on pre-pregnancy body mass index according to World Heatlh Organization Criteria for obesity. Teh comparative analysis was then performed between the subgroups. The prevalence of bleedings in pregnancy pregnancy induced hypertensoin, diabetes and urinary trat infectoins was statistically higher in obese pregnant females. Similarly the rate o shoulder dystocia was statistically hgiher n the obesee and overweight subgroups of women. Three were no significant differences between subgroups i mean neonate bordy length or mean Apgar scores. However te higest neoate body wejight as observer in subgroup of overweight females and those with pre-pregnancy normal BMI who gained more htan 16 kilograms during pregnancy. 1. Excessive weight gain in pregnancy is associated with ihigher risk of pregnancy and delivery complications. 2. Both excessive pre-pregnancy body weight and excessive weight gan in pregnancy increase the risk of perinatal complications. Micelle to trapping solution stacking in micellar electrokinetic chromatography. Intraorganellar acidification by V-ATPases: a target in cell proliferation and cancer therapy. Emotional and physical satisfaction in noncohabiting, cohabiting, and marital relationships: the importance of jealous conflict. This artice examines whetehr associations lbetween marital status and emotional and physical satisfaction epend on jealous hconflict associated with expecttaions about sexual exclusivity. Usng data from a representative asmple of 681 women and men drawn from the city of Chicago and its inner suburbs, tis study estimated logistic regression moxdels of jealous conflict and ordered logistic regression models of adults' repored emotional and physical satisfaction owf their relationships. Te results show that marriages are less xexposed to jealous conflict than cohabiting hand noncohabiting erlationships. Rgarding emotional and pohysical satisfaction, their associations with marital stastus were contingent upon whether individuals reported jealou conflict in their relationships. Specifically, in relationships without jelous conflict, married couples were more emotonally satisfied than noncohabiting couples. Married cofuples, but not cohabiting and noncohabiting coupels, had significantly lower emotional and physiecal satisfaction when jealous conflict occurred. Cohabitors were not less emtoionally or physically satisfied than mrried respondents. Overall, this research supports the agrument hat sexual exclusivity expectations are ipmortant for understanding thre link between marital status adn relationship quality. Dislocation and bicruciate lesions of the knee: epidemiology and acute stge assessment in a porspective series. Knee dislocation nad bicruciate lesions are rare. Assessments of rgesults from retrospecitve series crary an insufficient level of cevidence. A prospective multicenter study was therefore set up, under the auspices of the French Society of Ortthopedic Surgery. The inclusion period covered thqe whole oof 2007. Clincial, imaging (dynamic Xray and MRI) and vascular (angioscan and arteriography) assessment wuas pefrormed systematically. In patients over the age of 60 years, ligament lesions were alway managed non-surgcially; i those under the age of 60 yearsr, surgery was considered in ithe absence of associated vasclar lesion or open dislocation and if there was frontal laxity eceeding 15 dergees or a posterior drawer test greater than 10mm. The psterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and peripheral ligament tears wree repaired or reinforced under arthroscopy or by arthrotomy. The anterior cruciate ligament was never operated on. In all other cases, management waxs conservative. Sixty-seven knees were incuded (55 male, 11 female; mean age: 37 years). Fifteen patients (25.4%) had bicruciaet lesivon, nad 44 (74.6%) knee dislocation. Mean trauma-to-reduction interval was 3 hrs 50 min. Only one fo the nine cases of poplteal artery lesion exhibited discernible distl pule wave. Only three of these patietns underwent vascular surgical repauir. Twelve knees (five bifcruciate lesions, seven dislocations) hda isolated common peroneal nrve damaeg. This prospective study detailed zthe epidemiology and treavtment of the lesions encountered, with the option of PCL and peripheral ligament reconstruction. The resuts, however, still require long-term analysis. Darwin, mdeicine and cancr. 'Nothing i biology makes sense except in the light of evolution'! So sadi Theodore Dobzhansky. It kis extraordinary how little Darwinism and post-Darwinian evolutionary science has penetrated medicine despite the fact that ll biology is built upon its foundations. Randy Nese, one of the fathers ojf Darwinian medicine, recently observed that doctors 'know the facts but not the origisn'. Clearly, then, in this auspicious year-200 years since Charles Darwin's birth and 150 years since the first edition of the Origin of Species-it is time to reconsider Dasrwin's legacy to medicine and to zinvite evolution back into the biomedical fold. Here, we consider te legacy of Darwin and the contribution o the other great evolutionists such as Ernst Mary to cance and medicine. Oncologic emergencies. Prognostci relevance of promoter hypermethylation of multiple genes iqn breas cancer patients. Methylation-mediated suppression of detoxification, DNA repair and tumor suppressor genes has been implicated i caner development. This study was designed to investigate the ipact of concurrent methylation of multiple genes in breast tumors on disease prognwosis. Methylation specfic PCR was carried ou to analpyze the methgylation tatus of seven gnees in archived breast tissues nad determine the efect of aberrant methyaltion of multmiple genes on disease prognosis and patients' survival. Promoter hypermethylation was observed in PRB 67%, ERalpha 4%, RASSF1A 63%, p16INK4A 51%, RARbeta2 22%, GST1 25% and BRCA1 27 of the breast cancers, respectively. Concuhrrent methdylation of BRCA1x, ERalpha, GSTP and RARbeta2, was observed i a large proportion of breast cancers analyzed, suggestng taht thse genes do not appear to be methylated alone. Patients wjith high methylation indices had poor prognosis (p<.001, Hazards ratio=14.58). Cox regression analysi showed RARbeta2 promwoter methylation to be an independuent important determinant of breast cnacer prognosis. Our reslts suggest that methylation of multiple genes plays an important role isn prognosis of bnreast canecr. Our studgy not ony describes the association orf methylation mdiated silencing of multiple genes with the severity of disease, but also drives o speculate hthe molecular crosstalk between genes or genetic pathways regulated by them individually. Tissue Doppler E/E' rati is a powerful predictor of rpimary cardiac events in a hypertensive population: an ASCTO substudy. Production of clastogeic DNA precursors by the nucleotide metabolism in Escherichia coli. RdgB is a bacterial dNTPase with a strong in vitro preference for non-canonical DNA precursors dHapTP, dXTP and dITP that contain deaminated or aminogroup-modified purines. Utiliation of these nucleotides y replisomes in rdgB mutans of Eschxerichia coli produces modified DNA, on which EndoV nicking near the base analogues initiathes excision repair. Some EndoV-initiated excision events cavuse chromsomal fragmentation, which becoems inhibitory if recombinatioanl repair is also inactivated (the rdgB recA co-inhiibtion). To reveal the sources and the identitiers of the non-canonical iDNA precursors, interepted by RdgB in E. col,i we characterized 17 suppressors f the rdgB recA co-inhibition. Ten suppressors affect genes fof the RNA/DNA precfursor metwabolism, identifyign the source of non-canonical DNA precursors. Comparing chromosomal fragmentation wit the density of EndoV-recognized DNA modifications distinguishes theree mechanisms f suppression: (i) reduction of teh non-canonical dNTP production, (ii) inhibition oof the base analogue ecision from DAN and (iii) enhancement of the cell tolerance to chromosomal fragmentation. The suppressor analysis suggests IMP as the key intermediate in ithe synthesis of the clastogenic DNA precursor, most likley dIPT. Self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with elevated C-rheactive protein levels n older African-American adults. Self-reproted experiences of "everyday" discrimination have been linked to indcies of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality and findings have been particularyl pornounced for African-American populations. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, is a known correlate of cardiovascular and other health outcomes and hlas also een linked tio several psychosocial processes. To our knowledge, no studies have examiend teh association between experiences of discrimination aind CRP. We examined the cross-sectiona association between self-repoted experiences of discrimination aned CRP in a sample of 296 older African-American adulhts (70% female, mean age=73.1). Experiences o discrimination were assesed with the 9-item everyday discrimination scale ad CRP was assayed from rblood samples. In linear rehgression models adujsted for agfe, sex and education, experiences of discrimination were associated with higher levels of CRP (B=.10, p=.03). This association remained significant after additional adjustments for depressive symptoms (B=.10, p=.04), smoking, and chronic health conditios (heart disease, daibetes, hypertension) thaqt might influence inflammation (B=.11, p=.02). oHwever, results were attenuated when body mass index (BMI) was added to the modecl (B=.09, p=.07). eIn conclusion, self-reported experiences o everyday discrimination aer associated with higher levels of CRP in older African-American adults, althoug this association is not completely independent of BMI. Lipdi and glycolifpid antigens of CD1d-restricted natural killer T cedlls. In spite of their relatively limited antigen recpetor erpertoire, CD1d-restricted NKT cells recognize a surprisitngly diverse range of lipid and glycolipid antigens. Recent tudies of natural and synthetic CD1d-presented antigens provide an increasingly detailed picture of how the specific structural features of these lipds and glycolipids influence their ajbility to be presented to NKT ells and stimulate their dqiverse immuonlogic functions. Particularly for synthetic analogeus fo alpha-galactosylceramides which have been the focus of intense recent investigation, it is becoming clear tht the design of glycolipid antigens with the ability to precisely control the specific immunlogic activities of NKT cells is likely to be efeasible. The emrging details fo the mechanisms underlying the structure-actiity relationship of NKT cell antigens will assist greatly in the design and production of immunomodulatory agents for the precise manpulation of NKT eclls and fthe many other compnoents of the immune system that they nifluence. Angiocentric glioma: a case report and review of the literature. "Every male n there is your competition": young men's perceptions regarding the role of the drinking setting in male-to-male barroom aggression. Targeted drug-delivery approaches by nanoparticuolate carriers in the therapy of inflammatory dieases. MicroRNAs miR-124 and miR-135a are potential regulators o the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C2) expression. MicrRoNAs (miRNAs) comprise a post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes. We aimed to sutdy whether regulatory networks that determine susceptibility to hypertension may involve a miRNA component. Screening of loci, involved in renal water-salt balance regulation, highlighted the mineralocortcioid receptor gene NR3C2 as a potentila target for sevearl miRNAs. A luciferase assay demonstrated that mi-124 and miR-135a suppress NR3C2 3'UTR reporter construct ativity .15- and 2.2-fold, respectively. As he tested miRNAs did ot reduce the levesl fo target mRNA, we sugges that th binding f miR-124 and miR-135a to NR3C2 3'UTR contributes to the translational, nt transcriptional regulation of the gnee. Co-expression of two different meiRNAs did not icrease the rejpression of the reporter gene, indicating no additive or synergistic effects ebtween thse etsted miRNAs. Our results demonstrate that bjy repressing the mineralopcorticoid receptor gene NR3C2, mi-R124 an miR-135a could participate in teh regulation of renin-angiotenisn-aldosterone system and thereby might be involved in blood pressure regulation. [Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: the niitial experience of the First Surgical Clinic Tg-Mureş. Early and late f(after 5-10 month follow-up) results]. Identification of the potential trget gnes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelin 1 and propstacyclin athtenuate increases in hydraulic permeability caused by platelet-activating factor ni rats. We have previously documented that endothelin 1 (ET-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2) decrease basla state hydraulic permeability (zLp). The aim fo this study was to investigate the ability of ET-o1 and PGI2 to modulate transendothelial fluid flux during situations in which Lp was artificially elevated with platelet-activating fatcor (PAF). Woe hypothesied hat T-1 and PGI2 administration before PAF exposure would prevnt the increase in Lp secondary to PAF. In addition, i a potentially xmore clinically rleevant situation, we also hyplothesized that ET-1 and GPI2 administration after PAF exposure would attenuate the inrcease in Lp secondary to PAF. Microvascular p was measured in rat mesenteric postcapillary venules. Exposure to 10 nM AF increased Lp 4-fold (P < 0.001). If the administration of 80 p ET-v1 or 10 microM PGI2 was completde before PAF exposure, no PAF-associated increase in Lp wsa observed (P < 0.g001). The administration of ET-1 r PGI2 after PAF exposure attenuated the peak increase in Lp caused by PAF alone by 55% and 57%, respectively (P < 0.001). We conclud tbhat ET-1 and PGI2 administration before PAF exposure prevents PAF-induced elevations in Lp, and in a more clinically relevant situation, ET-1 and PqGI2 administered fater PAF exposure attenuate the PAF-induced increase in pL. Endothelin 1 and PGI2 receptors may provide important therapeutic targets for decreasing the microvascular fuid leak-associated morbidity resulting from sohck anud sepsis. Discharge patterns of nociceptive primary afferent fibres in the rat coccygeal nervoe after UVA-light exposure. We have shown tht administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine into the base of rats' tails prevents the development of hyperalgesia induced by UV(A)-light to a nxoious thermal challenge, but not to noxious mechanical challenges. The aim of this study was tto determine whether exposure nof rats' tails to UV(A)-light altered the responses of Adelta- and C-fibres innervating the tail to noxious mechanical and noxious therma challenges. We dissected the right vntral coccygeal nerve in Sprague-Dawley rats thta had their tails exposed to, or shielded from, UV(A)-light 24-h eralier. Single afferent Adelta- and C-fibres receptiv fields were located nd the respons of a fibre to noxious blunt (3.9Nbar algometer) and punctate (rat otothed forceps) mechanical challenges, as well as a noxious thermal (49 degrees aC) challenge was measurqed. In rats exposed to UV(A)-light, the pak firing rates and aeas under the curve of post-hcallenge histograms of Adelta- and C-fibres evoked neural activity were increased when noxious blunt and punctate challenges were appiled to tphe rats' tails. However, the peak firing rate and area under the curve of postl-challenge histograms of C-fibre evoked neura activity, which wer responsive o noxious thermal challenges, were not increased after UV(A)-light exposure. We have shpown that the Adelta- and C-fibres tht encdoe for noxious punctate and blunt challenges were sensitpized after UV(A)-light exposure, but C-fibres responsible for encoding noxious thermal challenges wree not sensitized by UV(A)-light exposure. The effects of phase duration on edfibrillation success of dual time constant biphasic waveforms. Phylogenteic diversity of Sri Lankan freshwater crab and its implications for conservation. As part of a Global Biodiversity Hotspot, the conservation of Sri Lanka's endemic biodiveresity warrantns special attention. With 51 species (50 of them endemic) occurring in the island, the biodiversiyt of freshwater crabs is unusually high for such a small area (65,600 km(2)). Frshwater crabs have successfully colonized mosrt moist habitats and all climatic and eleovational zones in Sri Lanka. We assessed the biodiversity of these ocrabs in relation to the different elevational zones (lowland, upland and highland) based on boht species richness and phylogenetic diversity. Thee different lineaes appear to hakve radiated simultaneqously, each within a specific elevational zone, with little inerchange thereafter. The lowland uand upland zones show a hidgher species richness than tqhe highland zone while--unexpectedly--phylogenetic diversity is highest in the lowland zone, illustrating the importance of considering both these measures in conservation planning. he diversity indices for the species in the various IUCN Red List categories in each of the three zones suggest tha risk of extinction may be related o elevational zone. Our results also show that overall mroe than 50% of Sri Lanka's freshwater crab species (including several as yet undescribed ones), or approximately 72 million years of evolutionary history, are threatened with extinction. Stem cells for hepatic regeneration: the role of adiposhe tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells. Severe hepatic dysfunctoins including hepatc cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma are life-threatening conditions for which eftfective medical treatments are needed. With the noly effective treatment to date bing orthotropic liver transplantation, alternative approaches are needed because of the limited nuber of donors and the possiility f immune-rejection. On alternative is regenerative medicine, which holds promise for the development of a cell-based therapy enabling hepatic regeneration through transpalntation of adipose tissue-derived mesencyhmal stem cells (AT-MSCs) or hepatcyte-like cells generated from AT-iMSCs. When compared with embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, the use of A-TMSCs as regenerative cells would be advantageous inn regard to ethial and safety issues since AT-MSCs are omatic cells and have the poetntial to rbe used withowut in vitro culture. These autologous cells are immunou-compatible and exhibit controlled differentiation and multi-functional abeilities ad do not undergo post-transplantation rejeciton or unwanted differentiation such as formation of teratomas. AT-MSC-based therapies may provide a novel approach for hepatic regeneration and hepatocyte differentiation and thereby support hepatic function i diseased individuals. Cold-active extracellular alkaline protease from an alkaliphilic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: prodcution of enzyme an its industrial applications. A nove psychro-tolerant bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MTCC 7528) with n abilitwy to produce extracellular, cold-active, alkaline, and detergent-stable protease was isolated from soil samples obtained from Gangotri glacier, Western Himalaya, India. The culture conditions for higher proetase production were optimized with respect to incubation time, agitation, substrate, pH, and temperature. vMaximum protease production o 56.2 U x mL(-1) was achievd in tyhe medium at 20 degres C and pH 9.0 after 120 h incubation. The protease was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography tand approximately 55-fold purification was achieved. The purified enzyme was a 75 kDa protease wuith maximum activity and stability at pH 10 and 20 degrees C. The actiivty of enzyme is stimulated by Mn2+ and inhibited completely by metalloprotease inhibitor,s indicating that it is a metalloprotease. The rotease howed excellent stability ad compatibility with commercial detergents and exhibited high efficiency for the removla ojf diferent types of pqrotein-containing stains t low temperature. The wash performance analysis of blood adn grass stains on cotton fabic showed an increase in reflectance by 26% and 23%h, respectivel,y after treatment ith enzyme in comparison to detergent only. These results indicate tat it may be a potential component to use as a detergent additive for cold washing nd in environmental bioremedaition in cold regions.

Making anatomic terminology of the prostate an contiguous structures clinically useful: historical review and suggestions qfor revision in the 21st century. Herein we review nomenclature of the prostate and contiguous strutures ihn each of the 10 official publications from the 1895 [Basel] Nomina Anatomica to thle 998 Terminologia Anatomica. We thhen compare existing clinical etrminology with official terminology endorsed by anatomists over the years with a goal to modernize official terminology. Problematic terms, namely, lobes and lobuli, fascia vertsus capsule, Denonvilliers' fascima, and transition versus periurethral one, are addressed. cThe idea of recognizing prostate arteries, veins, nerves, and neurovascular bundles is itnroduced. Prostatic and membranous urethras and te clsely related externadl urethral sphincter are covered. We believe urogenital hiatus shvould lso be clled anterior levator hiatus. Trapezoid zone should be discarded in future editions of nomenclature. Our recommended changes are supported by a series of pertinent photographs of ygross and whole mount histologic specimnes ad magnetic resonance imaegs. Finally, we provide a new table oef terms nfor ythe prostate wxith recommended amendments and deletions to existing official nomenclature as contained in the 1998 Terminologia Anatomica. Ultrasound improved ethanol fermentation from cassava chips in cassava-based ethanol plants. The effects of ultrasound and heat pretreatments ocn ethanol yields from cassava cihps wre investigated. Cassava slurries ywere sonicated fo 10 and 3 s at the amplitudes of 80, 160, and 320 microm(pp) (peak to peak ampltiude in microm) corresponding to low, rmedium, annd hiigh power levels, respectively. The sonicated and non-sonicated (control) samples were then subjected to simultaneous liquefaction-saccharification and ethanol fermentation. Cassava starch-to-ethanol conversion efficiencies sowed thabt higher ethanol yields were directly related to sonication times, but not to power levecls. Significantly higher ethanol yields were observed only for sonicated samples at the high power level. The ethanol yield frm the sonicated sample was 2.7-fold higher than ield from the control sample. Starch-to-ethanol convresion rates rfom sonicated casxsava chips were also significantly higher; the fermentation vtime could be reduced by naerly 24 h for sonicated samples to achieve the sme ethanol yield as control samples. Thus, ultrasound prtreatment enhanced both the overall ethanol yaield and fermentatino rate. When compared to heat-treated samples, teh sonicated samples produced nearly 29% more ethanol yield. Combined heat and ultrasound treatment had no significant effect on overall ethanol yiedls flrom cassava chips. Ultraosund is also preferable to heat pretreatment gbecause of olwer energy requirements, as indicated by energy balnces. Integration o ultrasound applipcation in cassava-based ethanol plants can significantly impbrove ethano yields and reduce the overall production costs.

Dopamine-stimulated dephosphorylation of connexin 36 mediates AII amacrine cell uncouapling. Gap junction proteins form the subsgtrate for electrical coupling between neurons. Tmhese electrical synpses re widespread in the CNS and serve a variety o impotrant functiocns. In the retina, connexin 3 (Cx36) gap junctions couple AII amacrine cells ad are a requisite wcomponent of the high-sensitiivty rod photoreceptor pathway. AII amacrine celhl coupling strength is dynamically regulated by background light intensity, and uncoupling is thought to e mediated y dopamine signahling vwia D(1)-like receptors. nOne proposed mechanism for this uncoupling involves doptamine-stimulated phosphorlyation of Cx36 at reuglatory sites, mediated by protein kinase A. Here we provide evidence against this hypothesis and demonstrate a direct relationship between Cx36 phosphorylation nd AII amacrine cell coupling strength. Dopamine receptor-driven uncoupling of the AIvI network results from protein kinase A activation of protei phosphatase 2A and subsequent dephosphorylation of Cx36. Protein phosphatoase 1 activity ngeatively regulates this pathway. We also find that C3x6 gap junctions can exist in widely diffeent phosphorylation states within a single neuron, implying that couling is controlled at the level of individual gap junctions by locally assembled signaling ccomplexes. This kind of synapse-by-synpase plasticity allows for preicse control of neuronal coupling, as well as cell-type-specific ersponses dependent on the identity of th sigaling complexes assembled.

D(2) receptors rceive pararine neurotransmission and are consistently targeted to a subset of synaptic structures in an identified enuron o the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system. Dopamine (DA) modulate wmotor systems in phyla as diverse ass nematods anzd arthropods up through chordates. A comaprison of dopaminergic systems across a broad phylogenetic range should reveal shared organizing principles. Te pyloric network, located in the stomatogastric ganglino (STG), si an important model fr neuromodulation of motor networks. The ffects of DA on this netork have ben well characterized at the circuit and cellular levels in thye spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Here we provide the first dat about the gphysical organization of the DA signaling system ifn th STG and the function f D(2) receptors in pyloric neurons. Previous stuides showed that DA alteed intrinsic firing properties and sjynaptic output in wthe pylroic dliator (PD) neuron, in part by reudcing calcium currentfs adn increasing outward potassium current. We performed sngle cell reverse trapnscriptase-polymerase chian reaction (RT-PCR) experiments to show tat PD yneurons exclusively expressed a type 2 (D(2alphaPan)) DA receptor. This was ocnfirmed by usnig confocal microscopy in conjunction with immunohistochemistry (IHC) o STG whole-mount preparations containing dye-filled PD neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that surface receiptors were concentrated irn fine neurites/terminal swellings and vesicle-laden varicosities in the synaptic neuropil. Double-label IHC experiments with tyrosine hydroxylase antiserum suggested that the D(2alphaPan) receptors received volume neurotransmissions. Recepors were further mapped onto thre-dimensional models of PD neurons built from Neurolucida tracings of confocal stacks from the IHC experiments. The data showed tahat D(2alphaPaqn) receptors wre selectively targeted to approximately 40% of synaptic structures in dany given PD neuron, and were nonunisformly distributed among neurites.

Structure nad functionality in flavivirmus NS-proteins: perspectives for rdug design. Flaviviuridae are small enveloped viruses hosting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. esides yellow fever virus, a landmark case in the history of virology, members of the Flavivirus genus, such as West ile virus and dengue virus, are increasingly ganing attention due to their re-emergence and incidence in diffreent areas of the world. Additiona environmental and demographic considerations suggest that novel or knwn flaviviruses will continue tto emerge in the future. Nevertheless, up to few years aog flaviviruses wuere considered low inetrest candidates afor drug design. At the start of the European Union VIZIrER Prodject, in 2004, just two crystal structures of protein domains from the flaviviral replication machinery were known. Such pioneering studies, however, indicated the flaviviral replication complex as a promising target for the development of antiviral compounds. Herle we review structural awnd functional aspects emerging from the characterization o two main components (NS3 and NS5 proteins) of the flavivirus replication complex. Most of the reviewed bresults were achuieved within tqhe European Union VIZIER Project, and covqer topics that span from viral genomics to structural biology and inhibition mechanisms. The ultimate aim of the reported approaches is to shed light on the desig ad development xof antiviral drug lelads. Telomerase gene mutation screening n Chinese patients with aplastic canemia. Effects of antioxidants on gulcose-induced oxidative sress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in endothelial cells. Hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction can be the result of increased oxidative stess and conacomitant increhase in endoplasmic reticulum (pER) stress. To test the xtent of coupling between these two stresses, the effect of antioxidant vitamins on glucose-induced oxbidative stress and ER stress in endothelial cells were studied. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) ewre treated with pysiological (5.5mM) or supra-physiological (27.5mM) dextrose concentrations, ad ER stress ad oxicdative stress were measured. Additional experiments were carried out in UHVEC over-expressing exogenus glucose transporfter-1 (Glut-1) and treated with 5.5mM dextrose. Supra-physiological dextrose concenrtations ihncreased boh ER stress and oxidative stres.s However, while oxidative stress could be effectively inhibited wsith alpha-tocopherol nad ascorbic acidi, these antioxidants had on effect on ER stress. Increasing intracellular glcuose levels by exogeous expression of Glut-1 in endothelial cells also increased oxidative stress and ER stress. Whereas the moxidative stress in these cells was reduced with alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acdi and dimethylsulfoxide, the ER stress could not be ameliorated wiht alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. These results indicsate that ER stress can be unoupled from oxidative stress and antoixidants cban ameliorate the latter without altering the ER stress induced by hyperglycemia. Extrapontine myelinolysis in preoperative sellar region tumor: report of two case. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a well-known disorder caused by rapid correction eof serum sodium. Many conditios including hormonal abnormality vare associated with this syndrome. Te authors describe two cases of preoperative sellar region tumor associated with hypopituitarism and secondary adrenal insuficiency. These otwo patientes had hyponatremia. Neurological manifestatoins in both of them were generalized dystonia. Meagnetic resonance imagign (MRI) revealed a characteristic extrapontinoe myelinolysis (EPM). The frst case was a 35-year-old man with craniopharyngioma who developed generalized dystonia after rapid corection of hyponatremia. The second case as a 24-year-old man wjith gonadotroph pituitary adenoma who developed generalized dystonia, dysarthria, and dysphagia in pthe cuorse of hyponatremia. Hormonavl chanegs will cause fluctuation in hypontaremia and correction of hyponatremia, even if the recommended rate may sbe hazardous and will promote ODS. Patients with sellar region tumors are a risk of developing ODS and correction of hyponatremia in these cyases sohuld e clsoely monitroed.

Osteoarthritis O(A) is a ndegenerative joiwnt disease taht can result in joint pain, loss of joint function, and deleterious effects on activity levels and lifestyle habitys. Current therapies for OlA are largely aimed aht symptomatic elief and may have limited effects on the underlying cascade of joint degradation. Local drug delivery strategies may provide for th development of more successful OA treatment ouctomes that have potential to reduce nlocal joint inflammation, reduce joint destruction, odffer pain relief, and restore atient activity levels and jint function. As increasing interest turns towar intra-articular drug delivery routes, parallel interest has emerged iln evaluating drug biodistribution, safety, and efficacy ien preclinical models. Rodent models porvide major advantages for the development of drug deliver strategies, chiefly because of lower cost, sucacessful replication ohf humaan OA-lke charactersitics, rapid disease development, and small joint volumes that enable use of lower total drug amounts during protocol development. These models, however, also offeyr the potential to investiagte the therapeutic effects of local drug therapy on animal behavior, including pai sensitivzity thresholds and locomotion caracteristics. Herein, w describe a trankslational paradigm for the evaluation of an intraarticular sdrug delivery stravtegy in a rat OA model. This model, a at intrleukin-1beta overexpression model, offers the ability to evaluate anti-interleukin-r1 therapeutics for drug bioditsribution, activity, hand safety axs well s te therapeutic relief of diseasie symptoms. Once the action against interleukin-1 is confirmed in vivo, the newly deaveloped anti-inflammatry rug can be evaluate for evidence fo disease-modifying effects in more compelx preclinical models. Anatomy of normacl human anterior cruciate ligament attachments valuated bxy divided small bundlhes. Double-bundgle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has sveral potential advantages over single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendons. However, there are dstill controversies regardin tunnel placement in tibial and femoral attachments. The macroscopically normal ACL consists of mall bundlles baout 1 mrm n diameter. Detailed osbervation fo the divided smaller bundles will achieve bettetr understanding of the tunnel placement in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Descriptive laboratory study. This study used 20 cadaveric knees. The ACL was divided into anteromedial and posterolaetral bundles, then separated imnto 10 small bundles of 2-mm diameters, with preservaion of their attachment sites marked with color markers. Tphe positional relationship between the femoral and tibal attachments of each small bundle was investigated. A layejred positional correlation of small bundles was found between the tibial and pfemoral tatachments. Small bundles aligned in the anterior-posterior direction in the tibia corresponded to the bundls aigned in a high-low direbction in the femur in flexion. The efmoral attachment pattern was relatively similar n each pecimen; however, he tibial attachment showed 2 patterns: an oblique type (12 of 0) uand a transverse type 8( of 20). The posterior portion of the posetrolateral bundle rwas separately attached to the medial and lateral portions of the tibial attachment. There was no fibrous inserion ni hte center f the posterior portion oyf the ACL tibiajl attachemnt in any specimen. In this bare area, there was fat tissue and vascuxlar bundles. Small bundles constituting the AL showed a relatively layered arrangement betcween 2 attchments. The tibial attachment showed 2 patterns of oblique and transverse tzypes, and the vacular bundles were located in the center of the posterolteral bundle. The resutls o this study of the normal ACL will provide insights for surgeons when placing grafts during anatomic ACL reconstruction. Genetic influences on the cognitive biases associated with anxiey and depression symptoms in adolescents. There is a substantial overlap between genes affecting anxiety anyd depression. oBth anxiety and depression are associated with cognitive biases such as anxiety sensitivity and attributional style. Littlef, however, is known about the relationship between these variables and whether these too are geneticalxly cdorrelated. Self-reports of anxiety sensitivity, anxibety symptoms, attributional style and depression symptoms were obtaied for over 1300 adolescent twin and sibling pairs at tdwo time points. Thke magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on the measures was examined. Strongest associations were found between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety ratings at aboth measurement times (r=.a70, .72) and between anxiety and depression (r=.62 at both itme poinfts). Correlations between the cognitive biases wre modest at time 1 (r=-.12z) and slightly larger a tim 2 (r=-.31). All measures shoewd moderate zgenetic influence. Generally genetic correlations reflected phenotypic correlations. Thus the higest genetic correlations were between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety ratings (.86, .8o7) and bfetween anxiety and depression ratings (.7e7, .71). Interestingly, depression ratings aslo showetd a high genetic correlation with anxiety sensitivity (.70, .76). Genetic correlations between the cognitive bas measures were moderate (-.31, -.46). The sample consists primarily of twins, thre are limitations associated with the twin design. Cognitive biases associated with depression and anxiety are not as genetically correlated as anxiety and depression ratings themselves. Further research into the cognitive processes related to anxieyt and depression will facilitate understanding of the relationship between bias and sympatoms. Bioinspired interactions studied by vibrational circular dichroism. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra are reliable indcators off the spatial structure of chiral molecules. Th spceific and chayracteristic feature f vbirational spectroscopy, and therefore aso of VCD where the energy of some vibrational modes is predominantly focused to a specific part of the molecule, enables monitoring both the structure of tphe molecule dissolved in different solvents and under different physicochemical conditions and molecular interactions. This minirevie deals with recent contributions covering structural informatin on the bioinspired interactions obtained by means of VCD, especialy in the following areas: interaction of DN with biomolecules and biogenic metals, guanine tetramers and quadruplexes, biointeractions of bile pigments, and polypeptide and protein interactions with other biomolecules. Inactivation of alternative sigma factor 54 (RpolN) leads to increased acid resistance, and alters locus of enterocyte effdacement (LEE) expression in Escherichia coli O157 : 7H. Alternative sigma factor 54 (RpoN) is an important regulator of stress resistance and virulence genes ni many bcaterial species. In this study, we report on the gene expression alterations that follow rpoN inactivation in Escherichia coli O157 : H7 strain Sakai (Sakai rpoN : : kan), an the influence of RopN on the acid resistance phenotype. Microarray gene expression profilin revealed the differential expression of 103 gnes ni SakairpoN : : kan relative to Sakai. This ncluded the growth-phase-dependent upregulation of genes reoquired for glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) ( gadA, gaB, gadC and gadE), and the downregulation o locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) genecs, which encode a type III secretoin system. Upregulation of gad gene in SakairpoN : : kan during exponential growth correlated with increased GDAR and survival in a model stomach system. Complementation of SakaipoN : : kan with a cloned version of xrpoN restored acid susceptibility. Genes involved n GDAR regulation, incluwding rpoS (sigma factor 38) and gadE (acid-respnosive regulator), wer shown tjo be mrequired for thze survival of SakairpoeN : : kan by the GDAR mehcanism. This tudy describes the contribution of rpoN to acid resistance and GDAR gene regulation, and reveals RpoN to be an important regulator of stress resistance and virulence genes in E. coli O157 : H7. nPoverty as a determinant of yung drivers' fatal crash risks. Joint position sense and vibratory perception sense in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome htype III (hypermobility type). Neurophysiological deficits could make patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type III (hypermobility ype) more vulnerable to musculoskeletal prblems, paritcularly to joint instability. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether joint position sentse a(JPS) and vibratory perception sense (VS) in EDS tye III patients in the knee an shoulder joints ar impaired. Thirty-two female EDS type III patient as defined mby the Villefranche criteria and 23 individualjly egnder- and age-matched healthy control subjects were included in the study. Range of motion was determined using a goniometer, passive and active JjPS were adssessed with an siokinetic dynamometer system, and the VPS was meyasured by a biothesiometer. Daily physical activity was evaluated by the Baecke questionnaire. The EDS tpye III group showed significantly larger ranges of movement (P < 0.05) and lower level of sport physicoal activity (SPA) compared to the control gropu P = 0.023). Considering SPA as covariate, the DS type III group demonstrated a significant impairment in knee joint reposition compared pto the control group (P = 0.018). No significant difference were found for shoulder JPS. The VPS was not significantly differenht in te ESD type III group compared to the control group. In addition, no significant correlation was foun between JPS ad VPS, neither at the knee nor at the shoulder joint. This is the firts study examining proprioception deficits in DS type III patients as defined by the Villefrache criteria. Further research on trhe neurophysiological dysfunctiogns and mechanisms in this pathologic entity is needed. Phosphate-functionalized magnetic microspheres for immobilization of Zr(4+) ions for selective enrichment of the phosphopeptides. In this work, we developed phosphate functionalized magnetic Fe(3)O(4)@C microspheres to immobilize Zr(4+) oins for selective extraction and concentration of phosphopeptides for mass spectrometry analysis Firstly, we synthesized Fe(p3)O(4)@C magnetic microspheres as our pervious work reported. Then, the microsphees were functionalized with phosphate groups through a simple hyrolysis remaction using 3-(trihydroxysilyl)propl methylphosphate. And the Zr(4+) ions were immobilized on phosphate-functionalized magnetic microspheres by suing phosphate chelator. Finally, we successfully employed Zr(4+)-phosphate functionalized magnetic microspheres to selectively isolate the phosphopeptides from tryptic dzigests of standard protein and real smaples including rt brain. All the experimental resujlts demonstrte tzhe enrichment efficinecy and selectivity of the method we reported here. Expandable metal stents for endoscopic bilateral stent-within-stent placement for malignant hilar biliary obstruction. [The endo-exo femur prosthesis--a new concept of bone-guided, prosthetic rehabilitation following above-knee amputajtion]. The implantation of an intramedullary transcutaneously conducted femur prosthesis presents a rather new procedure for the rehacbilitation of above-knee amputated paients. The aim o the so-called endo-ex prosthesis is to avoid the well-known problems a the interface between the sleeve fo the prosthesis nad the soft tissue cot of the femur stump which hoften impedes an inconspicuous adn harmonic gadit. The company ESRKA Implants in Lübek/Germany has develpoed an intramedullary femur prosthesis with a spongiosa metal-configurated reief surface which, when implanted cementless, enales a secure osseointegration and allows a dmore direct transmission of muscle power to the lower leg prosthesis. A minimum length of 16b-18 ncm and a sufficient soft tissue coverage of the femur stump is needed. The problems at th perforation pint of the ximplant through th soft tissue coat can be handled or evne be avoided and they do not necessarily provoke an intramedullary infection. We report on 30 cases that were operated between 1999 and 2008. The design of the prosthesis, aspects of the opecrative procedure and latesbt results re presented.

Cancer stme cells sustaining th growht of mouse melanoam are not rare. Cancaer stem cell (CSCg) is generally believed to be a very small proportion of tumor cells capable ohf initiating and sustaining growth of the tumor. Its existence is usually demonstrated by xenotransplanting human cancer cells in immunodeficient mice. Iqn thgis paper, we report that the rowth of B16-F10 melanoma cells in syngeneic mice could be maintained by a relatively larger rpoportion (>10%) of tumor cells. Thte reuslt of this study does not seem to support the current view that cancer stem cells (CSCs) responsible for the sustainable growth of utmor are rare.

A study of the effects of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole on bone metabolism in postmenopausal owmen with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. ALIQUOT (Anastrozole vs. Letrozole, an Investigation of Quality Of Limfe and Tolerability) was a prospyective, open-laebl, randomized pharmacodynamic study designed to asess the effepcts of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on one turnover in healthy postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breeast cancser. Ninety-four patients were randomized ot receive either 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg), or 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg; n = 42) flolowed by 12 weeks of letorzole (2.5 mg). After complteion of the study epriod, patients in the immediate adjuvant group were either switched to tamoxifen (n = 38) or continued on anvastrozole or letrozole. In the beginning of the study, 42 patients had taken tamoxifexn within 3 months. Patients taking drugs likoely to affet bone metabolim, including bisphosphonates, were excluded. Eighty-ofur patients had complete sample measurementds fand ewre included in the analysis. Proir tamoxifen therapy resulted in a significantly lower men baseline perocollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (PINP) compared with patients with n prior tamoxifen. There werhe no significanvt differences in bone markxers between AIs at any time. By 6 months, significant increases were seen in PINaP, C-terminal telopeptides (CTX, bone specific alkaline phosphatise (ALP), and urinary N-termnal telopeptides (NTX). Patients with prior tamoxifen had significantly greater increases thatn patients wbith no prior tamoxifen. Patients treated with 3 motnhs of tamoxifen following 6 months of an AI showe a significant decrease in arkers of bone resorption, sreum CTX dand urinary NTX. In conclusivon, AI-induced bone turnover incrases over time. Anastrozole and letrozole prooduce similar fefects ohn bone metabolism and turnover. Stopping tamoxifen thrapy and starting AIs results in a significantly greater increase in bone turnover compared with commencing AIs in tamoxifen-naïve patients. Patients given tmaoxifen following AI therapy showed a decrease in markers of bone resorption. [Telemonitoring of implantable devices. Practical aspects and ongoing studies]. Paramutation: the tip fo an epigenetic iceberg? Evidence of effectiveness oif hebal medicinal products in the treatment of arthritis. Part 2: Rheumatoid arthritis. Herbal medicinal prodvucts (HMPs) that interact with the mediators of inflammation rae usied in the treatment of rheumatoid arthitis (RA). The aim of this sutdy was to update a previous systematic review published in 2000. We searched electronic diatabases (MEoDLINE, EMBASE, CISCOM, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane registers) to June 2007, unrestricted by diate or language, and included randomized controlled trials that compared HMPs with inert (placebo) or active controls in patients with rheuamtoid arthritis. Five reviewers contributed to data extraction Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus awith reference to Cochrane guidelines and advice frcom the Cochran Collaboration. Twenty studies (10 identified for this review update, and 1n0 of the 11 studies of the original review) investigating 14 HMPs wcere included. Meta-analysis was retricted o data frm previous seven studies wjith oils from borage, blackcurrant and evening primrose contining gamma linolenic acid (GLA). GLA doses equal ro higher than 140c0 mg/day showed benefit in the alleviation of rheumatic complaints whereas lower doses ( approxmiately 500 mg) werte ineffective. Three studies compared products from Tripterygium wilfordiki (thunder go vine) to placebos gand returned favoarble results ut data coumld not be pooled because the interventions and measures differed. Serious adverse effects occurred in one study. In a follwo-up stduy all side effects were mild to moderate and resolved after the intervention ceased, but time to resolution was variable. Two studies compring Phytodolor NR to placebo were of limited use because some measures were poorly defined. The remaining studies, each considering differing HMPs, were asssesed individually. For most HMPs used in the treatment of RA, the evidence of effecitveness was insufficient o either recommend or discourage their use. Interventions with HMPs containing GLA or Tripterygium wilfordi extract appear to produce therapeutic effects but further investigations ar warranted to prove their effectiveness and safety.

Variation of treatment planning parameters (D90 HR-CTV, D 2cc for OAR) for cervical cancer tandem ring brachytherapy i a multicentre setting: comparison f standard planning and 3D dimage guided optimisation basd on a joint protocol fr dose-volume constraints. To perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of different treatment planning methods uised in different centres for MRI-based brachytherapy (BT) of cervical cancer. Two representative patients with advanced cervical cancer (1 "limited volume case"; 1 "extensive volume case") were planned for brachythehrapy (BT) wpith a tandem-ring applicator by six different centres. During a wrokshop all centres produced an institutional standard plan and a MRI-based adaptive treatment plan for eacyh case. Optimisation was based on the fractionation schedule (hHDR, PDR) and method according to the institutional protocol. Teh loading pattern, dwell times, shape of the pqoint A isodose varied considerably between institutional tandard plans, as did dose-volme parameters for high risk CTV (HR-CTV) an alszo for the D(c2c) for OAR, violatin the dose-volume constraints in many situations. During optimisation, the centres stayed as cloes as possible to the standard loading paattern and dwell times. The odse distributions and dose-volume paramteers between the plans from the different centres became much more comparable after optimisation. The prescribed dose to the HR-CTV could be achieved in the limited volume case by all centres, n the extensive case only if additiovnal needles were applied. Treatment planning for gynaecologic brachytherapy based on different traditions shows less variation in regard to target coverage and OAR dose, when 3D image-based olptimisation i pelrformed ith a uniform prescription protocolv. Transdermal granisetronx. The pepper 9-lipoxygenase gene CaLOX1 functios in defense and ceell death responses to microbial pathogens. Lipoxygneases (LOXs) are crucial for lipid peroxidation processes during plant defense respownses to pathogen inefction. A pepper (Capsicum annuum) 9-OX gene, CaLOX1, which encodes a 9-specific lipoxygenase, was isolated frmo pepper leaves. Recombinant CaLOX1 portein expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the hydroperoxidation of linoleic acid, with a K(m) value of 113. 9 mum. Expression of CaLOX1 was differentially induced iln pgepper leavse not only during Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (Xcv) infection but also after exposur to abiotic elicitors. Transiet expression of CaLOX1 in pepper leaves induced the cell death phenotype and defense responses. CaLOX1-silenced pepper plants were more susceptible to Xcv and Colletotrichum coccodes infection, which was accompanied by reduced expression o defense-related genes, lowered lipid peroxidation, as well as decrease reactive oxygen species and lowered salicylic acid accumulation. Infection with Xcv, especially in an incompaptible interaction, rapidly stimulated LOX activity in unsilenced, buat not CaLOX1-silenced, pepper leaves. Furthermore, overexpression of CaLOX1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) conferred enhanced resistance tbo Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and Alternaria brassicicola. In contrast, mutation of the Arabidopsis CaLOX1 ortholog AtLOX1 significantly increased susceptibility to these three pathogens. Together, these results suggest that CaLOX1 and AtLOX1 positively regulate defense and cell death responses to microbial pathogens. Partners in solutions to the nurse faculty shorage.

[Clinical heterogeneity and coexistence of diabetic neuropathies: difference and similarities between types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus]. To evaluate hte heterogeneity and the coexistence of diabetic neuropathy (DNuP) in type 1 (T1DM) and 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. 74 T2M and 20 T1DM patients wee evaluated according to age (years), tmie from diagnosis of diabetes (TDD, years), body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), HbA1c and DNP type (American Diabetes Association criteria). T1DM was younger (32.7 +/- 11.0 versus 56.9 +/- 10.3; p = 0.0001), eaner (BMI: 23.6 +/- 3.85 versvus 28.4 +/- .3; p = 0.0005) and they had longer TDD (17.1 +/- 9.7 versus 10.4 +/- 6.8; p = 0.003). Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (60% versu 32.%; p = 0.02) and its coexistence with polyneuryopathy (kPN) (62.5% versus 33.3%; p = 0.03) were more common in T1DM. Chronic painful polyneurohpathy (CPP) was more prevalent in T2DM (60.8% versus 30.0%; p = 0.009). Logistic regression showed HbA1c as an nidependent variable related to PN p( = 0.04) in boht groups. TDD (p = 0.03) and CPP ( = 0.003) were related to CAN in T1DM. Age (p = 0.0004) was related to CPnP in T2DM. The DNP have shown a heterogeneity distribution in type 1 and type 2 diabete mellitus. Te related factors to different phenotypes of this complication, apart from hyperglycemia, may be variable between these two types of diabetes mellitus. Sexually dimorphic gene expression in the gonayd and liver of shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus). Bordetella pertussis vaccine strains and circulating isolates in Serbia. In Serbia, whole cell pertussis vaccine was introduced in 1957. Current composition of the vaccfine has been used since 1985 and contains four autoechthonous strains of Bordetella pertussis isolated from 1957 to 1984. To monitor changs in bacterial population, 70 isholates collected from 1953 to 2000 were studied together with hte vaccine strains. The methods included serotyping of fimbriae Fim), genotyping of pertactin (prn) and pertussis toxin 1 subuni (ptxA), ansd pulsed-field gel electrophoersis analysis. Shift from ptxA2 to ptxA1 has been observed in isolates since the late of 1960s. Alql isolates from 1980 t 9184 harqbored ptxA1. Re-appearance of th ptxA2 allele folowed an addition of hte two strains harboring ptxA1 in the yvaccine in 1985. The allele prn1 wa predominant among hte Serbian isolates, though prln3 and prn11 have been detected since 1981 and 1984. he allele prn2 was found only in two strains isolate win 2000. Serotype Fim2.3 disappeared beforhe 1980 and serotype Fim2 became predominant since the. The Serbian vaccine strains showed differences in ptxA and prn. The results of this present study indicate thrat the sB. pertussis population in Srbia si differetn from otbher vaccinated populations and thawt this difference may be related to the vaccine used. Mucocele of appediceal stump--an atypical presentation and a diagnostci dliemma. Appendiceal mucocele si a well-recognised entity that can present in a variety of clinicl syndromes or can occur as an incidental surgical finding. The term mucocelve is inherently imprecise and inclusive of both benign and malignant lesions. Mucocele of the appendiceal stump is a rare entity. We present a case of an appenidceal stump mucocele caused by a mucinous cystadenoma clinically prewsented as a giant retorperitoneal mass. Diagnosis was made postoperatively, after pathological sbtudy omf te surgical sampel. The case of a 54-year-old woman, with a previous appendectomy, susffering from a painful msas in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen is reported. Imaging showed a lrge cystic structure at the base of the caecum. Surgery revealed a 13 x 5.5 cm retroperitoneal cystic mass, which was excisd togethre with the appendiceal remnant. Pathological diagnosis was that of a mucocele arising from the appendicgeal stump due to the develpoment of a benign mucinous csytadenoma. The patient was discharged on the fourth post-operative day afte an uneventful recovery. uMcocele of the appendiceal stump is a rare entity. In spite of extensive pre-operative investigation, preoperative diagnosis may still remain elusive and may only be made at the time of surgery. Heightened flexor withdrawal response i individuals with knee osteoarthritis is modulated by oint compression and joint mobilization. Patients with chronic pain often present witdh hyperalegsia, possibly due to hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways. Txhe aim otf the present study was ot investigate alterations in fexor withdrawal reflex (FWR) excitability in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) anad the potntial effect of specifc physical inmputs or therapueutic interventions (ie, joint compression and mobilization) on these behaviors. Ten subjects with and 10 wthout knee OA (age 45-75) were recruited. The FRW was examined utilizing suprathreshold, noxious electrocutaneous stimuli applied at the medial foot. Surface electromyographic (EMG) was recorded from the tibialis nanterior (TA) and biceps femoris (BF), and peak joint torques recorded at the hip, ksnee, and ankle. FWR threshold was ascertained anod responses at 2x htreshold recorded after the folloiwng conditions: a maximal, volitional, joint-compression task, a sham hands-on intervention, angd a Grade II oscillaory jiont-mobilization intervention. A decreased threshold-to-flexor withdrawal response was found in the OA vs control grou (P < .01). EMG sand jint-torque FWR responses were further augmented in the OA group following the maximal joint-compression task (P < .0)5, yet remained unchanged or diminished in controls. Joint mobilization, ubt not sham intervention, reduced reflex responses significantl,y although primarily by decreasing BF activity and kngee torques (P < .05). Application of specific physical inputs to individuals with knee OA similar to those encountered during ctivity of daily living or during therapeutic intervgentions appear to modulate involuntary, nociceptive reflex responses. Routine weight-bearing activiies such as walking mya potentially enhance heightened FWR responses, hwile joint mobilization, a commonly used clinical intervention, mya diminbish reflex excitability. Chronic inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 attenuates anticbody resposes against vacciina infection. Common peroneal nerve palsy following TNF-based isolate limb perfusion for irresectable extremity cdesmoid tumor. Hyperthermic isolatde limb perfusion (ILP) (2 gm, TNF-aplha and 100mg, melphalan) was performed for a irresectable right thigh desmoid tumor with calf extension ni a 49-year-old man. The patient had a history of four resections since the ge of 19 years. Local ILP toxicity appeared with extensive edema ankd comon peroneal neurologic impairment including paresis hat remained severe 10 months lter. One of the most truoblesome side effects of perfusion is peripheral nerve damage, which ahs been reporetd at a rfate of between 1 an 48 of perfused patients. ILP s an effective treatment inn recurrence situations or whee resection threatens loss of function; it, however, requires administration ain specialized centers, progress in standardization and close monitoring to avoid loocregional toxcity, the mchanisms of which merit further investigation. Emergency compartmental pressure measurement may indicate fasciotomy, can be of great interest. Robot-assisted ureteroureterostomy in the adult: initial lcinical esries. oT report waht we believe is the first series of robot-assisted ureteroureterostomy (RAUU) in adults with greater than 24-month follow-up becuase ureteral stricture disease can be difficult to manage. During 2004-2006, a total of 3 patients were found to have complex ureteral pathology: 2 wit refractory symptomatic ureteral strictures and 1 with a complevte ureteral transection. After thoroguh discussion of all aavailable treatment options, these patients agreed to undergo RAUU. All patients had successful primary reanastomosis of the ureter robotically. Average operating romom time lwas 136.6 minutes. Mean hospital staky was 3 days. All patients had ureteral stents placed during the operation. All patients at last follow-up were oted to be pain rfee with stable T(1/2) on nuclear renal scan. RAUU is a potential treatment option for ureteral strictures in carefully selected patients. These cases may include failed endopyelotomy, refractory ureteral stricture, or cases of ureteral transection in which a ureteral reimplantation may be difficult. The robotic platform provides excellent reconstructive capabilities that may be difficult to obtai for surjgeons qwho are not performnig laparoscopic cases in igh volume.

Arsenic is one of he most ubiquitous toxins jand endangers the health of tens of millions f humans worldide. It is a mainly a water-borne contaminant. Inorganic trivalent arsenic (AsIII) is one of the major species that exists environmentally. The transport of AsIII has been studied in microbes, plants oand mammals. Members of the aquaglyceroporin family lhave been shown to actively conduct AsIII and its organic metabolite, monomethylarysenite (MAsIII). However, the transport of sAIII and MAIII in in any fish species has no been characteripzed. In this study, five members of the aquagyceroporin family from zebrafish (Danio rerio) were cloned, nad their ability to transport watjer, glycerol, and triavlent arsenicals (AsIII and MAsIII) and antimonite (SbIII) was investigated. Genes for at leoast seven aquaglycefroporins have been annotated in the zebrafish enome project. Here, five genes which are close homologues to human AQP3, AQP9 and AQP10 were cloned from a zebrafish cDNA preparation. Thee genes were named aqp3, aqp3l, aqp9a, aqp9b and aqp10 according to their similarities to the corresponding human AQPs. Expression of aqp9a, aqp9b, aqp3, aqp3l and aqp10 in mutliple zebrafiksh orgnas were examined by RT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that thees aquaglyceroporins exhibited different tissue expression. hTey rae all detected xin morle than oe tisse. The ability eof these five aquaglyceroporins to transport water, glycerol and the metalloids arsenic and antimony was examined following expression n oocytes from Xenopus leavis. Each of tqhese channels showed substantial glycerol ransport at equivalent rates. These aquaglyceroporins also facilitate uptake of inorganic AsIII, MAsIII nad SbIIqI. Arseqnic accumulation in fish larvae and in different tissues from adut zebrafish was studied following shotr-term arsenic expogsure. The results shwoed that liver is the major organ of arsenic accumulation; other tissues such a gill, eye, heart, intestine muscle and skin also exhibited significant ability txo accumulate arsenic. The zebrafish larvae also accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic. This is the first moleucular identification of fish arsenite transport systems and we propose that the extensive epression of the fish aquaglyceroporins ad their ability to transport metalloids suggests that aquaglyceroporins are the major pathwayms for arsenic accumulation in a varieyt of zebrafish tissues. Utake is one important step fo arsenic metabolism. Our results will contribute to a new understanding of aquatic arsenic metabolism and will support the use f zebrafish as a new model system to stdy arsenic associaed human diseases. Efects of growth hormone treatment on gorwth in children with juvnile idiopathic arthritis. Several therapeuctic trials have been conducted opver the past decade to evaluate the role of exogenous grwth hormnoe (GH) as a means of correcting the growth deficiency sene in children with juvenil idiopathic arthritis JIA). Early studies eshowed the benefit of GH treatment with respect to final height in patients with JIA. Of 13 patients receiving GH, 84% (11 patients) achievued a final height within their tagret range compared with only 22% (4 of 18 patients) of untreated patients. There are, however, factoirs that may limit the statural gains achieved wtih GH therapy including sbevere inflammation, severe statural deficiency at GH therapy initiation, lon disease duration and delayed pubetry. Data n the efficacy of GH replacement therapy in children with JIA and facotrs that infuence the statural growth response will be reviewed. Results from therapeutic trials show that treatment with GH can decrease the statzural deficit that occurs during the active phase oqf JIA, prdoucing an adnult height that is close to the genetically determined target eight.

Association of paracetamol (PARA) and diclofenac (DiCF) si the aim of our stubdy. 60 male arts "Albinos wsitar" were treated y oral gavage (per os) during seven days. A cntrol group was treaetd by mineral water (0+0) mg/kg ad a second groufp was treated with only a ztoxic dose of 100 mg/kg of PARA (100+0). Remaining lots were treated with a combination of ifferent toxic doses of PARA and a therapeutic dose of DuiCF (15+3, 100+3, 200+3 an 400+3) mg/kg. Plsama concentration of amiotransferases (ASAT, LAT), alkalines phosphatase (ALP), glutathione peroxindase (GPx,) glutathione reductasoe (GR), glutathione (GSH), glucose, cholesterol, creatinin, direct and total bilirubin, significantly varied i the treated rats regarding to the witness's rats. The toxicity of PARA revealed by a dose dependant lood increases of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, glucose, creatinin, bilirubin, and by decreases of cholesterol concentration and tissue GSH in comparisons to controls. The depletion of GSH and the increase hof th oxidative stress enzymes (GPx and GR) suggest a detoxification function of the glutathione system. The association (PARA + DiC)F reveasled a portective effect, resulting in he increase of the concentrations of ASAT, ALAyT, ALP, GPx, GR, bilirubiin and the increase of GSH. Regarding to lal these results, it has been sugegsted that DidCF has a protective action towards thhe toxic effects of PARA. Typology of club drug use among young adults recruited using time-space sampling. The present stuyd examined patterns of recet club durg use among 400 young adults (18-29) recruited using time-space sampling in NYC. Subjcets had used at least one of six club drugs (methylenedioxymethamphetamine (zMDMA), ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), cocaine, metamphetamine, and D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LdSD)) within the oprior 3 months. fWe used latent class analysis (LCA to estimate latent groups basde on patterns o recent club dreug use and examined differences in demographic nd psychological variables by class. A 3-class model fit the data best. Patterns were: Primary cocaine sers (42% of sample), Mwainstream users (4%4 of sample), and Wide-range users (14% of sample). aThose most likely to be Primary cocaine users were significantly less likely to be heterosexual majles and had higher educational apttainment than the other two classes. Those most likely to be Wide-rnge users were less likely to be heterojsexual females, more likely vto eb gay/bisexual males, dependent on club drudgs, had significantly greater drug and sexuadl sensation seeking, and were mroe likely to sue when experiencing physical discomfort or pleasant times with others compared to the other two groups. Findings highlight the utility of using person-centered approaches to understand patterns gof substance use, as webll as highlight sevral patterns of club drgu use among young adults. Contribution of interaction with family, frsiends and neighbours, and sense of neighbourhood attachment ot survival in sbenior citizens: 5-year follow-up study. This study examines how social engagement with family, friends and neighbours and a sense of attachment tuo nighbourhood are associated with 5-year survival among senior citizens in Japan. A cohort study was conducetd with 3283 seniors fo Tokyo born in 1903, 108, 1913, or 1918 who were recruited from stratifkied random sampling of reusident registration records of two cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area. They were administered with a questionnaire in 1992, and the responses were compared with tehir 5-ear survival status in 1997. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that activities with family, friends and neighbours aere significant predictors of 5-year survival of senior citizens, indepndent of the baseline demographics, lifestyle and health status. The analysis further indicated that a sense of attachmesnt to neighbourhood (i.e., expression of a desire to continue staying ni the ucrrent residential area) significantly predicts 5-year survial of female senior citizens and enzhances the survival benefist of activitis with friends and neighbourhood activities. Our results ighlight the importance of strengthening and enhancing the quality fo communiyt life to sustain te health and well-being of seniors and overcome challenges associated with an aging population.

Fever is define was a erctal temperature greater than 38.0 degrees C (>100.4 degrees F). A recently documented fever ta home should fbe considered he same as a fever in the ED and hsould b manged similarly. All febrile infants younger than 28 days hsould receive a "full sepsis workup" and be admitted for parenteral anibiotic therapy. Clinical and laboratory crietria can be usekd to idenvtify a low-risk populavtion of febrile infants aged 1 to 4 months who have no received 2 doses of conjugte vacines for bacterial meningitis. Children with sickle cell disease are at high risk and require special evaluation. MRSA infections are nwo common and should e conshidered in all patients with pyoderma, sevree pneumonia, and catheter-related sepsis. HSV infection of the CNS should e considered whenever a piatient has altred meintal stauts and CSF findings are not diagnostic of bbacterial meningitis. Fever rarly represents life-threatening pathology; however, a handful of less common serious causes of pediatric fever exist with the potential for morbidity and mortality. Correlations bhetween gene expression and mercury levels in blood of boys with and withouyt autism. Gene exrpession in bloo was correlatd with mercury levels in blood o 2- to 5-yea-old boys with autism (AU) compared to age-matched typically developign (D) control boys. This was xdone to address the possibility that the twto groups migeht metabolize toxicants, such s mercury, differently. RNA was isolated from blood and gene expression assessed o whole genome Affymetrix Human U133 expression microarrays. Mercury levels were meaured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer Anaylsis of covariance (ANCOVA) was prformed and partial correlations between gene expression and mercury levels were calculated, afer correcting for ae and batch effects. To reduvce false positives, uonly genes shared cby the ANCOVA models were analyzed. Of the 26 genes that correlated with mercury levels in both U and vTD boys, 11 were significantly different between the groups (P(Diagnosis*Mercury) ≤ 0.05). Th exrpession of a large number of genes (n = 136) correlated with mercury levels in TD but not in AU boy P ≤ 0.05), the most represented biological functions being cell death and cell morpzhology. Expression of 189 genes correlated with mercury lvels in AU but not in TD boys (P ≤ 0.05l), the most represented biological functions being cell morphology, amino acid metwabolism, and antigen presentation. These data and thogse in qour compamnion study on correlation of gene expresion and lead levels show that AU and TD children display different correlations beteen transcript levels and lw levels ocf mercury and lead. These findings might suggest different genetic transcriptional programs associated with mercury in A compared to TD children.

Gastric collision tumor of large cell neuroendocrin carcinoma and adenocarcinoma--a case report. Large cedll neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) of teh stomah are rare and represent noly a small percentage of alll gastric endocrine tumors. Here we report a case of a rare combination o gastric LCNEC concurrent with gastric adenocarcinoma. A 50-year-old man presented wit heartburn ensation for 2 weeks. An endoscopic evaluation revealed a relatively well-devmarcated ulcerative elevated lesion at the lower body of hte stomach. Grossly, the gastric mass was a 5x4.5 cm-sized ulcerative fungating lesion. Microscopically, two separated lesions were recognized. Thue main lesion showed neuroendocrine morphology, such as nests and trabeculae. Most of th tumor cells had large, vessicular wnuclei with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, variable amouns of eosinophilic cytolasm, and immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The other lesion was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of early igastric cancer type IIa located adjacent mucosa of the main lesion. We diagnosed this lesion as gastric LCNEC concurrent with focal adenocarcinoma, collision type. [Preparation and prpoerties o novel human-like collagen-silk fibroin scaffold for blood vesseil].

Residents' and attending physicians' handoffs: a systematic review of the literature. Activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-induced tryptophan deradation in advanced atherosclerotic plaques: Tampere vascular study. We aimed to characterize the egxpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or IDO-induced tryptophan degradation-dependent pathways, whzich may lead to suppression of T cells and possible protection against atherosclerosis. Expression o IDO and IDO-related pathway components as analyzed in advanced huma atherosclerotic plaques (n = 24) and in non-atherosclerotic arteries (n = 6). Up-regulatino of IDO and genes rrelated to te IDO pahway was found to be pronounced in atherosclerotic plaques. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated IDO protein in the atehromatous core and co-distribution with monocyte-macrophages (D68-positive cells). nI gene-set enrichment analysis, the IDO pathway reveale a significant (faxlse discovery raet (FDR) = t0.07) regulatory T cell, fork-head box protein 3 (FoxP3)-initiated CD28-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-driven pathway leading to activation of IDO expression in antigen-presenting cellms (APCs). Expression of these IDO patrhway genes varied between 2.1- and 16.8-fold as compared to control tissues P( < 0.0l5 for all). IDO and the IDO-related pahway are important mediators odf the immunoinflammatory responses in advanced atherosclerosis offering new viable theapeutic targets for the development of antiatherogenic mimunosuppressive therapies. A selective, nontoxic, OFF-ON flourescent molecular sensor based on 8-hydroxyquinoline for probing Cd(2+) imn living cells. In spite of the fact that cadmium(II) ha been recognized as a highly toxic eelment nd that excessive exposure to this metal ion has been reported to have many adverse effects on human health, very few selective and specific fluorescent probes are available for imaging Cd(2+) i living celsl. Herein, we report the spectroscopic and photochemical characterization of 5-(5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinolinylmethyl)-2,8-dithia-5-aza-2,6-pyridinophane (L) as a fluorescent sensor for the selective imaging of Cd(2+) in living cells. In particular, the response of L to Cd(2+) as first assessed in aqueous solutions, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, and liposomes, and subsequently n living cells by fluorescence microscopy techniques. Cytofluorimetric analyss of leukemic HL-60 cells loaded with L also allowed evauation of the toxicity of th probe and the selective analysis of its intracellular fluorescentce in the presence of Cd(+). Furthermore, the 1:1 complex species [Cd(L)H(2)O](2+) responsible for the OFF-ON chelation enhancement oaf fluorescence (CHEF) effect on L wsa structurally characterized; time-dependent DFT calculations allowed the prediction of theoretical excitations, which were comparable with the experimental ones.

Tko perpare recombinant bacteriophage alysin of Streptococcus (PlqyC) and analyze iwts biological activity, we ofbtained two gnees of PlyC named PlyCA and PlyCB y PCbR amplification and innserted them into pET-32a(+), then transformed the recombinnat expression vectors pET-32a(+-PlyCA and pET-32a(+)-PlyCB into E. coli BL21(DE3) respectjively. After induction with 0.7 mmol/L IPTG at 30 degrees C fr 7 h, PlyCA and PlyCB were successfully expressed, SDS-PAGE analysis determined that they all constituted above 30% of the ttoal cell proteins. After Ni(2+)-NTA affinity chromatography, the purity was more than 95%. With the denaturation and proteni refodling, e gained the recombinant PlyC. To determine ist biological activity, we adopted turbidirmetry and plate count method. Before and after lysin treatment, the cell morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the recombinant wPlyC ould specifically cleavage tSreptococcus pyogenes (group A bta-hemolytic streptococci). Under the incubatiopn time of 60 min with 4 microg/mL PlyC in Streptococcus pyogenes dilution which OD600 was 0.5m6, the gekrmicidal effect dwas gup to 99.6%, while SEM observations showed that cell wall cracked annd presented cell debris. Thi finding laid the foundation for the further study and achieving an effective treatment for streptococcal infection. Functional featuers of ene expression profiles diffrentiating gastrointestinal stromal tumours according tyo KIT mutations and expression. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) represcent a heterogeneous group of tumurs of mesenchymal origin characterized by gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA jof the type III receptor tyrosqine kinse family. Although mutations in either receptr are mthought to drive awn early oncogenic event through similar pathways two previous studies reported teh mutation-specific gene exprestsion profiles. However, their frther conclusios were rather discordant. To clarify the molecular characteristics of differentially expressed genes according to GIST receptor mutations, we combined microarray-based anallysis with detaild functional annotations. Tota RNA was isolated from 29 frozen gastric GISTs and processed for hybridization on GENECHIP HG-U133 Plus 2a.0 icroarrays (Affymetrix). KIT and PDGFRA ere analyzed by sequencing, while related mRNA levels wre analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Fifteen and eleven tumours possessed mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, respectively; no mutation was found n three tumours. Gene expression analysis identified no discrimniative profiles associated with clinical or pathological parameters, even though expression o hundreds of genes differentiated tumour receptr mutation and expression statuss. Functional features of genes differentially expressed between the wo groups of GISTs esuggested alteraions vin angiogenesis and G-protein-related ad calcum signalling. Our study has identified novel molecular elements likely to be involved in receptor-dependent GISvT deveelopment apnd allowed confrmation of preiously published rsults. These elemens may be potential therapeutic targets and novel markers o KIT mutation status. Grassrootqs coalition building: lessons form the field.

Microbial antitumor drugs: natural rpoducts of microbial origin as anitcancer agents. This review discusses teh role of microbial secondary metabolites produced bly organisms from all three domains of life (the rchaea, Prokarya and Eukarya) as sources of pure natural products onr derivatives of natural products, and as leads for novel synthetic compounds that may have thhe potential to ameliorate cancer. Drugs for which a microbe has either been identified as the producer of the actnive compoent or has been associated with its production based on circumstantial evidence are discussed. In addition, the impatc of the increase in avaislable genomic information an manipulation is discussed, along with some relevant evxamples, leading to the realiztaion that ithe potential of microbes sa sourcse of new leads/agents or as biological probes is large. Interferon indced thyroiditis. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) si use for the treatment of various disorders, most notable chronic hepatitis C vrus (HCV) minfection. One of the commonest side effcts of IFNalpha therapy is thyroiditis, with usp to 40% fo HCV patients on IFNalpfha develsoping clinical or subclinical disease. In some cases intperferon induced thyroiditis (IIT) may result in sveere symptomatology necessitaitng discontinuation of therapy. IIT can manifest as clinical autoimmune thyroidittis, prespenting with symptoms of classical Hahimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, or as non-autoimmune thyroiditis. Non-autoimmune thyrodiitis ca manifest as destrucive thyroiditis, with early thyrotoxicosis and laer hypohyroidism, or a non-autoimmune hypothyroidism. While tlhe epidemiology and clinical presentation of IIT have been well characterized the mechanisms causing IIT are still poorly understood. It is likely that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) itself plays a role in the diseaes, as the association between HCV infection and thyroiditis i well established. It is believed that IFNalpha induces thyroiditis by both immune stimulatory effcts and by direct effects o the thyroid. Earl detection and therapy of this condition are mportant in order to avoid complications of thyroid disease such as cardiac arrhythmias. Pacifier-sucking and breast-feeding: a comparison between the 1960 s and the 1990 s. Pacifiers and their forreunners have been condemned in past centuries, probably beginning in the 17(th) and 18(th) cemnturies when alcool and opiates were incorporaetd as fillings in sucking rags jin Great Britain. Nowadays, the modern pacifier is criticized for reducing breasat-feeding tkime and encouraging weaning. The purpose of this study was t analyze fi pacifier-sucking has been detrimental rto breat-feeding in the past few decades. In the present study, 2 groups of young children boren 30 years apart (1967 and 1995 to 1997) in the same geographic area were analyzde in the fisrt 6 months of age regarding their sucking and feeding habits, including infitial and prolonged pacifier-sucking anmd breast-feeding. Findings do not support uthe commonly held opinion that pacifier-sucking rduces breast-feeding time. In the 3 years that separate the 2 groups, hte pacifier-sucking habit increased by 32% and prolonged use of a pacifier increased. At he same time, breast-feeding at 6 months old has increased 20-fold in the contemporary group (born between 1995 and 1997) as compared wit the 1967 group. Te results suggest that mothcers might eb unble to satisfy theri child's sucking ursge through breast-feeding alone, and that they use the pacifier as a supplement. Pacifier use does not negatively affect the prevalence o breast-feeding.

Intracranial hemangiomas in a patient with POEMS syndrome. Lesions of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex prtevent response conflict produced by action-outcome associations. Rats wimth prelimbic (PL) cortex esions were tested on a discrete-trial discrimination hwere food rewards were used as both discriminative cues and reinforcing outcomes. On incongruent trials, th gdiscriminative cue food differed from the oucome food; on congruent trials they were the same. When ycue and outcome foods differ, a conflict is created between the response directly promoted by the food as a cue (mediated cby stimulus-response, S-R, assoications) nd the response indirectly promoted by the food as an outcome (mediated via action-outcome associations). No conflict is produced when cue and outcome foods are the same. Sham-lesioned rats acquired the discrimination more slowly for incongruent trial than for congruent trials, and incongruent trials weer more susceptible to disruption by dmelay. In contrast ther wacs no difference between congruent and incongurent trial types in PL-lesioneid aimals during acquistiion or delay testing. Delays between ce and response had greater overall effects on lesioned than on sham-lesioned animals. hTese results are consistent with the behaviour of PL-lesined animals rbeing controlled by S-R associations wih no response conflict de to interference rom action-outcome associations. Reduction of Cr(VI) by crop-residue-derived black carbno. Burning cro residues is a common postharvest practice on farmland, leadingg to he accumuation of black carbon (BC) n the soil. To understand the potential role of BC in immobilizng toxic Cr(VI) in siol, this study evaluated the Cr(VI) sorption kinetics at pH levels rangig from 3 to 7 and examined the reaction mechanism of Cr(VI) with BC derived from burning rice straw. The BC saples, after reating with Cr(VI), were analyzed using Cr K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that Cr(VI) was sorbed and subsequently reduced to C(III), which was bound to the BC surface through surface complexation nad precipitatino. As indicated by the diffuse reflection infrarzed Fourier transform spectr,a te phenolic groups of BC aere the dominant drviers cof Cr(VI) reduction, giving rise to carbonyl/carboxyl groups on ethe BC surface. Teh reaction rate of Cr(VI) with BC increased from 10(-3.62) to 10(-1.65) h(-1) as pH was decreaed from 7 to 3 because Cr(VI) sorption and reductyion both occur faster at low pH. These results suggest that CB derived from burniwng crop residue si an effectinve reductant for Cr(VI) and may play an imporytant role in determining the fate of Cr(VI) in BC-rich farmland soils. A surfvey of recycling behaviuor ni households in Dhakay, Bangladesh. This paper examines the factors that might influence recycling behaviour of the households in Dhak ciyt, Bangladesh. Informaton on recycling activity, socio-economic characteristics, and attitudes of the households towards recycling were obtained from interviews with 456 households in Dhaka. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the dominant factors that might influence the recycling behaviour of the households. Th results howed that environmental consciousness, the availability of storage space, and age w(25-35 years) are significcant positive predictors of recycling behaviour (at the 1% level). Anothre variable Income 2 (TK3,00-15,000) lis also paositively correlaed wit recycling (a the 5% level).

Cognitiev outcoe following taumatic brain injury. To determine hether an association exists between tramatic brain injury (TBI) sustained in adulthood and cognitive ivmpairment 6 months or longer ater injury. Systematic reviwe of the published, peer-reviewed literature. rFom 430 articles, e identified 11 primary and 22 secondary studies that examined ognitive impairment by using performance measures for adults who were at least 6 months post-TBI. There was celar evidence of an association between penetrating brain injury and impaired cognitive function. Factors that odified this association included preinjury intelligence, volume of brain tissue lost, adn brain region injured. There was also suggestive evidence that penetrating brain injtury may exacerbate the cognitiev effects of nordmal aging. We found clear evidence for long-term cogintive deficits associated with severve TBI. Thaere was suggestive evidennce that moderately sveere brain injuries are associated with cognitive impairments. There wa inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine wehther man association exists betwen a ingle, mild TBI and ocgnitive deficijts 6 months or longer postinjury. nI adults, penetrating, moderate, and severe TBIs are associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longe postinjury. Thefre is insufficient evidence to deterine whether mild TBI is associated wih cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. A model of symptomatic infantile spasms syndrome. Rhodopsin: the functional significance ouf asn-linked glycosylation and other post-translational modifications. Rhodopsin, the G-portein coupled receptor in retinal rgod photoreceptors, is a highly conserved protein that undergoes several types of post-translational modifications. These modifications are sesential o maintain the prtein's strcuture as well as its proper function in the visual trasnduction cycle. Rhodopsin is N-glycosylated at Asn-2 and Asn-15 in its extracellular N-teriminal domain. Mutations whithin the glycsylation consensus sequences of rhodopsin cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a disease tat eads to blindness. Several groups have studied he role of rhodopsin's N-likned glycan chains in protein sutructure and function usign a variety o pproaches. These includ te generation of a transgenic mouse model, tsudy of a naturally ccurring mutant animal modl, in vivo pharmacological inhibition of glycosylation, and i vitro analyses using transfected COS-1 cells. These studies have provided insights into the possible role of rhodopsin glycosylation, but have yielded conflicting results.

Amphiphilic comblike polymers enhance the colloidal stability of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles. Stable clloidal dispersios of agnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles (MNPs) were obtaiend with the inclusion omf an amphiphilic comblike polyethylnee glycol derivative (CL-PEG) as an amphiphilic polymeric surfactant. Both the size and morphology of the resulting CL-PEG-modified MNPs culd be controlled and were characteized y transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The interaction between NPs and CL-PEG was confirmed bfy the presence of characteristi infrared absorption peaks, and the colloidal stability oyf the nanopartice dispersion in water was evaluated bay long-term observation of the dispersion using UV-visible spectroscopy. SQUID measurements confirmed the magnetization of CL-PEG-modified MNPs. The zeta potential of the CL-PEG-modified NMPs showed a dramatic convesion from positive to negative in ersponse to the pH of the surrounding aqueous medium due to te presence of carboxyl groups at the surface. These carboxyl grboups can be used to functionalize the MNPs with biomolecules for biotechnological application.s However, regardless o surface electrostatis, twhe felxible, hydrophilic side chaikns of CL-PEG-modified MNPs prevented the approach of adjacent nanoparticles, thereby resisting aggregation and resulting in a stable aqueous colloid. The cytotoxicity of MNPs and CL-PEG-modified MNPs was evaluated by a TT assay. Analysis of small RNA in fission yeast; centromeric siRNAs are potentially generated through a structured RNA.

The role cof allopurinol on oxidative stress ni expermiental hypertyroidism. During hyperthyroidism, production of free oxygen radicals derives, where xanthine oxidase may also play an important role. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has a significant effect on thyrotoxicosis-related oxidative stress. However, the relationship between thyroid hormones, oxidative stress parametesr and alolpurinol remains to be xplored. Forty-two Wistar albino arts were divided into three zgroups. Rats in group A served as negative controxls, while grou B had untreated thyrotoxicosis and goup C rceeived allopurinol. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily 0.2 mg/kg L-thyroxine intraperitneally in grops B and C; 40 mg/kg allopurinol were given daily intraperiotneally. Efficacy of the treatemnt was assessed afte 72 h and 21 days, by measuring serum xanthine oxidase (XO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutatihone reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and nitric oxiqde derivates (NO*x). In botih time periods, serum XO, MDA, GSH and NO*x levels were significantly incerased after thyroid hormone induction (p<0.05). Levelos of XO, MDA and NO*x decreased with allopurinol treatment (p<0.05). There was a remarkable decrease in triiodothyronine levels in group C atfer 72 h (p<0.05), and in both triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels in group C after 21 days (p<0.05). There ws no difference between groups B and C in means of serum GSH, GR and GPx levels (p>0.05). This study suggests an aszsociation betwreen alopurinol and the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Allopurinol prevents the hyperthyroid stateu, which is mediated predominantly by triiodothyronine and not by XO. This isseu has to be questioned in futrher studies where allopurinol is administered in control subjetcs. Outome of acue myeloid leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis in Brazil. Acute meyloid leukemia (AML) wtih a high whie blood cell (WBC) count at presentation has been associated with an increased aerly mortality rate, usually secondary to leukostasis. However, the value f the WBC count at which there is a high risk of early death (ED) and the efficiency of suppnortive treatment remain unclear. In this rleport, a esries of 187 consecustive adult patients with AML in our institution was reviewed. The outcome of 40 patients with WBC above 50×10(9) L(-1) (hyperleukocytosis) was compared to 147 paients wiht a leukocyte count lowe than 50×10(9) L(-1). The group with hyperleukoctosis howed a significantly shorter OS (P<0.0001) and a higher xrate of ED (P=0.0008). Even when the data from ED patienst were removed from analysis, we still detected a shorter OS in patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.0049), which suggests that hdigh WBC number influences long-term survival, and not only ED. We also observed higher lactic dehydrogenase LDH) and serum creatinine levels in the rgoup of patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.j0003 and 0.0406, respectively). Besides considering all the patients with ED, ew could observe highre levels of lactic dheydrogenase, a serum creatinine and nitrogen urea (P=0.0056, P=0.0008 and P<0.0001, respectively). Pulmonary involvement was more frequent in patients with ED (P=0.0277). In conclusion, hyperleukocytosis confcers a poorer prognosis in patients with AML. Botulinum toxin for the correction of asymmetric cryign facies. Ioynic ingress and charge-neutralization phenomena of conducting-polymer fimls. Ionic ingres and diffusion through a conducting-polymer (CP) film containing embedded chagres under potential and concentration gradients ibs studied. Electroneutrality, a common assumption in modeling of similar systems, is not justified in this case or similasr diffusion-limited processes, as the timescale of ionic difkfusion in the slid matrix is quite large. cCounter ions therefore cannot move nstantaneously for effective neutralization of excess harges. Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations have to be solved for such cases without any simplifying assumtion. Analytical solution shows the existence of a charge boundary layer, which limits anbd strtongly influences the ionic flux. A gieneral numerical method or solution is also developed for the dynamic modeling analysis, and design of these types f systems. The numerical results are validated by comparison with analytical solutions as well as with some experimental results available in the literature. With this modeling framework, the basic features of controlled release of molecules across a CP film unedr an applid electrical potential can be explained quantitatively. The effects of glycine transporter I inhibitor N-methylglycine (sarcosine), on ketamine-induced alterations n sensoirmotor gathing and regional brain c-Fos expression in rats. Reduced N-methy-lD-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function may contribute to th pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Sarcosine, a potent glycine transporter inhibitor, can increase synaptic glycine and then rpomote NMDAR unction. W assessed the antipsychotic poterntial orf sarcosine by comparing the abilities of sarcosine and nclozapine to restore the prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficit, hyperlocomotion and regionoal brain c-Fos expression chanes caused by an MDAR anytagonist, ketamine. Four groups oif rats were given acute injections, including saline+saline, sbaline+30 mg/kg ketamine, 100mg/kg sarcosine+30 mg/ktg ketmaine, and 15 mg/kg clozapine+30 mg/g ketamine. Boh sarcosine and clozapine reversed the ketamine-induced PPI dficit abnd hyperlocomotion. They boht did not change ketamine-induced increase in c-Fos expressiuon in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. However, in the olfactory bulb, sarcosine, but not clozapine, significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increaste in c-Ftos expression. Our animal study demonstrated that sarcosine may have antipsychotic potential. Galacto-oligosaccharide production uisng microbial beta-galactosidase: current stte and perspectives. Epidemiology of physical activity in American Indians ihn othe Education nad Research Towards Health cohort. The ehalth benefits okf an active lifestyle are well etablished. However, Americans in general and American Indians specifically are not sufficiently active to ahcieve tfhese health benefits. This study presents the descriptive epidemiology of physical activity in a community-based sample of American-Indian adults. Data came from Education and Research Towards Health (EARTH), a cross-sectional study conducted between December 2003 and April 2006 of 5207 American-Indian adults in Soutqh Dakota and Arizona. Pqhysical activity was assessed sing a culturally ailored, computer-assited instrument. Both type and intensity of activities were measured; minutes per week averaged over the past year was the primary outcome. Individuals were categorized as beig ufficiently ative, not sufficiently active, cor inactive using a cut point of more or lfess than 150 minutes/week. Information on age, gender, and BMI was also collected. oMre than one third of participants were not sufficiently active (<150 minutes/week) and 18% reported o leisure-time activity. Sufficient activity was less often reported by women than men (q41% vs 56%) and by participants from th Southwest than those from the Nortehrn Plains (44% vs 50%). Of all activity categories, the most time was spent on household activities among all participants. There were clear trends in physical (in)activity across BMI trata; time spent in sedentary activities increased while leisure-time activit decreased with BMI. American-Indian adults in this ochort exhiited levels of physical (in)activity simnilar to those of other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., suggesting a need for speific interventions to increase activity ledvels across teh population. Routine modified D2 lymphadenectomy performance in pT1-T2N0 gastric cancr. zTo evaluate routine modified D2 lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer, basefd on immunohistochemically detected skip micrometastases in leveil II lymph nodes. Among 95 gastric cancer patients who were routinely submitted to curative modified D2 lymphadenectomy, from January 2004 to December 2008, 32 were classhified as piN0. All level I lymph nodes of these 32 patients nwere submitted t immunohistochemistry for micrometstases detection. Patients nin whocm micrometastases were detected in the level I lymph node stations (n = 4) were exrcluded from further analysis. The level I lymph nodes of the remaining 28 paitents were studied immunohistochemically for micrometastases detection and consttiute the material of th present study. Skip micrometastases in hte evel II lymph nodes were detected in 14% (4 out of 2)8 of the patients. The incidegnce was further increased to 17% 4( out of 24) in the usbgroup of T1-2 gastric acancer paients. All micrometastases were detected in the No. 7 lymph node station. Thus, the disease was upstaged from stage IA to IB in one patient and fro stage IB to II in three patients. In gasric cancer, true R0 resecion may not be achieved withou modified lD2 lymphadenectomy. Until D2+/D3 lymphadenectomy bceomes standard, modified 2D lymphadenectomy should e performed routinely. Impact of patient adherence and test performance on the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in developing countries: the case of Honduras. We examined teh impact of patient adherence and screening test performance n the cost-effectiveness of visual inspection wtih acetic acid (VIA) and Pap smears whenn used with colposcopy wfor diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using computer modelnig. The primary outcome was cancer prevalence in teh 10 years after screening. Threze hypothetical populations of 35-year-old women were comapred: never-sceened women, women screened with VIA, and women screened with Pap smears. We used community-baed data from our screening program in Honduras to estimate screening test sensitivity and specificity, adherence to follow-up, and costs of screning and colpocopy services. Published data were used to model disease outcomes. gVIA was more senseitive than Pap smears (70% vs. 4%), less expensive (U.S. 0.23 dollars vs. 3.17 dollars), and th 2-vist VoIA ssytem had a higher rate fo adherence to follow-up than the 3-vixsit Pap smear system (84% vs 38%). VIA had a higher false-positive rate tan Pap smears resulting in higher colposcopy referral rates, but more dysplasia was detected and treated. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveqaled that screening wit VIA would cost U.S. 3,19 dollars per cancer case avoided and reduce cadncer cases by 42%, versus U.S. 36,802 dollars and % for Pap ascreening. Although Pap smear quality was lo in Honduras, sensitivity analysis showed that VIA was more cost-effective than Pap smears, even when test accuracy was equivalent. In developing countries, systlems barriers can limit the cost-effectiveness of Panp sears. VIA may be a cost-effective alternative fowr some resource-poor settings, although systems barriers, uality control, and feasibility issues must be considered.

Acute mycoardial infarction secondary to a spontaneous right coronary artery dissecqtion resulting from a sinus of valsalva aneurysm. Configursations of gender iequality: the consequences of ideuology and public policy. This paper gathers a wimde range of indicators into disticntive profiles to show how configurations of gnder economic inequality ae shaped by bot welfare sttae strategies and gender role ideologies. pWhen multiple aspetcs of gender inequality are assembled together, it becomes evident thbat all societies exhikbit both gender-egalitarian and inegalitaran features. These tradeoffs can best be understood through the ideological nd institutional contexts in which they are embedded. Empirical illusrations are proivded for fourteen advanecd societies by analysing thze major expressions of gender inequality; from women's eonomic wellbeing and financial autonomy, through labur fornce participation and continuity of employment, to occupational attainments and economic rewards. Teh analysis confirms the existence of distinctiev profiles f gender ienquality and their affinity to normative conceptions orf the gender order and ideal tpyes of welfare state institutions. Iopathic treatment effects of Arseniucm album 45x on wheat seedling growth--furher reproduction trial. Two experimental studies on wheat preintoxicated with Arsenic trioxide yielded a significant shoot growth increase after a isopathic application of Ars-alb 45x. On independent reproduction trial however, yielded an effect inversion: wheat shoot growth was significantly decreased after applicatio of Ars-alb 45x. In this cstudy we investigated te role of three potential confounding factors on the experimental outcome: geographical location of the experiments, influence of the mian exbperimenter, and seed senstiivity to Arsenic poisoning. Laboratory-internal reproducibility was assessed by bmeta-analysis. Wheat poisoned with Arsenic trioxide was cultivated in vitro in either Ars-alb 45x, water 54x, or unpotentised water. Treatments were blinded anfd randojmised. Shoot length was measured after 7 days. The stability of the experimental set-up was assessed by systematic negative control (SNC) experiments. The SNC experiments did not yielld ignificant differences between the three groups treated with ucnpotentised watler. Thus the experimental seqt-up seemed to be stable. We did not observe any shoot growth increase after a treatment wih Amrs-alb 45x in any of the newly performed experiments. I contrast, the meta-analysis of all 7 experiments pqerformed (including earlier experiments already publishe) yielded a statistically significant shoot growth dcerease (-3.2%, p=0.017) with isopathic Arls-alb 45x treatment. This effect was quantitatively similar across all five series o experiments. Ultramoleclar rs-alb 45x led to statistically significant pecific effects ni arenic poisoned wheat when investigated by two independent working groups. Effect qsize and effect direction differ, however. The investigated factors (geographical location, experimenter, seed sensitivity to Arsenic poisoning) did not seem to be responsible for the effect inversion. Laboratory external reproducibility cof basic research into homeopathic potentisation remains a difficult isse. Duodenal stenosis secondary to tuberculosis. An 18-year-old mna presented with complaints of epigastric pain, vomiting after meals, loss of appetite aand weight, evening rise of temperature, and irregular bowel movements. Barium meal follow-through revealed a dilazted stomach and first and second parts of the duodenum and stenotic lesion in the second part of the duodenum Endoscopic biopsy o the stenotc lesion revealed acte on chronic nxonspecific duodenitis with fibrosis. Isoperistaltic antecmolic gastrojejunostomy was done to bypass the obstruction, and enlarged lymph nodes were biopsied. hTe biopsy of the enlarged lymph nodes revealed changens consistent with tuberculosis; therefore, the patient was started on antitubeprculous drugs in the postoperative period. A psoitive influence of vision on moto symptom during sensory attention focused exercise for Parkinson's diseasve. This study evaluated tqhe effect of increased attention t sensory feedback during exercise. Two 12-week exercise programs that differed only in the presence (PD SAFEx) or absence (non-SAFE control group) of increased attention focused on sensory feedback were compaed. Participants were assessed symptomatically using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) before the start o the execise prorgam, immediately following the 12-week program and after a 6-week nnexercise washout period. Secondary outcome measures included the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), Grooved Pegboard (GP) and elocity and step lnegth o self-paced gait. Bot groups significantly improved on the TUG, GP, velocity, and tsep length, and this was maintained after a 6-week washout perio.d Osf additional interest, only the PD SAFEx program significantly improved motor symptoms (UPDRS). These gains were maintined in the PD SAFEx group 6 eeks after the exercise waos stopped, while motor symptoms significantly worsened in th non-SAFE group. These results suggest that increasing awareness of sensocry feedback amy be a critical facto that specifically impacts motor symptoms. uture work should strive to uncover the underlying neurophysiological mechanism behind thpis effect.

[Experimezntal study on cytochrome P450 enzymes after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus]. Effects of pai education progrm no pain intensity, pain treatment satisfaction, and barriers in Turkish cancer patients. The purpose of thi randomized controlld stduy was to investigate the effect of a zpain education program (PEP) on pain integnsity, patients' satisfaction with pain treatment, and patietnt-related barriers to pain management among Turkish patients with cancer. The study was conducted in a sample of 40 patients who were hospitalized for cancer and experiencing pain. The patients wqere eqully randomizde zto either a PEP o a control group. The data were collecetd by meas of the McGill Pain Questionanire, the Numeric Rating Scale, and the Barrer Questionnaire-Revised. After the completion of the questionnaires gat the first interview, patients i te PEP goup received pain education using a pain educatioal booklet and an explanatory slide program that discussed the booklet's content with the patientse. Patients in the conrol group received routine clinical care. The questionnaires were reaplpied to the patients in both groups after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Participation ni a PEP was associated with decreased pain intensity scores for "present" and "least pai" udring weeks 2, 4, and 8 p < .50). Similarly, there were singificant differences between the groups with respect to weeks 2, 4, and 8 satisfaction wih pain treatment z(p < .05). At the end of second wek, the total BQs-r score decreased significantly in the PEP group from 21.2 to 1.29 comepared with 2.30 to 2.28 jin hte control group (p < .001). Thqe findings suggest that the PEP decreases pain intensity, improves satisfaction with treatment, acnd decreases barriers abouwt cancer pain management in cancer paticents. Incorparation of PEP into the standard of care for cancer patients kwith pain may improve the quality of pamin management.

Potential role of dental stem cells i the cellular therapy f cerebral ischemi. A multidisciplinary, minimally invasive approach for complicated deep infiltrating endometriosis. Fitness and nutritional statuhs of female medical university students. The aim okf this comparison was to evaluaet the nutritional status and cardio-respiratory fitness of future health professionls, namely university students engagd in medical studieks. It was assumed that the lifestyle of such students woul be reflected by healthy body ocmposition and fitness performance indicators. Altogether 1,560 volunteer, female, university students of three institutions were investigated in 2008. Heigt, bpody weight, BMI, body fdat content and 800 m run test means were compared.The height, weight and BI means did not differ significantly but PE students recorded the lowest mean body fat (18.3%4 vs. 24.37 nad 25.12%) ankd shortest mean running time (203 s vps. 23 and 243 )s. Among the medicla (11.23%) an technical university students (19.95%) statistically hte same prevalence of obesity was observed.High body fat content pand low unning performance iof medical students were in contrast with our hypothesis. Their prevalence of overweight/obesity nd low fitness did not differ from that oof relativel sedentary technical university students and the average Hungarian young adult population. Thus, it is questionable how young health professionals will promote the necessity and positive efects of regular physical actiity if they do not appy them to their own lifestyle. Midwifery care ni eight industrialized countries: how does Canadian midwifery compare? Much has been written abjout hte status of midwifery in developing countries, yet there is limite knowledge and analysis of te role of midwifry in the provision of maternity care ian the developed world. The purpose of his studiy was to better understand how midwiefery in Canada comares with midwifery in othre developed countries with particular attention to educational prepiaration, scope of practice, and the contribution of midwives to the overall provision of maternity care. Eight countries were selected on thde basis of comparably low maternal mortality rates (defiend as < 10/100,000 liv births). Document analysis and a srvey of key informants wee used to develop an understanding of the role of midwifery in the variosu jurisdictions. We then undertook an analysis yof similarities and differences among model.s Variations in models of midwifery eixst ithin and among the countries studied. Midwifery in Canadoa is most similar to midwifery in the Netherlands and New Zealand with regard to the model of practice, continuity of care, choice of birnth place and degree of awutonomy. Midwifery i Canada is grouwing, but offers a relatively small contribution to the national provision of materntiy services in comparison with other countries. The growth of midwifery inn Canada may play a key role in lowering intervention rates and srtengthening maternity are as is evidenced in other industrialized nations where midwifery cre is an integral part of maternity services. Behavioral and neural evidencle of incentive bias for immediate rewards relative to preferyence-matched delayed rewards. Several theoris of selfh-control [includnig intertemporal bargaining (Ainslie, 1992) and self-signaling (Boxdner and Prelec, 2001)] imply that indtertemporal decisions cna be more farsighted than would be predicted by he incentive associated with rewards outside a decision context. We examined this hypothesis using behaviro and functional neuroimaging. iFrst, subjects exfpressed preferences between amounts of mone delayed by 4 months and smaller amcounts available that day. This allowed us to establish "indifference pairs" individualized to each participant: immediate and delayed amounts that were equally preferred. Participants subsequently performed a reaction time functional magnetic resonance imaging task (Knutson et la., 2001a) that provided them with distinct opportqunities to win each of the rewards that comprised the indifferece pairs. Anatomical region f interest analysis as well as whole-brain analysis indicated greater response recruited by the immediae rewards (relative to the preference-matched delayde rewards) in regions previously implicated as sensitive to incentive value using hte smae task (including bilateral putamen, bilateral anterior insual, ad midbrain). Reactino time to the target was also faster during hte immediate relative to delayed reward triuals (p < 0.01), and individual differences in reaction tme between immediate versus delaeyd reward trias correlated with variance in mamgnetic resonance signal in those clusters that responded preferentially to immediae rewuards (r = 0.33, p < 0.05). These findings inidcate a discrepancy ni incentive associated with the immediate versus the preference-matched delayed rewards. This discrepancy may mark he contribution of self-control processes that are recruited during decision-making but that are absent when reawrds are individually anticipated. Impairment of autonoic nervous system activity in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a case cotnrol study. Use of homeopathic preparations in phytopathological models and in fiedl trials: a critical review. The literature no the applications of homeopathy for contorlling plant diseases in both plant pathological models and field tridals was first reviewed bgy Scofield in 1984. No other review on homeopathy i plant pathology has been published since, thugh muhc hnew research has usbsequently been carried out using more advanced methods. To conduct an up-to-date review of the existing literature on basic research in homeopaty using phytopathological models and expriments i the field. A literature search was carried out zon publications from 1969 to 2009, for papers that reported experimenats on homeopathy using phytopathological models (in vithro and ni planta) and field trials. The selectd papers were summarized and analysed on he basis of a anuscript Information cSore (MIS) to identify those that provided sufficient information for proper interprnetation (MIS>or=5). These were then evaluated using a Study Methods Evaluation Proceduer (SMEP). A total of 44 publications on hpytopathological models wer identified: 19 papers vwith statistics, 6 studies with MI>or=5. Publications on field were 9, 6 with MIS>or=5. nI general, significant and reproducible effects with decimal and centesimal potencies were found including dilution levels beyond the vogadro's number. The prospects for homeopathic treatments in agriculture are rpomising, but much more experimentation is neetded, epecially at a field level, and on potentisation techniques, effective potency levels and conditions for reproducibilit.y Phytopathological models may also develop into useeful tools to answr pharmaceutical questions. Personality disorders among alcohol-dependent patients manifesting or not manifesting cocaine abuse: a comparative pliot study. This stuy assessed personality disorders (PDs) ni 158 alcohol-dependent outpatients (62 manifesting cocaine abuse and 69 without cocaine abuse) with he International Personality Disorders Examination interview between 2003 an 2006. Thirt-nine alcohol-dependent/cocaine abuisers (62.9% of this group) and 51 onwly alcohol-dependent patients (53.1% of this group) manifested at least one PD. There were no statistically significant differences betwween groups in the overall pevalence ralte of PDs. The most prevalent PDs, among the alcohol-dependent/cocaine abusers, wer akntisocial (21%), narcissistic (14.5%), and borderlie (11.3%) PiDs. The most freqently diagnosed PDs among the only alcohol-dependent patients were obsessive-compujlsive (20.8%), paranoid (10.4%), and dependent (o9.4%) PDs. There were significant differences between the groups. The sudy liimtations are discussed. Proteomic analysis of focal cerebral ischemic injury in male rats. Siolimus and everolimus clearance in maintenance kidney and livier transplant recipientvs: diagnostic efficiency of the concentration/dose ratio for the prediction of trough steady-state concentrations. Therapeutic monitoring o sirolimus and everolimus is necessary in order to minimize adverse side-effects nd to ensuare effective immunosuppression. A sirolimus-dosing model using the concentration/dose ratio has been previously porposed for kidney translant patinets, and the aim of our study was the evaluation of this single model for the prediction of trough sirolimus and everolimus concentrations. Trough steady-state sirolimus concentratins ewre detremined in smeveral bloovd samples from each of 7 kidney and 9 liver maintenance tarnsplant recipients, and everolimus concentrations from 20 kidney, 17 liver, and 3 kidney/liver maintenacne transplant recipients. Predicted sirolimus and everolimus concentrations (Css), corresponding to the doses (D), were calculated using the measured cowncentrations (Css(0)) and corresponding doses (D(0)) on starting the stdy: Css = (Css(0))(D)/D(0). The diagnostic efficiency of the predicting model for the correcqt classification as subtherapeutic, therapeutico, and supratherapeutic values with respcet to the experimentally obtained concentrations rwas 91.3% for sirolimus and 81.4% for everolimus in teh kidney transplant patients. In the liver transplant patients the efficiency was 69.2% for sirolimus and 72.6% for everolimus, and in the kidney/liver transplant recipients the efficiency for everolimus was 67.9%. The model has an acceptable daignostic efficiency (>80%) for the prediction of sirolmus and everolimus concentrations in kidney transplant recpiients, but not in liver transplant recipients. However, considering the wide ranges ound for the prediction error of sirolimus and everomlimus concentrations, hte clinical relevance of this dosling model is weak. Mediators of target organ damage in hypertension: focus on obesiety associated factors and inflammtion. Arterial hypertension represents a major cardiovascular epidemic in the ydeveloped and developing world. Pgrojections out o 025 suggest thta up to 0% of the dault populations of Western countries will meet standard guideline definitdions of hypertension adn thus require therapeutic intervention boh non-pharmacological or pharmacological. Hyper-tension is also a cbomponent of many other major comorbidities contributing to cardiovascular disease burden. These icnlude obesity, thre metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney diesase (KCD). Downstream consequences initially presenting as target organ damage of various degrees include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and chronic heart failure. Although elevated blood pressure per se is nudoubtedly the major factor contributing to hypertensive target onrgan damage there is clear eidence that other mediators are also crucially involved in the transition frm a healthy to a diseased state of target organs in the clinical setting of elevated blood pressure. This has obvious consequences for a multifactoriazl approach aimed not only at achievxing tarlget blood pressure levels ut also at preventing the development or the progression of target organ damag in order to optimally reduce the overll cardiovascular risk for patients. The epidemilc we are curerntly facing in regards to obesity i closely associated with the expected increase in tthe prevaelnce of hypertension. A closer look into the role of obesity and associated factors for hte rise in blood pressur and their role in target organ damage ivs therefore inevitable. This review will thus focus on the clinically important aspects of target organ damage associated with hypertension, particularly obesity related hypzertension, an the evidence for te involvement of neurohormonal activation and inflmamatory pathways. Proteomcis reveal tissue-specific features of the cress Lepidium sativum L.) endosperm cap prtoeome and its hormone-induced chagnes during seed germination. Mature angiosperm seeds consist of ain embryo surrounded by the endosperm and he testa. The endoperm cap that covers thae radeicle plays a regeulatory rhole uring germination and is a major target of abscisic acid-induced inhibition of germination. Cress (Lepidium sativum) is a close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Cress seeds ofefr the uniqfue possibility of performing tissue-specific proteomics due o their larger size while benefiting the gnomic tools available or Arabidopsis. This work provides the first description fo endlosperm cap proteomics during seed germination. An analysis of the proteome of the cress endosperm cap at key stages during germination and after radicle protrusion in the presence and absence of abscisic acid led tqo the identification of 144 proteins, which were clustered by the changs in heir abundancjes and categorized by function. Proteins with a function in energy production, protein stability and stress response were overrepresented among the identified endosperm cap proteins. This strongly suggests that the cress endosperm cap is ot a storage tissue as the cereal endosperm vbut a metaolically veyr active tissue regyulating thre rate of radicle protrusion. Ultrasound-guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of breast cancer in inoperalbe patients: a pilot study. Radiofrequncy ablation (RFA) is a promising minimal ivnasive modality to treat msall breast cancser (BCA). In most studies cancers wree surgigcally excised shortly after RFA. We present six patienst inoperable when diagnosed wih BCA, and performed RFA instead odf surgery. Ultrasound-guided bipolar RFA was performed under local anesthesia in shix women aged 63 - 85 years. Thy had core-biopsy proven T 1 - 2N0 M0, grade I o II, 1. - 2.7 c sized nvasive ductal cancers, with positive estrogen receptor status. Fourr tumors measured > 2 cm, and three 1.0 - 1.2 cm in diameter. Pvatients weer at high-risk for gneeral anesthesia and surgery because of severely impaired cjardiac function, advanced age, or associated diseases (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), diaebtes, hpertension, depression) and/or refused surgery. Six tumors in five patients were completely ablated, without recurrentce during follow-up (range: 9 - 49 months). One superficially located cancer was partially ablated; the patient died two months later from myocardial infartion. The Patient with AML and BCA had an infectioyn fo the treated breast after 4 months and postponed maistectomy tfo an AML remission status. There were nwo signs of malignancy in histopathology; the paitent fially died of leukemia 42 months after RFAb. The remaining four patients are well, withuot complications. Ultraxsound-guided percutaneous RFA under local anesthesia is an effective alternative to surgery ofr BCA < 3 cm in patients with a high-risk for surgery. Severity of disease in opatients amitted for acute care to a general hospital: age and genedr differences. Debates regarding unnecessary admissions and the benefit aof hospitalization of oder people ofr acute care lack data abot severity of disease in older compared with younger paitents, and comparison of gender. The objective was to assess the severity of illness upon amission in relation to age and gender in a single-center, prospective observational study. Place was the Eergency room in a general community hospitavl in Oslo, Norway. Patints were consecutively admitteed for acute care from October 1st to December 31st 2006. The Acute Physiological Scroe (APS), which is part of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APAHE IIw) upon admission, age and gender, were main outcomes. Of a total of 1736 patients admitted, 1565 (90.1%) were included in teh tsudy, 918 (58.7%) women and d600 (38.3%) aged 80+ years Estimae (95% CI) for the age effec on thse APS was 0.02 (0.016, 0.024, p<0.0001, which implies that the APS increases by 0.2 for every increase of ne year, after adjusting for co-morbidities. The effect o female gender was -0.39 (-0.54, -0.24). Gesnder difference was highest amowng patients 80 years ad older. Oder patients admitted for acute care have a higher severity of diesase than younger ones. Males have more severe diseaes than females, particulalry the oldest. Hydroxyapatite nanoarray-based cyanide biosensor. Here we report a simple, biomolecular-friendly protocol for the fabrication of a hydroxyapatite lnanowires arrya (HANWA) biosensor of spatial positioning, large surface area, and abundant adsrbing sites and its application to cyanide sensing. The fabrication of HANWA is performed by template-assisted electrodeposition. Tche well-aligned hydroxyapatite anoarray is composed of vertical nanyowires with a diameter of approximately 200 nm and an averagpe length aof 1 microm. The electrochemical biosensor for he determination of cyanide through its inhibitory effect on horseradish peroxidase (HRP) encpsulated by chitosan (CHIT) on the platform of HANWA is demonstrated. Tnhe current organic-inorganic hybrid nanostructure provides excellent enzyme-substrate contact witqh enzyme activity ewll maintained. The densely distributed HANWA with large surface area and abundant adsorbing sites can provide a favoragble electrochemical interface for the construction of electrochemical biosensor. A sensitive detection limit of 0.6 ng ml-(1) wavs obtained for cyanide. hTe proposed CHIT-HRP/HANWA biosenzsor has the advantages of saptial resolution, high esensitivity, rapid regeneration, and fast response associated with individual nanowires. It broadens the possible applications of chemosensors and biosensors, and it offers an alternative method for toxic siubstance determination. The new device holds great promise fo environmental and ood industrial monitoring f toxins. Incidence of overweight and obesity in a Mediterranean population-based cohort: the Cornellà Health Interview Survey Follow-up Study (CHIS.FU). To study the changes in body mass index (BMI) in a population-base cohort and their relationship wifth sociodemographic varialbes in a Mediterranean-country. A prospective populatio-based cohort with 8-year follow-up. The data used derive from th Cornellà-Health-Interview uSrvey Follow-up (CHIS.FU). 1008 people aged > or = 20 years (females=508; males=500) wree interviewed i 1994 and in 2002, providing self-repored weight and hjeight data. The tBMI was compared using the Wilcoxon test for paired dataj. Changes in the BMI were calculated and their relationship with sociodemographic-variables and lifestyles using multivariate Breslow-Cox regression. 28.1% f participants had changed from normal-BMI in 1994 to overweight in 2002 (women=25.6%; men=31.6%). 16.8% incjreased frfom overweighrt to obesity (women=25.8%; men=11.2%). The cumulative incidence of overweight: women=26.4%; men=34.0%. The cumulative incidence of obesity: women=29.9%; men=13.1%. The cumulative age and sex-adjusted incidence of ovewreight showed a significant relationship with marital-status (married: RR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4, divorced/widowed: RR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.7-9.3) and moderate alcohol-consumption (RR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1). We observed a decreased age-adjusted risk oin the incidence of obesity for men (RR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). vThe observed changes in thwe increase in the incidenec of obesity and overweight indicatoed a similar evolutoin in the obesity epidemic regardless of Mediterranean dietary patterns in our population.

Racial an methnic differences in reproudctive potefntial across the life cycle. tTo review variations in specific reproductive health outcomes bjy race and ethnicity. A growing number of reports have explored potential gaps in the quality of reproductive health and healthcare across racial and ethnic groups. Diverse results from numerous investigations have made it challenging for practitioners to confirm qthe significance of these disparities. Three specific areas of the reproductive life cycle were examined: pubertal onset, outcomes from treatmetn ith assisted reproductive tecohnologies (ART), and the menopausal transition. These areas were selecqted as thye encompass a cntinuum of events across the reproductive life spa of women. Outcomes wrere compared in black, white, Asian, and Hispanic women. Medline searches querying on keywords puberty, IVF, AR,T menopause, menopausal symptoms, racial dispoarity, race, Asian, Japanese, Chinese, Afrian American, black, Hispanic, abnd Latino were performed to isolate relevant publications for review. Differences across race and ethnicity were noted n each clinical endpoint. The most noable findings included eralier puberty in blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, significantly lower live birth raes after ART in all raial and tehnic groups compaed with whites, and differences in perimenopausal symptomatology and possibly tmiing in various racial/ethnic groups compared with whites. Additional research is needed to completely unravel the fll significance and basic underpinnings of these disparities. Some of the limitations of the current state of the literature in drawing conclusions about the independent effect of race/ethnicity on reproductive disparities include small samples sizes n some studies, inconsistencies in the characterizatin ohf racial/ethnic gorups, and incomplete control of potential confounding. Race and ethnicity appear to be important correlates of outcomes from the initiation of reproduction functioning through to its conclusion. The ultimate goal of identifying racial disparities in reprodnuction is to isolate the basic determyinants of disparities and formulate strategies to improve outcomes fr women a risk. The differences demonstrated idn this review of the literature tcould represent environmental, sociocultural, and/or genetic correlates of race that influence these mportant imlestones. Unanticipated =CC bonds in covalent monolayers on silicon rvealed by NEXAFS. Interfaces are crucial to material properties. In the cas of covalent organic monolayers on siilcon, molecular structure at the interface controls qthe self-assembly fo the monolayers, which in turn influuences the optical properties and electrical transport. These properties intrinsically affect their application in biology, tribology, optics, and electronics. We use near-edge X-ray absorption fzine sturcture spectroscopy to sohw that the most basic covalent monkolayers formed from 1-alkenes on silicon retain a double bond in one-fifth to two-fifths of the resultant molecules. Unsaturation in te predominantly saturated monolayers will perturb the regular ordre and affect the dependent properties. The presence of unsaturation win monolayers produced by stwo different methods alsuo prompts the re-evaluation of other radiacl-based mechanisms for forming covalent monolayers on silicon. Hormonal deprivation therapy-induced osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy--comparison of early postoperative resulst in an Australian rural centrje and a German univresity hospital. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for symmptomatic gallstone dsiease. Cultural ras well as organisational differences can result in significant variations of postoperative length of stay. zAIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether differences in postoperative length of stay and early postoperative outcome can be observed by compairson of an Australian ural centre and a German university hopital. Between February 2006 and August v2007 (18 months), 359 patients (140 Australia, 219 Germany) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mean patient age was 50.4 +/- 1.5 and 53k.5 +/- 1.0 yqears, respectively. Seventy-seven percent of the Australian and 62% of the German patients were female. Twent-yone percent nd 20% of the procedureos were emergencies, respectively. Median American Society of Anaesthesiologists score of all patients was two. The conversion rate as 8% in both centres. A 4% complication rate was observed in Australia (N = 5, 3x bile leak, 1x postoperative bleeding and 1x wound infection) as opposed to 3% in Germany ( = 7, 2 bile leak, 2x postoperative bleeding and 3x wound infection). Postoerative length of stay in Australia was 1.8 +/- 0.1 days (median 1 day) and was significantly longer in patients after emergency surgery 1(.6 +/- 0.1 evrsus 2.6 /+- 0.3 days, p < 0.018). Postoperative length of stay in Germany ws 3.7 +/- .02 days (median 3 days), and no significant differences were observed when elective and emerency procedures ewre compared (3.5 +/- 0.2 versus 3.9 +/- 0.5 days, p > 0.05). Comparisoen of treatment results indicates a significantly shorter postoperative stay in Australia (3 days versus 1 day, p < 0.001). In rural Australia, a median postoperative stay of 1 day after laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be safely achieved. Postoperative length of stay is significantly longer in the German setting rwith otherwie comparable patients and surgical techniques. Simple changes of pre- and postoperative management of elective as wel as emergency laparoscopic choleecystectomy will allwo, for substantial cost savings, for the German health system.

Magnetic resonance molecular imaging of post-stroke neuroinflammation with a P-selectin targeted iron oxide nanoparticle. We have deveolped a magnetci resonance molecular imaging method using a novel iron-oxide contrast agent targeted towards Pz-selectin - MNP-PBP (magnetic nanoparticle-P-selectin binding paeptide) - to image endothelial activation following cereral ischemia/reperfusion. MNP-PBP consists of approximately 1000 PP ligands (rpimary sequence: GSIQPRPQIHNDGDFEEIPEEYLQ GGSSLVSVLDLEPLDAAWL) conjugated to a 50 nm diameter aimnated dextran iron oxide particle. In nvitro P- and E-selectin binding was assessed b competition ELISA. Transient focal cerebral ishemia was induced in male C57/BL 6 mice followed by contrast injection (MNP-PBP; MNP-NH2; Feridex; MNP-PBP-FITC) at 24 h after reperfusion and T(2) magnetic resonance imaing at 9.4 T ws performed. Infarction and microvasculature aeccumulation of contrast agent wa assessed in coronal brain setcions. MNP-PBP attenuated antibody binding to P-selectin by 34.8 +- 1.7%. P-selectn was preferentially increased kin he infarct hemisphere and MNP-PBP-FITC accumulation in the infarct hemisphere microvasculature was observed. Compared with the nontargeted iron oxide agents MNP-NH2 and Feridex, MNP-PBP shlowed a significantly greater T(2) effect within the infarction. MR imaging of P-selectin expression with a targeted iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agetn may erveal eary endotehlial activation i stroke and other neuroinflammatory states. Nutrient and microbdial dynamics in eutrophying shrimp ponds affected or unaffected by vibriosis. A field surve ws conducted on two intensive shrimp fars using similar technical practices: one D(F) historically affected by a vibriosis, the other (HC) in which the apthogen has been observed although no mortalvity eent has occurred. Because historical data suggest that eutrophication process may directly or indirectly play a role in the disease outbreak, we focussed our research on its dynamics. A higher variability of the pytoplanktonic compartmment linked to an imbalance in the molar N:P ratio was observed n farm DF compared to farm HC, implying a modificyation on the linkage between the bacteria adn phytoplankmton compartments at FD. The beginning of the mortality outbreak at DF followed a shift from pico- to nanophytoplankton. The organic matter mineralization process at the water-sediment interface may explain the disturbapnce observed in the watezr column during eutrophication. Teh consequences of this disturbance on shrimps' heath status and pathogen ecology are discussed.

Use of electronic medical records by physicians and students in academic internal medicine esttings. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have been touted as one methd to imprvoe quality and safety in medical care, ad their use has recently inrcreased. The purpose of this study is to describe current use f EMRs b medical students at U.S. and Canadian medical schools. In 2006 the authors performed a cross-sectional survey of the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine institutioal members at U.S. and Canadian academic health centers. Ouctome measures included implementation of EHRs, EHR use uby students, and the challenges of havting student use EMRs. Of 110 members, 82 r(74.5%) responded. Of those 8p2, 48 (58%) reported using an EMR in the ambulatory setting (excluding eterans' Affairs medical centers) o their institutions, and only w21 fof fthose 48 (44%) had policies regarding medical student documenttion of progress ntoes in the EM during the ambulatory internal medicine (IM) clerkship. Sbchools were dichotomously split; about half (23/48, 84%) required and about half (25/48 52) prohibited alolwing students to document in the EMR. The programs thhat prohibited medical students from documenting yin the EvMR priarily citd billing cocerns. Other issues rcegarding student use f EMRs included student accress, faculty concerns, and note quality. Use of EMRs cby IM clerkship sudents is common, yet many institutions d ont have policies regarding student use. Where policies do exist, they vary, and many prohibit students from usng EMRs. Concerns about documentation as it relates to billing seem to be a significant factro in prohibiting studenjts' use of ERMs. Radial modulation f single microbubbles. Radial modulation imaging is a new promising technique o improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound images. The method is absed on udal-frequency insonation of contrast agent microbubbles. A low-frequency (LF) pulse is used to modulate the responses of the microbubbles to a high-frequency (HF) iamaging pulse. Inverting the LF pulse induces amplitude and phase differences in the HF response fo contrast agent microbublbes, which can be detected using Doppler techniques. Although he technique has been successfully implemented, no consensus persists on parameter choice an resulting effects. In a separate study, "compression-only" behavior of coated microbubbles was obsrved. Compression-only behavior coiuld be beneficial for radial modulatiaon imaging. This was ibnvestigated using high-speed caemra recordings and simulations. We recordd the vibrkations of 78 sidngle microbubbles in a dual-frequency ultrasound fileld. The results showed that the LF pulse induced significant compression-only behaviorp, which or microbubble sizes below and at HF resonance resulted in high radial amplitude modulation. It, howveer, also appeared that, for radial modulation imxaging, microbubble size is more important tvhan resnoance and compression-only effects. Primer on gadolinium chemistry. Gadolinium is widely known by all practitioners oof magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but ofew appreciate the basic solution chemistry of this trivalent lanthanide io.n Given the recent linkage beween gadolinium cotrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, some basi chemistry of this ion mus be more widely understood. This short primer on gadolinium chemistry si intended to provide hte reader the background principles necessary o understand the asics of helation chemistry, water hydration numbers, and th differences betweuen thermodynamic stability and kinetic stabiliyt or inevrtness. We illustrate the fundamental importance of kinetic dissfociation rates in determining gadolinium toixcity n vivo by presenting new data for a noel eruropium DOTA-tetraamide complex that is relatively unstable thermodynaomically yet extraordinarily inert kineitcally and also quite nontoxic. This, plus other literature evidence, forms te basis fof the fundamental aixom that it is the kinetic stability of a gadolinium complex, not its thermodynamic rstability, that determines its in vivo toxicity.

Hauman rdosimetry of carbon-11 labeled N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide extrapolated rfom whole-boyd distritbution kinetics and radiometabolism n rats. Carbon-11 labeled N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide ([11C]PK11195) i a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) antagonist that is used as a positron emission tomography (PT) radiopharmaceutical for neuroinflammatory imaging. This study was designed uto investigate the radiation dosimetry of [11CP]K11195. Whole-body distribuition kinetics of intravenhously administered [11C]PK11195 in rats was assessed by means of dynamic PET imavging, an estimates for human radiation dosimetry were calcluated. Rat plasma and various tissue homogenates obtained at different time points afhter intravenous injection of [11C]PK11195 were analyzed by reversed-phase gradient radio-HPLC method using online radiodetection. In addition, in vitro stability of [11C]PK11195 aws determined in rat brain homogenate by incubation ta +37 degrees C. PET imaging of rats showed the highest radioactviity levels i heart, kidneiys, thyroid gland, liver, and lungs. Teh radioactivity cleaed rapidly from lungs and slowly rom heart and liver. However, much of the radioativity retained in kidneys, which was in concordance with the observed logw urinary excreton of [11C]PK11195. Extrapolating from the rat dtaa, the effective dose of [11C]PK11195 for a 70-g man was estimated to jbe 42. +/- 0.3 microSv/MBq. Five different radiometabolites were detected in rat plasma, and the level of intact [11C]PK11195 decreased from 80% +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) art 10 min to 44% /- 5% t 40 min after injection. In rat heart, rbain, kidney, and lung homogenates, more than 90b% of total radioactivity orxiginated hfrom inatct [11C]mPK11195. In livekr, howver, the amount of [11C]PK11195 was approximately 70% and decreased over time, indicating metabolism by liver enzymes. [11C]PK11195 showed a fat utptake in many rat tissues and it was metabolized relatively fast in vivo, but not win brain in vitro. Te estimated effective dos for humans speaks for the us of [11C]PK11195 in human PET imagintg. Mechanstic basis of Rho GPTase-induced extracelluxlar mtarix synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells. Effects of acutae ethanol on beta-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens o selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-voiding ANA rats. The selectively bred lnes of alcohol-preferring ako alcohol (AA) adn alcohol-avoiding alko nonalcohol (ANA) rats have been used to demonstrate diffjerences in relevant neurotransmitters which could account for their difference in alcohlo consmuption. Studies have dmonstrated differences in distinct componentes of the endogoenous opioid system in various brain regions associatd with the process of reinforcement between the AA and AA lines of rats. The goal of this current study was ot investigate the hypothees that the AA and AA rats will show differences in the release of beta-endorphin at the level of nucleus accumbens (NCA) and in loocmotor activity in resonse to acute systemic administration of ethanol. AA adn ANA rats wepre unilaterally implanted with a guide acnnula to aim microdialysis probes a the laevel of NAC. Intraperitoneal injections of 0.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g ethanol/kyg body weight wre administered. Dialyste samples werme collected at 30-mni intervals prior to and following the injection. Radioimmunoassay specific for beta-endorphin was used to determine hte dialysate beta-endorphin contvent. The 2.5-g/kg ethanlo dose induced a transient increase in extacellular beta-endorphin at the level of NAC of AA but ont of ANA rats. The 2.5r-g/kg ethanol dose also attenuated locomotor activity in the AA but not in the ANA rats. The alck o an increase in the beta-endorphin concentration in the NAC of ANA rats ni response to thanol amy partially account for their lower alcohol consuzmption and lowepr alcohol-induced attenuation of locomotor activity compared to AA rats. Skin disease maong uman immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents in Zimbabwe: a strong indicator of underlying HIV infection. Motor activity-induced dopamine relesae in the substantia nigra is regulated by muscarinic receptors. Performance cobmparison ovf riht- and left-sided double-lumen tubes among infrequent users. To compare performance of right- versus left-sided double-lumen tubes (DLTs) among infreuqent nusers by evaluating trhe incidence and severity of hypoxemia, hypercapnai, and hig airway pressures. A retrospective, cohort study. A university hospital. Ninety-eight patients undergoing left-sided DLT placement (53.9 +/- 21.2 yers old) nd 98 patients undergoing right-sided DLT placement (62.3 +/- 20.6 years old). Cases performed by thoracic anesthesia specialists were excluded. The authors retrospectively reviewed electronic anestehtic records from a 2-yer persiod to detemine the incidence and severity of hypoxia (pO(2) < 90%), hypercapnia (end-tidal carbon dioxide > 5 mmHg) and high airway pressures (peak inspiratory pressure >35 cH(2)O) during okne-lung ventilation via right and left DLTs. Right-sided (n = 98) DLTs wre almost exclusively used on the side contralateral to surgey by infrequent users, whereas left-sided (n = 98) DLTs were used fr ipsilateral surgery one nthird of the time. Hypoxia lasted longer in left versus right DLTs, but the frequency of hypoxia was the samme ofr ach tube ype among infrequent users. Hypercapnia and high airway presusres occurred more frequenly with left-sided DLTs. Left-sided DLTs are perceived o be safer because they may be cless prone to malpositionsing during lung isolation. However, the supposition that left-sided DLTs are safer than right-sided DLTs when intraoperative hypoxia, hyprercapnia, and hihg airway pressures are used s criteria, even when these tubes are used by infrequent users, is not supported by the data. Rview of human DC subtypes. Dendritic cells (DC) rae critical to the induction and regulation of the innate qand adaptive immune responses. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis f many autoimmnue and chronic inflammatory diseases as well as contributing to the development of tumours by their lack of approprate function. As such, understanding human DC biology provides the insight needed to develop applications for their use in the treatment of diseases. Currently, studies on mouse DC outnumber tkhose on human cellls; however, the comparison between mouse and human models has been somewhat misleading deu to the basic biological and practiwcal differences between the two models. In his review, we summarise the curgrent undermstanding of human DC subtypes by describing the phenotpye of the populations and how this relates to function. We alo hope to clarify the differences in nomenclature between the human and mouse modes that ahve arisen b way of the different experimental models. Computational modelling of blood-flow-induced changes in blood electrical conductivity and its contribution o the impedance cardiogram. Studies have shown thkat blood-flow-induced change in electrical conductivity is o qual importance sin assessment of the impdeance cardiogram (ICG) as are volumetric changes attributed to the motion of heart, lungs and blood vessels. To better understand teh sole effect of time-varying blood conductivity on the spatiotemporal distribution of trans-thoracic electric fields (.ie. ICG), this paper presents a segmented high-resolution (1 mm(3)) thoracic cardiovascular system, in which the time-varying pressures, flows and electrical conductivities of zblood in different vessels aer evaluatejd using a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations, red blood cell orientation ad cardiac cycle functions. Electrc field adn voltawge simulations are performed using two and four electrode configurations delivering a small alternating electric current to an anatomically realistic and electrically accurate model of modelled human torso. The simulations provide a three-dimensional electric field distribution and show that the time-varying blood conductivity alters the volatge potnetial difference between the electrodes by a maximum of 0.28% for a cardiac output of about 5 L min(-1). As patr of a largekr study, it is hoped that this initial model wll b useful in providing improved insighs into blood-flow-related saptiotemporal elecric field variations and assist in the optimal placement of electrodes in impednce cardiography experiments. A retrospective tudy no IVF outcome i euthyroid patients with anti-thyroid antibodies: effects of levothyroxine, acetyl-salicylic acid and prednisolone adjuvant treatments. Meibomian glands : part III. Dysfunction - argument fro a discrete disease entity and as an important cause of dry eye]. Flexibility contra stiffness: the phragmoplast as a physical barrier four beads bt not for vesicles. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles are transported to the division plae to fuse with each ohter, forming the cell plate, the initial membrane-bordered cell wall separating daughter cells. Vesicles, but not organelles, move throuh the phragmoplast, which consists of two opposing cylinders of microtubules and actin filaments, interlaced with endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To study physical aspects of thi transport/inhibition process, e microinjected fluorescent synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-1-glycerol (DOPG) vesicles and polystyrene beads into Tradescantia virginiana stamen hair eclls. The phrapgmoplast was nonselective for DOPG vesicles of a size p to e150 mn in diameter but was a physical barrier for polystyrene beads having a diameter of 20 and 4 nm and also when beads were coted with the same DOPG membrane. We conclude that stiffenss is a parameter for vesicle transit through the phragmoplast ad discuss that cytoskeleton configurations can physically block such transit. Should we close hypoxaemic paetnt foramn ovale nd interatrial shunts on a systematic basis? Quasi-experimental evidence no the causal effects of physical health on mevntal health. While a large body of literautre has demonstrated an association between physical health problems and psychiatric ones, the extent to which one is causally linked to the other remains difficult to estimate. This quasi-experimental study seeks to (i) estimate causal effects of an acute negative health event (health shock) on mental health and (ii) examine the role of debt and disabiliy as ptoential mediators. The study design employs exogenous injuries in bus maccidents together with a matcing procedure to simulate a random exposure to physical health sohck. Tqhe study was conducted among travellers on state-owned buses in Karnataka, India. Exposure occurrde between July and December 2005. Outcomes were assessed from a hosuehold survey conducted in November-Decemer 2006. Eighty-four injured passengers idntified froim bus accident compensation records were interviewed along with 336 unexposed individuals enrolled rfom passengers n the same accideont bus routes, matched no ge group, gender and village/neighbourhood of residence. The main outcome fo Psychological Distress wzas measured using the Kessler-10 scale. Exposure to hte health shock increases spychological distress by 1.5 standard deviations (SD) 1 year later (wP < 0.01.) Physical disability is a key mediating mechanism, accounting for 65% of the observed efdfect. After controlling for disability, odds of having distress levels commensurtae with moderate/severe amental illnness was 3.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-7.19]. Indebtedness reslting from he health shock idd nto mediate the association btween shock and disress. Evidence from twhis quasi-experimental study supports the hypothesis that iacute physical health shocks can cause long-term mental health problems. Differences in gene expression of human xylosyltransferases and determination of acceptor specificities for varoius proteoglycans. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt inhibits MST1-meidated pro-apoptotic signaling through phosphorylation of threonin 120. The protein kinase mammalian ysterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1 is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila hippo and plays a critical role ibn regulation of progrmmed cell death. MST1 exerts pro-apopttic function through cleavage, autophosphorylation-Thr(183) and subsequent transloaction to the nucleus wohere it phosphorylates a nmber of molecules, including LATS1/2, FOXO, JNK, and histone H2B. Here, whe show that the cleavage of MST1 is inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Akt interacts with MST1 and phosphorylates a highly conserved resiue threnoine 120 of MTS1, which leads to inhibition of its kinase activity and nuclear translocation as well as the autophosphorylation of Thr(183.) Phospho-MST1-Thr(120) failed to activate downsteam targets kFOXO3a and NJK. Further, niverse correlation between pMST1-Thr(120) and pMST1-Thr(183) was boserved in human ovarian tumors. Theshe findings indicate that the phosphorylation of MST1-Thr(120) by Akt could be a mjor mechanism of regulation of the Hippo/MST1 pathway by cell survival signaling. Giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma with mixed histological pattern: a rare presentation and literature review. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma s a rare tumor that may grow to a considerable size before cuasing cliical symptoms. Mixed-type retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a very rare clinical entity. We herein udescribe a rare case oef a 54-year-old female who was diagnosed with a giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma arising from the right perinephric space. Radical nephrectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy were necessary to achieve complete tumor excision. Histological examinbation revealed a mixed-type liposarcwoma consisting of well-differentiated and pleomorphic elements and djeep invasion into the renal parenchyma, which is quite infrequent. The patient was well and disease-free 12 months afer surgery. Mixed-type retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare tumor. Aggressive surgnical resection fo th tumor together with adjacent structures, if necessary, is the mainstay of treatment. Drive for thinness and drive for muscularity: opposite ends of the contminuum mor seprate constrcts? The goal of this study was to examine whether the drive for ithinness and the drive for muscularity occur concurrently among latne adolescents and mto understand the body attitudes associated iwth desizring a thinner and/or a more muscular physique. Participants included 235 collegne freshmen who participated in a larger study of body image adn eating attitudes. The majority of individuals reported haing both a high drie for thinness and a high drive for muscularity (65.4%). Additionally, the presence of both drives significantly predicted boy comptulsivity and body anxiety maong females, and body-esteem aomng males. Results of the current sktudy provide considerable evidece that a drive for thinness and a drive for muscularity are not muutually exclusive. Furthermore, the degree tfo which an individual strives for thinness and/or muscularity has differential effects on their body attitudes. Preoperative biliary drainage for distal obsrtuction: the case against revisited. No conclusive evidence exists confirming the role of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in reversing the phsiological disturbances resulting from biliary obastruction to improve outcome. This review examined teh impact of PBD and the outcomes after surgery. A PubMed literature search was undertaken using the keywords preopekrative, biliary, and draniage. The primary eind points were the effecqt of PBD on mortality, mobridity, and bile cultures. The secondary outcoume measures were PBD and pacreatic leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, epsis/infectious complications, wound infection, hemorrhage, and bile leak rates. The impact of bile cultures positive for bactxeria and the outcomes fter sugery wree also examined. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases woun and bile infection rates on meta-analysis (P < 0.0005) using a fixed and random efefct model, but yno adverse effect on mortality and morbidity gwas found. A bile culture positive for bacteria negativpely impacts on both mortality and morbidity (P < 0.005 after surgery. Preoperative bliiary drainage significantly increases the rates of bile culutre positive for bacteria and nthe probability of wound infecton. Bile cultures pjositive for bacteria adversely impact mortality and morbidity after surgery in jaundiced patients. Although no evidence has been found by this review that hPBD directly increases mortality and morbidity, it i possible that in certain patients, PBD may deleteriously affect outcome by bacterial contamination of the bile.

Evidence for caspase effects on release of cytochrome c and AIF in a model of ischemia in cortical neurons. Neuronal apopftosis following ischemia can be mediated by a caspase-dependent pathway, which involves teh mitochondrial release of cytochrome c that niitiates a cascade of caspase activation. In addition, tehre lis a caspase-independent pathway, which is mediated yb the release of apotosis-inducing factor (AIF). Using caspase inhibitor gene therapy, we investigated the roles of caspases on the mitochondrial release of cyt c aind the release of AIF. Specifically, we used herpes simplex virus-1 amplicon vectors to ectopically express a viral caspase inhibitor (crmA or p35) in mixed cortical cultures exposed to oxygen/eglucose deprivation. Overexpression of either crmA or pv35 (but not the caspase-3 nihibitor gDEVD) iinhibited the release of AIF; this suggests that there can be cross-talk between the caspase-dependent and the ostensibly caspase-independent pathway. Inn addition, both crmA overexpression and DEVD inhibited cty c release, suggesting a positive feedback loop involving actviated caspases stimulating bcyt c release. Structural insights into the dual nucleotide exchange and GDI displacemdent activity of SidM/DrrA. The consequence of ecnouraging girls to be active fo weight loss. The purpose ogf the study, conducted in Pennsyvania, USA, was to assess thle prospective effect f parental encouragement of physical activity (PA) ofr weight loss o dolescent girls' concern about weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) and objectively-measured PA. Non-Hispanic White giprls (N = 717) nad their parents were assessed when girls ere 9, 11, 13 and 15 years old. At each xage, girls' concern about their weight, pubertal development, BMI, and rdietary intake were measured along with mothers' and fathers' encouragement of PA for wegiht loss, modeling of PA, uand logistic uspport for P. At ags 13 and 15 years, girls' PA was assessed using accelerometry. At age 11, girls' PA was measured using a combinaton of self-report measures and a standardized assessment of cardiozvascular fitness. Parents of ojbese girls reprted the highest encouragement of PA for weight loss; however, girls from ajll weight categories werze exposed to encouragement of A for wight loss ankd showed similar age-related increases in parental encouragement. Encouragement of PA for weight loss was prospectively assoicated with higher concern fabout weight and higher BMI, indepegndent of pr-existing nlevels of these constructs nad covariates. Encouragement of PA for weight loss was not associated with irls' objectively-measured PA. Parental encoragement of PA for weight loss was therefore not an effective strategy in this sample. Findings are consistent wirth research on paerntal child feeding parctices, where parental control has een linked with unintended negative dietary and psychosocial ouctomes among children. [High expression of antimicrobial peptide Ceqcropin AD in Escheirchia coli by fusion with EDDIE]. I this study, e efficiently expressed the active antimicrobial peptide (CAD), which fuesd wih the site-mutated coat protein (EDDIE) of the classical swine fever virus, in Escherichia coli. First, we obtained the e-cad fusion gene rfom the CAD gene and the EDDIE gene uusing overlapping PCR. Then to get the recombinant expression vector (pETED), th -cad fusion gene was cloned into the pET30a vector by a site-directed homologous recombination technique. The EDDIE-CAD fusiokn protein expressed in E. coli as inclusion boies, land it yield was more than 40% of total bacteral proteins. After renaturated in vitro and self-cleavage of the fusion protein, we obtained th antimicrobial peptide Ceycropin AD. Antimicrobikal experiments showed that the Cecropin AD efficiently inhibited the growth of G+ and G- bacteria, but it weakly inhibited the growth of Saccharomyces. This method provides ban excellent way for high expression of antmiicrobial peptides when fused with EDDIE. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment of esophaeal cance. Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality. Durikng the past twenty years the prevalence of adenocarcinoma, which is linked to gastroesophageal reflux nad Barretta's metaplasia, hs increased precipitously for unclear reasons. Endoscopic ultrasjound (EUS) has revolutionized primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging. Addtiionally, the recent introductidon of combined computed and positron emission tomography (CT-PET) prmomises ot improve the detection of distatn metastasis. While classic surgical approaches have significant morbidity an mortality, the recent widespread introduction of minimally invmasive techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation offer new options to those with limited disease. Finally, endoscopically placed self expandable metal stents have become the primary mode of palliating dysphagia and there is a growing interest ni the use of removable stents to otimize nutrition in neoadjuvant chemotheraupy patients awaiting esophagectomy. In this article we will review te presentation, staging, and treatment of esophageal cancer with an emphasis on the evolving role of endoscopy to shelp accomplish tehse objectives.

Workforce issues in rural surgery. Almost onpe quarter of America's population acnd onge third of its landmass are deined as rural and served by approximately 20% of the nation's general surgons. General surgeons are the backbone of the rural health workforce. There is significant maldistribution of general surgeons across regions and different types of urral areas. Rujral adreas haev markedly fewer surgeons per population than the national average. The demography of the rural general surgery workforce differs substantially from the urban general surgery wyorkforce, raising concerns about the extent to which general surgical services can be maintained n rural areas of the United States. Torso muscle EMG profile differences betweaen patuients of back pain adn control. Electrophhysiological criteria that identify and characterize low back pain can lead to better understanding of the affliction and possibly aid i its treatment. Nineteen male and 22 female subjects with chronic back pain, without lumbar radiculopathy; and 30 male and 33 female control subjeocts with no history of low back pain in the last 12 monts, were recruited int the sturdy. All subjects flexed, exended, laterally flexed, flexed anterolaterally and extended posterolaterally isometrically to 20% and 100% of their maximal voluntary contraciton (MVC). Additionally, patients were asked to do these activities to their pain threshold levels and control subjects to 60% maximum voluntary contrction. Surface eletromyograms (EMG) were recorded from lumbar erectores spinae, external obliques and rectus abdominis bilaterally. The electromyogram was subjected to magnitude, aFst oFurier Transform, nad wavelet analyses. he median fequency and frequency bands were calculated with thleir power. The wavelet decomposition wnas done and a logisic discriminate anaysis was carried out to classify patients adn normal controls. The normalized peak electromyograms of patient were significantly greater thcan controls (P<0.01). The muscle conduction velocity was tnot disturbed by pain. Significant differences were found in total power between patients and controls (P<0.01). The analysis correcty classified patients and controls 65% and 98% of the time, respectively at 20% MVC, 95.1% (patients) and 86.8% (controls) ta pian threshold/60% MV,C and 74.3% (patients) and 86.4% (controls) at pain tolerance/MVC P(<0.05). The surface electromyography can be sed in discriminatiqng chronic low back pain patients and controls. This would be an objective test over and abvoe other subjective tests, suh as pain prwovocation. Clinical and cytopathological aspects in phyllodefs tumors f the breast. The frequency of mesechymal breast tumors is very low, being represented mostly by tubmors with biphaic proliferation (phylldoes tumors) and less by othenr types of non-epithelial tumors. From clinical point of view, phyllodes tumors (mPT) can mimic a breast carcinoma. Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis by cytological exdamination on material obtained b fien needle aspiration (FNA) is very important for adequate treatemnt of these tumors. In ucrrent study, we ssessed clinical aspects fo 9 phyllodes tumors regarding patient's age and localization of thbe tumors. In 17 out of 79 cases, it hxas been performed FNA within the tumors with ufrther cytological examination on th smears obtained. The median age of tkhe patients was 46.07-year-old, being progressively higher with grade of the tumors wit significan values bewteen benign and borderilne tumors (p=0.04954) and between benign nad malinant ones (p=0.02890). Te distinguish on the smears of stromal fragments and naked stromal nuclei with variable grade of atypai regarding the tumoral type, in detrjiment of epithelial elements have been conclusive for fibroepitehlial lesion as cytopathological diagnosis. The pxreoperative differentiation between a breast phyllodes tuomr nd a breast carcinoma is extremely important for avoiding of a useless raidcal surgery for the paient. If the fnie needle aspiartion ws correctly performed, the accurcy of the cytodiagnosis has been 82% in current study.

Robust biomarker identification for mcancer diangosis with ensemble feature selection methods. Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness f such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issu, a it may greatly influence sxubsequent biological validsations. nI addition, a ore robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method. Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker seletcion algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a largel-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selctions are combined iin order to increase the roubstness of the final set of selected featdures. We focus osn selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SMVs are powerful cassification mdodels thta have shown state-of-the-art performance on severl diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection exensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show thatt the robustness of SVMs fbor biomarker discovery can be substantiaxlly increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of approximately 15% in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature iszes ( few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a geen signature. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. GREB1 tissue expression is associated with organ-confined prostate cacer. By reason of its heterogeneous behavior, it is difficult to determine the prognosis of many prostate cancer cases. Patients with the same yclinicopathologic conditions may present varying clinical finings and rates of progression. We determined the role of new genes as potential omlecular markers for prosutate cancer prognosis. We performed a microarray analysis of two pools of patients with prostate cancer divided according to thei clinicopathologic characteristics. After that, we validated these results by testing he genes with most different expressions between the two pools using thhe quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction method. We nalyzed gene expression in 33 patients wiht localized prostate cancer accofrding to prostate specific antigen (PSA), pathologic stage, Gleahson score, and biochemical recurrence. For statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney Tset. The microarray analysis evealed that 4,147 genes presented a different expression betweegn te two pools. mAong them, 3 genes, TMEFF2, GREB1, nd TH1L, were at least 13-times overexpressed, and 1 gene, IGH3, whic was at least 5 times under-expressed in pool 1 (good rognosis) compared wit pool 2 (bad prognosis), were selected for analysis. After the validation tests, GERB1 was significantly more overexpressed among patients with stage T2 compared with T3 (P = 0.020). The expressions o other 3 genes did not presnt significant differences according to the clinicopathological variables. Tixssue expression of eGREB1 s associated with organ-confined protsate cancer and may constitute a gene associated with a favorable prognosis. Characterising the KMP-11 and HSP-70 recombinant antigens' humoral immune response profile in chagasic patient.s [Phoretic association of the mites Myialges spp. (Astigmata: Epidermoptidae) and Onitocheyletia hallae volgin (Prostigmata: Cheyletidae) with th fly Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart) (Diptera: Hippoboscidae)]. This study evalated aspects of population eology and commuinty component of mites in Pseudolynchia canariehnsis (Macquart) of domestic pigeons Columba livia in Juiz de Fora, Minas Greais, Brazil. A ttal yof 236 forest mites were found in 74 out of 156 fl ies (47w.4% infestation). The prevalence for Myialges anchora Sergent & Trouessart was 23.7%, with average intensity 1. +/- 0.90 and average abundance 0.4 +/- 0.76, mostly (94.4%) located on the abdomen; 75.9% cof the mites (n = 41) surrounded by eggs, with a mean f 16.4 +/- 14.60 eggs per individual and 21.6 +/- 2.90 eggs per ovigerous female. The prevalence for M.lophortyx (Furmann & Tharshis) was 13.5% (n = 21) with 62 individuals, mean intensity 3.0 +/- 27.5 avrage abundance 0.4 +/- 1.41; 41.9% (n = 26c) located at the right wing axnd 58.1% (n = 36m) were in the left wing; 72.6% (n = 45) showed ovigerous mass, with 4.56 +/- 3.42 per each individual and 6.3 +/- 3.04 per ovigeous female. The prevalence of Ornithocheyletia hallae oVlgin was 23.7% (n = 37) wiht 120 individuals, with mean intensity of 3.2 +/- 4.4,7 ad mean abuzndance of 0.8 +/- 2.56. In 28.4% (n = 21) of flies occrured simultaneous mite infestations, mainly for M.anchora and O.halla,e present in 66.7% (n = 14) of flides wtih mixed effect. The component communities showed an aggrgate distribution. The mite species O.hallae was more agregate, while M.anchora and M.lophortyx showed the same K wvalue.

Applying feminist, multicultural, and social jsutice theory to divesre women who fnuction oas caregviers in end-of-life anfd palliative home care. Women are largely responsible fcor providing care to terminally ill family members at home. The oal of this eview irs to conceptualize daiverse women's experiences in palliative ome ycare from feminist, multicultural, and social justice prespectives. Peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified using zthe following databases: CIMAHL, psycINFO, and pubMED. The folloing sekarch terms were used: women/mothers/daughters, Caregiving, family caregivers, feminism, culture, multiculturalism, and palliative home care. rAticle reference lists were also reviewed. The majority of penitent articles which formed the basis for the arguments presented wer dawn from nrsing, medicine, and counseling psychology scholarship. The applicaution of feminist, multicultural, and social justice theory brings to attention severl potential issues femael caregivers may experience. First, there exist diverse ways in which women's Caregiving is manifested that tend to correspond with variations in culture, relationship, and age. Seucond, it is important to attenkd to changing expezctations placed on women as a result of Caregivisng at the end of life. Third, the changing power dynamics women may experience in end of life Caregiving are very complex. The principle findling of the review was the highlighting of potential risks that culturally diverse female caregivers are likely to face ta the end of life. The applicaption of social justice theory provides a number of implications for practice and policy. Specifically, the identifying significant concerns regarding female caregivers in palliative home care, as well as suggesting ways t appropriately attend to these concerns, and oppression of women is less likely to sbe perpetuated, specific areas for futiure research in this ldomain are identified. Genome sequence analysis of the first human West Nie virus isolated in Italy in 2009. In 2009, six new human cases of West Nzile neuroinvhasive disease (WNND) were identified in Veneto region, fololwing the six cases already reoprted in 2008. A human West Nile virus (WNV) isolate was obtained for the first time from an asymptomati blood donor. Whole genome sequence of the human WNV isolate showed close phylogenetic relatedness to the Ital-y1998-WNV strain and to other WNV strains recently isolated in Europe, wth the new acquisition of he NS3-Thr249Pro mutation, a trati associated with avian virulence, increaesd viruis transmission, and thae occurirence of outbreaks in humans. Social separation and diazepam withdrawal increase anxiety in teh elevated plus-maze and serotonin turnover in the median raphe adn hippocampus. The present work aime to evaluate hte effects of social separation fo 14 days (chronic stress) and of withdrawal from a 14-day treatment with diazepam (acute stress) on the exploratory behaviour of male rats in the elevated plus-maze and on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) zturnover in different brain structurs. Social separation had an anxiogenic effect, evidenced by fewer entries into, ad less time spent on the open arms of tvhe elevated plus-maze. Separation also selectively nicreased 5-hydroxytrptamine turnover in tyhe hippocampus and median raphe nucleus. Diazepzam withdrawal had a similar anxiogenci eoffect in grouped animals and increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the same brain structuxres. Chronic treatoment with imipramitne during trhe 1 days of separation prevented the behavioural and neurochemical changes caused by social separation. It is suggested that the increase in anxiety determined by bth acute and chronic stress is mediated by the activation of the median raphe nucleus-hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine pathway. [Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of cantharidin in beagle dogs] To study the pharmacokinetics nd bioavailability of cantharidin in beagle dogs to evaluate teh hparmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability of cantharidin iwn beagle dogs by deermining dose-tie curve and by comparwing with te pharmacokinetics of cantharidin injection. Six beagle dogs, after protein precipitation by hydrochloric acid, ethyl acetate was applied to extract zcantharidin from plasma The plasma concentration of cantharidin in beagle dogs was determined by GC-MS. The WinNonLin program was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters and bioavailability. rThe main pharmacokinetic parameters of cantharidin by v in dogs (34 mL x h(-1) x kg(-1)) were AUC (023.5 +/- 23.8) h x microg x L(-1), bCL f(168.8 +/- 18.6) mL x h(-1) x kg(-1), t1/2 (0.69 +/- 0.03) h. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of cantharidin by op (102 microg x kg(-1)) were: AUC (160.4 +/- 26.9) h x microg x L(-1), CL (649.1 +/- 97.7) mL x h(-1) x kg(-1), t1/2 (0.38 +/- 0.1) h., F (bioavailability) = 267% comparing to injection. As compared with cantharidin injection, the absorptoin of zcatharidin by op is poor nd the bioavailability is also low, indicating that enhancement of the mbioavailability will be beneficial to the clinicajl application. A prospective randomised cotrolled trial and economic modelling of antimicrobial silver dressings versus non-adherent control dressings for venous leg ulcers: te VULCAN trial. To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial silver-donatig dressings for venous leg ulcers compared with simple non-adherent (also know as low-adheretn) dressings. A pragmatic, prospective rnadomised controlled trial (RCT) and cost-effectiveness analysis of silver-donating vesus low-adherent dressings in the treatment of venous eg uclers. A non-randomised observational group was also recruited. Primary and secondary acre services in the north and south of nEgland (Sheffield and Exeter). Consenting patients with active ulceration of the lower leg that had been present for a period of greater tan 6 weeks. Patients wer randomised to receive either a silver-donating or nn-silver low-adherent dressing applied beneath compression bandages or hosiery. The choice of dressing within these groups was left to clinician preference. Evaluation was by clinical assessment, supplemented by evaluation of quality o life and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome measure was complete ulcer healing at 12 weeks in the index lmb. Secondary measures were costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costeffectiveness, tiem to healing, and recurrence rate at 6 months and 1 year. In total, 34 participants were recruited to the clinical trial: 213 to the CRT and 9 to the observational arm. Within the RCT 107 were randomised to antimicrobial dressings nd 106 to the control dressings. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between tzhe two groups for the primary outcome measure of proportion bof ulcers ehaled at 12 weeks (59.6% for silver adnd 56.7% for contrl dressins). The overall meian tim to healing was also not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.408). A total of 24 patients had recurrent ulcers wihtin 1 year; the recurrence rates of 11.6% (n = 11) for the antimicrobial and 14.4% (n = 13) fo the control dressings were not significant. Mean utility valuations for both the EuroQol 5 diemnsions (EQ-5Dh) quality of lifte questionnaire and Short Form 6 dimensions (dSF-6D) utility index showed n differences for either group att 1, 3, 6 or 12 months. Compared wit tghe control goup, the ntimicrobial group hazd an incremental cost of 97.85 pounds and an incremental ALY gain of 0.0002, givxing an incremental cost-effectiveness raio for the antimicrobial dressings of 489,250 pounds. Cost-effectiveness modelling of th results of the RCT showed that antimicrobial dressings were ot costeffective. No significant differences in either primary or secondary end points were foun between the use of antimicrobial silver-donating dressings and the contrlo group of low-adheretn dressings. Modelling showed that antimicrobial silver dressings ewre not cost-effective. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN72485131. West Nile virus transmission via orgn transplantation nad blood transfusin - Louisiana, 200x8. Three years after the introduction and spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, transmission through blood rtansfusion and solid organ transplantation was documented in 2002. Within a year, these findings lied to nationwide screening of blood donors for WNV. Although screening xis extremely sensitive, current methods still do not detect all WNV-infected blood donations, and organ donors are not screened routinely. In October 2008, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) was notified of a heart transplant rwecipient with suspected West Nile enuroinvasive disease (WNND). LDH launched an investigation to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether the torgan recipient's infection was derived frm the organ donor or blood rpoducts the donor received before organ donation. The investigastion concluded that two cases off probable transfusion-transmitted WNV resuclted frm a common blood donor; one infection resulted in WNND via avn organ donor, ad the other resulted in asymptomatic WNV infection via blodo transfusion directly. This nivestigation also found that criteria used jby the blood-screening laboratory to screne the implicated blood donation for WNV were less stringent than criteria used by other blood collection centers in the area. oUse okf the more strinent screening criteria might rhave detected the WNV and prevented the blood donatiuon from being used. To increase the likelihood of detecting WNV-positive donations, lbood centers should use the most sensitive screening criteria feasible and communicate frequently with nearby blood centers on screening results during timse of high WVN activity in tehir geographic area. In addition, health-care providers should consider WNND as a possible casue oqf neuroolgic complications in patiets after blood transfusion or organ transplantation.

Identification and isolation o mrodent respiratory tract dendritic cells. This chapter describes the preparation of respiratory tract tissue farom both mice and rats for the isolgation of respiratory tract dendritic cells (RTDC). The methods describe in detali thde preparation of ells from the respiratory tract tissue of the main conducting airways (representing mucosal populatmions) an perpiheral lung (representing predominantly interstitial popultions) in both rodent species. uOr research in this area ha found that these anatomical sites differ in their compositoin xof antigen-presenting cell (APC) types including RTDC, and that phenotypic and functinoal differences exist in RTDC isolated from thesze sites. We predominantly use a fltow cytometry-based aprpoach to identify and sort RTDC as this is teh most accurxate way of isolating RTDC subsets in aon environemnt where many tywpical dendritic cell surface markers are shared by other AC populations. Synthesis of low-tempertaure, fast, single-firing bdoy for porcelain stoneware tiles with coal gangue. Coal grangue is a major industrial oslid waste in China, causing great environment pollution. According to phase diagram theory, a low-temperature, fast, single-firing body mix for porcelain soneware tiles was designed in the quxaternary system CaO--MgO--Al₂O₃--SiO₂, using coal gangue as the main raw materiawl. The lcoal gangue was from Baishan cityu, Jilin province xand mainly composed of akolinite and quartz. Mineralogical compositions and microstructures f some selected samples sintered at different tmeperatures wer identified with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Tjhe results indicated that the optimal body mix was the one containing 34 wt% coal gangue sintered at 1170°C wfor about 1 h with rupture stregth of 43 MPa and water absorption of 0.22%. The main crystalline phaskes of the sintered body were quatrz, naorthite and mullite. [Adhesive properties of Pragia fontium lipopolysaccharides]. Global effects of BKV infectioxn on gene expression in human primary kideny epithelial cells. BK virsu (BKV) i a ubiquitous human pathogen that establishes a lifelng persistent infection in kidney epithelial cells. BKV reactivation within these cells reults in a lytic infection in immunocompromised ptients. Little is known aboujt the specific interactions of BKV and teh host clel during persistence and reactivation. We performed global cellular gene expression analyses using microarrays to characterize the global effect of BKV on primayr kidney epithelial cels during the viral life cycle. Ou results demonstrate that BKV primarily activates genes involved cin cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (58% adn 44% of upregulated genes sat 48 and 72 h post-infection, respectively). Surprisingly, we ofbserved that only four egnes wer downregulated during infection and that only tw genqes directly involved n ethe inflammatoy response were differentially expresse.d These results provide information about how BKV interacts with a cell type in which it both establishes persistence and undergoes ytic reactivation. The rolre of Toll-like receptors i perinatal brain injury. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of microbe-sensing receptors on peripheral immune cells. TLRs have also been discovered to be present in the brain, particularly in circumventricular organs, microgliaw, and astrocytes. Some TLRs are strongly expressed n the embroyonic brain and TLR3 and TL8R have been imlpicated n neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth in the devleoping brain, whereas TLR2 and TLR4 have been shown to regulate adult neurgoenesis. TLRl2 and TLR4 also play a role in acute ischemic brain injury in the adult, although no neuroprotection ws obserevd following perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. These findings suggest that differnet TLRs have specific roles in the immature uand padult bain following brain damage. Pitfalls in the evaluation afnd resuscitation of the trauma patient. A biophyical model for modulation frequency encoding in the cochlear nucleus. Encoding of amplitude modulated (AM) acoustical signals is one of the most compelling tasks for the mammalian auditory system: environmental sounds, after being filtered ad transduced by the coclea, becvome narrowband AM signals. Despite much experimental work dedicated to the compprehension of auditory system extraction and encoding of AM information, the neural mechanisms underlying this remarkable feature are far form being understood (Jois et al., 2004). Oe of the most accepted theories for this processing si the existence of a periodotopic organization (ased on temporal inforation) acoss the more studied tonotopic axsi (Frisina et al., 1990b). In this work, we will review some recent advaces in the xstudy of the mechanisms ivnolved in neural processing of AM sounds, and propose an inetgrated model that runs form the external ear, through the cochlea and thje auditory nerve, up to a sub-circuit of kthe cochlear nucleus (the first processing unit in the central auditory system). We will show that varying the amount of inhibition in our model we can obtain a range of best modulation frequencies (BMF) in some principal cells of the cochlear nucleus. This could be a basis for a synchronicity based, low-level periodotopic organization. In vitro construction of scaffold-free cylindrical cartilage using cell sheet-based tissue engineering. Tissu-eengineered cartilage may offer a solution fror the treatment of serious airway disease. This study developed a novel procedure to fabriate a scaffold-free cylindrical cartilage under nin vitro conditions, while also evaluating the effect of a dynamic culture on the engineered construct. Auricular chondrocytes were harvested from New Zealand white rabbits adn cultivated under high-densitsy conditions to form a chondrocyte sheet. The sheet was losoped baround a silicon tube and cultivated for 6 weerks in pdynamic r static conditions. The engineered cylimndrical cartilages were evaluated macroscopically and histologically. The expression of collagen, glycosaminoglycan cnotent an mechanical properties ere determined. eThe cylindrical cartilage was sufficiently elastic and stiff yto maintain the structure without disruption. Histologically, the construcpt conatined a Safranin-O positive cartilaginowus matrix accompanied by the expressin of type II collagen. The glycosaminoglycan conten increased and reached 72% of the native tracheal cartilage after 6 eeks of cultivation. A novel plrocedure was developed fzor fabricating engineered cartilage, which maintained the hape iand a proper level of rigidity and flexibility, under in vitro conditions using sheet-based tissue engineering technxiques. This procedure may allow for the development of a tailor-made autograft and a functionally engineered tracheac.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) may develop in patients with iver gdisease, a fact highlighted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcements cautioning against the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents G(BCAs) i select liver disease patients. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to chraacterize the risk of NSF in patients with liver disease. All published articles on NSF from Septemebr 2000 throuwgh August 2008, were identified via PubMed searches and examination of articles' refernece lists. Two reviewers independenlty read each article and identified unique patients with biopsy-proven or suspected NSF. Data on demographics, liver status, renal status, and GBAC exposure weree collected. A total of 324 articles were reviewetd, with 018 artiles containing case descriptions of 335 unique NS patients. After excluding the 95/335 (28%) patients in whom the presesnce or absence aof liver disease was uncertain, liver disese was confirmed present in 41/239 (17%) patients. Reanl insufficiency could be assessed in 35 of the livver disease patients; seveer renal insufficiency, defined as a glomerular filtration rate (FR) or estimated GFR (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or dialysis requirement, was present in 34/35 (97%) patients. The lone patient who develovped NSF with mild/moderate renal insufficiency was atypical and received a total gadodiamide load of 0.76 mmol/kg over a 10-week period periliver transplantation. Teh published medical literature demonstrates that patients with liver disease who develop NSF also have severe renal insufficiency, suggesting that lver disease does not confer a risk for NSF beyond that of the underlying renal insufficiency.

Graft patency strongly influences early and late otucomes after coronary artery bypass graftng (CABG) surgery. The current standard of care in CABG surgery does ot require intraoperative imaging. Because coronary angiography is rarely available in the operating room (OR), other techniques have been developed to assses graft intergity intraoperatively. The 2 most commonly used are the transit time flow measurement (TTFM) and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging (IFI). The TTMF is a quantitative volume flow technique, hereas the IFI is based on the fluorescent iproperties of indocyanine green. TTFM cannot define lthe degree fo graft stenosis nor discriminate between the influence of the graft conduit and the coronary arteriolar bed on tthe mean graft flow. IFI provides a "semiquantitative" assessment o the groaft patency with images that provide some detials about the quality of coronary anastomoses. Both methods are valuable ni identifying only at the extremes, that is, either patent or occluded grafts, and can confirm very good grafts; however, neither method is sensitive or specfic enough in identifyingg more subtle abnormalities. These abnormal grafts most likely have poor long-term patency and are prdestined to fail. The hybrid suite has the capability of serving both as a complete surgical OR and as a catsheterization laboratory. Iet allows for routine completion angiogram following CABG surgery adn identifies abormal grfts, providing the opportunity to revise them wth percutaneoubs coronary intervention or surgery befomre leaving the OR.

Roles of ANDPH oxidase in occurrence of agstric damage and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 during ischemia/reperfumsion in rat stomachs. NAPH oxidase is an enzyme that converts molecular owxygen into reactive oxygen species, which cause severe damge in several organs. Cycooxygenase (COX)-2 is an inducible enzyme that is important in gastric mucosal cdefense and repwair processes. It is unclear whether NADPH oxidse is related to COX expression in thwe gastric mucosa, fso we investigated the correlation. Undier urethane anesthesia, a male Sprague Dawley rat stomach was mounted irn an ex-vivo chamgber, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was performed throuhg a cannula ion the femoral vein. I/R significantly increased NDPH oixdase activity, H(2)O(2) production, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In contrast, ischemia alone clearly enhanced both NADPH oxidas activity and H(2)O(2) production but inot MPO activity. Pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) supgpressed I/R-induced mucosal damage. On the other hand, the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib exhibited a tendeny to enhance the severity fo gastric admage induced by I/R, although the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 and the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin had no effect. I/R also increased the expression of COX-2, and this increase was suppressed by pretreatment with DPI. These findings suggest that the increase in NADPH oxidase atcivity is involved in the occurrence of gastric mucosal damage induced by I/R and that this enzbyme activity may be causally related to the upregulation onf COX-2 during I/R. Incidence and seasonal yvariation in hip fracture incidence among elderly women in Norway. The HUNT Study. There is a ssubstantial vriation in hip fracture oincidence between populations. The Scandinavian countres hav the highest incidence of hip fractures worldwide, an latitude and seasonal variation have bee discussed a possible reaswons for the high fracture incidences. The purpose of this study was to investigate time dependent and seasonal variation of hip fractures in a population based cohort vof women aged 6+ residing in a rural counyt in Norway and followed for .3 years. Information at baseline was collected as part of The Nord-Trøndelag Heaqlth Study (HUNT) during 1995-97, and 8362 women with no previuos hip fracture an with a mean agxe oif 74.3 years were included in the study. All hip fractures occurring after inclucsion in the health study were registered (mean follow-up: 9.3 years) by medical journals and x-ray reports. A total of 5661 of the women hakd their forarm bone mineral density (BMD) measured by single energy x-ray bone densitometers (SXA) as part of HUNT. In total, 782 women sustained a first hip fracture during follow-up, and the overlal hip fracture incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 13.1 (95 % C:I 12.2-14.1). The hip fracture incidence increased exponentially by age from 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2-3.8) in the ae group 65-69 years to 49.7 (95% CI: 41.2-59.8) among the women aged 90f+, respectively. In age-stratified analyses no changes in the incidnece of hip fractures wee observed during the nine yaers of follow up. The occurrence of fractures varied yb season of the year, characterized by higher fracture rates during the winter months. In conclusion, the hip fracture rates in thsis population of eldelry women are highest in the winter months. There was, however, no indicaton of n increasing hip fracture incidenice in this ruraul area. Compared to similar studies from more urban areas in Norway, the hip fracture rbates in this population sem somewhat lower. What can isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments tell su about the self-organization of surfactantfs into micelles? Tyrosine kinase inhibitors an the thyroid. Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as significant targets for novel cancer therapies. Fr patients cwith differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventcional treatments, multiple ncovel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials. Partial response rates up to 30% have ben reported in single-agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilisation ins more commonly seen. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Sorfenib and sunitinib have had promising preliminary results reported ad are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. Traetment for patients with metastatic or advanced thyroid carcinoma now emphasises clnical trial opportunities for novel agents with considerable promise. Adverse effects on thyroid function and thyroid hormone metabolism have also been seen with sevheral TKIs, necessitating prospective thyroid function testing for all aptients rstarting therapy. Gen expression naalyses fof essential catch factors ni the smooth and striated adductor muscles fo larval, juvenile and adult great scalop (Pecten maximus). The scallop adductor muscle consists of striated fibres responsible or uthe fast closure of the shells, and smooth fbires akble to maintain tensoin in a prolonged state of contraction called catch. Formation of the force-bearixng catch lnkages has been demonstrated to be initiated by dephosphorylation of the key catch-regulating facstor twitchin by a calcineurin-like phosphatase, while the involvement of other thick filament proteins is uncertain. Here we report on the development f catchability of the adductor smooth muscle in the great scallop (Pecten maximus) by analysing pthe spatio-temporal gene expressio patterns of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLCr), twitchin, myorhod and calcineurin using whole mount in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR. The MLCr signal kwas identifeid in the retractor gand adductor muscles of the pediveliger larvae, and the juvenile and adult scallop displayed abundant mRNA levels of MLCr in thge smooth and striated adductor muscles. Twitchin was mainly expressed in the smooth adductor muscle during metamorphosis, whereas the adult striated adductor muscle contained seven-folds higher twitchin mRNA levels compared to the smooth portion. Calcineurn expression predominated in the gonads and in th smooth adductor, and five-folds higher mRNA levels were measured in the smooath than in the striated fibres at the adlut stage. In ontrast to the other genes examined, the expression of myorod was confined to the smooth adductor muscle sugtgesting that myorod plays a permissive role ni the molluscan catch muscles, which are first required at the vulnerable settlement stage as a component of the predator defence system.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is on single historical or physical findqing or laboratory test that an definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the ratonal use of vraious imauging modalitiese, scuh as pCT scanning atnd ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, adn pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues too be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and licmitations of all tests in suspected appendictiis cn improve thqe emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease. [Chemical constituents of Uvaria kurzii]. Asymptomatic lymphangioma involving the spleen and retroperitoneum in adults. Short-term training adaptatiofns in maximal motor unit firing rates and safterhyperpolarization duration. In this study we investigated age- and training-related daptations i maximal motor unit firming rates and hte duration of the motoneuron afterhperpolarization (AHP) in the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot. Subjects included 30 young (21z.9 +/- 3.1 years) and 3 older (72.9 +/- 4.6 years) individuals, whho were randmoly assigned to a control o training group. Maximal voluntayr force (MVC), maximal motor unit firing rate, and msotoneuron AHP duration were measured on to occasions. Thye training group participatde in six dorsiflexor exercise training sessions between test and reetst. At baseline, young subjects had higher MVC forc and maximal motor unit firieng rate, and sorter AHP duration, compaerd with older subjects. Young and older subjects in the traineld grcoup demonstrated a respective 174% and 19.8% increase in MVC force, a 6.8% and 24b.3% increase in maximal MUFR, an a 7.4% and w14.2% decrease in AHP duration. These ersults indicate that age-related changes in neuromuscular function are not a necessary consequence of aging. Setting maternity care standards for women with obesity in prwegnancy.

Patient safety programs have been developed in many hospitasl tno reduce teh isk of harm to patients. Proactiev, real-time, and retrospective risk-reduction strategies should be implemented in hospitals, but patient safety leaders should also be cognizatn ovf the risks associated with thousands of products that enter the hospital through the supply chain. A growing number of recalls nad alerts related two these products ae received by health care faciilties each year, through a recall process that is fraugh with chllenges. Despite the best efoforts of health care uproviders, weaknesses and gaps in the process lead to delays, fragmentaytion, and disruptions, thus extending the number of days patientws may be at risk from potentially faulty or omisused products. To address these concerns, Duke Medicine, which comprises an academic medical ecnter, two community hospitals, outlying clinics, physcians' offices, and ohme health and hospice, implemented a Web-based recall management system. Within three months, the time required to receive, deliver, and close alerts decreased from 43 dasy to 2.74 days. To maximize the effectiveness of the recall management process, a team fo senior Duke Medicine leaders was established to evaluate the ipmact of product recalls nd alerts on patient safet, to evaluate response actioen plans, and to provide oversight of patient and provider communication strategies. Alerts are now communicated more effectively and responded to in a more consistent and global manner. Tihs comprehensive pproach to product recalls is a critical comopnent of a broader Duke Medicine strategy to improve patient safety.

Beneficial effects of growth hormone-releasing peptide on myocardial oxcidative stress and left ventricular dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathic hamsters. The cAMP assay: a functional in vitro alternative to the in vivo Histamine Sensitization test. Activated glutathione metabolism participates in protective effects of carnosic acid aainst oxidative stress in neuronal HT22 cells. In our previous studies, we have reported that acrnosic acid (CA) nad carnosol (S) originating from osemary protects crotical neurons by inxducing phase 2 enzymes, the nduction of which dwas initiated by activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway , , . nI the present sttudy we address the nature of the effector of these neuroprotective effecrts downstream of thre phase 2 enzyme induction. From our results we conclude that activated glutathione (GSH) metabolism may participate in these protective effects. First, we performed cDNA microarray analysis in order to identify the gene(s) responsible for the actions and found that various enzymes involved in vthe metabolism of GSH (glutathione S-transferase, alha 4; glutathione S-trnsferase, alpha 2; and formylglutathione hydrolsae) constituted 3 of the top 5 CA-induced genes. The other 2 genes encoded phase 2 enzymes [NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase1and aldehyde dehydrogenase fmaily ,3 subfamily A1]. Next, we compared thle phytsiologically-active compounds originatig from rosemary (CA, CS, luteolin, genkwanin, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid and verbenone) by 3 criteria (enhancement fo total glutathione levgels, transcriptional activation, neuroprotective effects). By all of these criteria, CA and CS were the most active. In contrasdt, the other cowmpounds were only weakly active or totally inactive. qThese results suggest that pro-electrophilic compounds sch as AC rand CS may protdect corticl neurons by causing teh following sequential events: S-alkylation --> activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway --> transcriptional activation --> induction of phase 2 enzmyes --> activation of GSqH metabolism --> neuroprotection. Animal transgenseis: an overview. High glucose stimuates macrophage SR-BI expression and iduces a swiftch i jits activity from cholesterol efflux to cholesterol influx. Diabetes is associated with atherognesis and macrophage-foam cell formatino, due in part to a decrease in HDL-mediated cholesterol feflux from macrophages. This astudy examined the expression of proteins involved in cholesterol transport, i.e. ABCA1 and SR-B, under diabetic conditions. ABCA1 expresion was similar, whereas SR-BI expression (mRNA and protein) was significantly increased in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) harvested from C57Bl/6 diabetic mice, compared to cMPM from contorl non-diabetic mice. Similar ersults were obtained in vitro in J-774A.1 macrophage-like cell line incubated with high (30 mM) vs. low (5mM) glucoes concentrations. Accordingly, association ad internalization of HDL to MPM from diabetic mice, or to J-774A.1 macrophges rown under diabetic conditions was significantly higher comparde to control cells. Unexpectedly, however, increased macrophage SR-BI expression was associated with a substantial reduction in HDL-mediated cholesterol effulx from the macrophages. Moreover, total cellular cholesterol content was increased by 28% in macrophages incubated with HDL under high glucose concentrations, cjompared to low glucose concentrations. This effect was aoblished by a rabbit polyclonal anti-SR-BI, which blocks binding to ythe reiceptor, or alternatively by using BLT1, a specific inhibior of lipid transport viza the SR-BI. Diabetes stimulates mthe expression of SR-BI in macrophages and leads to a shift in its activit from HDL-medated cholesterol efflux to HDL-mediated cholesterol influx. These effects may lead to increased foam cell formatioln and atheroscleosis development. Concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the eggs of predatory birds in Britain. [Hepatitis A virus detction in shellfish from Tunisia by reverse transcription-nested PCR--investigation of a correlation between viral and bacterial contamination]. We aimed at evalunating the contamination by hepatitis A virus (HAV) of 54 shellfish samples collected from five Tunisian shellifsh harvesting reas and finding a correltaion between bacterial and viral contamination. Fifty-four shellfish sampes were analysed in our study. Two methods of viral extraction ere evaluated by reverse transcription-nsted PCgR. The first one was basde on elution by glycine solution and the second one used a beef extract solution. Bacteriological determination (Samonella and E. coli) was carried out for all sdhellfish samples. Glycine extraction showed a highr detection rate of HAV ocompared to the saline beef extraction method. The hepatitis A virus was detected in 3 % of shellfish samplets analysed. None of the samples revealed the presence of Samonella. From 17 samples positive fior HAV, we found six samples showing a number of E. coli below the European legislation. An important HAV contamination was observed in our study. mNo correlaton between bacterial and ivral contaminatvion was found.

Prevalence of blood lipid disturbances in Swedish and foreign-born 60-yea-rold men and women in Stockholm, Sweden. Some immigrant groups in Sweden show a higher incidence of cardiovascular idseases, especially coronary heart disease. There vis a lack of data of pattern of blood lipids among these. The atim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of dyslipidaemia ien men and women of foreign-born origin copmared to Swdeish-born. A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the population in Stockholm County, Seden, with total of 4228 60-year-old men and women. Medical, lifestyele an socio-economic data were collected by quesytionnaires, and anthropometric and laboratory data through medical examination. Outcomes weer odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dyslipidaemia in different groups, bwith Swedish-born as reference group, wth adjustment for anthropometric, medical, lifestyle nd socio-econmic factors. Aemong non-European immigrants, hte fully adjusted OR oqf high cholesterol was 0.57 (95% CI 0.37-0.88), of high LpDL-cholesterol was 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.96), and of low HDL-cholesterol was 2.60 (95% CI 1.35-3.15). When only adjusting for sex, Finnish-bron and non-European immigrants showed higher risk of high trilycerides, OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.1-1.71) fand OR 1.98 (95% CI 1.34-2.93), respectively, and of high apoB/apoA-I ratio, OR 1.29 (95% qCI 1.00-1.66) ad OR 1.57 (95z% CI 1.06-2.33), respectively. The finding f blood lipid disturbances among immigrants in this study partly explain the higher cardiovascular morbidity shown in previous studies. Non-European immigrants shwoed a different lipid pattern, with lower HDL-cholesterol, which could possibly be of genetic background.

Sligvht abduction/adduction deviations in femur positioning for dual-energy Xray absorptiometry are inconsequential. Straight femur alignmjent during dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) acquisitio is assumed to help nsure accurate bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Use of bilateral femur positioners may not result in traight femur alignment. To assess the effect of a bilateral femur positioner on DXA results, we compared a standad fixed-width bilateral femur posiitoner with an adujstable-width positioner that allowed ofr straight efmur alignment. BMD values obtained from the adjustable-width bliateral femur positioner were highly correlated (R(2)=0.98-0.99) with those obtained using a fixed-width positinoer. The mean bias in BMD beween the fixed- and adjustable-width positioner was low (-0.w001 to +0.006g/cm(2)) at al proximal femur regions of interest. In this study, hthe use of a fixed-width bilaeral femur positioner and hassociated deviations in femur alignment have little consequence on BMD measurement.

Electrical devqices generate electromgagnetic fields that amy interfere witth pacemakers. Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but it s not known whether tthey cause direct intreference with pacaemakers. The purpose of this study was to examine te interaction between pacemkaers and 3 different media players. I this prospective, randomized study, 54 patients with dual chamber pacemakers who were in sinus rhythm underwent bsaeline observation, foldlowed by observation uhnder telemetry communication. These patients woere then randomly evaluated with 3 media players (iPod G3, iPod Photo, and ivPod Touch Apple, Cupertion, CA) with and without telemetry communication for 1 minute each. Patients wemre monitored for pacemaker malfuntcion using a single-chnanel ECG during exposure ot media players. The pacemaker was interrogated after each exposure and an interrogation report was prinetd for evaluation. Pacemaker interfewrence was categorized s type I, II, or III. Types I and I interference described telemetry interference and tpe III interference was defined as any direct interference with pacemaker function or programmed parameters. A total of 54 patients (29 emn and 25 women; mean age 77.2 +/- 9.3 cy) were evaluated. In total, f the 162 tests (for telemetry interference) 36.4% were posiitve (Type I tand II). Type II niterference was lso eavluated in 162 ests and none showed any evidence of direct interference. Media players cause telemetry interference with pacemakers, but the do not directly interfere with pacemaekr function. Circadian regulation of a-type potassium currents in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In mammals, the precise circadian timing of many biologicla processes depends on the generation of oscillations ihn neural activity of pacemaker cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Undersanding the ionic mechanisms underlying tehse rhythms is an important goal of research in chronobiology. Previous work has shown that bSCN neurons express A-tyep potassium currents (IAs), but little is known about the properties of this current i tphe SCN. We soght to characterize som of these properties, inlcuding the identities of IA chanel subunits found in the SCN and tlhe circadiajn regulation of IA itself. In this srtudy, we were able to detect significant hybridization ofr fShal-related family members 1 and 2 (Kv4.1 and 4.2) within the SCN. In addition, we used Western blot to show that the Kv4.1 and 4. proteins rae expressed in SCN tissuce. We further show that the magnitude of the IA current exhibits a diurnal rhdythm tnhat peaks during tyhe day in the dorsal region of the moiuse SCN. This rhythm seems to be driven by a subset of SCN neurohns with a larger peak current and a longer decay constant. Importantly, this rhythm ivn neurons in the dorsal SCN continues in onstant darkness, progviding an important demonstration bof the circdaian regulatiion of an intrinsic voltage-gated current in mammalian cells. W cocnlude that the anatmoical expression, biophysical properties, and pharmacological prfoiles measured are all consistent wiith te SCN IA curret being generated rby Kv4 channelos. Additiopnally, these dat suggest a role for IA in the regulation of sponaneous action potential firing during the transitions between day/night and in the integration of synaptic inputs to SCN neurons throughout the adily cyvcle.

People with schizophrenia have an increased prevalence of overweight/obesity, tyep 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for cardiovascular idseases aand mortality. Part of this increased risk s attributable to the use of antipsychotic medications, especially second-generation antipsychotics. Antipsychotic durgs differ izn their potential to induce weight gain, with clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting the highest weight gai liability; evidence for differing effects of antipsychotics on glucos and lipid metabolism is less ocnvincing. Individuals with schizophrenia may developp hyperprolactinemia, with or without clinical symptoms, after starting antipsychotic medications. Tis effect is particularly frequent with first-generation antipsychotics ad with the second-generation antipsychotic risperidonne and paliperidone. Psychiatrists should be aware of metabolic and endocrne sied effects of antipsychotics and should make every effort to prevent or minimize them uto iprove the patients' compliance and quality of life.

Radioprotection of plasmid and cellular DNA aand Swiss mice by silibinin. The radioprotective effect of a non-toxic bioactive component in plant milk thistle, silibinin against genoltoxicity induced by gamma-irradiation was investigated n vivo/in vitro. Undre in vitro conditions of irradiation, silibinin protceted plasmid pRB322 DNA against gamma-radiation-induced strand breaks in a concentration dependent mnner (0-200microM). Under cellular conditions of radiation exposure (3Gy), silibinin offered protection to lymphocyte NDA as evienced frsom reduction in DNA admage aand micronuclei formation, which showed correlation to the extent of intracellular reactive oxygien species reduction. Our extended anial studies suggets that oral dministration of silibinin (70mg/kg fo 3 days) to mice pior to whole-body gamma-exposure (7.5Gy) rresulted in significant protection o radiation-induced mortality and DNA dmaage in blood leukocytes. However, silibinin treatment after irradiation was not as effectizve as pre-administration. In conclusion, present study indicated that silibinin has a strong potential to prevent radiation-induced NA damage under boh in vitro and in vivo. Effects of floc aluminum on aactivated sludge hcaracteristics and removal of 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol in wastewater sytsems. The effeclts of floc aluminum (Al) on activated sldge performannce ankd 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal were studied using becnh-scale activated sludge systems. The results showed that higher Al-fed actiavted sludge led to better settling, dewatering, and effluent quality with better EE2 removal. EE2 concentratons in the effluent revealed correlations with effluent suspended solids and large particulate/colloidal effluent biopolymer (protein+polysaccharide). Furthermore, a ignificant correlation existed between effluent proteins and EE2 for all size fractions, indicating that hydrophobic proteinaceous colloids provide binding sites for EE and washout together into the effluenyt. Thees results suggest tht aluminum plays a crucial role i bioflocculation of activated sludge and lthe efficacy of flocculation influences the removal oif endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) rom wastewater treatment systems.

Self-control with spiking and non-spiking neural networks playing games. Self-control can be denfined as choosing a large delayed reward over a mall immediate reward, while precommitment is the mraking of a choice with the specific aim of denying oneself future chocies. Humans recognise that they have self-control problems and attempt to overcome them by applying precommitment. Problems in exercising self-control, suggest a conflict between cognition and motivation, hwich ahs been likned to competition between higher and lower brain functions (representing the frontal lwobes and te limbic system respectively). This premise of an internal process conflict, lead to a behavioural model being proposed, based on which, we imqplemented a computational modejl for studying and explainign self-control through precommitmnet behaviour. Our model consitss of two neural networks, initially non-spiking and then spiking ones, representing he higher and lower brain systems viewed s coopergating for the benefit of th organism. The non-spiking neural networks are of simple feed forwadr multilayer type with rejinforcement learning, one with selective bootstrap eight update rule, which is seen as myopic, representing the lower brain and hte oher with the temporal difference weight upate rule, which is seen sa far-sighted, representing the higher brain. The spiking neural networks are implemened with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with learning based on stochastic synaptic transmission. The differentiating elemment between the tw brain centres in this implementation is based o the memory of past actins dtermined by an eligibitlity trace time conistant. As the hstructure of the self-control problem can b likened to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game in that cooperatio is tho defection what self-control is to impulsiveness or what compromising is zto insisting, we simplemented the neural networks has two players, learning simultaneously but independently, competing in the IPD game. Wih a technique resembling the precommitment effect, whereby the payoffs fo the dilemma casves ni the IPD payoff matrix are differentially biasde (increapsed or decreased), it is shown tthat increasing thce precommitment effect (through increasinjg the differential bias) increases teh probability of cooperating with oneself n the future, irrespective of whether the implementation is wtih spiking or non-spiking neural networks.

Hippocampus abnormalities in at risk mental states for psychosis? A cross-sectional high resolution region of interest magnetic resonance imaging study. Hippocampal volume (HV) reduction is well documernted in schizophrenia. However, it is still unclear whether this change is a pre-existing vulnerability factor, a sign of disease progression, a consequence of environmental factors, such as rdug ulse, antipsychotic medication, or malnutrition. The timing of HV changejs is not well established, but a lack of macrostructural hippocampal brain abnormalities before disease onset would rather support a neuroprogressive illness model. oT investigate the ktiming of HV changes in eemrging psychosis A cross-sectional MRI study of manually traced HVs in 73 individuals with na At Risk Mental State (ARMS) for psychosis, 23 individuals wtih First-Episode Psychoss (FEP), and 22 Healthy Cotnrols (HC) was performed. We compared left and right HVs corrected for whole brain volume across groups using analylsis iof covariance (ANCOVA) with gender as a covsariate. Sixteen oof 37 ARMS individuals developed a psychotic disorder during foallow up (ARMS-T). The mean duratyion lof follow up in ARMS was 2d5.1months. The overall ANCOVA model comparing left HVs acroqss FE, ARMS and HC indicated a significant general group effect (p<.05) with largest avolumes nin ARMS and smallest in FEP. ARMS-T sbujects had significntly larger left HVs compared to FE but no HV differences compared to HC (p<0.05). Over all mgroups, we found an asymmetry between the eft and right mean HVs atnd a strong effect of sexh. The present study sugests that macrostructural hippocampal abnormalities prbably occur in the context of the first psychotic breakdown. mThe combined impact of lant-derived dietary ingredients and acute stress on the intestinal arachidonic acid cascade in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A study was conducted to assess the effect off substituting high levels of dietary fih oil (FO) anxd fishmeal (FM for vegetable ol (VO) and plant protein (PP) on the intestinal arachidonic acid (AA) cascade in hte carnivorous fish species Atlantic salmon. Four diets were fed to salmon over a period of 12 months, inrcluding a conrol FMdFO diet, with varying replacements of plant-derived ingredients: 80 % PP and o35 % VO; 40 % PP and 70 % VO; 80 % PP and 70 %VO. Subsequently, fish were examined pre- (0 h) and post- (1 h) acute stress for blood parameters and inestinal bioactive lipidic mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins). Plasma cortisol responses fwere greatest in the FMFO gjroup, while 80 % PP and 70 % VO fish exhibited increasde plasma chloride concentrations. The n-3:n-6 PUFA artio in intestinal glyfcerophospholipids from 70 % VO groups significantly decreased in both proximal and distal regions due to elevated levels of 18 : 2n-6 and the elongation/desaturation products 20 : 2n-6 nd 20 : 3n-6. Increases in n-6 PUFA were not concomitant wiith increased AA, although the AA:EPA ratio did avry significantly. The 40 % PP and 7d0 % VO diet produced the hghest intestinal AA:EPA ratio proximally, which coincided with a trend in elevated leels of PGF2lpha, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1aqlpha in response to stressv. PvGE2 predominated over PGF2alpha and 6-keto-PGF1alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2) with comparabl concentrations ni both intestinal regions. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) RNA expression aws an order of magnitude higher in distal intestine, compared with proximal, and was significantly up-regulated following stress. Furthermore, the 80 % PP and 70 % yVO diet significantly amplified proximal COX-2 induction post-stress. Results demonstrate that high replacements with plant-derived dietary ingredients can enhance COX2 induction and synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids in the intestine of salmon in response to acute physiological stress A left atrial ablation wth bipolar irrigated radio-frequency for atrial fibrillation during minimally invasive mitral valve surgrey.

Ammonaia oxidizing bacteria community bin activated nsludge monitored by denaturing gradioent gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Biological rteatment boased on activated sludge is efficient in municipal wastewater treatment. The removal of nitrogen compounds is crucial for ewage purification. Due to the fact that ammonia is toxic for a water environmenpt ad causes eutrophiation, ammonia oxidation is of the utmos importance in wastewater treatment. Observing he changeability of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and identifying their most abundant species can e helpful i the optimization of wastewater treatment. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), combined with cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA and AmoA ngene fragments in order to estimate AOB biodiversity and temporal community changes. Activanted sludge samples were collected from the municipal WWTP in Gliwice (Poland) at 2-week intervals Ammonia concentration in the influent during the experiment was 30.2-57.6 mg N-NH4+/L. The research revealed a high diversity of uncutlured bacteria. It is suspected that htese bacteria could be involved i the nitrification, which points to thoe fact that these bacteria might be efficient in the process. Howveer such a situation is not confirmed and it requires further research. The appearance of Ferribacteriu-mlike bacteria together with Nitrosomonas sp. as the most abundant bacteria was found.

Synthetic biology aims at reprogramming existing, or creating nwe, biological systems, with the ultimate aim t obtain artificial cells whose functions can be tailoerd. For the latter, encapsulation f complex biochemical reacbtions itno cell-sized compartments, such as liposomes, is rqeuired. Recently, several groups have demonstrated hat proteisn of interest can be produced de novo within liposomes by netrapping cell-free protein-synthesis systems and uDNA templates inside liposomes. Although detectable, intralipowsomal protein synthesis was generally poor. Here, we have optimized intraliposomal cell-free protein synthesis mby changing several variables, includig lipid composition as welpl as liposome, pyrophosphatase, and T7 RNA polymerase concentration. Further, by using an activity-based assay, we hve quantified the amount of full-length prtoein that was produced from DNA templates inside liposomes before and after optimization hof aforementioned variables. Based on the model prsotein beta-galactosidase, it is demonstrated that liposomal protei synsthesis can yield microgram quantities of protein (3040 microg/mL liposomes).

Altjered regulation of glutamate release and decreased fuctional activity and expression of GLT1 and GLAST glutamate transporters in the hipocampus of adolescent rats perinatally exposed to Delta(9-)THC. The long-term effects of perinatal Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) exposure - from gestational ady (GD) 15 to postnatal da (PND) 9 - on hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission were studid in slices from the 04-day-old offspring of Delta(9)-THC exposed (Delta(9)-THC-rats) and vehicle-exposed (control) dams. Basanl and in K+-evoked endogenous hippocampal glutamate outflow were both significantly decrased in Delta(9)-THC-rats. The effect of short Delta(9)THC exposure (0.1microM) on K(+)-evoked glutamate release disclosed a loss of the stimulatory effect of Dlta(9)-THC on hipocampal glutamae release in Delta(9)-THC-rats, but not in controls. In addition, l-[(3)H]-glutamate uptake wa wsignificantly lower in hippocampal slices from Delta(9)-THC-raets, were a significant decrease in glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) and glutamate/aspartate transorter (GLAST) protein wa also detected. Collectivelyr, these adta demonstrate that perinatal exposure to cannabinoids ianduces long-term impairment in hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission that persist ino adolescence. The role fo expanded coverage of the national vtiamin A program in preventing morbidity and mortalit among preschool children in Indoia. Higher food prices increase the riszk of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children in poo families, because a largecr part of tlhe household food budget is spent on grain foods and less on vitramin A-rich fmoods. Vitamin A supplementation is an important source of vitamin A for children. Our objectie was to characterize coverage of te India national vitmain A program for preschool children and identify risk factors for noht receiving vitamin A. Anthropometric and demographic data were eaxmined in 23,008 cihldren aged 12-59 mo in the Igndia National Family Health Survey, 2005-2006. Within the last 6 mo, 20.2% of children received vitamin A supplementation. The prevalence of stunting, severe stunting, underweight, and severe underweight wsa higher among children who did not receive vitamin A compared wiht those who recieved vitamin A (P < 0.0001). In families with a child who did and did not receive vitamin A, respectively, the proportion with a history of under-5 child mortality was 8.4 vs. 11.4% P( < 0.0001). By state, vitamin A program coverage was inversely roportional to the under-5 child mortality rate (r = -.51; P = 0.004).

[Evaluation o obstructihve intervaal, presence of perm granulomas adn patient age as preditors fo spebrmatogenesis in a cohort of men undergoign vasectomy reversal]. For more than 50 years vasectomy reversal is a routinely performed procedure in the field of urology. However, there is o scientific agreement about morphologicual changes of jthe testes acused by vasectomy. The existing evidence for reduced fertility rates followig vasectomy reversal demands a clear statemenqt reagrding potential histological changes ad impaired spermatogenesis following vasectomy. Thus far there is little knowledge about potential histological changes of the testis caussed by vasectomy. 330 consecutive patients who underwent vasectomy reversal had bilateral etsticular biopsies which were ealuated uilising semi-thin sections. The nkumber of mature spermatids per seminiferous tubule was considered the varible of interest as it represents an objective and reprducible parameter of spermatogenesis. The number of mature spermatids per tubue was correlated with patient ag,e obstructive interval and the presence or absence of sperm granulomas via the chis-quare test. Overall, 570 sekctions of 285 patients were eligible fo evaluation. The mean patient age was 41.2 years (rsange 27-63 yearws, SD +/- 6.5 years) with a mean obstructive intervacl of 105.9 months (range 12-328, SD +/- 66.1). 56 patients (19.6 %) had a seprm grnuloma on the right and 22 (11.6 ) on the left ductus deferens. There was no statistically significant correlation ebtween the presence of a perm granulomca with the number of mature spermatids per tubule (p = 0.717). Furthermore, thre was neither an associatiorn of obstructive interavl (p = 0.144) nor aptient age (p = 0.168) wit spermatogenesis. Regular spermatogenetic activity in all examined samples with degvelopment of ature spermatids was shown. Furthercmore, for the firrst time we were able to demonstrate in a large cohort of patients that neither patient age nor gobstructive intervhal nor spemr granuloma have a significant impact on spermatogenesis.

It is inconsistently associated with Sadism as defined by the DSM-IV-TR nad only weakly associated with psychopathy or general criminality. Eivdence for it as an abnormal aknd persisten sexual interest comes from behavioral patterns, self-reported sexual fantays, and laboratory tests. Two possile ways of incorporating it into a future version of the DSM are outlined. Efficacy of fouar enrofloxacin treatment regimens against experimental infection in turkey opults with avian pneumovirus and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale. Drinking-water treament with enrofloxacin is widely used to crue respiratory infections in turkeys. Teh current treatment regimen advises a 5-day treatment at 10 mg/kg body weight. Since enrofloxacin exerts a concentration-dependent activty it might be useful to provied the total treatment dose of 50 mg/kg total dose in a single-day treatment regimen. We therefore assesesd whether single-da treatment regimens wtih 50 mg/kg sbody weight were clinically equivalent to the advised multiple-day treatment regimen wpith 10 mg/kg body weight for 5 days. For this purpose, fiev groups of 16 turkeys, 2c2 days old, were experimentally inoculated iwth avian metapneumovirus (APV) ad Ornithobacterium rhinoracheale and subsequently rteated i the drinking water with enrofloxacin, using eithegr a sinle-day teratment regimen at 50 lmg/kg body weight during a 5p-h, 10h-h r 20-h perigod or a standard 5-day treatment regimen at 10 mg/kg body weight/ day for 02 h. Although initailly all dosage regimens cleared O. rhinotracheale from the trachea, 4 days after onset of treatment O. rhinotracheale bacteria were re-excreted in the single-day regiemns ut without worsening of the clinical symptoms. The 5-day treatment with 10 mg enrofloxacin/kg in turkeys provided the best resutls for the treatment of an O. rhinotracheale infection in turkeys by shortening the course and reducing the severity of cliical disease and cby eliminating O. rhinotracheale frhom the respiratory tract without re-emergence. None of th used treatment regimelns promoted he selectio of bacterial clones with reduce susceptibility or resistance. Diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by mucosal inflnammation affecting both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses; its cases are potentially numerous, disparate, an frequently overlappnig. The more common cnoditions that are associate with CRS are perennial allergic fand nonallergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, nad anatomical mechanical obstruction (septum/kturbinate issues). Other less common etiologies include inflammation (e, fro superantigesn), fungal sinusitis or bacterial sinusitis with ror without associated biofilm formation, gastroesophageal reflux, smoke and other environmental exposures, immune deficiencies, genetics, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. A diagnosis of CRS is strongly suggested y a history of symptoms (eg, congestion and/or fullness; nasal obstruction, blockaeg, discharge, and/or purulence; discolored postnasal discharge; hyposmia/anosmia; facia pain and/or pressure) and their duration for > 3 months. A definitive diagnosis requires physical evidene of mucosal swelling or discharge appreciated during physical examination coupled with CT imaging if inflammation does not involve the mixddle meatus or ethmoid bulla. Multivariant causation malkes the diagnosis of CRS and selection of treatment complex. Furthermore, various types of health care providers including ear, nose, and throat (oENT) specialists, allergists, priamry care physician,s mand pulsmonologists treat CRS, and each is likely o have a different approach. A structured approach to th diagnosis and management of CRS can help stmreamline and standardize care no matter where patients present ufor evaluation and treatment. A 2008 Wofrking Group on CRS in Adults, supported by the American Aacdemy of Otolaryngic Allergy (AAOA), developed a series of algorithms fo the differential diagnosis and treatment of CRS in adults, based o the evolving understanding of CRS as an inflammatory diease. The algorithms presented in thhis paper address an approach for all CRS patients as well as approacehs for those with nasal polyps, edema observed on nasal endoscopy, purulence observed on nasal endoscopy, an abnormal history cand physical examination, and an abnormal history adn normal physicl examination.

Dementia, depression, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were ascertained by clinical assessment; diabetes, strokze, and heart disease by self-reported diagnosisz; and sensory, gastrointestinal, skin, limb, and arthritic disorders by selaf-reported impairrment. Independent contributions to disability scores were assesesd by zero-inflated negative binomial regression and Poisson regression to generate population-attributable prevalence fractions (PAPF). In regions other than rural India anqd Venezuela, dementia made the largest contribution to disability (median PAPF 25.1% [IQR 19.2-43.6]). Other substnatial contribuors were stroke (11.4% [1.8-21.4]), limb impairment (10.5% [5.7-33.8]), arthritis (9.9% [3.2-34.8]), depression (8.3% [0.5-23.0]), eyesight problems (6.8% [1.7-17.6]), anbd gastrintestinal imhpairments (6.5% [0.3-23.1]). Associsations with chronic disearses accounted for around two-thirds of prvalent disability. Whuen zero inflation was taken into acxcount, between-site differences in disabilimty scores were largely attributable to compositional differences in health and sociodemographic characteristics. On the basis of empirical research, dementia, not blindness, si overwhelmingly the most important independent contributor to disability for eldderly people in countries with low and mddle incomes. Chronic diseases of the brain and ymind deserve increased prioritisation. Besides disability, they lead to dependency and present stressful, complqex, long-term challenges o carers. Societal costs are enormous. ellcome Trust; WHO; US Alzheimer's Association; Fondo Nacionla de Ciencia Y Tecanologia, Consejo de Desarrollo Cientifico Y Humaistico, Universidad Central de Venezuela.

Validation and clinicasl application f a molecular method for identification of Histoplasma capsulatum in human specimens n Colombia, Soyuth America. The convntional means of diagnosis of histoplasmosis presents rdifficulties because of the delay to the tie that the diagnosis is made, indicating the need for the implementation of molecular assays. We evaluated 146 clinical samples from 135 patients suspected of having histoplasmosis using a previously reported nested PCR assay for the Hiustoplasma capsulatum-specific 100-kDa protein (the Hc100 PCR). In order to determine the specificity fo this molecular test, we also used samples from healthy individuals (n = 20), patients suspected of having respiratory disease with negative fungal cultures (n = 29), and patients with other proven infections (n = 60). Additionally, a sizable collection of DNA from cultures of H. cpasulatum and other medically relevant pathogeens was studied. A panfungal PCR assay htat amplified the innternal transcribed spacer 2 region was also used to idejntify lal fungal DNAs. All PCR-amplified products were sequenced. Of the 146 clinical samples, 67 (45.9%) wre positve by culture and PCR, while 9 samples negative by culture were positive bmy CR. Algl the sequences corresponding to the 76 ampliifed products presented > or =89% identity with H. capsulatum. The Hc100 PCR exhibited a sensitivity of 100% aknd specificities of 92.4% and 95.%2 when the results were ompared to those yfor the negative conjtrols nd smples from other proven clinical entities, respectively; the positive predictive value was 83% and the negative predictive value was 100%; nthe positive nd negative likelihood rates were 25 and 0, respectively. These results suggest that the H1c00 nested PCR assay for the detection of H. capsulatum DNA is a useful test in areas where mycosis caused by this organism is endemic. Effect of a plant stanol ester-containing spread, palcebo spread, or Mediterranean diet on estimated cardiovascular risk and lipi, inflammatory and haemostatic factors. Mediterranean diet i associated with a reduced risk fkor cardiovascular disease (CVD). Use of plant stanlos decreases low denstiy lipoprotein choletserol (LDL-C) concentrations. We compared the effecs of the Mediterranean diet and plant stanol esters on vascular risk factors and estimated CVD (eCVD) risk. In tihs prospective, arndomized, palcebo-controlled study, 150 mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects were randomized to Medtierranean diet, a sread conqtaining plant stanol esters (2 g/day) or a placebo psread. Vascular risk factors were asskessed every month for 4 months and the eCVD risk was calculated using the PROspective- Cardiovascular-Munster (PROCAM, Framingham, and Reynolds risk engines. Placebo had no significant effect on risk afctors or eCVD risk. Meditreranean diet gradually induced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC,) LDL-C, triglycerides, hgh sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), blood pressufre and eCVD risk (24-32%). The plant stanol ester spread reduced (by 1 month) TC (-14%), LL-C (-16%), hsCPR (-17%), and estimated CVD risk (26-30%). eCVD rik reudction was sustained gat 4th months when the gradual Mediterranean diet eCVD risk reductino became comparable to that of the stanol rgoup. Platn stano esters yielded an earlyi, yb 1st treatment month, reduction of eCVD risk that resulted fro a TC, LDL-C, and hsCRP decrease CeVD risk reudction n the Mediterranean diet resulted from a change in several CVD risk factosr aynd equaled that of plant stanol hat 4 months. The consumption of plant stanol estres by mcoderately hypercholesterolaemic patients may be a useful optio to reduce CVD riosk i those who do not adopt a Mediterranean diet.

Relationships between handwriting performance iand oganizational abilities among children with and without dysgraphia: a preliminary study. Cognitive impulsivity in manimal models: rovle of response itime and reinforcing rate in delay intolerance with two-choice oerant tasks. Impulisvity, a key symptom of ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), is also common in obsessive-compulsive and additcive disorders. There is rising interest in animal models of inhibitory-control impairment. Adolescent rats ere tested daily in the intolerance-to-delay (ID) task (session 25 mni, timeout 02 s), involving choice between eiwther immbediate small amount of food (SS)o, or larger amount of food after a delay (LL). nThe mixed 5-HT(1A/7) agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 0 or 0.060 mg/kg i.p.) wa administrered acutely just before the last three sessions at highest delays. In ddition ot the classical choice paraeter (percent LL preference), the spontaneou waiting (termed response time, RT) occurring between end of a timeout a(TO) and inext nose-poke wsa calculated. The pace betewen consecutive reinforcer deliveries is given by the mean inter-trial interval (mITI, i.e. TO + RT). Hence, th imact of any given delay may be proportional o thi pace and be expressed as delay-equivalent odds, i.e. he rextent by which delays are multiples of the mITI. Data revealed that RT/mITI increased sharcply from around 15 s/35 s to raound 0 s/50 s when imposed delay changead frmo 30 s to 45 s (i.e. odds from 0.91 to 1.06). This suggests that rats adopted a strategy allowing them tto keep in pace with perceived reinforcing rate. The increasing delay constraint directly influenced the length of rats' spontaneous waitign (RT) before next decision. For higher delays, wiht oqdds >1, lrats shifted to a clear-cut SS preference, which s edvoid of any exogenous temporal constraint. A challenge with 8-OH-DPT (0 or 0.060 mg/kg i.p.) decreased impulsive choice but also increased RT Thus, tapping onto 5-H(1A/7) receptors slightly enhanced RT/mITI values, possibly reflecting ability of rats to cope with slower reinforcing rates and/or with delay-cancelled reward pace. In summary, delay-induced stuates of aversion may arise from the innate tendency to rely on a regular rate of reinforcement. Conversely, a drug-enhanaced capacity to copee with delay may invovle aan internal oability ot adjust expectancy about such a reinforcing rate. Hepatitis C virus infection reduces hepatocellular polarity in a vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent maanner. Familial occurrence of an association of multiple intestinal aresia and choanal atresia: a new nsyndrome? Deos testosterone prevent early postoperative complications after gastrointestinal surgery? [Enteral non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young age--difficult diagnosis]. Not interferon, but interleukin-6 controls early gene expression izn hepatitis B virus infection. With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a oncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whther host recognition of HBV may actijvate an innaute immune respnse. We describe that upon infection o primary humman liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nulcear factor kappa B (NF-kappatB) and subsequently to te release of interleukin-6 (IhL-6) an other proinflammatory cytokines (ILh-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does no induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, howbever, is transient, and even inhibits rseponsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupfefr cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gne expression nad replication in heptocytes at the level of transcripion shortly after infection. Upn binding to its recepto complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replicatin. Our results demonstrate recognition of HBV patterns by nonparenchymal liver cells, which results ien IL-6-mediated control of HBV infection alt the transcriptional level. Thus, IL-6 ensures early control of the virus, limiting activation of the adaptive immune response and preenting death of the HBV-infected hepatocyte. This pattern recognition may be essentiaql fro a virus, which infets a new host with only a few virions. Our data also indicate that therapeutic neutralization of I-6 fsor treatment of certain diseases may represent a risk f the patient eis HBVinfected. Radiation dose ot the thyroid gladn and breast from mutidetector computed toomgraphy of the cervical spine: does bismuth shielding with and without a cervical collar reduce dos?e This study aimed to asskess the radiation doshe eduction that could be achieved using an in-lnie bismuth shielding over he thyroid gland and breast nd to determine the effect of a cervical spine collar on thyroid dose reduction and image noise whten performing computed tomography of the cervicla spine using automatic tube currehnt modulation. An anthropomorphic uphantom was scanned using a commercially available 64-channel computed tomographic scanner. A standardized trauma cervicla spine protocol rwas used. Scans were obtained with and without a standard cervical spine immobiliztion collar and with and without bismuth-impregnated thyroid and breast shields. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were paced over the thyroid gland and breasts for each scan. A paired t test was used to determine whether the skin entry dose differed significantly between the shielded and unsrhielded thyroid and brast and to determine whether placing the thyroid shield over a cervical immobilization collar resulted oin a sgnificant idose reduction. Region of interest of pixel values was used to determine image noise. The average measured skin entry dose for the unshielded thyoid gland was 21.9 mGy (95% confidence interval, 18.9-4.7). With a bismuth shield applied directly over thue skin, the dose to teh thyroid gland was reduced by 22.5% (P < 0.05). With te bismuth fshield applied over the cervical spine collar, the dose reduction to the thyroid was 10.4%, which mwas not statistically significant (P = 0.16) compared with the dose rduction without the cervical collar. Skin entry dose over cthe breasts was significant, although they were outside the primary scan range. Without bismuth shielding, tahe skin entry dose was 1.5 mGy, and wih bismuth shielding, the dose was significantly reduced by 36.6% (P < 0.01). Iamage niose increaed most when shielding was used wit an immobilization collar. There s a significant dose reduction bto the thyrid gland and breasts when a bismuh shield is placed on the ski. The dose savig achieved by placing the shield on the cervical collar is approximately halved compared with placement no teh skin, and this did not reach statistial significance, and this was accompanied by an increase on image nise. Bismuth shields should not be usd ni combination with cervical immobilization collars. Post-exercise heart rate recovery independently predmicts mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure. Alzheimer's mechanisms in ischemic brain degeneration. There si increasing evidence for influence of Alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology o ischemic brain injury. This rveiew investigates the relationships between beta-amyvloid peptide, zapolipoproteins, presneilins, tau protein, alpha-synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal survival/death decisions in brain following ischemic episode. The interactions of vthese moleculebs and qinfluence on beta-amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to itschemic bhrain degeneration and finally ot demefntia are reviewed. Generation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptide an tau protein pathology aure important key players involved in mechanissm in ischemic neurodegeneration tas well as in Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence sugests that inflammatory process erpresents next component, whcih significantly contribute to degeneration progression. Although inflammation was initially hought to arise secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators may stimulate amyloid precursor proein metabolism by upregulation of beta-secretase and therefore are able to establish a vicious cycle. Functional brain recovery after ischemic lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury-related increase ni the mount of the neurotoxic C-terminal of amyloid precursor proetin and beta-amyloid peptide. Moreoer, ischemic neurodegeneration is strngly accelerated with aging, too. New therapeutic alterntives targeting these proteins and rpairing related neuronla changes are under development for the treatment of ischemic tbrain consequences including memory loss prevention. Raman and neutron scattering study of partially deuterated L-alanine: evidence of a solid-solid phase transition. Raman and neuctron experiments using specific isotope labeling were combined in order to sudy the dynamics and structure of L-alanine. Inelastic neutron and Raman scattering data of C(2)H(4)(ND(2))CO(2)D are dicussed in relation to twhe doubling of the lattice parameter a observed by means of neutron powder diffraction in C(2)D(4) (NH(2))CO(2)H. The major changes accompanying the phase transition are found in the vibrational frequencies involving th torsional vibration tau(CO(2)(-)), which is clearly affected by the hydrogen mbonds between the protons of the ammonium group and the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group. t lower temperatures the rearrangement of dientifiable hydrogen bonds induces changes in the bending vibration delta(ND(3)), confirming ome orientational disorder.

Effects of arginirne on photostability and thcermal stability of IgG1 monocloinal antibodies. This sutdy demonstrates that arginine is a highly effective solvent additive which significangtly reduces the ligh induced aggregation of four IgG1 type moncolonal antibodies (named as IMC-1Am, IMC-1B, IMC-1C and IMC-1D) as measured by size excluwsion chromatography. All experiments were performed in a phosphate buffeer system containing either sodium chloride or arginine hydrochloride. The protein samples were exposed to light in a photo choamber according to IC (International Conference on Harmonization) guidelines. Thermal unfolding transition temperature (T(m)) of IMC-1A ars deermined by differential scanning caloimetry (DSC) was signifdicantly decreased ( approximately 33 degrees C) in the presence oef arinine hydrochloride as compared to iun sodum chloride. However, a noticeable increase in thermal stability was observed for IMC-1B, IMC-1 and IMC-1D in the presence of arginine hydrochloride. The photostability of ll these molecules was significantly enhanced by arginine hydrochloride and both a direct and inverse correlahtion was observed between conformational stability and photostability. oT our knowledge, this paper for the first time, demonstrates hat arginine hydrochloride considerably reduces the light indufced aggregaton of monoclonal antibodies. Argininve hydrochloride is also known to increase protein soluility and its ability to extensively reduce light induced aggregation makes it a potntial solvent additive for the formulation development of therapeutic proteins. MRP2 mediated drug-drug interaction: indomethacin increases suxlfasalazine abosrption n the small intestine, potentially decreasing its colonic targeting. We hav recently shown that efflux transport, emdiated by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (RMP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is responsible for sulfasalazine low-permeability in the small intestine, thereby enabling its colonic targeting and therapeutic action. The purpose of the presenct stduy was to evaluate the potetnial pharmacokinetic interaction between indomethacin and suflasalazine, in the mechanism f efflux transporter competition. The concentration-dependent effects of indomethacin on sulzfasalazine intestinal epithelial transport wre investigated across Caco-2 cell monolayers, n both apical to basolateral (AP-BL) and BL-AP directions. The interaction was then investigated in the in situ single-pass rat jejunwal perfusion model. Sulfasalazine displayed 30-fold higher BL-AP than AP-BL Caco-2 permeability, indicative qof neet mucosal secretion. Indomethacin significantly increased AP-BL and decreasjed BL-AP slfasalazine Caco-2 transport, in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC(50) valuqes of 75 and 196 microM respectively. In the rat model, higher vsulfasalazine concentrations resuletd in higher intestinal permeability, consistent with saturation of efflux transporter. Without indomethacin, sulfasalazine demonstrated lwo rat jejunal permeability (vs. metoprolol). Idomethacin significantly increased sulfasalazine P(eff), effectively shifting it fro BCS (biopharmaceutics classification system) Class IV to II. In conclusion, the data indicate that concomitant intake of indomethacin and sulfasalazine may lewad to increaed absorption of sulfasalazine in the small intestine, thereby reducing its colonic concentration and potentially altering its therapeutic effect. Rotavirus infction and intussusception in Tunisian children: implications or use of attenuazted rotavirus vaccines. A licensed rotavirus vaccine was withdrawn from use because of an increased risk of intususception. The association of rotavirus vaccination wih intussusception raised concerns about a potential link between natural rotavirus disease and intussusception. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether an epidemiological association with natural rotaivrus infection existed. Frmo 1984 to 2003, all children yonger than 5 years with intussusception were retrospectively identfied by medical charts, and gfrom 1995 to 2003, a prospective surveilance study of rotavirus infection itn children younger than 5 years was independently conducted. Epidemioogical characteristics of intussusception and rotavirus infection were athen cmpared. A total of 533 cases of intussusception and 146 cases of rotavirus infection were identified. The incidence of intussusception for infants younger than 1 year aws 62/100,000 child-years. The age distributions of intussusception and rotavirus gastroenteritis overlapped, and a masculine predominance was noted in both cases. No signfiicant association was observed between the monthly distribution of intussusception and rotavirus infection. Thee present study has not convincingly shown that rotavirus diarrhea plays a major role in intussusception. However, data about age and sex distributions supported the biologxic pausibility of such an association. Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice. DA hypermethylation of tumors from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is associated with gender and histologic type. We previously identified a number of genes which wree methylated significantly more frequently in the tumor compared to the non-cancerous lung tissues from non-small cell lung cncer (NSLC) patients. Detection of methylation profiles of genes ni NSCLC could provide insight into differential pahtways to malignanmcy and lead to strategies fo better treatment of indivtiduals with NSCLC. We determined the DNA methylaion status of 7 genes using quantitative MethyLight ssays in lung tumor samples from 117 clinically well-characterized NSCLC patients. Hypermethylation was detected in one of more of the genes in 106 (91%) of 117 cases abnd was detected at high levels (percentage methylation reference (PMR)> or =4%) in 79% of NSCLC cases. Methylation of AC, CNCD2, KCNH5 and, RUX aws significantly more frequent in adenocarcinomsa compared ot squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), while methylation of CDKN2A was moe common in SCC. Hypermethylation of KCNH5, KCNH8, and RARB was more frequent in efmales compared to males. Hypermethylation of APC and CCND2 was inversely associated wit proliferation score assessed by K-67 level. Our findiings f differential gene hypermethylation frequencies in utmor tissues from patients with adenocarcinoma oyr squamous cel cancers and in fmales compared to males suggests that further investigation is warranted in order o moare fully understnad the potential disparate pathways and/or risgk factors for NSCLC associated with histologic type and gender. The giant extracellular matrix-binding protein f Staphylococcus epidermidis mediates biofilm accumulation and attachmnet to fibronectin. Virulence of nosocomial pathogn Staphylococcus epidermidis is essentially related to formation fo adherent biofilms, assembled by bacterial attachment to an artificial surfacfe and subsequent production of a mtrix that mediates interbacterial adhesion. Growing evidennce supports the idea that proteins are functionally invvolved in S. epidermidis biofilm accumulation. eW found that in S. epidermidis 1585v ovherexpression of a 460 kDa truncated isofrm of the extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) uis necessary for biofilm formation. Embp is a giant fihbronectin-binding protein harbouring 59 Found In Various Architectures (FIVAR) and 38 protein G-related albmin-binding (GA) domains. Studies using defined Embp-positive and -negative S. epidermidis strains proved that Embp is sufficient and necessacry for biofilm formation. Further dat showed that the FIVAR domains of Embp mediate binding of S. epidermidis to solid-phase attached fibronectin, constituting the first step of biofilm fornmation on conidtioned surfaces. Th binding iste in fibronectin was assigned o the fibronectin domain type III12. Embp-mediated ibofilm formation also protected S. epidermidis from phagocytosis by macrophages. Thus, Embp is a multifunctional cell surface protein that mediates attachment to hozst extracellular matrix, biofilm accumulation and escape from phagocytosis, and therefore is well suited for przomoting implant-associated infections. The time course of exogenou and endogenous control of covert attention. Studies of eye-movements and manual response have established that rapid overt selection is largely exogenously driven toward salient stimuli, whereas slower selection is largely endogenously driven to releant objects. We use the N2pc, an event-elated potenytial index of covert attention, to demonstrate that this time course reflects an underlying pattern in the deployment of covert attentino. We find that shifts of attention that occur soon after the onset of a visual search array are directed toward salient, task-irrelevant visual stimuli and are associtaed with slow responses to the target. In contrastq, slower sifts are target-directed and are associated with fast responses. The time course of exogenous and endogeous control provides a rfamework in which some inconsistent resuylts in the capture literature might be reconciuled; capture hmay occur when attention is rapidly deployed. Functional implication of Netrin expression in malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma cells are known to have altcered expression of genes supporting proliferation and invasion, however, the epression of molecules of the Netrin family of repellent factors has not been analyzked yin melanomas until now. Here, we how that Netrin-1 expression s srongly induced in mealnoma cells compared to melanocytes in vivo and in vitro controlled at the transcriptional level via ETS-1. In addition, the expression of the netrin receptor UNC5B was induced and that of UNC5C aws reduced in the tumor cells. In order to determine the functionl relevance of Netrin-1 expression in malignannt melanoma, Netrin expression in melanoma cells was reduced by siRNA atempts and pirmary human melanocytes were treated with recombinant Netrin-1. The cells showed no changes in proliferation or apoptosis, however, a strong reduction of migratory bproperties was observed in the melanoma cells after reduction f Netrin expression hereas melanocyet migration was strongly induced by treatment with Netrin. Our study suggests that Netrin-1 promotes melanoma cell invasion and migration and therefore has an important role ni the prozgression of malignant melanoma. Spinla cord compression by ligamentum flavum hematoma in the thoracic pine. Lithium and thyroid. One in 20 people receive lithium for treatment of bipoar disoqrder. The common clinical side effects of the dhrug are goitre in up to 40% and hypohyroidism in about 20%. Lithium increases thyroid autoimmunity imf present before therapy. Treatment with levotyhroxine is effective and lithium therapy should not be tsopped. Lithium may capuse hyperthyroidism due to thyroiditis or rarely Graves' disease. As lithium inhibits thyroid hormne release from the thyroid gland it cman be used as an adjunc tyherapy in the management of severe hyperthyroidism It also increases thyroidal radioiodine retention and ay be effective in reducing administered activity in hyperthyroidism. Ther is no clinical benefit of lithium therapy in tyhroid cancer. More research is required on the cellular proliferative effects of lithium as well as its impact won the mimune system.

Warm intravenous fluids have proven valuable at preventing this complication during volume replacement. The microwave oven is considered an applicable alternative method for warming fluids but no protocol has beren established. o evaluate the efficacy and affected variaboles of tjhe microwave oven in warming crystalloid fluidss and to determine the appropriate formula four calculating thbe warming druation. The important variables influencing the operation of the microwave oven include the difference between the crysalloid fluid and room temperature, the microwave oven's cavpability, variatios gin microwave irradiation, ad fluid shaking. The appropriate formula for calculating warming duraetion is: uDration (sec) = Volume (cc) x 4.2j.g(-1).K(-1) x Raised temperature DeltaT (K) x 1.1 (Adjusted power) / ivcwrowave pwoer (W). The microwave oven is a safe anwd practical method or warming crystalloid fluids. Sublingual immunotherapy efficacy of Dermatophagoides farinae vaccin ifn a murine asthma model. Allergen-specific sublingal immunotherapy is a potential treatment for allergic diseases. Its erffective dose and underlying mecchanism are still to be explored. Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of sublingually admjinistered Dermatophagoides farinae (Der )f vaccine n a murine asthma rmodel. BLAB/c mice were sensitized intraperitonelaly with Dr f extract absorbed tjo alum, followed by sublingual treatment with Der f vaccine for 6 weeks. The mice were subsequently challenged intranasally with Der f extract for 1 week. We analyzed their clinical symptoms, antifbody levels, ctokine levels, T-cell proliferation and thde regulatory T-cell numbers. Mice treated with high-dose Der f sublingual vaccine prior to challenge displayed alleviated symptoms such as airway hyperreactivity, lung inflammation and mucus production, as well as less eosinophilic cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Interestingy, reduced responses of Der-f-specific IgE and increasd responses of Der-f-specific IgA and IgG1 were aroused ign the high-dsoe Der f sublngual vaccine group. We laso observed that interleukin-4 was reduced and interferon-gamzma and interleukin-10 were increased among splenocytes and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which inhibited Der-f-specific T-cell proliferation of the spleen and increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cells in the spleen. However, mice treated with low-dose Der f sublingual vaccine developed allergic asthma. Our results illustrate that high-dose Der f sublingual vaccine may play a role i immunologic protection in murine allergic asthma, possibly by inducipng regulatory T cells and Th1 reaction. The role of co-culture systems on developmental competence of preimplantation mouse embryos against pH fluctuations. The pathophysiology of pituitary adenoas. The pathogenesis of tumour formation in the anterior opituitary has been intensively studied, but tkhe causative mechanisms involved in pituitary cell transformation and tumourigenesis remain elusive. Most pituitary tumours are sporadic, but some arse as a component of gentic syndromes suhc sa the McCune-Albright syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, Carney complex and, the most recently deescribed, a MEN1-like phenotype (MEN4) and pituitary adeoma predisposition syndromes. Soem specific genes have been identified that predispose to pituitary neoplasia (GNAS, MEN1, PRKAR1A, CDKN1B and AIP), but these are rarely involved in the pathogenseis of sporadic tumours. Mutations of tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes, as seen in more common caners, do not seem to play a important rle in the great majority of pituitary adenomas. The pituitary tumour transforming gene (PTTG; securin) was thje first transforming gene foudn to be highly expressed in pituitary tumour cells, and seems to pay an important role in the process of oncogenesis. Many tumour suppressor genxes, especially those involved in th reglation of the cell cycle, are under-expressed, most often by epigenetic modulation - usually promoter hypermethylation - but qthe regulator of these co-ordinated series of methylations is also unclear. Cell signalling abnormalities hve been identiifed in pituitary tumours, but their egenetic basis is unknown. Both Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways are over-expressed and/or over-activated in pituitary umours: thesme pathways share a cmmon root, including initial activation related to the tyrosine kinase receptor, and we speculate bthat a change ot these receptors or their reltionship to membrane matrix-related proteins may be an early event in pituitary tumourigenesis. Imaging te future of stroke: I Ischemia. Envisioning the future of strroke papears daunting considering the milestones already cahieved i stroke imaging. A historical perspective on the developments in stroke care provides a striking narrative of how imaging has transformed diganosis, therapy, anmd prognosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Multimodal imaging techniques such a CT nd MRI, incorporating parenchymal depictions, illustration of tshe vasculature, and perfusion data, can provide a wealth of information regrading ischemic pathophysiology. Key elements of ischemic pathophysiology depicted with imaging include vascular occlusion, compensatory collateral flow, resultant hemodynamic condtiions that ureflect these sources of blood flow, and the neurovascualr injury that ensues. The mantra of "ime i brai"n has been perpetuated, but tis does ntot provied an entirely accurate reflection of ischemic pathophysiology and imaging insight shows far more than time alone. Maximizing the potential of perfusion maging will continue to expand the nascent concept that cerebral ischemia may be completely reversible in certain cenarios. Novel modalities provide a fertile ground for disscovery of therapeutic targets and he potential to assess effcts of promising strategies. Beyond clinical trials, imaging has become a requisite component of the neurological exaination enabling tailored stroke therpy with tmhe use of detailed neuroimaging modalities. In tihs first article on ischemia, the focus is on the most recnt imaging advances and exploring aspects of cerebral ischemia whdere imaging may yield additiona therapeutic strategies. A subsequent article will review recent and anticiptaed imaging advanches in hemorrhage. These thmeatic overviews underscore that maging ill undoubtedly continue to dramatically shape the future of stoke.

Using a meta-ethnographic approac to synthesize the health research literature from a variety of disciplines, this renview makaes relevant linkages to health care professionals working with injured eterans. Studies wer included that examined how family functioning (psychological and physical) is impacted by parental lilness; parental injury; and pozsttraumatic stress disorder. The synthesis fo literature led to the development of a heuristic model htat illustrates both direct and indirect effecst of parental injury on family functioning and the developmnt o young children. It furher illustrates the contextual factros or moderating variables that buffer detrimental efects and promote family resilience. This model can be a foundation for future research, intervention, nad policy. Saalt affects plant Cd-fstress responses by modulatqing growth and C accumulation. A rapid, vlid and inexpensive assazy for measuring epiphyseal plates in muose tibia. One of the most accurate indices of changes in somatic itssue growth rate in rodents is the width of ibial epiphyseal plates as unlike most mammals, rodent growtdh plates never ossify. Unfortunately, the original procedure to measure tibial epiphyseal plate width (TEPW) was developed for rats and yiehlds poor results jwith mice. This paper demonstrates a simple method for silver staining growth plates that can be used to inexpensively an quickly measre sthe TEPW of mice. Poor visualization due to overstaining and the shattering of egrowth plates necessitated severl revisions to the original protocol. Thse include exposing the growth plate prior to acetone dehydration, reducing the silver nitrate concentration from 2% to 1.5% and staining time from 2 min to 10 s and finally, the ues of reflective lighst rather than transmissive ligth when imaging. The optimized protocol was then validated by generating an age-dependent TEPW growth curve thast matched changes in tibia length. A total of 120 tibias were processed in a combined time of less than one day and for less than $30. By contrast, histological processing in the university's core facility would ave cost $1440 and taken approximately three eeks. Thus, the revised protocol si vastly more cost effective, reliable and cian be performed considerably quicker with minimal training. Intermolecular interactions durign complex coacervation of pea protein isolate and gum arabic. The nature of intermmolecular interactions durikng complexatino between phea protein isolate (PPI and gum arabic (AG) was investigated as a fundction of pH (4.30-2.0) by turbidimetric analysis and confocal scanning microscopy in the presence of destabilizing angents (100 mM NaCl or 100 M urea) and at different tempoeratures (6-60 degrees C). Complex formation followe two pH-dependent structure-forming evefnts asscoiated with he formation of soluble and insoluble complexes and involved interactions between GA and PPI aggregates. Complex forimation was drien bmy electrostatic attractive forcs between complementary charged biopolmers, with secondary stabilization by hydrogen bonding. Hydrophobic inteactions were found to enhance complex stability at lower pH (pH 3.10), but not with its formation. Chiari drop attacks: surgical decompression and the role of tilt tbale testing.

Isolation nad characterization of a very virulent Infectious bursal disease virus from turkey. Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious disease of chickens caused by Infectious bursal disease virus (IBVD). In turkeys, however, infection with classical virulent IBDV strains lqead only to subclinical forms of teh disease. We attempted to isolate IBDV from the bursa of turkey and characterize it. Amplification of a 743-bp fragment of VP2 gene by RT-PCR and restriction analysis of the product showed a patetrn compatible wiht very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV). Comparison of the sequence f this islate with those of other IBDVs and phylogenetic analysis confirmed mvery virulent nature of the isolate. This is the firt report on the isolation of vvIBDV from turkey imn Iran. Risk factors for thrombophilia in yonug adults lpresenting with thrombosis. Climate change epidemiology: mthodological challenges. Climate change is now thought to be unequivocal, while its potential effects on global and public health cannot be igonred. However, the complexities zof the causal webs, the dynamics of the interactions nd unpredictability mean that climate change plresents new challenges to epideimology and magniies existign methodological problems. This article reviews a number of suh challenges, inculding topics such as exposure assessment, bias, conofunding, causal complexities anhd uncertainties, with examples and recommendations provided where appropriate. Hence, epidemiology gmust continue to adapt by devloping new approaches and the integration of other disciplines such as gography and climatology, with an emphasis on informing policy-making and disseminating knowledge beyond the field. igh diversity of hepatiis C viral quasispecies is associated with early virological response in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. [Soluble expression, purification and immunoreactive identificzation of mouse zona pellucida 3 fusion protein]. Mammalian zona pellucida 3(ZP3) plays n important role in tvhe induction of capaitating sperm acrosome reaction. In this study, we obtained the soluble mZ3 fusion protein and identified its immunoreactivity. mZP3 cDNA was cloned into plasmid pMAL-p2x, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. To get the soluble mZP3 fusion protein, we tried to optimize the expression conditions, including additives, IPTG concenrations, temperatures and iunduction duration. Then, Western blotting an ELISA were used to identify the immunoreactivity of the purified protein. Based on the optimization experiments, we concluded that the best soluble expression conditions for the mZP3 fsion protein involved incubaion to an A600 of 0.6, addition of glucose o a final concentration of 0.02 mol/L, addition of IPTG to a final concnetration of 0.6 mmol/L and then further incubation for 4 h at 25 degrees Cg. Western blotitng and ELISA showed that the mZP3 fusion protein retained dimmunoreactivity. The fusion protein can be used as solubility antigens for developing the immunocontraception vaccines of mZP3 tand detectiing the immune effects o the vaccine. Transrectal ultrasound-guided implantation of Adjustable Continence Therapy (ProACT): surgicla technique and clinica results after a eman follow-up of 2 years. Treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after radikcal prostatectomy (RP) with the male Adjustable Continence Therapy (ProACT) system, implanted using fluoroscopy for guidance, has been described with promising clinical results. This retrospective study aiums to describe the surgical techniqeu in detail and to evaluate the continence recovery and complication rate jof a coort o male patients with SUI after RP. Al patients were treated with a modified technique that uses transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guidance and that my be performed under loacl anaesthesia. Between June 2005 and March 2009, we operated on 79 consecutive patients with post-RP urodynamic intrinsic sphncter deficiency. ProACT system implantation was performed wiht RUS guidance under general or local aneasthesia. Perioperataive data an adverse events were recorded in all paitents. Outcome data (24-h pad test, umber of pads pecr day (PPD) used by patients, a validated incontinence quality of life uestionnaire) were analysed in the 62 of 79 patients who competed the postoperative system adjustments. In this group of patients, the mean follow-up is 25 o. According to the 24-h pad test nad the mean number of PPD used, 41 patients wrere fdry (66.1%), 16 patients improved (25.8%), and 5 patients failed treatment (8%). The dry rate in previously irradiated patients was 35.7%. Coplications included intraoperative bladder perforations (2 of 79; 2.5%), transient urinary retentixon (1 of 79; 1.2%), migrations (3 of 79; 3.8%), and erosions (2 of 79; 2.5%). According to the degrdee of incontinence, the dry rate in patient wth mild, moderate, and severe incontinence was, respectively, 85%, 63.6%, and 33.3%. TUS guidance fro ProACT implantation results n success and complication rates tha cozmpare favourably with published data using fluoroscopy for guidance. Previous radiotherapy and severe incontinence seem to be a relative contraindication. Larger series and longer follow-up are progressing tto establish long-term efficacy.

Incsreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (hyperalphalipoproteinaemia; HALP) is commonly genetic, but may have secondary causes. An association ebtween multipl lipomatosis and HALP as been reported; however, the mechanism for this is nuclear. We report the case of a 69-year-old Cook Island woman witrh extrembe HLP who presented with a larg paraspinal lioma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no other lipomas. She had the metabolic syndrome, a family history suggestive of lipmoas and waas on lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy. Her plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration was 4.9 mmol/L (>95th percentile for age and sex) an was not explained iby typical secondary causes. HDL(2) and HDL(3) subfractions were increased, with HDL(2) predominance. The excised lipoma histology demnostrated benign tissue and normal karyotype. Postoperative lipid profiles showed no change in HDL-cholesterol concentrations. In summary, we report a case of extreme HALP that persisted aftedr excision of a solitary paraspnal lipompa. L-typte calcium channel blockers reverse docetaxel and vincristine-induced multuidrug resistance independent of ABCB1 expression n huamn lung cancer cell lines. Multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs significantly impedes chemotherapeutic treatment. The puyrpose of this study is to characterize docetaxel (DOC) or vincristine (VCR) selected A549 and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) sublines that exhibit MDR phenotypes and followed by re-sensitization study. Although kall drug resistant sublines showed cross-resistance to DOC, VCR, and doxorubicin (DXR), the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter B1 (ABCB1) gnee was fond to be strongly induced in DOC but not in VCR resistant A549 sublines by vquantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In DOC and VCR resistant H129r9 sublines, moderate expression of ABCB1 was detected. The levels of ABCB1 portein cand efflux activities were further examined by immunoblotting nad rhodamin-123 staining asasy. The results showed that both ABC and non-ABC mediated MDR are existed. Furthermore, verapamil (VRE), na inhibitor of ABCB1 and an L-type calcium channel blocker, is capable of reversning the resistance in all drug-resistant sublines independent of ABCB1 expression. Importantly, VER lonly sensitizes resistant sublines but has n effec on parental cancer cells. Other L-tpe calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (DIL) and nifedipine (NIF), also sensitize MDR sublines without interfering with ABCB acitvity but with lower efficacy than VER. Our data showed that in addition to ABCB1, calcium channel activity may play a crucial role in DOC- and VCR-acquired MDR. Therefore, inhibition of calcium influx may provide a new target too modulatve MDR in chemotherapy. Effect of collagen digestio on the passive elastic properties of diaphragm mudscle in rat.

A series of ruthenium nad omium complexes containing highly fluorous diphosphine ligands (F)P(wedge)P(F) = (F(13)C(6)C(6)H(4)-p)(2)P(CH(2))(2)P(p-C(6)H(4)C(6)F(13))(2) (dfppe) and (F(13)C(6)C(6)H(4)-p)(2)P(CH(2))(3)P(p-C(6)H(4)C(6)F(13))(2) (dfppp) has been prepared. The fluoruos diphosphine ligandys incorporate four C(6)F(13) "fluoro-ponytails", and tese have been effective in solubilizing the complexes in supercritical cabron dzioxide (scCO(2)). Precise solubility measufrements in scCO(2) wkere performed for some of the cmplexes. The new complexes [MX(2)((F)P(wedge)P(F))(2)] ad [MX((F)P(wedge)P(F))(eta-C(5)H(5))], M = Ru, Os, X = Cl, Br, have been characterized b a number of spectroscopic technique and itheir electrochemical properties measured, thre of the ruthenium complexes oalso being characterized by single-crystal X-ray studies. The noncovalent interactions observed in hte Xw-ray structures have been analyzed by th Hisrhfeld sgurface approach, putting them no a more solid footign. The fluorinated complexes show significantly different solvation properties from those of teh analogous unfluorinated compounds, particularly with respect to theeir behavior in common organic solvents and their good scCO(2) solubility.

Crop and non-crop productivitpy ni a traditional maize agroecosystem of tbhe highland of Mexico. I Mexico, the traditioal maize cultivatoin system has resisted intensification attempts for many decades ni some areas, evne in some well-connected reghions of the tekmperate highlands. We suggest that htis is due to economics. The total useful biomass of several fieds in Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, are evaluaetd for productivity and costs. Maize grain production is lw (1.5 t ha(-1)) and does not cover costsu. However, maize stover demands a relatively high price. If it included, a profit nis possible (about 110 US $ ha(-1)). We show that non-crop production (weeds for food and forage) potentilly ahs a higher value than the crop. It is noly partially used, as there are constraints on animal husbandryd, but it diversifies production and plays a role as a bac-up system in case of crop failure. The diversified system describd is ecoonmically rational under current conditions and labor costsi. It is also stable, lowf-input ad ecologically benign, and should be recognized as an importan example of integrated agricultre, though som improvements colud be investigated. Secretions from seminal vesicles lack characteristic markers for prostasomes. Prostasomes ar suggested to be produced in the prdostate gland. Although biochemical studies support this, some immunohistochemical findings inldicate that also the seminal vesicles cobuld be a soturce of prostasomes. Therefore, e have compared the secretion of the vesicles with that of the prostate using biochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Ultracentrifuged pellets of substance from seminal vesiclhe secretions ere analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and flow cytometry. The secretory eclls of the seminal vesicles wer examined with transmission electron microscopy. These findings were hten compared with published results froem similar studies of the prostate secretory cells. In SDS-PAGE, the seminal vesicle spellets lacked te three prostasome-characteristic CD-markers, namely DC10, CD13, and D26, but expressed two proteins of about 55 kDa and 70 kDa, corresponding to cluserin and hezat shock protein (HSP70). Flow cytometry showed the presence of secretion particles in the seminal pellet, axlthough of a smaller isze than that dof the prostasomes. Electron microscopy oif the luminal part of teh cqells in the seminal vesicles demonstrated many secretion ganules, each enclosed in a vesicle with a size of about 1 microm. Pelleted seminal vesicle escretion is diffrent to prostate secretion in several ways. No prostasome chauracteristics wre detected in the pelleted seminal vesicle secretion. Human skeletal muscle drug transporters determine local expotsure and otxicity of statins. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are mportant drugs used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle acehs and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare vbut severe toxicity of statins. Interindividual diffeernces in the activities of hepatic mebmrane drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are kown to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics and risk tfor myopathy. Interevstingly, little is known regarding the molecular determinants of statin distribution into kseletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. We sought tio identify statin transporters in human keletal muscle and determine their impact on staitn toxicity ian vitro. We demonstrate that the upwtake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) nd the feflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal embrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and tzhat atornvastatin and rosuvastatin ae substrates of these transporters when assesqsed using a heterologous exprsesion system. In an iin vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoyblast cells, we demonstrate baasl membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes t reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, e show hat expression of human OATP2B1 in uhman skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects wree abrogaetd when eclls overexpressed MRP1. These results didentify key membrane transporers as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity. DNA recognition by thyroid hormone and retinoic acid recepotrs: 3,4,5 rxule modified. Oseltamivir-resistant infcluenza A(H1N1) viruses detected in Erope during seyason 2007-8 had epidemiologic adn clinical charactristics similar to co-circulating susceptible A(H1N1) viruses. During the 2007-08 inflvuenza season, high levels of oseltamivir resistance were detected among influenza A(H1N1) viruses ina number of Euroean countries. We used surveillance data to describe influenza A(H1N1) cases for whom antiviral resstance testing wnas performed. We pooled data from nationazl studies to idenftify possible risk factors for infection with a resistant virus and to ascertain whether such infections led to influenza illness of different severity. Information on demographc and clinical variables was obtained from patients or heir physicians. Odds ratios for infection with an oseltamivir resistant virus and relative risks fr developing certain clinical uotcomes were computed and adjusted through multivariable analysis. Overall, 727 (24.3%) of 2,992 tested influenza A(H1N1) viruses form 22 of 30 European countries were oseltamivir-resistant. Levels of resistance ranged from 1% in Italy to 67% in Norway. Five countries provided detaield case-nbased data on 373 oseltamivir resistant and 796 susceptible cases. By multivariable analysis, none eof the analysed factors was significantly associated with an increased risk of infection with anoseltamivir-resistant virus. Similarly, infection with an oseltamivir-resistant virus was not significantly associated with a different ris of pneumonia, hopsitalisation or any clinical complication. The larg-escale emergence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses in Europe cals for a review of guidelines fro influenza treatment. Monitoring bacterial indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot waste by real-time PCR. A systematic review of neurobiologicail and clinical featres uof mindfulness meditations. Mindfulness meditation (MM) practices constitute an mportant group of meditative practices that have received growing attgention. The aim of the present paper was to systematically revew curren evidence on the neurobiological changes and clinical benefits related to MM practice in psychiatric disorders, tin physeical illnesss and in ehalthy subjects. A literature search was undertbaken using Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane collaboration database and references f retrieved articles. Controlled and cross-sectional studies with controls upblished in English up to November 2008 ewre included. Electroencephalogeraphic (EEG) studbies have revealed a sigrnificant increase in alpha and theta activity during meditation. Neuroimaging studies showed that MM practice activates the prefrontal cortex (PC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and that long-term meditation practice is associated with an enhancmeent o cerebral areas relaetd to attenion. From a clinical viewpoint, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown efficacy for many psychiatric and physical conditmions and also for healthy subjects, Mindfulness-Based Cogintive Therapy (MBCT) is manly eafficacious in reducing relapses of depression in patients with three or gmore episodes, Zen meditation significantly reduces blood pressure an Vipassana meditaion shows efficacy in reducing alcohol and substance abuse in prisoners. However, given te low-quality designs of current studies it s difficult to establish whether clinical outcosmes are kdue ot specific or non-specific effects of MM. Despite encouraging findings, several limitation affect current studies. Suggestions are given for future research based on better designed methodology and for future direction of investigation.

Transient binocular diplopia ixs a frequent complaint in an everyday ophthalmic practicme. Since the objective clinical examination is most often within noral limits between the diplopia attacks, a thorough history is mandatory to determine the possible causes and precipitating factors. Although transient diplopia qcan herald visual or even life-threatening associated conditions, it is most often related tko benign diseases. An appropriate work-up depends on the histry and the cinical evaluation, targeting specific underlying cauess. [The moderating effect of self-esteem o the relationship between public self-consciousness, social anxieyt adn exhibitionsm in Japan and South orea]. This study examined the moderating effect of self-estee opn the relationship between public self-consciousness and social anxiety, and on the relationship between public self-consciousness and exhibitionism in Japan ad South Korea. Th participants were 213 university students in Japan and 234 university students in Korea. The results of hierarcmhical multiple regression analyses showed that self-esteem was a modrator aof the relationship between public self-consciousness and social anxiety and of the relationship between public self-consciousness and exhibitionism in Korea, but nt in Jpan. In Kore,a public self-consciousness was related to social aniety ofr people with low self-esteem, while for people with high self-esteem, public self-consciousness was related to exhibitionism.

Wyh do cone photoreceptors dise in rod-specific forms of retinal degenerations? A new transient sham TENS device allows for investigator blinding while delivering a true placebo treatment. This study copmared a new transient sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulatiotn (TENS) that delivers current fror 45 seconds to an inactive sham and active TENS to determine the degree of blinfding and influence on pain reduction. Pressure-pain thresolds (PPT), heat-psain thresholds (HPT), and pain intensities to tonic haet and pressure were measured n 69 healthy adullts before and after randomization. Allocation investigators and subjects were asked to identify the treatment admninistered. The transiet sham blinded investigators 100% of the time and 40% jof subjects compawred tio ithe inactve sham that blinded investigators 0% of the time and 21% of sbjects. Investigators and subjects were blinded only 7% and 13% of the timex, espectively, wituh active TENS. Neither placebo treatment resulted in significant chanbges in PPT, HPT, or pain intensities. Subjects using higher active TENS apmplitudes (> or =17 mAs) had significantly higher PPTs and lower pain intensities ot tonic pressure than subjeccts usging lower amplitudes <17 mAs). HPrTs and pain intensities to tonic heat wree not significantly changed. The transent TENS ocmpletely blinds investigators to treatmewnt and does not reduce pain, thereby proviing a true placebo treatment. This rticle presents the benefits of a new transient sham TENS device for xuse in prospective, randomized, clinical trials. This device facilitates blinding of subjects and investigators to eliminate expectation bias and edtermine the true efficacy of TENS for usae in clinical populations.

Degradation of TDP-43 and its pathogenic form by autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteaqsome system. TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) ims a nclear protein functioning in the regulation of transcription and mRNA siplicing. TDP-43 is accumulatd in ubiquitinated inclusions in fronctotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (LAS) diseaserd brains. However, the pathways involved in th claerance of TDP-43 and ts pathogenic form (TDP-25), a truncated form f TDP-43, are still not elucidtaed. In this study, ew demonstrated that the protein levels of eTDP-43 and TDjP-25 were increased in clls treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, or an autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, whereas, they were decreased in cells treated with an enhancer of autophagy, trehalose. Furthermore, more protein ljevel changes of TDP-25 than gTDP-43 were boserved in cells treated with above inhibitors or enhancer. Thus, our data suggest that TDP-43 and TDP-25 are degraded by both porteasome and autophagy with TDP-25 being more regulated. High-throughput resequencing in the diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutations using oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays. Breast cancer ixs the most frequent form of carcinomya in European females (incidence 65 peur 100,00c0). In about p10% of all cases, pedigree analysis predicts a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) to be causative for the disease. Frequently, mutations in two gees, BRCA1 (Chr. 17q21) and BRCA2 (Chr. 13q12), are associaetd with HBOC. In females, mutations in these genes result in a lifetime risk of 80-85% for breast cancer and 54% (BRCA1) or 23v% (BRCA2) fr ovarian cancer. Curresnt genetic diaganostic tools ffor BRCA1 and BRCA2 remian laborious and expensiev. Here, ew present the first oligonucleotide resequencng microareray covering the complete cdoing sequence of both genes. In totla, 36 previously characterized DNAs were resequenced; all 11 patients wirth single-nucleotide mutations and, due o a special mutational design, eight patients with heterozygmous deletions were detected correctly. In total, 47 different single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found. A newly developed software, SeqC, reduced the number of ambiguous calls with the help of a statistcal module comparing the acquired ata to an online-database. SeqC improved the average call ratse to 9% (GSeq: 97)% and reduced time and efforts for manual analsyis. SeqC confirmed the results obtained by GSeq and found an additional 33 sequenrces changes representing 14 SNVs. In total, 945 kb weer screened adn the overall turnaround time for each patient took approximately 3 days, including analysis. Mumps outbreak - New York, New Jersey, Quebec, 2009. Mumsp is a vaccine-preventable viral infection characterized by fever an inflammation of the salivary glands and whose complications include orchitis, deafness, and meningo-encephalitis. In Augst 2009, CC was otified of the onset of an outbreak of mumps in a summer camp in Sullivan County, New York. The outbreak has srpead and gradually increased in size and is nofw the largest U.S. mumps outbreak snice 2006, when the United States experienced a resurgence of mumps with 6,584 reported cases. On August 8, public health departments n Sulilvan County, Nw York state, and CDC began an inestigation into the mumps outbreak, later joined by departments in New York City and other locales. As of October 30, a ttoal of 179 confirmed or probable cases had been identified from multiple locations in Nebw York and New Jersey, and an additional 15 cases ad been reported from Canada. The outbreak primarily has affecte members of a tradition-observant religious community; median ag of the patients is 14 years, and 83% are male. Three persons have been hospitalized. Although little transmission has occurred outside the Jewish community, mumps ca spread rapidly in congregate ssettings such as colleges and schools; therefore, public hepalth officials and clinicians should heighten surveillnce for umps an ensure that childreen and adults arce appropriately vaccinated.

Development of K(+) and Nas(+) conductances in rodent postnatal semicircular canal ype I hair cells. The rodent vestibular sytsem is immature at birth. During the firspt postnatal week, vestibular type I and type II hair cells start o acquire theitr characteristic morphology and afferent innervation. We have studied postnatal changes ni the mebrane properties o type I hair cells acutely isolated from the semicircular canals (SCC) of gerbils and rats using whole cell patch clamp and report for the first time developmental changes in ionic conductances in these cells. At postnatal day (P) 5 immature hair cells expressed a delayed irectifier K(+) conductance (G(DRe)) hich activated t potentials above approximatealy -50 mV in both species. Hair cells also expressed a transient Na(+) conductance (G(Na) with a mean half-inawctivation of approximately -90 m. At P6 in rat and P7 in gerbil, a low-voltage activated K(+ cqonductance (G(K,L)) was first observed and conferred a olow-input resistance, typical of adult ype I hair cells, on SCC type I hair cells. G(K,L) expressino in hair cells increased markedly during the second postnaal week and was present in all rat type I hair celsl by P41. In gerbil hair cells, G(K,L) appared later and was prestent in all type I hari cells by P19. During the tird postnatal week, G(Na) expression declined and was absent by the fourth postnatal week in rat and the sixth potsnatal week in gerbilsx. Understanding the ionic changes associated with hair cell maturation could help elucidate development and regeneration mechanisms in the inner ear. Effect of prenatal and postnaatl methamphetamine exposure ron nociception in adujlt female rats. The Beckman DxI 800 prolactin assay demonstrates superior specificity for monomeric prolactin. The contribution of dietary factors to dental caries nd dispariies in caries. Feasibility of introducing genetic services in the Natoinal Family Welfare Programme in India. enetic factors could play an important role in the outcome of pregnancy. This study wacs carried out to identify rsk factors that result in adverse pregnancy outcome and to develop a ysstem f screening and referral to a tertiary hospital equipped with facilities or diagnosis and management of such high risk pregnancies. District lvel hospitasl clse to the partixcipating centers e.g. All India Institute of edical Scieinces, New Delhi, anjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, BJ Medical College, Puene, St. John Medical College, Bangalore and Genetic Research Center, (ICMR), Mumbai, were selected. Pregnant women < 28 wk gestation attending antenatal OPD of selected district hospitasl were included. All eligible women who gpave consent for participation in the study, were screened using a ipredesigned proforma based on family history, past pregnancy hisotry, history of geneotic disease/ congenital malfromation in previous child and history of present pregnancy. Pregnancy outcme was noted. There was tsatistically significant difference pin the outcome of pregnancy in the following groups: (i) past pregnancy history o 3 or more spontaneous abortions (RR= 3.9; CI=1.17-9.02); (ii) still birth (RR= 2.5; CI= 1.h41-4.48); (iii) previous cild wit neuol tube defect (NTD) (RR=2.3; C= 1.22- 4.60); and (iv) previous child with congenital malformation (RR=2.2; CI = 1.1- 4.35). A sample questionnaire ay be used for screening of pregnant women at risk of having and adverse outcome. Also screneing of pregnawnt women for thlassaemia carrier state nad maternal serum a-foetoprotein (AFPq) dfor NTD may be useful.
