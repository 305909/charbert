Does BLM helicase unwind nucleosomal DNA? RecQ helicases maintain chromosome stability by resolving several highly specific DNA structures. BLM, the protein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, is a member of the RecQ helicase family, and possesses both DNA-unwinding and strand-annealing activity. In this study, we have investigated the unwinding activity of BLM on nucleosomal DNA, the natural nuclear substrate for the enzyme. We generated a DNA template including a strong nucleosome-positioning sequence flanked by forked DNA, which is reportedly one of the preferred DNA substrates for BLM. BLM did not possess detectable unwinding activity toward the forked DNA substrate. However, the truncated BLM, lacking annealing activity, unwound it partially. In the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the unwinding activity of both the full-length and the truncated BLMs was promoted. Next, the histone octamer was reconstituted onto the forked DNA to generate a forked mononucleosome. Full-length BLM did not unwind the nucleosomal DNA, but truncated BLM unwound it partially. The unwinding activity for the mononucleosome was not promoted dramatically with RPA. These results indicate that full-length BLM may require additional factors to unwind nucleosomal DNA in vivo, and that RPA is, on its own, unable to perform this auxiliary function.

The application of fluorescent probes for the analysis of lipid dynamics during phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process whereby specialized leukocytes ingest large particles. This is an extremely dynamic and localized process that requires the recruitment to the sites of ingestion of numerous effector proteins, together with extensive lipid remodelling. To investigate such a dynamic series of events in living cells, non-invasive methods are required. The use of fluorescent probes in conjunction with spectroscopic analysis is optimally suited for this purpose. Here we describe a method to express in RAW264.7 murine macrophages genetically encoded probes that allow for the spatio-temporal analysis of lipid distribution and metabolism during phagocytosis of immunoglobulin-opsonized beads. The fluorescence of the probes is best analysed by laser scanning or spinning disc confocal microscopy. While the focus of this chapter is on phagocytic events, this general method can be employed for the analysis of lipid distribution and dynamics during a variety of biological processes in the cell type of the investigator's choice.

Tinea capitis in Southeastern China: a 16-year survey. This survey was a retrospective of a 16-year (1993-2008) study on the incidence, clinical features, and etiological agents of tinea capitis mainly representing the Southeastern China. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct microscopic examination. Eight hundred and sixty-six patients with tinea capitis, 381 males (44%) and 485 females (56%), were enrolled in this study. Patients were between 20 days and 84 years old with an average of 10.5 years and the peak incidence was in the age group of 6-10 (48.5%). Five hundred and sixty-two patients (64.9%) were ectothrix and 303 patients (35.0%) were endothrix with only one patient was favus. The incidence of tinea capitis from 1993 was gradually increasing and reaching to its peak in 2001. Positive cultures of dermatophytes were obtained in 715 patients: Microsporum canis (62.4%) was predominant, followed by Trichophyton violaceum (19.0%), Trichophyton tousurans (9.8%). M. canis was the major pathogen for ectothrix infection, while T. violaceum and T. tousurans contributed to the most endothrix form. M. canis, T. violaceum, and T. rubrum were the major pathogens for kerion.

The value of the early pregnancy assessment clinic in the management of early pregnancy complications. To determine the value of North York Hospital's Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic (EPAC) in the management of early pregnancy complications and its effect on the number of emergency room (ER) visits. The EPAC was opened in August 2005 at North York General Hospital. The number of patients being assessed, the sources of referral, the reasons for referral and the treatments provided in the clinic between January 2006 and December 2007 were reviewed. The number of patients attending the ER with the diagnoses of miscarriage, early pregnancy hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy one year prior to the opening of the EPAC (July 2004 to June 2005, year 0), during the first subsequent year (January to December 2006, year 1) and the second subsequent year (January to December 2007, year 2) were reviewed. Of the 1448 referrals to the EPAC during the two-year period, 38% were referred from the ER, 31% from family physicians, 24% from obstetricians, 2% from midwives, and 5% from other sources. The reasons for referral included confirmed missed miscarriage (450 patients, 31%), threatened miscarriage (471, 32.5%), complete miscarriage (182, 12.6%), ectopic pregnancy (111, 7.7%), incomplete miscarriage (59, 4.1%), hyperemesis gravidarum (23, 1.6%), and others (152, 10.5%). Through arrangements made by the clinic, 200 women underwent dilatation and curettage, and 133 were administered misoprostol to induce miscarriage. Fifty-seven patients with ectopic pregnancy received medical treatment with methotrexate, and 13 patients had surgery for ectopic pregnancy. There was no significant change in the total number of patients being assessed in the ER for early pregnancy hemorrhage, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy before and after the opening of the EPAC. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER for ectopic pregnancy, from 37% in year 0 (n = 24/65) to 24% in year 1 (n = 14/54) and 14.5% in year 2 (n = 9/62). There was also a trend towards a reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER for hemorrhage (year 0 = 32.4%; year 1 = 29.4%; year 2 = 27.5%), and miscarriage (year 0 = 19.5%; year 1 = 12.6%; year 2 = 16.9%). The EPAC is of significant value in the management of early pregnancy complications. It is particularly useful in the follow-up of patients with ectopic pregnancy and also helps to reduce the number of patients attending the ER for follow-up of other early pregnancy complications.

The gap junction proteome and its relationship to disease.

Effect of lumbar total disc arthroplasty on the segmental motion and intradiscal pressure at the adjacent level: an in vitro biomechanical study: presented at the 2008 Joint Spine Section Meeting Laboratory investigation. The artificial disc has been proposed as an alternative to spinal fusion for degenerative disc disease. The primary aim of this biomechanical study was to compare motion and intradiscal pressure (IDP) in a ball-and-socket artificial disc-implanted cadaveric lumbar spine, at the operative and adjacent levels, using a displacement-controlled setup. A secondary comparison involved a "salvage" construct, consisting of pedicle screws (PSs) added in supplementation to the artificial disc construct. Ten human cadaveric lumbosacral spines (L2-S1) were potted at L-2 and S-1. All measurements were initially made in the intact spine, followed by implantation of the artificial disc, and finally by the salvage PS condition. For the artificial disc condition, a Maverick ball-and-socket artificial disc was implanted at L4-5. For the PS condition, CD Horizon PSs were placed at L4-5, and the artificial disc was left in place. A displacement-controlled, custom-designed testing apparatus was used to impart motion in the sagittal and coronal planes. Motion at both the implanted level (L4-5) and immediately adjacent levels (L3-4 and L5-S1) was measured. Intradiscal pressure at the rostral adjacent level (L3-4) was also measured. The Tukey test was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). In flexion, no significant difference was noted between the artificial disc and the intact spine with regard to motion at the operative level, motion at adjacent levels, or IDP. In lateral bending, while the artificial disc significantly decreased operative-level motion (p < 0.05), no significant difference was noted in adjacent-level motion or IDP. With regard to extension, the artificial disc significantly increased operative level motion and decreased the rostral adjacent level (L3-4) motion and IDP (p < 0.05). Caudal adjacent-level (L5-S1) motion was not significantly different. In flexion and lateral bending, the addition of PSs significantly decreased motion at the implanted level when compared with the intact spine and the artificial disc (p < 0.05). This decrease in motion at the index level was associated with a compensatory increase in motion at both adjacent levels in flexion only (p < 0.05), but not in lateral bending (p > 0.05). The IDP was significantly increased in lateral bending but not in flexion. With regard to extension, the significant decrease in IDP that was noted with the artificial disc persisted despite the addition of PSs (p < 0.05). The artificial disc either maintains or reduces adjacent-level motion and pressure, compared with the intact spine. The addition of PSs to the artificial disc construct leads to significantly increased motion at adjacent levels in flexion and significantly increased IDP in lateral bending. At the operative level, the artificial disc is associated with hypermobility in extension, which is restored to the intact state after the addition of supplementary PSs.

How to remove accumulated iodine in burn-injured patients. Absorption of large quantities of iodine, as induced by the use of topical antimicrobial povidone-iodine in burn-injured patients, may cause metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities as well as renal failure. To diminish iodine levels, haemodialysis was previously reported to be a suitable therapy. We therefore studied the kinetics of iodine in order to define the most optimal dialysis strategy. Two patients with elevated iodine levels (93.6 and 81.2 mg/L) underwent continuous dialysis with blood flows Q(B) 150 and 120 mL/min. Blood was sampled from the inlet and outlet dialysis line at several time points during a 7-h and 39-h 10-min period, respectively. Samples were analysed for iodine with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) method. Kinetic analysis was performed using one and two compartmental models, deriving kinetic parameters: plasmatic volume V(1), extraplasmatic volume V(2) and intercompartmental clearance K(12). The calibrated kinetic model of Patient 2 was further used to simulate different dialysis strategies: 12-h per day with Q(B) 240, 6-h per day with Q(B) 480 and 240, and 12-h every 2 days with Q(B) 240. For each strategy, the mean average plasmatic and extraplasmatic concentration (TAC(p) and TAC(ep)) was calculated during 48 h. Iodine seemed to follow one compartmental kinetics when serum sample collections were limited to the first 7 h of dialysis (Patient 1), but iodine appeared to be distributed in two volumes (V(1)=19.4 L, V(2)=38.0 L and K(12)=55 mL/min) when a longer observation period was taken into account (Patient 2). The simulations disclosed that 12-h dialysis per day with Q(B) 240 or continuous dialysis with Q(B) 120 resulted in the lowest TAC(p) (18.2 and 19.0 microg/L) and TAC(ep) (34.4 and 36.1 microg/L). In patients with elevated iodine levels, especially when associated with renal failure, haemodialysis with a minimum 12-h duration with sufficient blood flow should be the first choice to remove iodine.

Protostadienol synthase from Aspergillus fumigatus: functional conversion into lanosterol synthase. Oxidosqualene:protostadienol cyclase (OSPC) from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, catalyzes the cyclization of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene into protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol which is the precursor of the steroidal antibiotic helvolic acid. To shed light on the structure-function relationship between OSPC and oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSLC), we constructed an OSPC mutant in which the C-terminal residues (702)APPGGMR(708) were replaced with (702)NKSCAIS(708), as in human OSLC. As a result, the mutant no longer produced the protostadienol, but instead efficiently produced a 1:1 mixture of lanosterol and parkeol. This is the first report of the functional conversion of OSPC into OSLC, which resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the V(max)/K(M) value, whereas the binding affinity for the substrate did not change significantly. Homology modeling suggested that stabilization of the C-20 protosteryl cation by the active-site Phe701 through cation-pi interactions is important for the product outcome between protostadienol and lanosterol.

The C53/C37 subcomplex of RNA polymerase III lies near the active site and participates in promoter opening. The C53 and C37 subunits of RNA polymerase III (pol III) form a subassembly that is required for efficient termination; pol III lacking this subcomplex displays increased processivity of RNA chain elongation. We show that the C53/C37 subcomplex additionally plays a role in formation of the initiation-ready open promoter complex similar to that of the Brf1 N-terminal zinc ribbon domain. In the absence of C53 and C37, the transcription bubble fails to stably propagate to and beyond the transcriptional start site even when the DNA template is supercoiled. The C53/C37 subcomplex also stimulates the formation of an artificially assembled elongation complex from its component DNA and RNA strands. Protein-RNA and protein-DNA photochemical cross-linking analysis places a segment of C53 close to the RNA 3' end and transcribed DNA strand at the catalytic center of the pol III elongation complex. We discuss the implications of these findings for the mechanism of transcriptional termination by pol III and propose a structural as well as functional correspondence between the C53/C37 subcomplex and the RNA polymerase II initiation factor TFIIF.

An investigation of teaching staff members' and parents' views on the current state of adaptive seating technology and provision. It is recognized that for children with poor postural control, a comfortable adaptive seating system which provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential for raising their overall level of well being. The purpose of this study was to investigate the views of teaching staff members at special needs schools and of the parents of children who attended these schools on the provision and current technology of seating systems. Two similar questionnaires intended to elicit the views of teaching staff and the parents of children attending these schools were designed and distributed to these groups. Dissatisfaction exists with reliability of these systems and the time it takes for replacement systems to be issued. The perceived importance of adaptive seating role in the user being accepted by peers was found to be statistically different between the two groups. Time spent per day transferring the child to and from seating systems was found to be greater than 1 h for both groups. Scope remains for improvements to be made in adaptive seating provision and technology. Although mainly descriptive, these results could be of use when developing newer systems and improving services.

Procalcitonin: inflammatory biomarker for assessing the severity of community-acquired pneumonia--a clinical observation in geriatric patients. Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease of the elderly and involves a high mortality risk. Demographic developments are creating new challenges for acute medical treatment strategies in geriatric patients with their underlying multimorbidity. In addition to the diagnostic parameters recorded on hospital admission, such as white cell count and C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, more than the risk scores CRB- and CURB-65 evaluated to date, appears to be a promising parameter for assessing the severity of pneumonia in elderly patients to allow early detection of severe courses and initiation of suitable treatment. The decisive factor is the dynamic course of the procalcitonin values over 3 consecutive days, as demonstrated in this case series.

Motivations for training as an SCPHN in Northern Ireland. Several policy consultations addressing post-registration nursing careers have followed the creation of the specialist community public health nurse (SCPHN) part of the NMC register, for health visitors, school nurses and occupational health nurses. This study surveyed a cohort of students (n = 44) starting a SCPHN programme, to explore what factors influenced their decision to train for this part of the register, and whether these differed according to previous experience or chosen pathway. The most highly rated factors were an interest in health promotion, a desire to work in community settings, and more involvement in the social aspects of health. These factors were closely linked with aspirations of career progression. There was no significant difference between previous experience and factors influencing career change decisions. However, there were some variations between chosen pathways, with occupational health respondents prioritising factors differently to their health visiting and school nursing counterparts. It is recommended that research is conducted into occupational health nursing roles, SCPHN proficiencies reviewed, and more flexible educational programmes developed.

Regulation of epithelial stem cell replacement and follicle formation in the Drosophila ovary. Though much has been learned about the process of ovarian follicle maturation through studies of oogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, less is known about how follicles form initially. In Drosophila, two somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs) in each ovariole give rise to all polar cells, stalk cells, and main body cells needed to form each follicle. We show that one daughter from each FSC founds most follicles but that cell type specification is independent of cell lineage, in contrast to previous claims of an early polar/stalk lineage restriction. Instead, key intercellular signals begin early and guide cell behavior. An initial Notch signal from germ cells is required for FSC daughters to migrate across the ovariole and on occasion to replace the opposite stem cell. Both anterior and posterior polar cells arise in region 2b at a time when approximately 16 cells surround the cyst. Later, during budding, stalk cells and additional polar cells are specified in a process that frequently transfers posterior follicle cells onto the anterior surface of the next older follicle. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie stem cell replacement and follicle formation during Drosophila oogenesis.

Cardiac effects of varying pulse charge and polarity of TASER conducted electrical weapons. The TASER(R) CEW (Conducted Electrical Weapon) is rapidly replacing the club in the English-speaking world for assisting in the arrest of resistant subjects and is now used by the majority of law enforcement agencies in the USA, Canada, and the UK. Animal safety studies of the CEW have focused on the risk of VF. We sought to determine the difference in cardiac capture and VF risk between the approximately 102 +/- 8 microC of the ubiquitous X26 and a me-tered 72 microC charge from an experimental device. It is well established from the bidomain theory and experimental data that a pacing electrode will capture the heart with significantly lower charge when the electrode touching the cardiac tissue is a cathode However, experimental data show that there is no difference in the ability of the anode vs the cathode to induce VF. We sought to evaluate the effect of polarity changes on cardiac capture and the induction of VF. Small swine ( approximately 20.0 kg) were anesthetized and ventilated. The apex of the heart was located via echocar-diography and a CEW probe was fully inserted towards the apex. Echocardiography was used to monitor cardiac contractions to determine cardiac capture. Both the X26 and the 72 microC pulses were delivered at both polarities to test for cardiac capture. Higher charge pulses (375 microC) were then delivered with both polarities to test for VF risk. The 72 microC experimental unit was unable to cause cardiac capture even in small swine with fully inserted probes directly over the apex of the heart. We found no polarity effect in the risk of VF in small swine with larger charge ( approximately 5x) pulses.

Neonatal bladder inflammation produces functional changes and alters neuropeptide content in bladders of adult female rats. Neonatal bladder inflammation has been demonstrated to produce hypersensitivity to bladder re-inflammation as an adult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of neonatal urinary bladder inflammation on adult bladder function and structure. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on postnatal days 14 to 16 with intravesical zymosan or anesthesia alone. At 12 to 16 weeks of age, micturition frequency and cystometrograms were measured. Similarly treated rats had their bladders removed for measurement of plasma extravasation after intravesical mustard oil, for neuropeptide analysis (calcitonin gene-related peptide or Substance P) or for detailed histological examination. Rats treated with zymosan as neonates exhibited increased micturition frequency, reduced micturition volume thresholds, greater extravasation of Evans blue after intravesical mustard oil administration, and greater total bladder content of calcitonin gene-related peptide and Substance P. In contrast, there were no quantitative histological changes in the thickness, fibrosis, or mast cells of bladder tissue due to neonatal zymosan treatments. Functional changes in urologic systems observed in adulthood, coupled with the increased neuropeptide content and neurogenic plasma extravasation in adult bladders, suggest that the neonatal bladder inflammation treatment enhanced the number, function, and/or neurochemical content of primary afferent neurons. These data support the hypothesis that insults to the urologic system in infancy may contribute to the development of adult bladder hypersensitivity. Inflammation of the bladder early in life in the rat has multiple sequelae, including laboratory measures that suggest an alteration of the neurophysiological substrates related to the bladder. Some painful bladder syndromes in humans have similar characteristics and so may be due to similar mechanisms.

Specific inhibition of bile acid transport alters plasma lipids and GLP-1. Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor in development against chronic constipation (CC) and constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The objectives of this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat. Effects on plasma lipids and BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with dyslipidemia while changes of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by elobixibat was assayed in samples from a 14 day high-dose elobixibat study in patients with CC. Thirty-six dyslipidemic patients, 21 females, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg elobixibat or placebo once daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary endpoints included other lipid parameters and serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC treated with high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days, was evaluated for changes in GLP-1. In the dyslipidemia study LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % (p = 0.044), and the LDL/HDL ratio was decreased by 18 % (p = 0.004). Serum C4 increased, indicating that BA synthesis was induced. No serious adverse events were recorded. In the CC study, GLP-1 increased significantly in both the 15 mg (20.7 ± 2.4 pmol/L; p = 0.03) and the 20 mg group (25.6 ± 4.9 pmol/L; p = 0.02). Elobixibat reduces LDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio and increase circulating peak GLP-1 levels, the latter in line with increased intestinal BA mediated responses in humans.

[Dermatophytosis: a summary of dermatomycosis as a proposal for future revision of the guidelines]. In preparing guidelines for dermatomycosis (tinea, trichophytia, dermatophytosis), we have primarily summarized the disease types and treatments as described in 4 textbooks used in Japan and abroad. We present our classification draft based on these following descriptions. In Japan, any dermatophytosis other than favus or tinea imbricata is considered to be tinea, while outside Japan, favus and tinea imbricata are also classified as tinea. Tinea capitis is classified together with trichophytia superficialis capillitii and kerion celsi, in a group that tends to include asymptomatic carriers. Most textbooks generally classify trichophytia profunda of the glabrous skin and granuloma trichophyticum as subtypes of tinea corporis. Tinea faciei can easily be misdiagnosed, but in many cases can be distinguished from tinea corporis by its specific clinical picture. Tinea unguium is regarded as one type of onychomycosis. We present a summary of dermatomycosis treatment as a proposal for future revision of the guidelines. One of the problems in the treatment of tinea capitis is that the safety of itraconazole (ITZ) and terbinafine hydrochloride (TBF) in children has not been established. Severity criteria for concomitant use of oral medications in the treatment of tinea pedis remains to should be established. Although many clinical studies concerning tinea unguium have been published, 3 of the 4 textbooks we consulted clearly stated that most of those studies were conducted by pharmaceutical companies. Further studies on the etiology and disease severity of tinea unguium are needed.

Influences of clonality on plant sexual reproduction. Flowering plants possess an unrivaled diversity of mechanisms for achieving sexual and asexual reproduction, often simultaneously. The commonest type of asexual reproduction is clonal growth (vegetative propagation) in which parental genotypes (genets) produce vegetative modules (ramets) that are capable of independent growth, reproduction, and often dispersal. Clonal growth leads to an expansion in the size of genets and increased fitness because large floral displays increase fertility and opportunities for outcrossing. Moreover, the clonal dispersal of vegetative propagules can assist "mate finding," particularly in aquatic plants. However, there are ecological circumstances in which functional antagonism between sexual and asexual reproductive modes can negatively affect the fitness of clonal plants. Populations of heterostylous and dioecious species have a small number of mating groups (two or three), which should occur at equal frequency in equilibrium populations. Extensive clonal growth and vegetative dispersal can disrupt the functioning of these sexual polymorphisms, resulting in biased morph ratios and populations with a single mating group, with consequences for fertility and mating. In populations in which clonal propagation predominates, mutations reducing fertility may lead to sexual dysfunction and even the loss of sex. Recent evidence suggests that somatic mutations can play a significant role in influencing fitness in clonal plants and may also help explain the occurrence of genetic diversity in sterile clonal populations. Highly polymorphic genetic markers offer outstanding opportunities for gaining novel insights into functional interactions between sexual and clonal reproduction in flowering plants.

Hepatic and portal venous Doppler waveforms and flow velocities in normal pregnancy. Although the flow velocities of portal veins (PV) and flow patterns of hepatic veins (HV) during pregnancy were evaluated in the literature, changes in PV flow pattern during pregnancy have not been assessed. The aim of this study was to detect changes in HV and PV flow velocities and patterns during pregnancy. One hundred sixty-three healthy pregnant women aged 17-42 years-old (mean: 26.9+/-5.1) were included in the study. Twenty-seven were in the first trimester (group 1), 89 in the second trimester (group 2), and 47 in the third trimester (group 3). Maximum and minimum flow velocities and waveforms were obtained from the hepatic vein (HV) and the main portal vein (PV) of the subjects. The flow patterns were recorded as monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic waveforms. Maximum flow velocity of PV was higher in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Although some subjects had a monophasic flow pattern of the PV, a biphasic flow pattern was prominent in all groups. A triphasic PV waveform was not observed in any of the groups. In the HV the triphasic waveform was prominent in the first trimester and biphasic in the second and third trimesters. When evaluating physiological changes in pregnancy, flow pattern changes of the HV and flow velocity changes of the PV may be accepted as sensitive parameters and may be indicators of physiological alterations related to pregnancy.

Substrate-mediated stabilization of a tetrameric drug target reveals Achilles heel in anthrax. Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax. With the increased threat of anthrax in biowarfare, there is an urgent need to characterize new antimicrobial targets from B. anthracis. One such target is dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyzes the committed step in the pathway yielding meso-diaminopimelate and lysine. In this study, we employed CD spectroscopy to demonstrate that the thermostability of DHDPS from B. anthracis (Ba-DHDPS) is significantly enhanced in the presence of the substrate, pyruvate. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of the enzyme is 3-fold tighter in the presence of pyruvate compared with the apo form. To examine the significance of this substrate-mediated stabilization phenomenon, a dimeric mutant of Ba-DHDPS (L170E/G191E) was generated and shown to have markedly reduced activity compared with the wild-type tetramer. This demonstrates that the substrate, pyruvate, stabilizes the active form of the enzyme. We next determined the high resolution (2.15 A) crystal structure of Ba-DHDPS in complex with pyruvate (3HIJ) and compared this to the apo structure (1XL9). Structural analyses show that there is a significant (91 A(2)) increase in buried surface area at the tetramerization interface of the pyruvate-bound structure. This study describes a new mechanism for stabilization of the active oligomeric form of an antibiotic target from B. anthracis and reveals an "Achilles heel" that can be exploited in structure-based drug design.

Rheumatic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. This article reviews the literature concerning rheumatic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including common immune-mediated pathways, frequency, clinical course and therapy. Musculoskeletal complications are frequent and well-recognized manifestations in IBD, and affect up to 33% of patients with IBD. The strong link between the bowel and the osteo-articular system is suggested by many clinical and experimental observations, notably in HLA-B27 transgenic rats. The autoimmune pathogenic mechanisms shared by IBD and spondyloarthropathies include genetic susceptibility to abnormal antigen presentation, aberrant recognition of self, the presence of autoantibodies against specific antigens shared by the colon and other extra-colonic tissues, and increased intestinal permeability. The response against microorganisms may have an important role through molecular mimicry and other mechanisms. Rheumatic manifestations of IBD have been divided into peripheral arthritis, and axial involvement, including sacroiliitis, with or without spondylitis, similar to idiopathic ankylosing spondylitis. Other periarticular features can occur, including enthesopathy, tendonitis, clubbing, periostitis, and granulomatous lesions of joints and bones. Osteoporosis and osteomalacia secondary to IBD and iatrogenic complications can also occur. The management of the rheumatic manifestations of IBD consists of physical therapy in combination with local injection of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; caution is in order however, because of their possible harmful effects on intestinal integrity, permeability, and even on gut inflammation. Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine and leflunomide should be used for selected indications. In some cases, tumor necrosis factor-alpha blocking agents should be considered as first-line therapy.

Dioxins and organohalogen contaminants in the Asia-Pacific region. This article reviews the outcome of comprehensive investigations conducted in our laboratory at CMES, Ehime University over the past three decades on the distribution, sources, temporal trends and toxic impacts of the persistent and bioaccumulative organohalogen contaminants in Asia-Pacific region with a particular emphasis on developing countries. Results of multi-media monitoring studies were compiled and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues of dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have been heavily used. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These groups of contaminants, together with polychlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing region, indicating the necessity for long term monitoring. The open dumping sites for municipal wastes in major cities are significant sources of many toxic chemicals, and these areas are probably one of the challenges for future research due to the long term impacts on the environmental quality and human health. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast milk of residents living in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generations. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecosystems and human health.

Rehabilitation of ankle and foot injuries in athletes. Foot and ankle injuries are extremely common among athletes and other physically active individuals. Rehabilitation programs that emphasize the use of therapeutic exercise to restore joint range of motion, muscle strength, neuromuscular coordination, and gait mechanics have been shown to have clinical success for patients suffering various foot and ankle pathologies. Rehabilitation programs are discussed for ankle sprains, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and turf toe.

Combined and sequential delivery of bioactive VEGF165 and HGF from poly(trimethylene carbonate) based photo-cross-linked elastomers. The ability of trimethylene carbonate (TMC) based elastomers to release bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) separately and in combined and sequential fashions using an osmotic release mechanism was investigated. A TMC-based elastomer was chosen since TMC degrades without producing potentially harmful acidic degradation products, and its mechanical properties can be tailored by copolymerizing with D,L-lactide (DLLA) and epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) and by controlling the cross-link density. The bioactivities of released VEGF(165) and HGF were assessed using the proliferation of human aortic endothelial (HAEC) and CCL 208 monkey lung epithelial cell lines. VEGF(165) and HGF were lyophilized separately or together with trehalose, rat serum albumin (RSA) and NaCl. No significant elastomer degradation occurred over the initial 8 weeks, during which the bulk of the embedded growth factors were released. The presence of a low concentration of NaCl in the release media did not affect the viability of HAEC and CCL 208 cells. The TMC-based elastomer was able to provide a sustained release of highly bioactive VEGF(165) and HGF for more than 10 days. When released in combination from the same device, VEGF(165) and HGF were released at similar rates. By preparing a dual-layered cylinder, in which VEGF(165) was in the outer layer and HGF in the inner layer, a constant release of VEGF alone was first obtained, followed by overlapping and constant release of the two growth factors after a period of 4days. This study demonstrates the potential of TMC-based elastomers combined with an osmotic mechanism to release acid-sensitive growth factors in bioactive form alone and in combination, in controlled rates and sequences.

Pityriasis rosea during etanercept therapy. Multiple bioengineered agents has been recently developed to attack other parts of the immune/inflammatory system, achieving therapeutic implications for dermatologic diseases. On the other side, each new therapy has the potential for adverse cutaneous reactions. We present herein the first two cases of Gibert's pityriasis rosea occurring during etanercept therapy and discuss possible links between this common, etiologically still unexplained exanthema and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha drugs.

Ulnar Mammary syndrome and TBX3: expanding the phenotype. We present a patient with features of Ulnar Mammary syndrome (UMS) consisting of bilateral ulnar defects, inverted nipples, short stature with associated growth hormone deficiency, and cryptorchidism. Our patient also had a hypoplastic anterior pituitary and an ectopic posterior pituitary gland, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and cardiac conduction defects consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although TBX3 is known to be expressed in both the developing heart and the pituitary gland, conduction defects and anatomical pituitary abnormalities have not been previously described in UMS. This may, in part, be due to the fact that these features are not actively sought in individuals with UMS. Because these new findings have important clinical implications, we suggest that clinicians caring for individuals with UMS offer brain imaging, growth hormone testing, and cardiac arrhythmia screening. The diagnosis of UMS was confirmed on mutation analysis of TBX3. The mother of the propositus was also found to carry the same mutation, although she did not show the classical features of UMS. Therefore, our report also supports the variable expressivity of UMS within the same family.


The efficacy and safety of irbesartan in primary hypertension even if a dose is missed: Results from the NO PROBLEM Study.

Effect of carbon monoxide on gene expression in cerebrocortical astrocytes: Validation of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique to characterize changes in gene expression in complex cellular and tissue processes, such as cytoprotection or inflammation. The accurate assessment of changes in gene expression depends on the selection of adequate internal reference gene(s). Carbon monoxide (CO) affects several metabolic pathways and de novo protein synthesis is crucial in the cellular responses to this gasotransmitter. Herein a selection of commonly used reference genes was analyzed to identify the most suitable internal control genes to evaluate the effect of CO on gene expression in cultured cerebrocortical astrocytes. The cells were exposed to CO by treatment with CORM-A1 (CO releasing molecule A1) and four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of eight putative reference genes. Our results indicate that Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) together with Ppia (peptidylpropyl isomerase A) is the most suitable gene pair for normalization of qRT-PCR results under the experimental conditions used. Pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), Hprt1 (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase I), Sdha (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, Subunit A), Tbp (TATA box binding protein), Actg1 (actin gamma 1) and Rn18s (18S rRNA) genes presented less stable expression profiles in cultured cortical astrocytes exposed to CORM-A1 for up to 60 min. For validation, we analyzed the effect of CO on the expression of Bdnf and bcl-2. Different results were obtained, depending on the reference genes used. A significant increase in the expression of both genes was found when the results were normalized with Gapdh and Ppia, in contrast with the results obtained when the other genes were used as reference. These findings highlight the need for a proper and accurate selection of the reference genes used in the quantification of qRT-PCR results in studies on the effect of CO in gene expression.


[Myofibroblastic sarcoma of the larynx : a case report and review].

Mercury exposure and periodontitis among a Korean population: the Shiwha-Banwol environmental health study. The oral effect of chronic low-level mercury exposure is not completely understood. This study examined whether mercury exposure is associated with periodontitis. This study cross-sectionally surveyed 1,328 residents (598 males and 730 females) from the prospective Shiwha and Banwol cohort in Korea from July 2005 to August 2006 at baseline. Two dentists assessed periodontitis, an outcome, using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI): CPI 3 or 4 and CPI 0 to 2 were classified as periodontitis and non-periodontitis, respectively. The hair mercury level, the predictor, was analyzed. The mercury level was categorized according to the reference dose of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States: normal = <1 ppm and high = > or =1 ppm. Age, gender, economic status, smoking, frequency of daily toothbrushing, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity were assessed as confounders. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the adjusted association. Subgroup analyses for gender were also performed. Mercury exposure was independently associated with periodontitis (odds ratio = 3.17). Males with high mercury levels had a 50.0% higher probability of having periodontitis than females with normal mercury levels. Of them, the interaction effect between the body burden of mercury and gender was 39.0%. The odds ratio between periodontitis and high mercury levels was higher for males than females (95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 2.23 versus 0.59 to 1.26, respectively). These results suggest that mercury exposure had an independent association with periodontitis. High body-burden mercury in males might be a contributory factor linked with periodontitis.

Central and systemic inflammatory responses to thoracotomy - potential implications for acute and chronic postsurgical pain. Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) may affect up to 70% of patients after surgery. Glial and immune mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic postsurgical pain. Our objective was to study cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ and TNFα over a 72-hour period in patients undergoing a thoracotomy and oesophagectomy. Despite adequate pain control, thoracotomy was still associated with significant central and peripheral inflammation. This must be taken into consideration in planning future strategies to prevent CPSP. 


Rethinking HIV prevention to prepare for oral PrEP implementation for young African women.

High-fat diet caused widespread epigenomic differences on hepatic methylome in rat. A high-fat (HF) diet is associated with progression of liver diseases. To illustrate genome-wide landscape of DNA methylation in liver of rats fed either a control or HF diet, two enrichment-based methods, namely methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation assay with high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq), were performed in our study. Rats fed with the HF diet exhibited an increased body weight and liver fat accumulation compared with that of the control group when they were 12 wk of age. Genome-wide analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) showed that 12,494 DMRs induced by HF diet were hypomethylated and 6,404 were hypermethylated. DMRs with gene annotations [differentially methylated genes (DMGs)] were further analyzed to show gene-specific methylation profile. There were 88, 2,680, and 95 hypomethylated DMGs identified with changes in DNA methylation in the promoter, intragenic and downstream regions, respectively, compared with fewer hypermethylated DMGs (45, 1,623, and 50 in the respective regions). Some of these genes also contained an ACGT cis-acting motif whose DNA methylation status may affect gene expression. Pathway analysis showed that these DMGs were involved in critical hepatic signaling networks related to hepatic development. Therefore, HF diet had global impacts on DNA methylation profile in the liver of rats, leading to differential expression of genes in hepatic pathways that may involve in functional changes in liver development.

Polyelectrolyte multilayer-assisted fabrication of non-periodic silicon nanocolumn substrates for cellular interface applications. Recent advances in nanostructure-based biotechnology have resulted in a growing demand for vertical nanostructure substrates with elaborate control over the nanoscale geometry and a high-throughput preparation. In this work, we report the fabrication of non-periodic vertical silicon nanocolumn substrates via polyelectrolyte multilayer-enabled randomized nanosphere lithography. Owing to layer-by-layer deposited polyelectrolyte adhesives, uniformly-separated polystyrene nanospheres were securely attached on large silicon substrates and utilized as masks for the subsequent metal-assisted silicon etching in solution. Consequently, non-periodic vertical silicon nanocolumn arrays were successfully fabricated on a wafer scale, while each nanocolumn geometric factor, such as the diameter, height, density, and spatial patterning, could be fully controlled in an independent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that our vertical silicon nanocolumn substrates support viable cell culture with minimal cell penetration and unhindered cell motility due to the blunt nanocolumn morphology. These results suggest that vertical silicon nanocolumn substrates may serve as a useful cellular interface platform for performing a statistically meaningful number of cellular experiments in the fields of biomolecular delivery, stem cell research, etc.

[Cognitive behavioral therapy for social phobia]. This article discusses diagnostic features of social phobia, social skills and (anxious) avoidant personality disorder, and gives an overview on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy strategies used in social anxiety patients. Motivation to change and the therapeutic relationship are important issues to be worked on at the beginning and throughout therapy. Functional analysis focuses on interactional and systemic features. Three specific programmes dealing with anxiety management, social skills training and relaxation techniques are presented (Gruppentraining sozialer Kompetenzen, Hinsch und Pfingsten (2007); Soziale Phobien, ein kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutisches Behandlungsmanual, Stangier et al.

Management of schizophrenia with suicide risk. Suicidal behavior remains a major source of morbidity and mortality among schizophrenics. The National Institute of Mental Health Longitudinal Study of Chronic Schizophrenia found that over a mean of 6 years, 38% of the patients had at least one suicide attempt and 57% admitted to substantial suicidal ideation. Suicide is also a major issue among inpatients, with serious implications for clinical practice and patient-doctor relationships. The management of schizophrenic patients with suicide risk remains a difficult area for clinicians despite attempts to better understand it by gathering experts in the field. This article discusses the frequency of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia, offers a model for understanding it, and discusses various aspects of the management of the at-risk schizophrenic patient.

Right ventricular rupture due to recurrent mediastinal infection with a closed chest. Right ventricular (RV) rupture in cases of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery is a rare and dangerous complication. Bleeding from the right ventricle occurs mainly after sternal reopening, due to either iatrogenic manipulation (wire removal, lesions due to wiring maneuvers) or mechanical shearing forces, producing direct injury. We present a case of RV wall perforation due to infection in a recurrent postoperative mediastinitis with a closed chest. The current literature on treatment of postoperative mediastinitis is also reviewed.

The Economic Lives of People with Disabilities in Vietnam. Through a series of focus group discussions conducted in northern and central Vietnam, this study gives voice to the lived economic experience of families with disabilities and how they manage the economic challenges associated with disability. The dynamic of low and unstable income combined with on-going health care and other disability-related costs gives rise to a range of coping mechanisms (borrowing, reducing and foregoing expenditures, drawing upon savings and substituting labour) that helps to maintain living standards in the short-run yet threatens the longer-term welfare of both the individual with disability and their household. Current social protection programs were reported as not accessible to all and while addressing some immediate economic costs of disability, do not successfully meet current needs nor accommodate wider barriers to availing benefits.

Mapping radiation quality inside photon-irradiated absorbers by means of a twin-chamber method.

Aberration in hearing one's own voice can cause not only stuttering but also depression. The etiology of depression has not yet been defined with certainty. The successful use of botulinum toxin recently to treat depression has brought to attention the theories which connect emotions with facial muscles. According to facial feedback hypothesis, facial muscles not only express emotions but also cause and/or alter them. It has been long suggested that a disturbance in the process of hearing one's own voice can negatively affect the functioning of vocal muscles, and I suggest that the negative effect can extend to facial muscles leading at the end to depression. Using certain methods to restore the normal function of both vocal and facial muscles can hypothetically be a new treatment for depression.

[Multivariate analysis of risk of cardiac complications in Hodgkin's lymphoma]. A computer database was created to take care of a wide range of protocols for combined treatment of Hodgkin's disease stage I-IV (n=1,573). Early-onset radiation-related injuries (pneumonitis) and exposure of lung tissues to radiation were identified as the main risk factors for cardiopathology development. It is suggested that total focal dosage used after chemotherapy be reviewed since total dosage for the entire lymph collector in excess of 30 Gy might contribute to hazards of cardiopathology. However, a locally administered TTD ranging 36-44 Gy to deal with residual tumor offers best advantage in preventing local relapse. Nor does it increase the risk of future complications. Our approach might promote individualization of prognosis as far as cardiac complications involved in Hodgkin's lymphoma are concerned.

Synchrony of G6PD activity and RBC fragility under oxidative stress exerted at normal and G6PD deficiency. To investigative the effects of oxidative stress simultaneously on Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and RBC fragility under normal and G6PD defective conditions. The effects of several nitric oxide (NO) generating compounds and sulfhydryl blocking agents were simultaneously tested in vitro on hemolysate G6PD activities and RBC fragility. These effects were compared between normal subjects and patients with G6PD deficiency. The NO donor compounds nitrosocysteine, nitrosoarginine and diethylamine caused strong inhibition on normal and defective G6PD activities, while a similar inhibition was observed only at higher concentrations of the sulfhydryl blocking agents: 2-mercaptoethanol , cysteine and reduced glutathione. All these oxidative compounds promoted RBC hemolysis in parallel to their inhibition extents on G6PD activities. The protection of RBC from this hemolysis was achieved by preincubation with NADPH or SNP but not NAD(+) compound. A concomitant response of G6PD activities and RBC fragility towards the oxidative stress was established.

[A prospective study on the association between dyslipidemia and hypertension]. To discuss the risks of hypertension development with relation to the level of lipid variables among populations who had normal blood pressure at baseline study. In April 2000, under the support of project "prevention of metabolic syndrome and multi-metabolic disorders in Jiangsu province", a cohort study was performed to obtain the baseline data among 8685 persons from age 34 to 74. In June of 2006, a follow-up investigation was carried out among those who had been in the study for 5 years after the baseline study started. 2603 persons who met the selection criteria and showed normal blood pressure during baseline study, were recruited in this investigation. The interval from the baseline to the follow-up studies was 6.38 years on average. Relationship between the risk of developing hypertension and the baseline level of lipid variables were analyzed. Relations between baseline lipid levels and the incidence of hypertension during the follow-up was discovered. In gender and age adjusted model, the lipid variables were all associated with hypertension (trend test, P<0.01). In multivariable-adjusted model, HDL-C [aRR=0.71 (95%CI: 0.61-0.99)], non-HDL-C [aRR=1.28 (95%CI: 1.14-1.83)], TC/HDL-C ratio [aRR=1.41 (95%CI: 1.25-2.03)] and TG [aRR=1.49 (95%CI: 1.30-2.13)] were again associated with hypertension (trend test, P<0.05). Even the aRR was much weakened after the baseline SBP, DBP were adjusted with Cox model, the significant relation of hypertension to HDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio and TG still existed. Excluding the two factors of obesity (BMI> or =28) and diabetes which had been recognized in marked linking with hypertension, lipid variables were still associated with hypertension. Dyslipidemia might occur before being hypertensive. Hypertension was associated with HDL-C, TC/HDL-C and TG or even exclusion of obesity, diabetes and factors of smoking and drinking or baseline level of SBP, DBP were adjusted.


Could the bug Triatoma sherlocki be vectoring Chagas disease in small mining communities in Bahia, Brazil?

ATM regulates a RASSF1A-dependent DNA damage response. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the RASSF1 promoter is one of the most frequent events identified in human cancer. The epigenetic-driven loss of RASSF1A protein expression is observed more often in tumors of higher grade and correlates with a decreased responsiveness to DNA-damaging therapy. Ras association domain-containing family 1A (RASSF1A) promotes apoptosis by signaling through the MST2 and LATS1 kinases, leading to stabilization of the YAP1/p73 transcriptional complex. Here we provide evidence for a new pathway linking DNA damage signaling to RASSF1A via the main sensor of double-strand breaks in cells, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We show that, upon DNA damage, RASSF1A is phosphorylated by ATM on Ser131 and is involved in the activation of both MST2 and LATS1, leading to the stabilization of p73. Furthermore, lung and ovarian tumor cell lines that retain RASSF1A expression commonly harbor polymorphisms in the region of Ser131, and our analysis shows that the S131F polymorphism conveys resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, we present a novel DNA damage pathway emanating from ATM that is frequently disabled in tumors via epigenetic silencing of RASSF1 or mutation of an ATM phosphorylation site.

Application of the National Osteoporosis Foundation  Guidelines to postmenopausal women and men:  the Framingham Osteoporosis Study.

Comparison of HbA1c in Chinese patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes randomized to twice daily insulin lispro low mix 25 or twice daily human insulin mix 30/70. Glycemic control prevents onset and progression of diabetes-related long-term complications. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that twice daily insulin lispro low mix 25 is noninferior to twice daily human insulin mix 30/70 in achieving glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), from baseline to endpoint, in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. In this phase IV, crossover, open-label, multicenter study, 117 Chinese patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequence groups. One group received 12-week treatment with twice daily human insulin mix 30/70 followed by 12-week treatment with twice daily insulin lispro low mix 25, while the other group received the reverse treatment sequence. HbA1c, baseline-to-endpoint change in HbA1c, proportion of patients achieving target HbA1c <or= 7% and <or= 6.5%, fasting blood glucose, and daily insulin doses were measured for each period. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. A statistically significant reduction (P <or= 0.0001) of HbA1c was achieved after each treatment (human insulin mix 30/70: mean HbA1c = 7.91% (95%CI: 7.67%, 8.15%); insulin lispro low mix 25: mean HbA1c = 7.96% (95%CI: 7.72%, 8.20%)). The 95%CI (-0.20, 0.10) of the difference between the two treatments satisfied the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.3% (lower limit of 95% CI > -0.3%). No statistically significant differences between treatments were observed for any of the secondary efficacy measures. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and hypoglycemia between the two treatments and treatment sequence groups was similar. Three serious adverse events were reported (human insulin mix 30/70 group: 2 patients (1.7%, hypoglycemic coma and cardiac failure); insulin lispro low mix 25 group: 1 patient (0.9%, stroke)). All serious adverse events were resolved and no patients died during the study. The results support noninferiority of twice daily insulin lispro low mix 25 versus twice daily human insulin mix 30/70 in HbA1c control in Chinese patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes.

Preliminary study in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with electrical stimulation in the inferior thalamic peduncle. Deep brain stimulation has been used in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our principal objective was to determine the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation of the inferior thalamic peduncle in the treatment of refractory OCD. An open protocol was performed from March 2003 to April 2007 in 5 patients with OCD refractory to conventional treatments. Bilateral stereotactic implantation of tetrapolar electrodes was aimed at the inferior thalamic peduncle and corroborated by electrophysiological responses and magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were off stimulation for 1 month after implantation. In the on-stimulation period, parameters were set at 5 V, 450 microseconds, 130 Hz in bipolar and continuous mode. Clinical changes were evaluated every 3 months for 12 months by means of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Statistical significance was assessed by the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. The mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreased from 35 to 17.8 (P < 0.001), and the mean Global Assessment of Functioning scale score improved from 20% to 70% (P < 0.0001). The neuropsychological battery did not show significant changes, and there were no side effects related to electrical stimulation in the chronic period. We conclude that inferior thalamic peduncle stimulation is a safe procedure and may be an effective alternative in the treatment of those OCD cases refractory to conventional treatments.

CFTR allelic heterogeneity in Brazil: historical and geographical perspectives and implications for screening and counseling for cystic fibrosis in this country. The goal of the present study was to provide a complete and updated spectrum of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in the Brazilian population combining all available in silico data for patients with CF in Brazil, including founder background and migration flow that consisted of the actual genetic pool of the Brazilian population. Information sources in international databases (PUBMED and SCIELO) were searched. The Brazilian population shows a wide variation in the frequency of CFTR mutations in states Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Minas Gerais (MG), Pará (PA) and Bahia (BA); this variation includes the most common mutation p.F508del. Apparently, this frequency variation is because of the different ethnic compositions. States such as SC and PR have a greater European admixture with almost 90% of CF alleles identified. In other states, such as BA, higher frequency of alleles that are common among African populations is seen. Overall, the CFTR mutational spectrum indicates the presence of European, African and Amerindian ethnic groups in the contemporary Brazilian CF patients. Here, we present an analysis of the CFTR allelic heterogeneity and discuss the origin of its genetic composition, in an attempt to provide improved perspective for the CF population screening in Brazil and genetic counseling.


"I felt for a long time like everything beautiful in me had been taken out": Women's suffering, remembering, and survival following the loss of child custody.

Survival after bilateral versus single-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are increasingly having bilateral rather than single-lung transplantation. To compare survival after single and bilateral lung transplantation in patients with IPF. Analysis of data from the United Network of Organ Sharing registry. Transplantation centers in the United States. 3327 patients with IPF who had single (2146 patients [64.5%]) or bilateral (1181 patients [35.5%]) lung transplantation between 1987 and 2009. Survival times and causes of death after lung transplantation. Selection bias was accounted for by multivariate risk adjustment, propensity score risk adjustment, and propensity-based matching. Median survival time was longer after bilateral lung transplantation than single-lung transplantation (5.2 years [CI, 4.3 to 6.7 years] vs. 3.8 years [CI, 3.6 to 4.1 years]; P < 0.001). However, survival times for the 2 procedures did not differ after adjustment for baseline differences, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality with bilateral transplantation ranging from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.02) to 0.96 (CI, 0.77 to 1.20) in different analyses. Bilateral lung transplantation seemed to result in harm within the first year (HR, 1.18 [CI, 0.98 to 1.42]) but survival benefit thereafter (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.59 to 0.87]). Primary graft failure was a more common cause of death among patients who had bilateral rather than single-lung transplantation (3.7% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.002). Cancer was a more common cause of death among patients who had single rather than bilateral lung transplantation (unadjusted HR for death among single vs. bilateral transplant recipients, 3.60 [CI, 2.16 to 6.05]; P <0.001). Causes of death were ascertained without an adjudication committee and must be interpreted cautiously. Survival did not differ between patients who had single and bilateral lung transplantation. Single-lung transplantation confers short-term survival benefit but long-term harm, whereas bilateral transplantation confers short-term harm but long-term survival benefit. None.


Amino acid analysis.

Cigarette smoking and panic: a critical review of the literature. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia's emerging. Although the cause of this comorbidity remains controversial, the main explanations are that (1) cigarette smoking promotes panic by inducing respiratory abnormalities/lung disease or by increasing potentially fear-producing bodily sensations, (2) nicotine produces physiologic effects characteristic of panic by releasing norepinephrine, (3) panic disorder promotes cigarette smoking as self-medication, and (4) a shared vulnerability promotes both conditions. The aim of this review was to survey the literature in order to determine the validity of these explanatory models. Studies were identified by searching English language articles published from 1960 to November 27, 2008, in MEDLINE using the key words: nicotine AND panic, tobacco AND panic, and smoking AND panic. Twenty-four studies were reviewed and selected according to the following criteria: panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and nicotine dependence, when used, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, Fourth Edition, or Fourth Edition, Text Revision; no additional comorbidity or, if present, adjustment for it in the statistical analyses; use of adult or adolescent samples; comparison with a nonclinical control group or application of a crossover design. Non-significant results or trends only were reported as no difference. Data on anxiety disorders or substance abuse in general were not included. Panic and cigarette smoking each appear to have the capacity to serve as a causal factor/facilitator in the development of the other. Although the temporal pattern and the pathogenetic explanations of such a co-occurrence are still being discussed, cigarette smoking tends to precede the onset of panic and to promote panic itself. Additional studies are strongly recommended.

Coding of on-line and pre-planned movement sequences. Recent experiments have demonstrated that complex multi-element movement sequences were coded in visual-spatial coordinates even after extensive practice, while relatively simple spatial-temporal movement sequences are coded in motor coordinates after a single practice session. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine if the control process rather than the difficulty of the sequence played a role in determining the pattern of effector transfer. To accomplish this, different concurrent feedback conditions were provided to two groups of participants during practice of the same movement sequence. The results indicated that when concurrent visual feedback was provided during the production of the movement, which was thought to encourage on-line control, the participants performed transfer tests with the contra-lateral limb better when the visual-spatial coordinates were reinstated than when the motor coordinates were reinstated. When concurrent visual feedback was not provided, which was thought to encourage pre-planned control, the opposite was observed. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the mode of control dictates the coordinate system used to code the movement sequence rather than sequence difficulty or stage of practice as has been proposed.

Cultivation and characterization of canine skin-derived mast cells. It is essential to develop a technique to culture purified skin-derived mast cells (SMCs) to facilitate immunological research on allergic diseases in dogs. This study was performed to develop an efficient culture system for canine SMCs and to characterize the cells in comparison to canine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Enzymatically digested skin biopsy samples were cultivated in serum-free AIM-V medium supplemented with recombinant canine stem cell factor. Three to five weeks after the initiation of culture, mast cells were collected by a magnetic activated cell separation system using anti-c-Kit antibody. The collected cells were composed of a uniform population showing morphological characteristics of mast cells with a round or oval nucleus and abundant toluidine blue-positive metachromatic granules in the cytoplasm. The results of flow cytometric analysis for the presence of cell membrane c-Kit and Fc epsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) indicated that approximately 90% of the cells were mast cells. The cytoplasmic granules were positive for both tryptase and chymase. Apparent dose-dependent degranulation was induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the cells. These cytological and immunological characteristics observed in SMCs were mostly similar to those observed in BMMCs; however, IgE-mediated degranulation was significantly lower in SMCs than BMMCs. The culture system for canine SMCs developed in this study would be useful in understanding the pathophysiology and developing anti-allergic therapeutics in canine allergic dermatitis.

Relationship Between Tei Index and PEP-Derived Myocardial Performance Index in Sinus Rhythm. The goal of this study was to evaluate the preejection time (PEP)-derived myocardial performance index (MPI) in hypertensive (HT) patients with sinus rhythm and its relationship to the classic Tei index. One hundred five patients were enrolled in the study (65 HT and 40 control subjects). The mean age of all patients was 50.5 ± 15 years and 60% were female. Echocardiography was performed on all patients. MPI was measured with the classic Tei method (MPI-Tei index) and the PEP-derived MPI method by using tissue Doppler echocardiography. Although the MPI-Tei index is defined as the ratio of isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT) along with isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) to ejection time (ET), PEP-derived MPI is defined as the ratio of PEP and IVRT to ET. We compared echocardiographic data between the HT group and the control group. MPI-Tei index and the PEP-derived MPI values were higher in the HT group compared with controls (0.52 ± 0.10 vs 0.39 ± 0.07, P < 0.001, and 0.51 ± 0.09 vs 0.39 ± 0.07). PEP-derived MPI was strongly correlated with the MPI-Tei index (r = 0.945, P < 0.001). Our study determined that the PEP-derived MPI might be used in the evaluation of left ventricular function in patients with HT, similar to the classic MPI-Tei index.

Sensory driven multi-neuronal activity and associative learning monitored in an intact CNS on a multielectrode array. The neuronal network controlling feeding behavior in the CNS of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis has been extensively investigated using intracellular microelectrodes. Using microelectrodes however it has not been possible to record from large numbers of neurons simultaneously and therefore little is known about the population coding properties of the feeding network. Neither can the relationships between feeding and neuronal networks controlling other behaviors be easily analyzed with microelectrodes. Here we describe a multielectrode array (MEA) technique for recording action potentials simultaneously from up to 60 electrodes on the intact CNS. The preparation consists of the whole CNS connected by sensory nerves to the chemosensory epithelia of the lip and esophagus. From the buccal ganglia, the region of the CNS containing the feeding central pattern generator (CPG), a rhythmic pattern of activity characteristic of feeding was readily induced either by depolarizing an identified feeding-command neuron (the CV1a) or by perfusing the chemosensory epithelia with sucrose, a gustatory stimulus known to activate feeding. Activity induced by sucrose is not restricted to the buccal ganglia but is distributed widely throughout the CNS, notably in ganglia controlling locomotion, a behavior that must be coordinated with feeding. The MEA also enabled us to record electrophysiological consequences of the associative conditioning of feeding behavior. The results suggest that MEA recording from an intact CNS enables distributed, multiple-source neural activity to be analyzed in the context of biologically relevant behavior, behavioral coordination and behavioral plasticity.

Analysis of potential genotoxic impurities in pharmaceuticals by two-dimensional gas chromatography with Deans switching and independent column temperature control using a low-thermal-mass oven module. The analysis of potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs) in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is a challenging task. The target limit of detection for a PGI in an API is typically 1 ppm (1 microg/g API). This is about 500 times lower than for classical impurity analysis. Consequently, analytical methods for trace analysis, mostly in combination with MS detection, need to be applied for the qualitative and quantitative determination of these impurities. A two-dimensional capillary GC method is presented that can be used for the determination of some target PGIs. A concentrated solution of the API sample is directly introduced in the GC-MS system, using an apolar column for first-dimension separation. The fraction (heart-cut) containing the PGIs is transferred to a second capillary column, installed in a low-thermal-mass oven (LTM). The LTM focuses the heart-cut(s) and allows independent temperature-programmed analysis with a polar second-dimension column. The API, solvent, and derivatization agents are not introduced in the second column or in the MS detector, avoiding contamination, column degradation, and target analyte peak detection/integration issues. The performance of this set-up is illustrated by the analysis of some Michael-reactive acceptor PGIs and haloalcohols in carbamazepine as test matrix. Excellent reproducibility (<10% RSD) at the low parts per million level and low detection limits (<1 ppm) were obtained.

Subcutaneous Mycosis Due to Cladosporium cladosporioides and Bipolaris cynodontis from Assam, North-East India and Review of Published Literature. A large number of phaeoid fungi cause infection in humans and other animals which is characterized by the basic development of sclerotic body, dark-coloured filamentous hyphae as well as yeast-like cells in the invaded tissue. Two cases of subcutaneous mycosis in immunocompetent male patients aged 55 and 58 years attending Dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Assam, north-east India, are reported. The first case was diagnosed as chromoblastomycosis which was caused by Cladosporium cladosporioides. The patient clinically presented with a chronic verrucous and nodular growth of 32-year duration on the left foot and leg. Identification of the species was done by sequencing the D1/D2 region of LSU (large subunit 28S rDNA). The patient was treated with surgical resection and oral itraconazole which showed good clinical response and total regression of lesion after 9 months. The second case due to Bipolaris cynodontis presented as verrucous exophytic growth over the dorsum of the right foot of 1-year duration which was diagnosed as chromoblastomycosis. The identification of the species was done by sequencing the ITS region. The patient was started with oral itraconazole but was lost to follow-up. Chromoblastomycosis due to Cladosporium cladosporioides is rare. Bipolaris cynodontis is not yet reported as a cause of human infection. The aetiological role of this fungus was confirmed by repeated isolation of the fungus from the lesion and direct microscopy. Molecular identification methods can increase the spectrum of black moulds causing human infection in coming years. We are reporting these two cases with review of the available literature.

Susceptibility of Caenorhabditis elegans to Burkholderia infection depends on prior diet and secreted bacterial attractants. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans may be killed by certain pathogenic bacteria and thus is a model organism for studying interactions between bacteria and animal hosts. However, growing nematodes on prey bacteria may influence their susceptibility to potential pathogens. A method of axenic nematode culture was developed to isolate and quantify interactions between C. elegans and potentially pathogenic strains of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. Studying these dynamics in liquid solution rather than on agar surfaces minimized nematode avoidance behavior and resolved more differences among isolates. Most isolates of B. cenocepacia, B. ambifaria and B. cepacia caused 60-80% mortality of nematodes after 7 days, whereas isolates of B. multivorans caused less mortality (<25%) and supported nematode reproduction. However, some B. cenocepacia isolates recovered from chronic infections were much less virulent (5-28% mortality). As predicted, prior diet altered the outcome of interactions between nematodes and bacteria. When given the choice between Burkholderia and E. coli as prey on agar, axenically raised nematodes initially preferred most lethal Burkholderia isolates to E. coli as a food source, but this was not the case for nematodes fed E. coli, which avoided toxic Burkholderia. This food preference was associated with the cell-free supernatant and thus secreted compounds likely mediated bacterial-nematode interactions. This model, which isolates interactions between bacteria and nematodes from the effects of prior feeding, demonstrates that bacteria can influence nematode behavior and their susceptibility to pathogens.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease resolution following sleeve gastrectomy. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease highly prevalent among the morbidly obese population, is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease today. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on the resolution of NAFLD. A retrospective study was conducted of 84 patients diagnosed with NAFLD prior to undergoing LSG. The diagnosis of NAFLD was achieved based on transabdominal ultrasonographic imaging as per the 2012 joint guidelines for the diagnosis of NAFLD (American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology). The patients had follow-up anthropometric measurements and were re-evaluated with postoperative ultrasounds at different time frames to assess the resolution of the disease. The median age of the patients was 44 (17-62), and 66.7 % were female. Average time since surgery was 3.3 years (range 1-5 years). The mean pre- and postoperative BMIs were 46.6 ± 7.8 and 33.0 ± 7.1, respectively, with a mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) of 55.7 % ± 23.0. A total of 47 (56 %) patients showed complete resolution of NAFLD postoperatively. Multivariate analysis showed a significant resolution of NAFLD in patients achieving >50 % EWL (OR 10.1; p < 0.001) after controlling for age and sex. Weight loss after LSG effectively resolved NAFLD in more than half of the obese patients in this study and can prove to be a useful tool in tackling the disease in the future.

Measuring circadian advantage in Major League Baseball: a 10-year retrospective study. The effect of travel on athletic performance has been investigated in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate this effect on game outcome over 10 Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons. Using the convention that for every time zone crossed, synchronization requires 1 d, teams were assigned a daily number indicating the number of days away from circadian resynchronization. With these values, wins and losses for all games could be analyzed based on circadian values. 19,079 of the 24,121 games (79.1%) were played between teams at an equal circadian time. The remaining 5,042 games consisted of teams playing at different circadian times. The team with the circadian advantage won 2,620 games (52.0%, P = .005), a winning percentage that exceeded chance but was a smaller effect than home field advantage (53.7%, P < .0001). When teams held a 1-h circadian advantage, winning percentage was 51.7% (1,903-1,781). Winning percentage with a 2-h advantage was 51.8% (620-578) but increased to 60.6% (97-63) with a 3-h advantage (3-h advantage > 2-hadvantage = 1-h advantage, P = .036). Direction of advantage showed teams traveling from Western time zones to Eastern time zones were more likely to win (winning percentage = .530) than teams traveling from Eastern time zones to Western time zones (winning percentage = .509) with a winning odds 1.14 (P = .027). These results suggest that in the same way home field advantage influences likelihood of success, so too does the magnitude and direction of circadian advantage. Teams with greater circadian advantage were more likely to win.

[Effects of extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves on apelin concentration and expressions in plasma and myocardium of rats with myocardial ischemia injury]. To investigate the changes of apelin in plasma and myocardium of model rats and the protective mechanisms of Extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb) on myocardial ischemia injury induced by isoproterenol. The model of myocardial ischemia injury was induced by subcutaneous injection of high dose isoproterenol. ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) was used to measure the apelin concentration in plasma and myocardium. Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the apelin mRNA level in myocardium. The pathomorphology changes of myocardium was observed with light microscope. EGb was administered for 7 weeks. Compared with the normal control group, the apelin concentration in plasma and myocardium and the apelin mRNA level in myocardium significantly decreased in the model group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the apelin concentration in plasma and myocardium and the apelin mRNA level in myocardium obviously increased in the EGb group (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, the NO content in serum also obviously increased and the pathological damage of myocardium was obviously improved. The protective mechanisms of EGb on myocardial ischemia injury may be related to the elevation of apelin contents and apelin mRNA level.

Active guidance for laser retinal surgery with a handheld instrument. Laser photocoagulation is a standard interventional tool in vitreoretinal surgery. Commonly applied treatments such as grid photocoagulation and panretinal photocoagulation involve the application of hundreds of dot-like laser burns to the retina. In order to enhance the accuracy and reduce the tedium of this procedure, we are developing a robot-assisted technique for retinal laser photocoagulation that includes software for planning patterns of laser burns on a retinal image and uses an active handheld micromanipulator known as Micron in order to apply the pattern of burns to the retina. The paper describes the system and presents preliminary results. In a sample 7x7 pattern of lesions applied to an artificial surface, the system demonstrated a mean position error of 43+/-23 microm.

Angiotensin type 1 receptor mediates renal production and conversion of prostaglandins E2 to F2α in conscious diabetic rats. Previous studies demonstrated that stimulation of angiotensin subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) led to increased renal generation of prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) and renal inflammation. In turn, PGE2 increases AT1R activity. The conversion of PGE2 to the less active metabolite prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) via 9-ketoreductase interrupts this feedback loop. The effects of diabetes on the interface between AT1R, PGE2 and PGF2α are not well established. We hypothesized that in diabetes, an aberrant AT1R activity enhances the biosynthesis of PGE2 and impairs the activity of PGE 9-ketoreductase, leading to accumulation of PGE2. Using microdialysis technique, we monitored renal interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), PGE2 and PGF2α in control and AT1R blocker, valsartan, treated diabetic rats (N=8 each). We utilized the PGF2α to PGE2 ratio as indirect measure of PGE 9-ketoreductase activity. Diabetes increased renal interstitial fluid levels of Ang II, PGE2 and PGF2α. PGF2α/PGE2 ratio increased by the third week, but declined by the sixth week of diabetes. Valsartan reduced PGE2 and PGF2α levels and increased Ang II and the conversion of PGE2 to PGF2α. Our results suggest that in diabetes, AT1R increases PGE2 generation and reduces conversion of PGE2 to PGF2α with the progression of diabetes.

The orchestration of conscious experience by subcortical structures. It is argued that conscious emotional feelings can not be adequately explained by just particular circuits or coherent activations within the brain, as is conventionally believed; nor by activations representing environmental stimuli going to the brain. According to the model suggested herein, the limbic system responds to sensory and other inputs according to how closely they are associated with built-in rewards or punishments. It does this by (a) activating the autonomic nervous system so that it prepares the body to acquire a reward or avoid a punishment, and (b) also activating the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC activations are temporally correlated with the autonomic activations and the feedback to them, so that they become identified with the autonomic attempts to acquire (a reward) or avoid (a punishment). The PFC circuit thus acquires a valence. The valence, along with arousal in a given context, underlies conscious emotional feelings. The model is related to: (a) how attention progresses along networks within working memory; (b) how a single, unified percept is formed; (c) how both value-based and cognitive-based responses are formulated; and (d) how the stream of consciousness is put together and driven forward. These concepts are integrated into a scenario of the orchestration of conscious experience and behaviour by subcortical-limbic system structures interacting with the cortex, and are shown to be consistent with much of the literature.

Cell lines derived from a medaka radiation-sensitive mutant have defects in DNA double-strand break responses. It was reported that the radiation-sensitive Medaka mutant "ric1" has a defect in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by gamma-rays during early embryogenesis. To study the cellular response of a ric1 mutant to ionizing radiation (IR), we established the mutant embryonic cell lines RIC1-e9, RIC1-e42, RIC1-e43. Following exposure to gamma-irradiation, the DSBs in wild-type cells were repaired within 1 h, while those in RIC1 cells were not rejoined even after 2 h. Cell death was induced in the wild-type cells with cell fragmentation, but only a small proportion of the RIC1 cells underwent cell death, and without cell fragmentation. Although both wild-type and RIC1 cells showed mitotic inhibition immediately after gamma-irradiation, cell division was much slower to resume in the wild-type cells (20 h versus 12 h). In both wild-type and RIC1 cells, Ser139 phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) foci were formed after gamma-irradiation, however, the gammaH2AX foci disappeared more quickly in the RIC1 cell lines. These results suggest that the instability of gammaH2AX foci in RIC1 cells cause an aberration of the DNA damage response. As RIC1 cultured cells showed similar defective DNA repair as ric1 embryos and RIC1 cells revealed defective cell death and cell cycle checkpoint, they are useful for investigating DNA damage responses in vitro.

Evaluation of critical size defects of mouse calvarial bone: An organ culture study. Mouse calvarial organ culture has been used widely for the study of bone biology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healing potential of neonatal mouse parietal defects in different culture media. The critical size defect (CSD) was also investigated. The parietal bones of neonatal mice were used. Full-thickness, 0.8-mm circular defects were created through the bones from one litter of mice. The bones were divided into three groups: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) group, DMEM/osteogenic medium (OM) group, and OM group. Cultures were analyzed with microcomputed-tomography, dissecting-microscope, phase-contrast-microscope, Von Kossa stain, scanning-electron-microscopy, and energy-dispersive-X-ray. Continuous bone formation of parietal bones was observed in all groups. Defects in the DMEM/OM group showed the highest healing potential and exhibited woven bone formation. Defects in the OM group showed limited bone healing at the defect edge. Defects in the DMEM group showed fibrous healing. The most effective culture medium (DMEM/OM) was used to determine the CSD of mouse calvaria in a separate experiment. Circular defects (diameters: 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5 mm) were made in the parietal bones from another litter of mice. The bones were analyzed with microcomputed-tomography, and phase-contrast-microscopy. The bone filling percentages of different size defects were statistically significant: 1.5-mm defects (4.49%), 1.0-mm defects (47.65%), and 0.8-mm defects (73.45%). In three culture conditions, DMEM/OM was the most effective approach to repair bone defects. A 1.5 mm in diameter, full-thickness parietal defect was found to be the CSD under the DMEM/OM culture conditions.

A Role for Autoinhibition in Preventing Dimerization of the Transcription Factor ETS1. ETS1 is the archetype of the ETS transcription factor (TF) family. ETS TFs share a DNA-binding domain, the ETS domain. All ETS TFs recognize a core GGA(A/T) binding site, and thus ETS TFs are found to redundantly regulate the same genes. However, each ETS TF has unique targets as well. One prevailing hypotheses explaining this duality is that protein-protein interactions, including homodimerization, allow each ETS TF to display distinct behavior. The behavior of ETS1 is further regulated by autoinhibition. Autoinhibition apparently modulates ETS1 DNA binding affinity, but the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely understood. We sought to characterize the relationship between DNA binding and ETS1 homodimer formation. We find that ETS1 interrogates DNA and forms dimers even when the DNA does not contain an ETS recognition sequence. Mutational studies also link nonspecific DNA backbone contacts with dimer formation, in addition to providing a new role for the recognition helix of ETS1 in maintaining the autoinhibited state. Finally, in showing that residues in the DNA recognition helix affect autoinhibition, we define a new function of ETS1 autoinhibition: maintenance of a monomeric state in the absence of DNA. The conservation of relevant amino acid residues across all ETS TFs indicates that the mechanisms of nonspecific DNA interrogation and protein oligomer formation elucidated here may be common to all ETS proteins that autoinhibit. 

Is emmetropia the natural endpoint for human refractive development? An analysis of population-based data from the refractive error study in children (RESC). To determine the natural end-point for refractive development during childhood. Cycloplegic (1% cyclopentolate) autorefraction was performed on 38, 811 children aged 5 and 15 in population-based samples at eight sites in the Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC). Refractions (right eye) were categorized as myopic (≤-0.5 D), emmetropic (>-0.5 to ≤+0.5 D), mildly hyperopic (>+0.5 to ≤+2.0 D and hyperopic (>+2.0 D). At five sites (Jhapa - rural Nepal, New Delhi - urban India, Mahabubnagar - rural India, Durban - semi-urban South Africa and La Florida - urban Chile), there was <20% myopia by age 15. Mild hyperopia was the most prevalent category at all ages, except for Mahabubnagar where emmetropia became the marginally most prevalent category at ages 14 and 15. At the other sites (Gombak - semi-urban Malaysia, Shunyi - semi-rural China and Guangzhou - urban China), there was substantial (>35%) myopia by age 15. At these sites, mild hyperopia was the most prevalent category during early childhood, and myopia became the predominant category later. In Gombak district and Guangzhou, emmetropia was a minor category at all ages, with myopia increasing as mild hyperopia decreased. In Shunyi district, emmetropia was the most prevalent category over the ages 11-14. Emmetropia was not the predominant outcome for refractive development in children. Instead, populations were predominantly mildly hyperopic or substantial amounts of myopia appeared in them. This suggests that mild hyperopia is the natural state of refractive development in children and that emmetropia during childhood carries the risk of subsequent progression to myopia.

Nosocomial Cholera Outbreak in a Mental Hospital: Challenges and Lessons Learnt from Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital, Uganda. During the last four decades, Uganda has experienced repeated cholera outbreaks in communities; no cholera outbreaks have been reported in Ugandan health facilities. In October 2008, a unique cholera outbreak was confirmed in Butabika National Mental Referral Hospital (BNMRH), Uganda. This article describes actions taken to control the outbreak, challenges, and lessons learnt. We reviewed patient and hospital reports for clinical symptoms and signs, treatment and outcome, patient mental diagnosis, and challenges noted during management of patients and contacts. Out of 114 BNMRH patients on two affected wards, 18 cholera cases and five deaths were documented for an attack rate of 15.8% and a case fatality rate of 28%. Wards and surroundings were intensively disinfected and 96 contacts (psychiatric patients) in the affected wards received chemoprophylaxis with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily until November 5, 2008. We documented a nosocomial cholera outbreak in BNMRH with a high case fatality of 28% compared with the national average of 2.4% for cholera outbreaks in communities. To avoid cholera outbreaks and potentially high mortality among patients in mental institutions, procedures for prompt diagnosis, treatment, disinfection, and prophylaxis are needed and preemptive use of oral cholera vaccines should be considered. 

Constituents of Ligularia brassicoides Collected in China: A New Diels-Alder Adduct of Eremophilan-10β-ol and Methacrylic Acid. Chemical study of four samples of Ligularia brassicoides collected in Sichuan Province of China afforded 18 compounds, five of which were new. LC-MS profiles were somehow similar to each other, although the compound ratio was slightly different. One of the new compound was a Diels-Alder adduct between franoeremophilan-10β-ol and methacrylic acid.

Comparison of 99Tcm and 131I in Polish hospitals, 2007. The Radioisotope Centre (RC) has organized for the first time in Polish hospitals a comparison of activity measurements of (99)Tc(m) and (131)I. From the 58 Polish hospitals invited, 37 participated in the comparison. Each participant got about 4 mL of (99)Tc(m) eluate and two (131)I capsules, low- and high-activity. Sources were standardized in the RC before dispatch using a 4pi ionization chamber calibrated by standard solutions. Participants used their own radionuclide calibrators. The measurement results were evaluated using the E(n) criterion and the z'-score. From all 118 measurement results received from participants, 75 results (64%) lay within +/-5% of the RC value, and 99 results (84%) lay within +/-10.0%.

A dangerous method? The use of induced pluripotent stem cells as a model for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a devastating and prevalent psychiatric illness. Progress in understanding the basic pathophysiological processes underlying this disorder has been hindered by the lack of appropriate models. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, it is now possible to generate live neurons in vitro from somatic tissue of schizophrenia patients. Despite its several limitations, this revolutionary technology has already helped to advance our understanding of schizophrenia. The phenotypic insights garnered with iPSC models of schizophrenia include transcriptional dysregulation, oxidative stress synaptic dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Potential pitfalls of this work include the possibility of introducing random genetic mutations during the reprogramming process, the inadequacy of using neurons from other patients as controls, the inability to capture the complex environmental contribution to schizophrenia pathogenesis, the difficulty in modelling neurodevelopment, and the difficulty in modelling the interaction of multiple neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. However, with the increasing sophistication of available reprogramming techniques, co-culture technology, and gene correction strategies, iPSC-derived neurons will continue to elucidate how neuronal function is disrupted in schizophrenia. 

Relation of non-cholesterol sterols to coronary risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cholesterol metabolism in the development of atheromatous artery disease. Serum synthesis (cholesterol precursors) and absorption markers (cholestanol, campesterol, sitosterol, and avenasterol) were related to coronary risk factors and vascular structure in a population-based sample of 468 randomly selected 33-39-year-old men on their regular habitual diet. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and serum lipids (including cholesterol) and sterols were measured in 2001, and the subjects were ranked to decreasing cholesterol synthesis depicted by serum cholestanol quartiles defined 21 years earlier in adolescence. Serum cholesterol was correlated with absorption (e.g. serum campesterol, p<0.05), but not with synthesis, or with cholestanol quartiles. Cholesterol metabolism (synthesis/absorption markers) decreased linearly (about 50%) with the increasing cholestanol quartiles. IMT differed between the age groups, but not between cholestanol quartiles. Serum triglycerides, apoprotein B, and body mass index decreased, and non-HDL cholesterol/apoprotein B values increased between the cholestanol quartiles, whereas LDL cholesterol was unchanged. Cholesterol synthesis markers were related to blood pressure and serum triglycerides, and negatively to HDL cholesterol level in total population and in most of the cholestanol quartiles (p from 0.05 to 0.001). Variables of metabolic syndrome accumulated in quartiles of high synthesis of cholesterol. Non-cholesterol sterols were related to many classic coronary risk factors, but virtually not to serum cholesterol or vascular structure.

A cytogenetic abnormality and rare coding variants identify ABCA13 as a candidate gene in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are leading causes of morbidity across all populations, with heritability estimates of approximately 80% indicating a substantial genetic component. Population genetics and genome-wide association studies suggest an overlap of genetic risk factors between these illnesses but it is unclear how this genetic component is divided between common gene polymorphisms, rare genomic copy number variants, and rare gene sequence mutations. We report evidence that the lipid transporter gene ABCA13 is a susceptibility factor for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. After the initial discovery of its disruption by a chromosome abnormality in a person with schizophrenia, we resequenced ABCA13 exons in 100 cases with schizophrenia and 100 controls. Multiple rare coding variants were identified including one nonsense and nine missense mutations and compound heterozygosity/homozygosity in six cases. Variants were genotyped in additional schizophrenia, bipolar, depression (n > 1600), and control (n > 950) cohorts and the frequency of all rare variants combined was greater than controls in schizophrenia (OR = 1.93, p = 0.0057) and bipolar disorder (OR = 2.71, p = 0.00007). The population attributable risk of these mutations was 2.2% for schizophrenia and 4.0% for bipolar disorder. In a study of 21 families of mutation carriers, we genotyped affected and unaffected relatives and found significant linkage (LOD = 4.3) of rare variants with a phenotype including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. These data identify a candidate gene, highlight the genetic overlap between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, and suggest that rare coding variants may contribute significantly to risk of these disorders.

Mechanisms of bacterial virulence in pulmonary infections. To consider the relevance to severe human lung infections of recently discovered virulence mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus and Francisella tularensis. S. aureus has long been considered an opportunistic pathogen. However, due to the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains that can readily infect and kill normal hosts, S. aureus must now be considered a potentially virulent pathogen. The evolution of S. aureus from an organism associated with asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonization to one associated with community-acquired lethal infections may reflect horizontal acquisition of bacterial genes that enable efficient spread, aggressive host invasion, and effective immune evasion. Alleviating the burden of staphylococcal disease will require better understanding of host susceptibility and of staphylococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance. In contrast to the rapidly evolving staphylococcal virulence strategy, recent genomic analysis of F. tularensis has revealed a small set of bacterial genes associated with the marked virulence of its North American subspecies. This suggests that a relatively stable strategy of immune evasion underlies this pathogen's ability to establish serious life-threatening lung infections from a very small inoculum. Understanding bacterial pathogenesis will require additional research into both host susceptibility factors and bacterial virulence mechanisms, including horizontal gene transfer. Refinements in the molecular detection of bacteria in the clinical setting, as well as whole genome analysis of both pathogens and patients, are expected to aid in the understanding of bacterial-induced lung injury.

The co-chaperone SGT of Leishmania donovani is essential for the parasite's viability. Molecular chaperone proteins play a pivotal role in the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, controlling cell fate and ensuring intracellular survival. In higher eukaryotes, the so-called co-chaperone proteins are required for client protein recognition and proper function of chaperones, among them the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (SGT) which interact with both HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones. An atypical SGT homolog is found in the L. donovani genome, encoding a protein lacking the C-terminal glutamine-rich region, normally typical for SGT family members. The gene is expressed constitutively during the life cycle and is essential for survival and/or growth of the parasites. LdSGT forms large, stable complexes that also include another putative co-chaperone, HSC70 interacting protein (HIP). The gene product forms cytoplasmic clusters, matching the subcellular distribution of HIP and partly that of the major cytoplasmic chaperones, HSP70 and HSP90, reflecting a direct molecular interaction with both chaperones.

Surgical complications following liver transplantation in patients with portal vein thrombosis--a single-center perspective. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was once considered a contraindication for liver transplantation (LTx) because of technical difficulties. Though no longer a contraindication, it remains a risk factor. A study of surgical complications following LTx in patients with and without PVT. A retrospective review of 1,171 consecutive patients who underwent LTx between June 1995 and June 2007 was performed, and 78 recipients with PVT (study group) were compared with a stratified random sample of 78 contemporous recipients without PVT (control group) for postoperative complications. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, race, and other confounding variables. The rate of primary nonfunction (PNF) in the study and control groups was 9.0% and 1.3%, (p = 0.063), while that of retransplantation was 17.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.055), respectively. The mean donor risk index (DRI) among the patients with and without PNF in the study group was 2.58 +/- 0.44 and 2.08 +/- 0.42, respectively (p = 0.014). A significantly higher number of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were observed in study group compared to controls (p = 0.012, 0.007, respectively). A higher rate of PNF was related to the complexity of the surgical procedure and the use of donor livers with a high DRI. Higher rates of PNF eventually led to a higher rate of retransplant. A strategy of offering donor livers with a low DRI might be helpful in decreasing the rate of PNF. Further, a PV interposition graft in difficult cases instead of thrombectomy could lead to a lower rethrombosis rate.

[Increase of saliva nitrate and nitrite level in patients with oral candidiasis]. To observe the alterations of saliva nitrate and nitrite level in patients with oral candidiasis. Parotid saliva and whole saliva were collected from 33 patients and 34 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in saliva were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Follow-up observation was performed on 10 patients after treatment. The data were statistically analyzed with independent-samples t test or paired-samples t test at alpha = 0.05. There was significant increase of the concentrations and secretion rate of parotid saliva nitrate in patient group as compared with controls: (49.70 +/- 0.50) vs (21.51 +/- 0.60) mg/L (t = 2.692, P = 0.009) and (27.71 +/- 0.50) vs (12.55 +/- 0.60) microg/min (t = 2.554, P = 0.013), respectively. Significantly increased concentrations and secretion rate of nitrate and nitrite [nitrate: (6.46 +/- 0.94) vs (1.11 +/- 0.70) mg/L (t = 3.792, P = 0.000); nitrite: (8.48 +/- 0.58) vs (3.39 +/- 0.53) mg/L (t = 2.888, P = 0.005); nitrate secretion rate: (10.57 +/- 0.91) vs (2.10 +/- 0.74) microg/min (t = 3.464, P= 0.001); nitrite secretion rate: (13.91 +/- 0.55) vs (6.42 +/- 0.58) microg/min (t = 2.397, P = 0.020)] were revealed in whole saliva of patients group. Significantly decreased nitrate and nitrite levels were also observed in patients after treatment, especially the changes of parotid saliva nitrate secretion rate [(37.50 +/- 0.50) vs (14.34 +/- 0.64) microg/min (t = 3.142, P = 0.012)], whole saliva nitrate [(14.29 +/- 1.01) vs (2.59 +/- 1.03) mg/L (t = 3.475, P = 0.007)] and whole saliva nitrate secretion rate [(25.97 +/- 0.93) vs (4.12 +/- 1.00) microg/min (t = 3.922, P = 0.003)]. The present study revealed the significant increase of salivary nitrate and nitrite level in patients with oral candidiasis is considered to be associated with the host defense reaction.

Reconstitution of bacterial outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters in planar lipid bilayer membranes. Micronutrients such as siderophore-bound iron and vitamin B(12) cross the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria through a group of 22-stranded beta-barrel proteins. They share the unusual feature that their N-terminal end inserts from the periplasmic side into the beta-barrel and plugs the lumen. Transport results from energy-driven movement of TonB protein, which either pulls the plug out of the barrel or causes it to rearrange within the barrel. Attempts to reconstitute native plugged channels in an ion-conducting state in lipid bilayer membranes have so far been unsuccessful. We, however, have discovered that if the cis solution contained 4 M urea, then, with the periplasmic side of the channel facing that solution, macroscopic conductances and single channel events could be observed. These results were obtained with FhuA, Cir, and BtuB; for the former two, the channels were closed by removing the 4 M urea. Channels generated by 4 M urea exposure were not a consequence of general protein denaturation, as their ligand-binding properties were preserved. Thus, with FhuA, addition of ferrichrome (its siderophore) to the trans, extracellular-facing side reversibly inhibited 4 M urea-induced channel opening and blocked the channels. With Cir, addition of colicin Ia (the microbial toxin that targets Cir) to the trans, extracellular-facing side prevented 4 M urea-induced channel opening. We hypothesize that 4 M urea reversibly unfolds the FhuA and Cir plugs, thereby opening an ion-conducting pathway through these channels, and that this mimics to some extent the in vivo action of TonB on these plugs.

Lentivirus vectors for stably introducing genes into mammary epithelial cells in vivo. We have reported the use of vectors based on avian leukosis virus (ALV) and ALV env pseudotyped lentivirus for stably introducing genes into somatic mammary cells in vivo for tumor modeling. These vectors require tva transgenic mice for viral infection. Here, we report, and described the method for, stably introducing genes into the mammary gland in mice using intraductal injection of a common lentiviral vector. This method does not need tva-transgenic mice for infection. This in vivo transformation method may be useful for rapid testing of the tumorigenic potential of genes potentially involved in breast carcinogenesis.

[Knowledge, behaviors and practices among ironworkers about tetanus in Senegal]. Tetanus is still a major health problem in Sénégal. In order to understand some of these reasons, we conducted a study. The aim of this study is to assess ironworkers' knowledge, behaviors and practices about tetanus. This knowledge, behaviors and practices survey was carried out in ironworks of two neighborhoods of Dakar from April 5 to May 10, 2008. 41 ironworks were identified and 32 agreed to participate in the study. In this ironworks, 120 ironworkers were interviewed. Their average age was 29 years +/- 15, education in French schools was low and 78.3% of them had a source of information. Despite some inaccuracies, most ironworkers were aware of tetanus (97.5%), severity (93.3%), causes (89.2%). However 35% did not evaluate the risk of tetanus and almost all the ironworkers or 96.7% had no preventive measures after injury. Moreover, no ironworker was fully immunized against tetanus. In some occupations at risk, awareness of tetanus should be increased by all available channels and methods emphasizing the importance of prevention.

De novo sequencing of peptides by MS/MS. The current status of de novo sequencing of peptides by MS/MS is reviewed with focus on collision cell MS/MS spectra. The relation between peptide structure and observed fragment ion series is discussed and the exhaustive extraction of sequence information from CID spectra of protonated peptide ions is described. The partial redundancy of the extracted sequence information and a high mass accuracy are recognized as key parameters for dependable de novo sequencing by MS. In addition, the benefits of special techniques enhancing the generation of long uninterrupted fragment ion series for de novo peptide sequencing are highlighted. Among these are terminal (18)O labeling, MS(n) of sodiated peptide ions, N-terminal derivatization, the use of special proteases, and time-delayed fragmentation. The emerging electron transfer dissociation technique and the recent progress of MALDI techniques for intact protein sequencing are covered. Finally, the integration of bioinformatic tools into peptide de novo sequencing is demonstrated.

Column bioleaching copper and its kinetics of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Application of bioleaching process for metal recovery from electronic waste has received an increasing attention in recent years. In this work, a column bioleaching of copper from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has been investigated. After column bioleaching for 28d, the copper recovery reached at 94.8% from the starting materials contained 24.8% copper. Additionally, the concentration of Fe(3+) concentration varied significantly during bioleaching, which inevitably will influence the Cu oxidation, thus bioleaching process. Thus the variation in Fe(3+) concentration should be taken into consideration in the conventional kinetic models of bioleaching process. Experimental results show that the rate of copper dissolution is controlled by external diffusion rather than internal one because of the iron hydrolysis and formation of jarosite precipitates at the surface of the material. The kinetics of column bioleaching WPCBs remains unchanged because the size and morphology of precipitates are unaffected by maintaining the pH of solution at 2.25 level. In bioleaching process, the formation of jarosite precipitate can be prevented by adding dilute sulfuric acid and maintaining an acidic condition of the leaching medium. In such way, the Fe(2)(+)-Fe(3+) cycle process can kept going and create a favorable condition for Cu bioleaching. Our experimental results show that column Cu bioleaching from WPCBs by A. ferrooxidans is promising. 

A Sabin 2-related poliovirus recombinant contains a homologous sequence of human enterovirus species C in the viral polymerase coding region. A type 2 vaccine-related poliovirus (strain CHN3024), differing from the Sabin 2 strain by 0.44% in the VP1 coding region was isolated from a patient with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Sequences downstream of nucleotide position 6735 (3D(pol) coding region) were derived from an unidentified sequence; no close match for a potential parent was found, but it could be classified into a non-polio human enteroviruses species C (HEV-C) phylogeny. The virus differed antigenically from the parental Sabin strain, having an amino acid substitution in the neutralizing antigenic site 1. The similarity between CHN3024 and Sabin 2 sequences suggests that the recombination was recent; this is supported by the estimation that the initiating OPV dose was given only 36-75 days before sampling. The patient's clinical manifestations, intratypic differentiation examination, and whole-genome sequencing showed that this recombinant exhibited characteristics of neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV), which may, thus, pose a potential threat to a polio-free world.

Radar cross section of human cardiopulmonary activity for recumbent subject. The radar cross section (RCS) corresponding to human cardio-respiratory motion is measured for a subject in two different recumbent positions. Lying face-up (supine), the subject showed an RCS of 0.326 m(2). But when lying face-down (prone), the RCS increased to 2.9 m(2). This is the first reported RCS measurement corresponding to human cardio-respiratory motion. The results obtained in this experiment suggest modeling the upper part of the human body as a half-cylinder where the front body corresponds to the cylindrical surface and the back corresponds to the rectangular one.

Risk factors for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis with a double stapling technique. Laparoscopic rectal transection carries the risk of anastomotic leakage because of its technical difficulty and long staple line with an inadequate cutting angle. Our objective was to investigate the risk factors affecting anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis with a double stapling technique. Between November 2006 and September 2008, 270 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and anterior resection with double stapling technique for distal sigmoid and rectal cancer. Data were collected prospectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for anastomotic leakage. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of stapler firings and clinical parameters. Anastomotic leakage was noted in 17 (6.3%) of 270 patients. In univariate analyses, tumor location (p = 0.021), operation time (p = 0.025), number of stapler firings (p = 0.040), and diameter of the circular stapler (p = 0.022) were significant risk factors for anastomotic leakage. Multivariate analyses showed that middle or lower rectal cancer was an independent factor affecting anastomotic leakage (p = 0.013). The number of stapler firings increased significantly in men (p = 0.023), in patients with a tumor at a lower level (p = 0.034), and in those with longer operation times (p < 0.001). A reduction in the number of linear stapler firings is necessary to avoid anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis with a double stapling technique. We recommend that a diverting ileostomy is mandatory in patients with middle and lower rectal cancer where multiple linear staplers were used.

Serum ADMA concentration-- an independent factor determining FMD impairment in cardiac syndrome X. Mechanisms of decreased endogenous vascular reactivity in individuals with cardiac syndrome X (CSX) are not fully understood. To evaluate the following serum markers: total nitric oxide (NO), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and to establish their relation to ultrasound indexes of endothelial function and structural remodeling in CSX patients. The study group consisted of 43 CSX patients (mean age: 56.3 +/- 9 years), while the control group included 21 healthy subjects (mean age: 54.86 +/- 6.9 years). The high-resolution ultrasound was performed to measure: flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD), nitroglycerine-mediated vasodilatation (NMD) and intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries. In CSX patients, significantly lower FMD (9.06 +/- 3.2%) and significantly higher IMT (0.667 +/- 0.14 mm) values were observed compared to healthy individuals (17.42 +/- 8.4%, 0.571 +/- 0.2 mm; P < 0.05). Mean total NO serum concentration was significantly higher in the CSX group (48.2 +/- 18.2 micromol/L) as compared to controls (32.1 +/- 1.4 micromol/L; P < 0.0001). There were no differences in serum ADMA and PDGF levels. In CSX patients, FMD values correlated with NO (r = 0.323; P = 0.039) and ADMA (r = -0.387; P = 0.012) serum levels; however, there were no significant correlations between NO and ADMA concentrations. Serum ADMA concentration is the only independent factor determining FMD impairment.

Effect of very early mobilisation on functional status in patients with acute stroke: a single-blind, randomized controlled trail. To evaluate the effect of very early mobilisation on functional status following acute stroke. Single blind, randomized controlled trial. University hospital. Eighty-six patients with acute stroke (42 men and 38 women) aged 30-80 years were randomized to an Intervention group and a Standard care group. All participants received 45 minutes standard care once a day for seven days. In addition, the intervention group (n=43) performed very early mobilisation consisting of early and frequent out of bed activities which started within 24 hours of stroke onset for 5 to 30 minutes at least twice a day, for seven days. Functional status was measured with Barthel ADL Index on admission, discharge and three months follow up. Intervention group showed a significant improvement in Barthel Index change scores (discharge - admission) (median=35, IQR=30-38.75 versus median=17.50, IQR=10-30) than the standard care group. Intervention group showed a significant improvement in Barthel Index change scores (three month follow up - admission) (median=42.50, IQR=35-55) versus (median=30, IQR=20-35) than the standard care group. The Intervention group reported statistically significant improvement in functional status at discharge (P<0.001) and at three months follow up (P<0.001) compared with the Standard care group. The results indicate that very early mobilisation in addition to the standard care may be effective in improving the functional status following acute stroke.

Acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry in the preoperative screening of septal surgery patients. The preoperative assessment of septal surgery patients with acoustic rhinometry (AR) or rhinomanometry (RMM) is still a controversial subject. This study was designed to apply AR and RMM in preoperative screening of septal surgery patients. The gold standard is postoperative satisfaction expressed by patients as "very high," "high," "moderate," or "low" subjective total benefit from the operation to the nasal obstruction 1 year after surgery. One hundred fifty-seven consecutive patients presenting for septal surgery because of an obstructing septum deviation in anterior rhinoscopy, sufficient pre- and postoperative data were available in 110 patients. Anterior rhinoscopy, AR, and RMM were performed before and 1 year after surgery. The preoperative AR and RMM had a statistically significant impact (p < 0.01) in predicting the postoperative satisfaction. The best single preoperative parameter for predicting postoperative satisfaction was the postdecongestion overall minimum cross-sectional area on the deviation side in AR; the estimated optimal cutoff value was 0.40 cm(2). The most predictive preoperative RMM parameter was the postdecongestion intercavital flow ratio (the flow on the deviation side divided by the flow on the wide side); the estimated optimal cutoff value was 1:2. For both parameters the sensitivity/specificity for the cutoff values was around 65/60% in finding patients with high or very high postoperative satisfaction. For anterior rhinoscopy the optimal cutoff was a deviation between severe and moderate with sensitivity/specificity around 55/55%. In patients with a very severe deviation, anterior rhinoscopy was sufficient for preoperative screening but in milder deviations AR and RMM significantly predicted postoperative success.

Genome-wide association study identifies variants at 16p13 associated with survival in multiple myeloma patients. Here we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiple myeloma (MM) survival. In a meta-analysis of 306 MM patients treated at UCSF and 239 patients treated at the Mayo clinic, we find a significant association between SNPs near the gene FOPNL on chromosome 16p13 and survival (rs72773978; P=6 × 10(-10)). Patients with the minor allele are at increased risk for mortality (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.94-3.58) relative to patients homozygous for the major allele. We replicate the association in the IMMEnSE cohort including 772 patients, and a University of Utah cohort including 318 patients (rs72773978 P=0.044). Using publicly available data, we find that the minor allele was associated with increased expression of FOPNL and increased expression of FOPNL was associated with higher expression of centrosomal genes and with shorter survival. Polymorphisms at the FOPNL locus are associated with survival among MM patients.

Imaging nanoparticle stability and activation in vivo. While liposomes and nanoparticles have been the subject of intense research for more than 40 years, few particles have been translated into clinical practice. Advantages of these particles include the potential to overcome the cardiac, renal or neural toxicity of systemic chemotherapy, the opportunities for multivalent targeting, the gradual yet significant accumulation within tumors due to leaky blood vessels and the myriad of new approaches to locally alter the properties of the particle in the region of interest. Given the complexity of the design and co-optimization of the surface architecture, shell formulation and drug loading, methods to image the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles in living systems are an essential part of an efficient research methodology. Here, we describe our efforts to label the shell and drug core of lipid-shelled particles with a goal of facilitating translation of activatable particles.

Sequential evaluation of swallowing function in patients with unilateral neck dissection. Neck dissection is the most reliable treatment for cervical lymph node metastases in head and neck cancer. However, it is unknown whether neck dissection can cause dysphagia. The aim of this study was to evaluate swallowing function after neck dissection. By using videofluoroscopic and videoendoscopic methods, swallowing function was evaluated in 17 patients prior to, 1 month after, and 4 months after neck dissection. In comparison with preoperative observations, swallowing function after neck dissection was affected by the following changes: a forward and downward displacement of the hyoid bone at rest and at its highest position, a decrease in the distance traversed by the hyoid bone during swallowing, and an increase in laryngeal penetration. Pharyngeal residue and aspiration were not observed in any of the patients. Although swallowing function is affected by neck dissection, serious clinical problems are not likely to occur.

Gene expression profiling in the lung tissue of cynomolgus  monkeys in response to repeated exposure to welding fumes. Many in the welding industry suffer from bronchitis, lung function changes, metal fume fever, and diseases related to respiratory damage. These phenomena are associated with welding fumes; however, the mechanism behind these findings remains to be elucidated. In this study, the lungs of cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to MMA-SS welding fumes for 229 days and allowed to recover for 153 days. After the exposure and recovery period, gene expression profiles were investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133 plus 2.0. In total, it was confirmed that 1,116 genes were up-or downregulated (over 2-fold changes, P\0.01) for the T1 (31.4 ± 2.8 mg/m3) and T2 (62.5 ± 2.7 mg/m3) dose groups. Differentially expressed genes in the exposure and recovery groups were analyzed, based on hierarchical clustering, and were imported into Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to analyze the biological and toxicological functions. Functional analysis identified genes involved in immunological disease in both groups. Additionally, differentially expressed genes in common between monkeys and rats following welding fume exposure were compared using microarray data, and the gene expression of selected genes was verified by real-time PCR. Genes such as CHI3L1, RARRES1, and CTSB were up-regulated and genes such as CYP26B1, ID4, and NRGN were down-regulated in both monkeys and rats following welding fume exposure. This is the first comprehensive gene expression profiling conducted for welding fume exposure in monkeys, and these expressed genes are expected to be useful in helping to understand transcriptional changes in monkey lungs after welding fume exposure.

Treatment of fibroadenomatosis in 14 cats with aglepristone - changes in blood parameters and follow-up. Fourteen female cats with fibroadenomatosis were treated with aglepristone, and the effectiveness of the treatment and its effect on selected haematological and blood chemistry parameters were studied. The cats were monitored for 12 months after the end of the treatment. Complete remission of the clinical signs was achieved on average 3.9 weeks after the treatment began; the success of the treatment confirmed the clinical diagnosis of fibroadenomatosis. During the course of the treatment the cats' haematological parameters returned to normal. In cats that had previously been treated with long-acting medroxyprogesterone acetate, treatment with aglepristone for five weeks was recommended. Cases of fibroadenomatosis reappearing after a few months should be regarded as new disease rather than a relapse. Six cats were subsequently mated and four gave birth to one or more litters; all the pregnancies proceeded normally with no clinically evident fibroadenomatosis. The other eight cats underwent ovariohysterectomy soon after the aglepristone treatment was completed.

Analysis of prognostic factors for the indication of central lymphadenectomy in papillary thyroid carcinomas. In this study we examined whether it was possible following preoperative parameters statistically significant correlation with the presence of metastatic lymph nodes in the papillary thyroid carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective study in a group of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of papillary carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy associated with routine lymphadenectomy of the central compartment (level VI). The study group consisted of patients whose definitive histological lymph node examination was positive for metastasis (N1), and the control group comprised patients found negative for metastasis (N0). Tumour diameter had a significance at 10% level [Pr(>|z|): 0.056], thus indicating that increased tumour size results in a higher probability of being in group N1. The logistic regression revealed that variables with a significance at 5% level for the presence of metastatic lymph nodes in the central compartment (N1) were: sex [Pr(>|z|): 0.019], overall patient age [Pr(>|z|): 0.012] and age >45 [Pr(>|z|): 0.022]. We performed a statistical analysis with the association of three preoperative variables (presence of ultrasound-revealed microcalcifications, presence of solid hypoechogenic nodule and type III vascularisation on echocolour-Doppler); this was found to result in a highly significant probability of entering into group N1. We found variables statistically significant for the presence of metastatic central compartment lymph nodes, including female sex, age >45 yrs and tumour diameter >1.5 cm. The association of papillary carcinoma with microcalcifications, solid hypoechogenic nodule structure and type III vascularisation on echocolour-Doppler also resulted in a statistically significant increase in the probability of positive level VI lymph nodes.

Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) by thyroid hormone: role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1 alpha). PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) regulates pyruvate oxidation through the phosphorylation and inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is an important control point in glucose and pyruvate metabolism. PDK4 gene expression is stimulated by thyroid hormone (T(3)), glucocorticoids, and long chain fatty acids. The effects of T(3) on gene expression in the liver are mediated via the thyroid hormone receptor. Here, we have identified two binding sites for thyroid hormone receptor beta in the promoter of the rat PDK4 (rPDK4) gene. In addition, we have investigated the role of transcriptional coactivators and found that the PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator) enhances the T(3) induction of rPDK4. Following T(3) administration, there is an increase in the association of PGC-1 alpha with the rPDK4 promoter. Interestingly, this increased association is with the proximal rPDK4 promoter rather than the distal region of the gene that contains the T(3) response elements. Administration of T(3) to hypothyroid rats elevated the abundance of PGC-1 alpha mRNA and protein in the liver. In addition, we observed greater association of PGC-1 alpha not only with the rPDK4 gene but also with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and CPT-1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) genes. Knockdown of PGC-1 alpha in rat hepatocytes reduced the T(3) induction of PDK4, PEPCK, and CPT-1a genes. Our results indicate that T(3) regulates PGC-1 alpha abundance and association with hepatic genes, and in turn PGC-1 alpha is an important participant in the T(3) induction of selected genes.

Detection and characterization of heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Canada: results from the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program, 1995-2006. We describe the epidemiology of heterogeneously resistant Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) identified in Canadian hospitals between 1995 and 2006. hVISA isolates were confirmed by the population analysis profiling-area under the curve method. Only 25 hVISA isolates (1.3% of all isolates) were detected. hVISA isolates were more likely to have been health care associated (odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 14.2) and to have been recovered from patients hospitalized in central Canada (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 7.4). There has been no evidence of vancomycin "MIC creep" in Canadian strains of methicillin (meticillin)-resistant S. aureus, and hVISA strains are currently uncommon.

Characterization of the human plasma phosphoproteome using linear ion trap mass spectrometry and multiple search engines. Major plasma protein families play different roles in blood physiology and hemostasis and in immunodefense. Other proteins in plasma can be involved in signaling as chemical messengers or constitute biological markers of the status of distant tissues. In this respect, the plasma phosphoproteome holds potentially relevant information on the mechanisms modulating these processes through the regulation of protein activity. In this work we describe for the first time a collection of phosphopeptides identified in human plasma using immunoaffinity separation of the seven major serum protein families from other plasma proteins, SCX fractionation, and TiO(2) purification prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. One-hundred and twenty-seven phosphosites in 138 phosphopeptides mapping 70 phosphoproteins were identified with FDR < 1%. A high-confidence collection of phosphosites was obtained using a combined search with the OMSSA, SEQUEST, and Phenyx search engines.


Risk factors for thrombophilia in young adults presenting with thrombosis.

[Factors associated with fruit and vegetable intake among adults in a southern Brazilian city]. The study aimed to describe the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake among adults (20-69 years of age) and to identify associated factors. This population-based study in 2006 included 972 adults in Pelotas, Southern Brazil. Consumption of fruits and vegetables was evaluated with three questions on habitual food intake during the year prior to the interview. The outcome variable was regular consumption of fruits and vegetables. Only one in five adults (20.9%) reported consuming fruits and vegetables regularly. Female gender, age 60 years or older, higher socioeconomic status, former smoking, and physical activity were associated with the outcome variable. According to the results, fruit and vegetable intake among adults fails to meet current Ministry of Health recommendations, particularly among male, young, poor, and physically inactive adults. Interventions to encourage healthy diet are urgently needed.

Embodied image: gender differences in functional and aesthetic body image among Australian adolescents. Perceptions of the body are not restricted to the way the body "looks"; they may also extend to the way the body "functions". This research explores body image among male and female adolescents using the Embodied Image Scale (EIS), which incorporates body function into body image. Adolescents (N=1526, male=673, female=853) aged 12-17 (M=13.83, SD=1.02), from 26 Western Australian high schools were surveyed. Information was gathered on pubertal timing, body mass index (BMI) and body image. Participants reported significantly higher value of, behavioral-investment in, and satisfaction with the functional dimension of the body compared to the aesthetic dimension. After controlling for age, pubertal timing, and BMI, females reported significantly higher aesthetic values and aesthetic behavioral-investment, and lower aesthetic satisfaction, functional values, functional behavioral-investment and functional satisfaction than male participants. Grade, pubertal timing and BMI category differences were also explored.

Assessing the zooplankton community and environmental factors in a Mediterranean wetland. Mediterranean wetlands represent unique repositories of biodiversity, but these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human-induced habitat loss. Seventy percent of Greek wetlands (ponds, mires, marshes, etc.) have been lost in the past 80 years due to human intervention. In Greece habitat types of mires, listed in Directive 92/43/EEC, have been recorded in a few locations, one of the most important is Kalodiki wetland. Eutrophication key elements were determined at four sampling stations throughout 1 year in order to monitor the trophic conditions. Moreover, the zooplankton community was described as biological element relevant in the assessment of the ecological status of Kalodiki wetland. Kalodiki wetland exhibits nutrient concentrations corresponding to eutrophic conditions while according to chlorophyll-a values it is classified between mesotrophic and eutrophic status depending mostly on the sampling period. As concerning zooplankton community, it appears poor in species and dominated by small-sized organisms, which is generally typical of eutrophic, disturbed systems. Differences among zooplankton assemblages over seasons as well as among sampling sites highlight the role of both abiotic and biotic factors.

[Impact of exogenous paraquat on enzyme exudation and biochemical changes of lignin degradation fungi]. To study the effect of exogenous oxygen, we added water solution of paraquat to 7 d cultures of Coriolus versicolor for the next 148 h. Enzyme exudation and biochemical process were investigated on the addition of paraquat. We found that compared with the control (without paraquat), the addition of 30 micromol/L paraquat stimulated the activity of manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase (LiP), and laccases (Lac) 7, 2.5 and 1.3 times, respectively. Also, addition of paraquat enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the first 48 h. Impact of paraquat on ligninolytic enzymes was significant than that on antioxidant enzyme. Addition of paraquat enhanced phenolic compounds and formaldehyde of cultures too. And concentration of malondialdehyde was increased in the first 24 h. The results showed that addition of paraquat promoted oxidative stress, but the antioxidant systems of the fungal strain are sufficient to prevent mycelia from oxidative stress. As exogenous oxygen, paraquat might be a useful substrate in degradation of lignocellulose.

Health-related quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis: validation of the German CFQ-R. This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Child and Parent versions of the German CFQ-R (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised), a disease-specific measure of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Self-Rating is combined with proxy-rating by parents in the use of the questionnaire. 136 children with CF (6 - 13 years) and their parents were recruited to evaluate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and validity, 20 children and parents to examine reproducibility (ICC). Cronbach's alpha is high in all but two dimensions of the Child version (alpha = 0.23-0.77) and for all dimensions of the Parent version (alpha = 0.69-0.89). For both questionnaires, reproducibility is moderate to high (ICC = 0.50-0.94). Factor analysis shows loadings of >0.4 in the majority of items. Higher HRQoL is reported by children with mild disease compared to those with moderate/severe disease and by boys compared to girls. Convergence between self-rating and proxy-rating depends on the dimension. The German CFQ-R, Child and Parent versions, are reliable and valid measures of HRQoL. They should be administered in combination as both, child and parent, provide important information. The measure offers a new patient-reported outcome for clinical purposes as well as for national and international studies in schoolchildren.

A prospective, single-blind randomised study on the effect of intercostal nerve protection on early post-thoracotomy pain relief. Intracostal suture or intercostal muscle flap can reduce post-thoracotomy pain through the preservation of intercostal nerves below or above the incision. This study aims to test whether combining intracostal suture with intercostal muscle flap might achieve better pain relief than intracostal suture alone. This study included 144 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resection. Eighty patients entered the trial but eight were excluded. Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to a muscle flap group, in which the fifth intercostal muscle and neurovascular bundle were raised and intracostal suture on the sixth rib was applied. For the control group, only intracostal suturing on the sixth rib was done. All patients had a functional epidural placed, which were removed 24h after surgery. Differences on average numeric rating scale (aNRS) scores were assessed in an early post-operative period from day 1 to day 7 and a later period from week 2 to week 12, when patients were resting or coughing. The doses of oxycodone demand and hyperalgesia-related intercostal dermatomes (HIDs) were recorded for analysis. No differences were noted between the two groups in terms of length and width of the incision, or duration of rib retraction. Neither in different time periods (early or late) nor the activity status (while resting or coughing) yielded a statistical difference on aNRS scores between the muscle flap group and the control group (muscle flap group vs control group: mean (95% confidence intervals) from d ay 1 to day 7, 4.42 (1.56-7.28) vs 4.79 (2.03-7.55) on coughing (p=0.282); median (inter-quartile range, IQR) from day 1 to day 7, 1.71 (0.86-3) vs 2.50 (1.16-3.12) while resting (p=0.279); median (IQR) from week 2 to week 12, 0.43 (0-0.86) vs 0.48 (0.06-1.20) on coughing (p=0.595); median (IQR) from week 2 to week 12, 0 (0-0.14) vs 0.05 (0-0.14) while resting (p=0.856)). No differences were found in total oxycodone consumption from day 1 to day 7 between the two groups (Z=-1.821, p=0.069). The rate of HIDs in each intercostal space and median number of HIDs were similar between the two groups on day 1 (p>0.05) and day 7 (p>0.05). The combination of intracostal suture with intercostal muscle flap may not necessarily achieve better post-thoracotomy pain control than using intracostal suture alone.

Radiotherapy. The intrathoracic growth of the tumor causes several severe symptoms as cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, hoarseness, anorexia/nausea, and dysphagia. In patients with manifest or threatening symptoms radiotherapy (RT) as an effective measure should be implemented into the management concept. Palliative RT radiotherapy prefers short hypofractionated schemas (e.g. 10 x 3 Gy, 4 x 5 Gy, 2 x 8 Gy, 1 x 10 Gy). Careful radiation planning supports the precision of palliative RT and reduces significantly the complication rate. A good response and prolonged palliation effects (6-12 months) can be achieved in many cases. However, the minimum biologically equivalent dose should not be less than 35 Gy. RT produces a good outcome in all types of metastases of lung carcinoma. In emergencies like VCSS or spinal cord compression RT should be initiated immediately. The selection of the optimal therapy for locally advanced lung carcinoma with malignant airway obstruction is difficult. Both brachytherapy and percutaneous irradiation are effective, however published results including local a sum of response, functionality and life quality demonstrates more benefit by percutaneous RT. Due to different physical properties of these two methods the combination of brachytherapy and external beam irradiation may be advantageous.

Instrumentation for small-animal capnometry. Monitoring of human vital signs - heart rate, respiratory rate, hemoglobin oxygen saturation and others - has become an indispensable part of the standard of care in a hospital setting. For example, vital sign monitoring during administration of general anesthesia is essential, given the role that the anesthesiologist plays in assuming physiologic control. In veterinary settings, however, vital sign monitoring under anesthesia is less common, and may consist simply of a visual assessment of respiratory rate. Vital sign monitoring is especially challenging in small animals, given the high metabolic rates and small volumes under consideration. In this paper, we present a unique nose-cone design and associated instrumentation which allows for measurement of respiratory parameters - e.g., anesthesia gas concentration, inspiratory and expiratory O(2), and inspiratory and expiratory CO(2) (capnometry). Such instrumentation facilitates a physiologic assessment of small animals undergoing general anesthesia, an increasingly important consideration as small animals play a greater role in in vivo biomedical studies. In addition, the techniques proposed herein are suitable for measurement on small respiratory volumes associated with neonatal monitoring.

[Genetic polymorphisms in STK15 and MMP-2 associated susceptibility to esophageal cancer in Mongolian population]. To investigate the frequencies of alleles and the association with risk of esophageal cancer in a Mongolian population, and to compare the allele frequencies of these polymorphisms between the two populations and the susceptibility to esophageal cancer. A case-control study was conducted, and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), including FAS - 670G/A, FAS - 1377G/A, FASL -844T/C, COX-2 - 1290A/G, COX-2 - 1195G/A, STK15 Phe31Ile, MMP-2 - 1306C/T and MMP -2 -735C/T, were detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP) in 188 esophageal cancer cases and 324 normal controls of Mongolian. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. The results were then compared with the reported data of the Han ethnic Chinese population. In Mongolian, as compared with the STK15 31Ile/Ile genotype, the STK15 31Phe/Phe genotype carriers had an increased risk of esophageal cancer (adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.12-4.31), and the subjects with MMP-2 - 735TT genotype had an increased risk of esophageal cancer as compared with those with the MMP-2 - 735CC genotype (adjusted OR =4.82, 95% CI: 1.59 - 14.60). However, the rest of SNPs were not associated with the susceptibility to esophageal cancer. The allele frequencies of FASL - 844 T/C [0.264(171/648)/0.736 (477/648), 0.323(418/1296)/0.677(878/1296)], COX-2 - 1195G/A [0.431(279/648)/0.569(369/ 648), 0.492(1250/2540)/0.508(1290/2540)], MMP-2 - 1306C/T [0.869(563/648)/0.131(85/ 648), 0.835(1298/1554)/0.165(256/1554)] and MMP-2 - 735C/T [0.789(511/648)/0.211(137/ 648), 0.748(1163/1554)/0.252(391/1554)] were significantly different between the ethnic populations (chi2 = 7.03, 7.84, 3.94, 4.05, respectively, P <0.05). These findings suggested that STK15 Phe31Ile and MMP-2 -735C/T polymorphisms might be the genetic susceptibility factors for esophageal cancer in Mongolian and there should be some differences of genetic susceptibility to esophageal cancer in between Han ethnic Chinese and Mongolian population.

Domain a' of protein disulfide isomerase plays key role in inhibiting alpha-synuclein fibril formation. alpha-Synuclein (alpha Syn) is the main component of Lewy bodies formed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons which is a pathological characteristic of Parkinson's disease. It has been recently showed to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and impair ER functions. However, the mechanism of how ER responds to alpha Syn toxicity is poorly understood. In the present study, we found that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a stress protein abundant in ER, effectively inhibits alpha Syn fibril formation in vitro. In PDI molecule with a structure of abb'xa'c, domain a' was found to be essential and sufficient for PDI to inhibit alpha Syn fibril formation. PDI was further found to be more avid for binding with intermediate species formed during alpha Syn fibril formation, and the binding was more intensive in the later lag phase. Our results provide new insight into the role of PDI in protecting ER from the deleterious effects of misfolded protein accumulation in many neurodegenerative diseases.

Enhancing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people's resilience to blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections: findings from a community-based participatory research project. Health services are fundamental to reducing the burden of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections (BBV/STI) in Indigenous communities. However, we know very little about young Indigenous people's use of mainstream and community-controlled health services for the prevention and treatment of these infections, or how health services can best support young people's efforts to prevent infection. University-researchers, a site co-ordinator and peer researchers developed a project and conducted interviews with 45 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged between 17 and 26 years. Thematic analysis of interview notes identified key themes around health service use and experiences of Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). Most participants had accessed health services for the prevention or treatment of BBV/STI, with positive experiences characterised by the provision of information and feeling cared for. Participants described the comfort and understanding they experienced at ACCHS; personal relationships and having an Indigenous care provider present were important factors in the overwhelmingly positive accounts. Young people reported strategies for overcoming challenges to prevention and accessing treatment services, including being proactive by carrying condoms and persisting with behavioural intentions despite feeling shame. Our findings reinforce the important role both mainstream and community-controlled health services have in the prevention and treatment of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections in young Indigenous people. We highlight opportunities to build on young people's strengths, such as their valuing of their health, their persistence, and their offers to support peers, to better prevent transmission of infections and enhance access to treatment.


Sentence recognition in noise: Variables in compilation and interpretation of tests.

In vitro antifungal action of different substances over microwaved-cured acrylic resins. The presence of Candida albicans on the surfaces of denture-base acrylic resins is strongly related to the development of oral stomatitis. This study evaluated the antifungal action of different agents over microwave-cured acrylic resin without polishing specimens previously contaminated with Candida albicans. Sixty specimens were immersed in BHI broth previously inoculated with the yeast and stored for 3 h at 37 degrees C. They were divided into 5 experimental groups (n=10): G1: 2% chlorhexidine solution (10 min); G2: 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (10 min); G3: modified sodium hypochlorite (10 min); G4: effervescent agent (5 min); G5: hydrogen peroxide 10 v (30 min). The specimens of the control group 1 (C1) were not disinfected. Ten additional specimens of the control group 2 (C2) were not infected with the yeast, aiming to check the asepsis during the experiment. The disinfection agents were neutralized and the acrylic resin specimens were immersed in BHI Broth for 24 h. Culture media turbidity was evaluated spectrophotometrically according to the transmittance degree, i.e. the higher the transmittance the stronger the antimicrobial action. Statistical analysis was performed (Kruskal-Wallis Test, p<0.05). The results, represented by the medians, were: G1 = 40; G2 = 100; G3 = 100; G4 = 90; G5 = 100; C1 = 40; C2 = 100. This in vitro study suggested that sodium hypochlorite-based substances and hydrogen peroxide are more efficient disinfectants against C. albicans than 2% chlorhexidine solution and the effervescent agent.

Biological evolution based on nonrandom variability regulated by the organism. A hypothetical mechanism for rapid and nonrandom emergence of evolutionary adaptations is proposed. It is supposed that some transcription factors and transcription regulators that are able to cross membranes can leave the cells of their origin and move within the organism using a specialized transport system when individual development occurs under conditions extreme for the given species. This system, in particular, connects soma with germline. The supply of germline cells with unusual transcription regulators changes the balance of their nuclear regulatory RNAs, thus initiating RNA-dependent epigenetic modifications of the germline genome and therefore changes in phenotypes of the progeny. It is highly probable that some of these phenotypes are adaptive and lay the basis for the origin of the next biological species. The proposed mechanism can serve as a basis for a new theory of the origin of species.

New phylogenetic analysis of the family elephantidae based on cranial-dental morphology. In 1973, Vincent Maglio published a seminal monograph on the evolution of the Elephantidae, in which he revised and condensed the 100+ species named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1931. Michel Beden further revised the African Elephantidae in 1979, but little systematic work has been done on the family since this publication. With addition of new specimens and species and revisions of chronology, a new analysis of the phylogeny and systematics of this family is warranted. A new, descriptive character dataset was generated from studies of modern elephants for use with fossil species. Parallel evolution in cranial and dental characters in all three lineages of elephants creates homoplastic noise in cladistic analysis, but new inferences about evolutionary relationships are possible. In this analysis, early Loxodonta and early African Mammuthus are virtually indistinguishable in dental morphology. The Elephas lineage is not monophyletic, and results from this analysis suggest multiple migration events out of Africa into Eurasia, and possibly back into Africa. New insight into the origin of the three lineages is also proposed, with Stegotetrabelodon leading to the Mammuthus lineage, and Primelephas as the ancestor of Loxodonta and Elephas. These new results suggest a much more complex picture of elephantid origins, evolution, and paleogeography.

A retrospective comparison of concurrent 5-fluorouracil or oral UFT in postoperative chemoradiation for gastric adenocarcinoma. 5-fluoro-uracil (FU) is a common agent in postoperative chemoradiation in gastric adenocarcinoma. However, FU is not well tolerated in a significant proportion of patients. UFT, a fixed combination of the oral FU prodrug tegafur with uracil, is one of the agents used instead of FU in such cases. We retrospectively compared the toxicity, local and distant control and survival rates with FU or oral UFT during concurrent radiotherapy to assess the role of UFT instead of FU. We conducted a retrospective analysis of survival, disease control and toxicity data in 52 patients treated with postoperative chemoradiation following total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma with either FU or UFT between January 2003 and December 2004. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 3-59), median survival time was 23 (+/-6.08) months and 1-3 years overall survival (OS) rates were 64.9-39% for all patients. Compared with the UFT regimen, the incidence of treatment interruption was greater with FU (p=0.023), but no significant differences were seen in local control (p=0.40), distant recurrences (p=0.83) and survival rates (p=0.8657) among patients. Concurrent UFT with radiotherapy seems to be a more tolerable and an equally effective regimen in the postoperative treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma when compared to FU.

Acrodermatitis due to nutritional deficiency. Nutritional deficiency is prevalent in developing countries but should also be considered in developed countries in the setting of genetic or acquired disease states. The skin is commonly involved and is often one of the first organs affected in nutritional deficiency, providing a key to the diagnosis. This article will review the most common nutritional deficiencies causing a periorificial and/or acrodermatitis: zinc deficiency, biotin deficiency, kwashiorkor, and essential fatty acid deficiency. Whereas older literature has focused on the relationship among nutritional deficiency, malnutrition and poverty, recent research has identified additional patient populations that are at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies. These populations include premature infants, patients with long-term total parenteral nutrition, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, intestinal bypass procedures, chronic alcoholics, anorexia nervosa, and restrictive diets. Recent studies have also focused on further understanding the genetic basis of inherited nutritional deficiencies such as acrodermatitis enteropathica. Skin manifestations can lead a provider to the diagnosis of a nutritional deficiency. In a child with a periorificial or acral dermatitis, the diagnosis of zinc, biotin, protein, or essential fatty acid deficiency should be considered, especially if accompanied by systemic signs of failure to thrive.

Risk of spontaneous miscarriage in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity undergoing IVF: a meta-analysis. To investigate whether thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) is associated with increased risk for spontaneous miscarriage in subfertile, euthyroid women undergoing IVF. Meta-analysis of observational studies. Four prospective studies that reported data on 1098 subfertile women undergoing IVF (141 with TAI and 957 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. Miscarriage risk ratio (RR). Clinical pregnancy rate and delivery rate. Euthyroid, subfertile women with TAI undergoing IVF demonstrated significantly higher risk for miscarriage compared with controls (four studies-fixed effects RR: 1.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.42- 2.79, P<0.001). No significant difference in clinical pregnancy and delivery rates was detected between groups. Based on the currently available evidence, it appears that the presence of TAI is associated with an increased risk for spontaneous miscarriage in subfertile women achieving a pregnancy through an IVF procedure.

Synthesis of multi-functional nanocapsules via interfacial AGET ATRP in miniemulsion for tumor micro-environment responsive drug delivery. Novel multi-functional polymeric hollow nanocapsules (PHN) based on the crosslinked poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) shells were synthesized in a miniemulsion interfacial polymerization via activator generated electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (AGET ATRP) technique with N,N'-bis(acryloyl) cystamine (BACy) as cross-linking agent, CuBr₂ as catalyst, ascorbic acid (VC) as reducing agent and hexadecane as inert solvent. In the AGET ATRP, a folate-conjugated block copolymer, folate-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (FA-PEG-tBA-Br), was used as macroinitiator/stabilizer, and the specific amphiphilic nature of the copolymer led the extending inward of polymer chains. The DLS analysis directly showed the PHN with an average diameter of 150 nm was obtained. After the PtBA shells were transformed into poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by hydrolysis, doxorubicin (DOX), as a model drug, was loaded efficiently into the hydrolyzed polymeric hollow nanocapsules (HPHN), then the in vitro release of drug was carried out in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4 or 5.0, with or without DTT or GSH of different concentrations). It showed that the existence of folate group significantly improved pH stimuli-responsive and DOX-loading capacity of the polymeric nanocapsules. An acidic pH (5.0) and presence of GSH would accelerate the DOX release behavior. Thus, these multi-functional polymeric nanocapsules have excellent available properties in the field of targeted and controlled drug delivery for cancer therapy.

Fast quantitative detection of cocaine in beverages using nanoextractive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Without any sample pretreatment, effervescent beverage fluids were manually sprayed into the primary ion plume created by using a nanoelectrospray ionization source for direct ionization, and the analyte ions of interest were guided into an ion trap mass spectrometer for tandem mass analysis. Functional ingredients (e.g., vitamins, taurine, and caffeine, etc.) and spiked impurity (e.g., cocaine) in various beverages, such as Red Bull energy drink, Coco-cola, and Pepsi samples were rapidly identified within 1.5 s. The limit of detection was found to be 7-15 fg (S/N = 3) for cocaine in different samples using the characteristic fragment (m/z 150) observed in the MS(3) experiments. Typical relative standard deviation and recovery of this method were 6.9%-8.6% and 104%-108% for direct analysis of three actual samples, showing that nanoextractive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry is a useful technique for fast screening cocaine presence in beverages.

Mardini-Nyhan association (lung agenesis, congenital heart, and thumb anomalies): three new cases and possible recurrence in a sib-is there a distinct recessive syndrome? In 1985, Mardini and Nyhan described three patients from consanguineous families with unilateral complete/partial lung agenesis, congenital cardiac defects, and ipsilateral thumb anomalies. Although there have been many reports of lung agenesis with other malformations, especially hemifacial microsomia and radial ray anomalies, very few demonstrate this triad of defects. We describe three patients with the Mardini-Nyhan association which may represent a distinct entity, although this remains uncertain at present. A fourth patient is also described, the sister of one of the other patients, with complex congenital cardiac disease and bilateral lung lobation abnormalities. This is the first reported incidence of a possible recurrence within a family and suggests, together with the consanguinity observed by Mardini and Nyhan, that recessive inheritance should be considered in genetic counseling for this disorder.

Effect of sweet chestnut tannin (SCT) on the performance, microbial status of intestine and histological characteristics of intestine wall in chickens. 1. In experiments carried out with 950 one-day-old male chickens, the effect of tannin supplementation (0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) on performance, microbial status of chickens small intestine and colon of 28- and 41-d-old chickens, as well as histological changes of jejunum walls at 41 d and carcase quality were determined. 2. Application of 250 or 500 mg of sweet chestnut tannin per kg of feed had an insignificant effect on body weight and feed conversion of 41-d-old chickens (30 and 26%) in comparison to control birds. The highest tannin supplement (1000 mg/kg) reduced final body weight. 3. No effects of tannin supplementation on feed conversion and carcase quality were found. 4. Addition of tannin increased dry matter content of the litter by 88 (Group II) and 77% (Group III) when compared to control. 5. Higher doses of tannins significantly reduced the number of E. coli and coliform bacteria in small intestine of 28-d-old chickens; in other microorganisms great variability of microbial populations in small intestine and colon were observed. 6. The histologies of jejunal walls in chickens of control, II (250 mg/kg) and III (500 mg/kg) groups were similar. The structure was characteristic of correctly developed and functioning tissues and the villi were formed correctly. Tannin applied at the highest dose (1000 mg) slowed down the proliferation rate in the mother-cell zone. Single cells and enterocyte complexes showed the features characteristic of degradation processes. These unfavourable symptoms indicated some disturbances in intestinal wall morphology and function.

Plasma ghrelin and obestatin levels are increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Obestatin, encoded by the same gene as ghrelin, was first described as a physiological opponent of ghrelin. We investigated fasting plasma ghrelin and obestatin levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. We found that ghrelin levels, obestatin levels and the ratio of ghrelin to obestatin were significantly higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats than Wistar-Kyoto rats. Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were positively correlated; however, heart period and baroreflex sensitivity were negatively correlated with ghrelin levels. Systolic blood pressure was positively correlated, whereas baroreflex sensitivity was negatively correlated with obestatin levels. In addition, systolic blood pressure was a significantly independent variable of ghrelin levels, obestatin levels, and the ghrelin to obestatin ratio in a multiple regression analysis. Our data suggests that there is a disturbance of ghrelin and obestatin in the circulation of spontaneously hypertensive rats and the ghrelin/obestatin system might play a role in blood pressure regulation.

5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin modify the expression profiles of microRNAs in human colon cancer cells in vitro. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently taken center stage in the field of human molecular oncology. Most of the chemotherapeutics are able to interfere with nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. The purpose of this study was to determine how 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP) modify the expression profiles of miRNAs in HCT-8 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells and whether the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of the chemotherapeutics could rely in part on their influence on miRNA expression. The expression profiles of miRNAs were determined using a miRNA microarray containing 856 human miRNA probes. The expression of selected miRNAs was then validated by real-time RT-PCR. Fifty-six up- and 50 down-regulations of miRNA expression with statistical significance were identified in colon cancer cells following exposure to 5-FU or L-OHP compared to matched control cells. The down-regulations of miR-197, miR-191, miR-92a, miR-93, miR-222 and miR-1826, whose expression was significantly down-regulated in both cell lines after the treatment of one drug or in one cell line following exposure to either drug, were further validated. Analysis of the relevant literature indicated that, in line with the tumor suppressive activity of 5-FU and L-OHP, the six down-regulated miRNAs might function as oncogenes due to their overexpression in cancers, and some of them correlated with the poor prognosis and treatment-resistance of cancer. In conclusion, we identify the modification of miRNA expression profiles in colon cancer cells following exposure to 5-FU and L-OHP, and our results indicate that their pharmacodynamic mechanisms could rely in part on their influence on the down-regulated miRNA expression. Further studies are needed to determine whether these miRNAs and their target genes might potentially provide for novel molecular markers and act as novel targets for treatment by interference.

Improving malaria recognition, treatment and referral practices by training caretakers in rural Nigeria. A caretaker training programme was carried out in Ugwuogo-Nike, a rural area in south-east Nigeria, based on formative research within the community. A training of trainers workshop was organized for 30 leaders of women groups who subsequently trained other mothers in their group. Community information activities, which lasted for a period of eight months, included the use of posters, drama group and jingles. The programme was evaluated using the quantitative and qualitative methods that were employed at baseline, which included community survey and focus group discussions (FGDs). For the community survey, households with children under five years of age were identified and provided the sampling frame, from which 300 households were chosen using the systematic sampling method. The target population for the FGDs were caretakers of children under five years. Post-intervention evaluation of the programme showed significant (p<0.05) improvements in knowledge, home management of malaria and referral practices for severe malaria. Those who correctly reported that mosquitoes were the cause of malaria rose markedly from 39.7% to 88.7%. Knowledge of symptoms of mild and severe malaria also increased significantly. Only 1.5% of caretakers were aware of the correct dose of anti-malarial before intervention, but this increased to 41.5%. The impact of intervention brought about a dramatic change in the practice of taking severely ill children, especially those with convulsion, to a traditional healer. A minority (6.7%) of caretakers took a severely ill child to a traditional healer as against 60% pre-intervention. There was also a significant increase in use of formal health facilities for the treatment of severely ill children. The study findings support the view that training of mothers to recognize, treat appropriately and refer severe cases of malaria is feasible and may lead to a reduction in the incidence of severe disease.


Beneficial effect of pentoxifylline into the testis of rats in an experimental model of unilateral hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition counteracts multiple manifestations of kidney disease in long-term streptozotocin-diabetic rat model. Evidence for the important role for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is emerging. We previously reported that PARP inhibitors counteract early Type 1 diabetic nephropathy. This study evaluated the role for PARP in kidney disease in long-term Type 1 diabetes. Control and streptozotocin-diabetic rats were maintained with or without treatment with the PARP inhibitor 10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-diaza-benzo[de] anthracen-3-one (GPI-15,427, Eisai Inc.), 30mgkg(-1)d(-1), for 26 weeks after first 2 weeks without treatment. PARP activity in the renal cortex was assessed by Western blot analysis of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins. Urinary albumin, isoprostane, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine excretion, and renal concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta(1), vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, fibronectin, and nitrotyrosine were evaluated by ELISA, and urinary creatinine and renal lipid peroxidation products by colorimetric assays. PARP inhibition counteracted diabetes-associated increase in renal cortex poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated protein level. Urinary albumin, isoprostane, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine excretions and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were increased in diabetic rats, and all these changes were at least partially prevented by GPI-15,427 treatment. PARP inhibition counteracted diabetes-induced renal transforming growth factor-beta(1), vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibronectin, but not soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and nitrotyrosine, accumulations. Lipid peroxidation product concentrations were indistinguishable among control and diabetic rats maintained with or without GPI-15,427 treatment. In conclusion, PARP activation plays an important role in kidney disease in long-term diabetes. These findings provide rationale for development and further studies of PARP inhibitors and PARP inhibitor-containing combination therapies, for prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

Feasibility and usefulness of training assertive community treatment team in cognitive behavioral therapy. Individuals with Serious mental illness require psychosocial treatments as adjunct to pharmacotherapy to promote recovery. An ACT team was trained in CBT interventions and charts were reviewed to identify sessions where CBT was utilized. Subjects who received at least 3 sessions of CBT went from 10% before training to 44% after training and 54% in the follow up period. All team members including bachelor's level staff provided CBT interventions. Results show that ACT Team members including those at bachelor's level can be trained in CBT and they utilize these interventions after training is completed.

Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. Epigenetic modifications of histones have been implicated in the regulation of cell specific expression of genes required for neuronal development. The best studied post-translational (epigenetic) modification of histones is the process of reversible acetylation. Two types of enzymes - histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) establish and maintain specific patterns of histone acetylation in balance, thereby contributing to both transcriptional activation and repression of specific sets of genes. Histone deacetylases catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from selected lysine residues in the conserved tails of core histone proteins and are considered as transcriptional corepressors. A significant amount of data implicates HDACs in diverse biological processes, including tissue specific developmental program by silencing specific growth-inhibitory genes. In line with this, gene disruption studies have shown that the class I deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2 play an essential role in nervous system development. In the present review, we briefly highlight current insights supporting the function of histone deacetylases in rodent brain development and discuss present knowledge referring to their role in neurogenesis, taking into consideration results obtained in culture systems and in in vivo studies. 

[Effects of combined use of dofetilide and verapamil on the action potential of papillary muscles in guinea pigs]. To test the effects of combined use of dofetilide and verapamil on the action potential of papillary muscles in guinea pigs. Under the stimulation of different frequencies (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25 or 2.0 Hz), the action potential of papillary muscles in guinea pigs was recorded with the standard microelectrode techniques. The impacts of different concentrations of amiodarone (1, 5 or 10 micromol/L), dofetilide (10, 50, 100 nmol/L), and a combination of 100 nmol/L dofetilide and 1 micromol/L verapamil on the action potential were tested. Amiodarone prolonged the action potential duration (APD) significantly, measured both at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) of repolarization, in a concentration-dependent manner independent from stimulation frequencies. Dofetilide prolonged APD in a concentration-dependent manner, which was negatively dependent on stimulation frequencies. The frequency-dependent effect was ameliorated by adding 1 micromol/L verapamil to dofetilide. Both amiodarone and dofetilide prolong APD in a concentration-dependent manner. The class III antiarrhythmic compounds, amiodarone, has less frequency-dependent effect than the pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. A combined use of potassium and calcium antagonists may reduce the frequency-dependence of the pure class III antiarrhythmic drug.


Race of male sex partners and occurrence of bacterial vaginosis.

Robust hairy microspheres and derived hairy surfaces by an "inside-out" wet approach. Robust hairy microspheres were conveniently synthesized through an "inside-out" protrusion approach consisting of a sol-gel reaction and a radical polymerization, from conventional organosilanes and vinyl monomers. Their hierarchical structures of hard cores and plastic hairs can be adjusted in terms of their sizes and compositions to impart various chemical and physical properties on their surfaces. These hairy microspheres can also be built into hairy surfaces with many useful functions, such as superhydrophobicity. This work opens up a new route for the synthesis of hierarchical particles and enriches the tool library of material and surface engineering.

Olanzapine, not resperidone, exacerbates beta-cell function and mass in ovariectomized diabetic rats and estrogen replacement reverses them. The effect of risperidone and olanzapine on beta-cell function and mass was investigated in 90% pancreatectomized and ovariectomized female rats, of which some were treated with estrogen replacement and some were not. Ovariectomized diabetic rats were divided into two groups: one group received daily estrogen replacement (30 mug 17beta-estradiol/kg body weight) and the other group received a vehicle. Each group was further divided into three subgroups and orally given either a placebo, risperidone (0.5 mg/kg body weight), or olanzapine (2 mg/kg body weight) each day in conjunction with a high-fat diet for eight weeks. Ovariectomy reduced serum prolactin levels, while risperidone and estrogen replacement increased them. Olanzapine, not risperidone, increased body weight gain and epididymal fats, and impaired glucose tolerance in ovariectomized diabetic rats, while estrogen replacement improved them. This was related to changes in insulin secretion capacity. Ovariectomized rats had decreased beta-cell mass, due to decreasing beta-cell proliferation, compared with Sham rats, and olanzapine, but not risperidone, caused further reduction. Olanzapine reduced IRS2 protein levels in the islets of ovariectomized rats. Decreased IRS2 attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and, subsequently, PDX-1 protein levels were lowered in olanzapine-treated rats. Estrogen replacement activated insulin/IGF-1 signaling regardless of treatment. In conclusion, olanzapine, but not risperidone, exacerbated glucose homeostasis partly by attenuating beta-cell function and mass in ovariectomized diabetic rats, while estrogen replacement reversed its negative impact. Further human studies are needed to support the claim that olanzapine should be avoided in the treatment of schizophrenic postmenopausal patients with diabetes.

[Resident and circulating mast cells in propulsative organs of the frog Rana temporaria]. Mast cells (MCs) of the "blood" and lymph hearts of the adult frog Rana temporaria were investigated at histochemical and ultrastructural levels. Two populations of MCs were revealed in these propulsative organs: population of resident MCs and population of circulating MCs. It has been shown that the resident cardiac MCs have an oval or elongated form and are located between atrial or ventricular myocytes and under endocardial endothelium. The resident cardiac MCs are situated in connective tissue of epicardium, too. Avascular myocardium of the frog ventricle consists of a spongy network of muscle trabeculae. We revealed circulating MCs in intertrabecular spaces and clefts of the spongy myocardium and in the blood of the main central cavity. Circulating MCs are round in shape and contain a large central nucleus enriched with condensed chromatin. They resemble the lymphocytes, but show cytoplasm filled with granules. These granules ultrastructure is much like that of the granules of the cardiac resident MCs. In the lymph heart, oval and somewhat elongated resident MCs are located in the interstitial space among cross-striated muscle fibers and among smooth muscle cells of tubular (afferent and efferent) valves. Sometimes lymphocyte-like circulating MCs are revealed in the cavity of lymph heart. Circulating MCs are also present in the lymphatics located adjacent to the lymph hearts. In certain parts of the lymphatic walls MCs are in close adhesion to the mesothelial cells lining the lymphatic cavity. Our histochemical investigation revealed that both the resident and circulating MCs of the propulsative organs give a strongly positive reaction with alcian blue, but weakly red with safranin and weakly metachromatic with toluidine blue. The presence of population of circulating MCs in the frog suggests that there are differences in biology of MCs between lower and higher vertebrates.

A motif-based analysis of glycan array data to determine the specificities of glycan-binding proteins. Glycan arrays have enabled detailed studies of the specificities of glycan-binding proteins. A challenge in the interpretation of glycan array data is to determine the specific features of glycan structures that are critical for binding. To address this challenge, we have developed a systematic method to interpret glycan array data using a motif-based analysis. Each glycan on a glycan array is classified according to its component sub-structures, or motifs. We analyze the binding of a given lectin to each glycan in terms of the motifs in order to identify the motifs that are selectively present in the glycans that are bound by the lectin. We compared two different methods to calculate the identification, termed intensity segregation and motif segregation, for the analysis of three well-characterized lectins with highly divergent behaviors. Both methods accurately identified the primary specificities as well as the weaker, secondary specificities of all three lectins. The complex binding behavior of wheat germ agglutinin was reduced to its simplified, independent specificities. We compiled the motif specificities of a wide variety of plant lectins, human lectins, and glycan-binding antibodies to uncover the relationships among the glycan-binding proteins and to provide a means to search for lectins with particular binding specificities. This approach should be valuable for rapidly analyzing and using glycan array data, for better describing and understanding glycan-binding specificities, and as a means to systematize and compare data from glycan arrays.

The effect of gypenosides on cardiac function and expression of cytoskeletal genes of myocardium in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. The relationship between changes of cardiac function and the gene expressions of two major myocardial skeleton proteins, titin and nebulin, and the effect of gypenosides on these gene expressions in diabetic cardiomyopathy rat were explored in the present study. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, diabetic cardiomyopathy group and gypenosides-treated diabetic cardiomyopathy group. The diabetic cardiomyopathy was induced in rats by injecting streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Seven weeks after the rats suffered from diabetes, the rats were treated with gypenosides 100 mg/kg per day orally for six weeks in gypenosides-treated group. In the meanwhile, the pure water was given to diabetic cardiomyopathy and the control groups. Subsequently, the cardiac functions, including left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), +/- dP/dt(max) and t-dP/d(max)t, as well as the mRNA content and proteins of titin and nebulin in myocardium were determined. The results indicated that (1) the diabetic cardiomyopathy rats had decreased LVSP and +/- dP/dt(max), increased LVEDP, and prolonged t-dP/dt(max) than normal rats; (2) LVSP and +/- dP/dt(max) in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats treated with gypenosides were significantly higher and LVEDP and t-dP/dt(max) were significantly lower than those without giving gypenosides; (3) the mRNA contents and proteins of titin and nebulin in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats were remarkably lower than those in the control rats and gypenosides had no effect on mRNA and protein expression levels of titin and nebulin in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. We conclude that (1) the cardiac function as well as the mRNA expressions of titin and nebulin decreased in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats; (2) gypenosides secure cardiac muscles and their function from diabetic impairment and these beneficial effects of gypenosides are not by changing the expressions of titin and nebulin.

Improvement of β-cell function ameliorated glycemic variability in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after short-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or in combination with sitagliptin treatment: a randomized control trial. Glycemic variability (GV) has been proposed as contributor to diabetes-related macrovascular complications. This randomized control trial evaluated a new combination therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) plus sitagliptin (CSII + sitagliptin) vs. CSII only in terms of metabolic control, GV and β-cell function in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 217 patients were randomized to two weeks of CSII (n = 108) or CSII + sitagliptin (n = 109) therapy. As a measure of GV, the coefficient of variation (CV) was computed from capillary blood glucose during the first and second week, respectively. β-cell function before and after treatment was determined with the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2). Good metabolic controls were established with both therapies. CSII + sitagliptin therapy resulted in greater improvements in CV and ISSI-2 than CSII alone (all P = 0.000). For each group, change in CV was inversely correlated with change in ISSI-2 (r = -0.529, P = 0.000 and r = -0.433, P = 0.000, respectively). The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that improved ISSI-2 was the only independent contributor to reduced CV in both groups (standardized β = -0.388, P = 0.004 and standardized β = -0.472, P = 0.000, respectively). Correction of β-cell function in newly diagnosed T2DM patients via use of either CSII or CSII + sitagliptin therapy was feasible in controlling GV to prevent secondary complications of T2DM. Moreover, CSII + sitagliptin therapy was superior to CSII monotherapy in terms of GV.

Management of adult Jehovah's Witness patients with acute bleeding. Because of the firm refusal of transfusion of blood and blood components by Jehovah's Witnesses, the management of Jehovah's Witness patients with severe bleeding is often complicated by medical, ethical, and legal concerns. Because of a rapidly growing and worldwide membership, physicians working in hospitals should be prepared to manage these patients. Appropriate management of a Jehovah's Witness patient with severe bleeding entails understanding of the legal and ethical issues involved, and meticulous medical management, including treatment of hypovolemic shock, local hemostatic interventions, and administration of prohemostatic agents, when appropriate. In addition, high-dose recombinant erythropoietin in combination with supplemental iron may enhance the speed of hemoglobin synthesis.

Nanoparticles for tumor-specific intracellular drug delivery. While intraperitoneal (IP) therapy of ovarian cancer is a theoretically promising treatment option, it is not clinically well accepted due to the several challenges in IP drug delivery. Nanoparticles are promising drug carriers, which may alleviate the difficulties in IP chemotherapy. However, currently available nanoparticles need to be further improved to fulfill the following requirements: (i) they must remain non-interactive with normal cells and prevent the payload from premature leaking; (ii) once the drug carriers reach the tumor, they should enter the cells efficiently and release the drug in the cells to effectively kill the targeted cells. Our recent observation indicates that a popular nanoparticle system fails these expectations by large margin. For safe and effective IP chemotherapy, new types of carriers and/or surface modification strategies are urgently needed.

TWEAK: a novel biomarker for lupus nephritis? Renal involvement is common in systemic lupus erythematosus. Early diagnosis of lupus nephritis (LN), allowing the instigation of appropriate therapy, remains an important clinical challenge. Current biomarkers in clinical practice are less than ideal, lacking both sensitivity and specificity. In the previous issue of Arthritis Research & Therapy, Schwartz and colleagues demonstrated the potential value of urinary TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (uTWEAK) as a biomarker for LN. They showed that uTWEAK is elevated in subjects with LN at diagnosis compared with those with systemic lupus erythematosus but no renal disease, and correlates with the degree of clinical disease activity. These data are thought-provoking and provide the platform for future longer-term studies.

Potential Targets for Antifungal Drug Discovery Based on Growth and Virulence in Candida albicans. Fungal infections, especially infections caused by Candida albicans, remain a challenging problem in clinical settings. Despite the development of more-effective antifungal drugs, their application is limited for various reasons. Thus, alternative treatments with drugs aimed at novel targets in C. albicans are needed. Knowledge of growth and virulence in fungal cells is essential not only to understand their pathogenic mechanisms but also to identify potential antifungal targets. This article reviews the current knowledge of the mechanisms of growth and virulence in C. albicans and examines potential targets for the development of new antifungal drugs. 

Impact of thrombogenic mutations on clinical phenotypes of von Willebrand disease. von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a most common inherited bleeding disorder. von Willebrand factor (VWF) exists as an extracellular adaptor molecule and generally involves in the hemostasis mechanism through binding with GP (Glycoprotein) Ib-IX-V platelet receptor. Clinical phenotype of bleeding disorders modulated to a decrease in bleeding symptoms by thrombogenic mutations. We made an attempt to investigate the impact of thrombogenic mutations/polymorphisms on the clinical phenotype of 114 different types of patients with VWD, and 120 healthy controls were screened for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T, factor V (FV) Leiden (1691G/A), beta(3) integrin (HPA-I) (Human platelets antigen-I) gene (1565T/C), and prothrombin 20210G/A mutations. Genotypic analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Forty-five patients (39.5%) were found to be positive for at least one of the prothrombotic risk factors screened. Prothrombin 20210G/A was not found in any patient with VWD as well as healthy control. Eight patients with VWD were carrying the defective alleles of different thrombogenic markers, showing milder phenotypes than expected. A high prevalence was observed for MTHFR 677C/T (677C/C 73.6%, 677C/T 24.6%, 677T/T 1.8%) and PLA1/A2 (1565T/T 88.6%, 1565T/C 10.5%, 1565C/C 0.87%) polymorphism followed by FV Leiden (1691G/G 97.4%, 1691G/ A 2.6%, 1691A/A 0.00%) in patients with VWD with allelic frequencies 11.4% (677T), 5% (1565C), and 1.3% (1691A). Hence, we concluded that thrombophilic markers were seen to be influencing the clinical phenotypes of patients with VWD.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Absence of Cirrhosis in United States Veterans is Associated With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can develop in individuals without cirrhosis. We investigated risk factors for development of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis in a U.S. We identified a national cohort of 1500 patients with verified HCC during 2005 to 2010 in the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) and reviewed their full VA medical records for evidence of cirrhosis and risk factors for HCC. Patients without cirrhosis were assigned to categories of level 1 evidence for no cirrhosis (very high probability) or level 2 evidence for no cirrhosis (high probability), which were based on findings from histologic analyses, laboratory test results, markers of fibrosis from noninvasive tests, and imaging features. A total of 43 of the 1500 patients with HCC (2.9%) had level 1 evidence for no cirrhosis, and 151 (10.1%) had level 2 evidence for no cirrhosis; the remaining 1203 patients (80.1%) had confirmed cirrhosis. Compared with patients with HCC in presence of cirrhosis, greater proportions of patients with HCC without evidence of cirrhosis had metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or no identifiable risk factors. Patients with HCC without evidence of cirrhosis were less likely to have abused alcohol or have hepatitis C virus infection than patients with cirrhosis. Patients with HCC and NAFLD (unadjusted odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-8.5) or metabolic syndrome (unadjusted odds ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-7.8) had more than 5-fold risk of having HCC in the absence of cirrhosis, compared with patients with HCV-related HCC. Approximately 13% of patients with HCC in the VA system do not appear to have cirrhosis. NAFLD and metabolic syndrome are the main risk factors for HCC in the absence of cirrhosis.

Mild experimental autoimmune encephalitis as a tool to induce blood-brain barrier dysfunction. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a border limiting access of immunoglobulins from the circulation into the brain. This becomes relevant when studying the pathogenesis of antibody-mediated autoimmune CNS disorders. Here, we characterized the BBB dysfunction in a model of mild experimental adoptive transfer autoimmune encephalomyelitis (AT-EAE). We show that large molecules can readily penetrate the BBB between days 3 and 7 after EAE-induction. This model may be valuable for studying putative pathogenic effects of immunoglobulins in the central nervous system.

Pulsatility of insulin release--a clinically important phenomenon. The mechanisms and clinical importance of pulsatile insulin release are presented against the background of more than half a century of companionship with the islets of Langerhans. The insulin-secreting beta-cells are oscillators with intrinsic variations of cytoplasmic ATP and Ca(2+). Within the islets the beta-cells are mutually entrained into a common rhythm by gap junctions and diffusible factors (ATP). Synchronization of the different islets in the pancreas is supposed to be due to adjustment of the oscillations to the same phase by neural output of acetylcholine and ATP. Studies of hormone secretion from the perfused pancreas of rats and mice revealed that glucose induces pulses of glucagon anti-synchronous with pulses of insulin and somatostatin. The anti-synchrony may result from a paracrine action of somatostatin on the glucagon-producing alpha-cells. Purinoceptors have a key function for pulsatile release of islet hormones. It was possible to remove the glucagon and somatostatin pulses with maintenance of those of insulin with an inhibitor of the P2Y(1) receptors. Knock-out of the adenosine A(1) receptor prolonged the pulses of glucagon and somatostatin without affecting the duration of the insulin pulses. Studies of isolated human islets indicate similar relations between pulses of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin as found during perfusion of the rodent pancreas. The observation of reversed cycles of insulin and glucagon adds to the understanding how the islets regulate hepatic glucose production. Current protocols for pulsatile intravenous infusion therapy (PIVIT) should be modified to mimic the anti-synchrony between insulin and glucagon normally seen in the portal blood.

Nutrition aspects of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, and is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Notable carcinogens involved in the development of lung cancer include smoking, secondhand smoke, and radon. Lung cancer is divided into 2 major types: non-small-cell lung cancer, the most prevalent, and small-cell lung cancer. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of the same. Medical nutrition therapy is often required for nutrition-related side effects of cancer treatment, which include but are not limited to anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and esophagitis. The best protection against lung cancer is avoidance of airborne carcinogens and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown that smokers taking large amounts of beta-carotene and vitamin A supplements had increased lung cancer incidence and mortality. However, ingestion of beta-carotene from foods, along with a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, has a protective role against lung disease. The use of complementary and alternative medicine by lung cancer patients is prevalent; therefore, clinicians should investigate whether complementary and alternative therapies are used by patients and advise them on the use of these therapies to avoid any potential side effects and interactions with conventional therapies. The article concludes with a case study of a patient with non-small-cell lung cancer and illustrates the use of medical nutrition therapy in relation to cancer treatment side effects.


Development of a toolkit and glossary to aid in the adaptation of health technology assessment (HTA) reports for use in different contexts.

Molecular identification of blood source animals from black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) collected in the alpine regions of Japan. One of vector-borne avian protozoa, Leucocytozoon lovati, has been found in the Japanese rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus japonicus), the endangered bird species distributed in the alpine regions in Japan. Vector arthropod species of L. lovati has also been estimated as Simuliidae black flies distributed in the same habitat of the host bird, however, possible blood meals of the black flies were not identified yet. To reveal host animals of black flies, we estimated the blood resources by using molecular techniques. Black flies were collected at Mt. Chogatake, one of the alpine regions of Japan in which Japanese rock ptarmigans live in June 2005. The analyzed 144 specimens were morphologically identified into five species including Simulium japonicum (n = 87), Prosimulium hirtipes (n = 48), Prosimulium yezoense (n = 3), Twinnia japonensis (n = 3), and Cnephia mutata (n = 3). Individually extracted DNA from the black flies was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification targeting the partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of birds or mammals to identify the blood meals. Of 144 black flies examined, 34 specimens were PCR positive for avian hosts (23.6%). No mammalian-derived bloods were detected from the samples studied through. Sequences amplified from 11 black flies consist of S. japonicum, P. hirtipes, and C. mutata showed high similarity to that of the Japanese rock ptarmigan. Therefore, present results conclusively suggest that these three species of black flies might suck the bloods of Japanese rock ptarmigans and could be the vector for L. lovati infection among this endangered bird species of Japan.

Inactivation of HAUSP in vivo modulates p53 function. Hausp is a deubiquitinase that has been shown to regulate the p53-Mdm2 pathway. Cotransfection of p53 and Hausp stabilizes p53 through the removal of ubiquitin moieties from polyubiquitinated p53. Interestingly, knockout or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Hausp in human cells also resulted in the stabilization of p53 due to the destabilization of Mdm2, suggesting a dynamic role of Hausp in p53 activation. To understand the physiological functions of Hausp, we generated hausp knockout mice. Hausp knockout mice die during early embryonic development between embryonic days E6.5 and E7.5. The hausp knockout embryos showed p53 activation, but no apparent increase in apoptosis. Embryonic lethality was caused by a dramatic reduction in proliferation and termination in development, in part due to p53 activation and/or abrogation of p53-independent functions. Although deletion of p53 did not completely rescue the embryonic lethality of the hausp knockout, embryonic development was extended in both hausp and p53 double knockout embryos. These data show that Hausp has a critical role in regulating the p53-Mdm2 pathway.

Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis implementation in the United States: a work in progress. After the initial approval of the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for anti-HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), uptake was initially limited, but more recent community surveys and expert opinion suggest wider acceptance in some key populations. Demonstration projects are underway to determine the best practices in the United States to identify at-risk individuals in primary care and sexually transmitted disease clinics who could benefit from PrEP. Studies of PrEP in combination with behavioural interventions are being evaluated. Studies to evaluate the use of PrEP by HIV-uninfected women in HIV-discordant couples interested in safe conception are also getting underway. The optimal deployment of PrEP as part of a comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy in the United States has been limited by lack of knowledge among some at-risk people and by some medical providers indicating that they do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable and comfortable in prescribing PrEP. Studies are underway to determine how to assist busy clinicians to determine which of their patients could benefit from PrEP. Although most federal health insurance programmes will cover most of the costs associated with PrEP, underinsured patients in states that have not enacted health reform face additional challenges in paying for PrEP medication and appropriate clinical monitoring. PrEP implementation in the United States is a work in progress, with increasing awareness and uptake among some individuals in key populations.

Antiepileptics in brain metastases: safety, efficacy and impact on life expectancy.

Relationships between coping strategies and lumbar muscle activity in subjects with chronic low back pain. Concerning chronic low back pain (CLBP), different cognitive-behavioral models have hypothesized that coping strategies play a role in the chronification of pain by changes in physical activity. Strategies such as avoidance - or persistent coping may be related to changes in (lumbar) muscle activity. Investigate the different coping strategies present in CLBP and whether these are differentially related to lumbar muscle activity during walking. In a cross sectional study, 63 subjects with CLBP walked on a treadmill at 3.8 km/h. Coping strategies were measured with the Dutch version of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire and three factors were identified with principal component analysis. Surface electromyography data of the erector spinae were obtained and smooth rectified electromyography (SRE) values were averaged per periods of swing and double support. The ratio of SRE values (swing/double support) was used as a measure of relaxation. The relation between SRE values and coping strategies was analyzed with random coefficient analysis. Three coping strategies (i.e. "catastrophizing", "distraction" and "persistence and control") could be discerned. "Catastrophizing" was positively related to (natural logarithm) SRE values (beta=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10; R(2)=7.7%). "Distraction" was negatively associated with SRE ratios (beta=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.05 to -0.01; R(2)=7.5%). No relation was found between "persistence and control" and SRE values or ratios. In CLBP, a maladaptive coping strategy like "catastrophizing" is related to increased lumbar muscle activity, and an adaptive strategy like "distraction" to increased lumbar muscle relaxation during walking.

Retrospective assessment of prevalence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) after implementation of a new guideline for the use of gadobenate dimeglumine as a sole contrast agent for magnetic resonance examination in renally impaired patients. From May 2007 to January 2008, patients with Stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing gadobenate dimeglumine (GBD)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were included in the retrospective investigation. The electronic medical records were reviewed to assess the prevalence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renally impaired patients underwent GBD-enhanced MR examinations. In all, 250 patients (98 men, mean age 72.6 years) were included: 97% of the patients had Stage 3 CKD (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); 37% had been exclusively exposed to GBD. The remaining were exposed to GBD and other gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The mean dose of GBD was 22 mL (standard deviation [SD], 11.2). Including exposure to other GBCAs, the mean cumulative dose of gadolinium was 61 mL (SD, 62.3). A total of 206 patients (82%) had skin examinations following the last GBD administration (mean duration, 108 days). No evidence of suspected or diagnosed NSF was found. In conclusion, on the basis of a retrospective chart review there was no skin evidence of NSF in predominantly Stage 3 CKD patients who were exposed to GBD at an average follow-up of 108 days, either solely or in combination with other GBCAs.

Environmental determinants of campylobacteriosis risk in Philadelphia from 1994 to 2007. Campylobacter species infections are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and may uncommonly be complicated by renal, neurological, and rheumatologic sequelae. Although excess summertime campylobacteriosis has been observed, environmental mechanisms driving disease seasonality are poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationship between environmental factors and campylobacteriosis risk in a major North American metropolitan area. We evaluated 1532 cases of campylobacteriosis reported in Philadelphia between 1994 and 2007. We constructed Poisson regression models with oscillatory smoothers, and also used case-crossover design, to evaluate the associations between environmental exposures and disease risk on weekly and daily time scales. Both methods control for confounding by seasonally oscillating environmental factors. Incidence was greatest in June and July, with annual periodicity. Weekly incidence was associated with increasing relative humidity, (incidence rate ratio (IRR) per % 1.017, 95% CI 1.008-1.025), temperature (IRR per degrees C 1.041, 95% CI 1.011-1.072), and decreasing Delaware River temperature during the same week (IRR per degrees C 0.922, 95% CI 0.883-0.962), and at 4-week lags (IRR per degrees C 0.953, 95% CI 0.919-0.990). No acute associations were identified in case-crossover analyses. Our findings affirm the summertime seasonality of campylobacteriosis in Philadelphia, and the link between warm, humid weather and disease risk. However, the link between low river temperatures and enhanced campylobacteriosis risk in humans described here is novel, consistent with known links between watershed temperature and Campylobacter survival, and implicates local watersheds as epidemiologically important reservoirs for foodborne pathogens.

[Viral etiology of acute respiratory infections]. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are pathologies that affect the respiratory tract from the proximal pharynx to the lungs, with an evolution of less than 15 days. They constitute the most frequent cause of morbimortality in the world. With the purpose of identifying the viral agents associated to this type of infections in patients of Zulia State, Venezuela, between February 2005 and July 2006, a total of 102 samples of the respiratory tract (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal washing, spit and bronchoalveolar lavage) were studied. Viral isolation was made through a cellular culture and the identification of the pathogenic agents by the technique of direct immunofluorescence. Forty six positive samples were obtained (45%). The greater incidence was found in the groups of 41 to 64 years old patients, followed by lactanting babies (1 to 23 months). There were no significant differences between sexes. Within the isolated viral pathogens, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was the agent most frequently found (32.6% p < 0.05), followed by Adenovirus (28.2%), Parainfluenza (23.9%) and Influenza (15.2%). The respiratory infections of the low respiratory tract were the most frequent (67.4%). A high incidence of associated viral agents to ARI in Zulia State is demonstrated. A high incidence in adult patients and the greatest positivity was found for RSV.

Occurrence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in Brazilian Indians from Umutina Reservation, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is associated with periodontal disease, especially localized aggressive periodontitis, produces a potent leukotoxin and its distribution is influenced by ethnic characteristics of the population. Using culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, this study evaluated the occurrence of this microorganism and the distribution of leukotoxic strains isolated from Indians belonging to the Umutima Reservation, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Forty-eight native Brazilians with gingivitis and 38 with chronic periodontitis, belonging to Umutina, Paresi, Bororo, Bakairi, Kayabi, Irantxe, Nambikwara and Terena ethnicities, were studied. Subgingival, supragingival and saliva samples of each patient were collected and transferred to VMGA III medium and to ultra pure Milli Q water. Bacteria were grown on TSBV agar and incubated in anaerobiosis (90% N2 + 10% CO2) at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The presence of the ltx promoter was determined by PCR, and a 530 bp deletion in the promoter was evaluated by using specific primers. A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from 8.33% of saliva, supragingival and subgingival samples from patients with gingivitis and from 18.42% of saliva and supragingival biofilm, and 26.32% subgingival biofilm from patients with chronic periodontitis. By PCR, the bacterial DNA was detected in 8.33% of saliva, supragingival and subgingival biofilms from patients with gingivitis and from 23.68% of saliva, 28.95% supragingival biofilm and 34.21% subgingival biofilm from patients with periodontitis. All strains were grouped as non-JP2 clones based on the absence of deletion in the leukotoxin promoter. Differences among the microbial and clinical parameters in patients were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney, Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The present results suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans can be related to the attachment loss in this population, but the presence of minimally leukotoxic strains, as well as its role in the pathogenesis of the periodontitis in these native Brazilians need to be further investigated.


Defining recovery from an eating disorder: Conceptualization, validation, and examination of psychosocial functioning and psychiatric comorbidity.

Tension-type headache in children: the Cinderella of headache disorders! Tension-type headache (TTH) may be as common a headache disorder as migraine in children and adolescents. TTH has a neurobiological basis with genetic and environmental factors making variable contributions to the different sub-types. The diagnostic criteria for TTH in the second edition of the "International Classification of Headache Disorders" appear to be applicable to children. Anxiety and mood disorders may be co-morbid with frequent episodic and chronic TTH. Psychosocial stressors play an important role in precipitating and maintaining TTH. Hence, a biopsychosocial approach should be adopted for care. Standardized histories and examinations together with prospective headache diaries are the foundations for good management; attention to 'red flags' will help identify secondary causes that present with headache similar to TT. There are no randomized controlled drug trials for the treatment of TTH. Relaxation and cognitive behavioral therapies are effective. TTH in children and adolescents warrants greater recognition from the clinician and scientist. Studies focusing on TTH are overdue.

Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Plateau. Due to its numerous environmental extremes, the Tibetan Plateau--the world's highest plateau--is one of the most challenging areas of modern human settlement. Archaeological evidence dates the earliest settlement on the plateau to the Late Paleolithic, while previous genetic studies have traced the colonization event(s) to no earlier than the Neolithic. To explore whether the genetic continuity on the plateau has an exclusively Neolithic time depth, we studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome variation within 6 regional Tibetan populations sampled from Tibet and neighboring areas. Our results confirm that the vast majority of Tibetan matrilineal components can trace their ancestry to Epipaleolithic and Neolithic immigrants from northern China during the mid-Holocene. Significantly, we also identified an infrequent novel haplogroup, M16, that branched off directly from the Eurasian M founder type. Its nearly exclusive distribution in Tibetan populations and ancient age (>21 kya) suggest that M16 may represent the genetic relics of the Late Paleolithic inhabitants on the plateau. This partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetan populations bridges the results and inferences from archaeology, history, and genetics.

Oxidized mitochondrial protein degradation and repair in aging and oxidative stress. Proteins are main targets for oxidative damage that occurs during aging and in oxidative stress situations. Since the mitochondria is a major source of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial proteins are especially exposed to oxidative modification, and elimination of oxidized proteins is crucial for maintaining the integrity of this organelle. Hence, enzymatic reversal of protein oxidation and protein degradation is critical for protein homeostasis while protein maintenance failure has been implicated in the age-related accumulation of oxidized proteins. Within the mitochondrial matrix, the ATP-stimulated mitochondrial Lon protease is believed to play an important role in the degradation of oxidized protein, and age-associated impairment of Lon-like protease activity has been suggested to contribute to oxidized protein buildup in the mitochondria. Oxidized protein repair is limited to certain oxidation products of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. Oxidized protein repair systems, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase or glutaredoxin/glutathione/glutathione reductase that catalytically reduce disulfide bridges or sulfenic acids, and methionine sulfoxide reductase that reverses methionine sulfoxide back to methionine within proteins, are present in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, the role of the mitochondrial Lon protease and the oxidized protein repair system methionine sulfoxide reductase is further addressed in the context of oxidative stress and aging.


Environmental enrichment reduces the impact of novelty and motivational properties of ethanol in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

[Pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the role of FGF23 and Klotho]. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex metabolic alteration secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reduction of 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is the first derangement, followed by an increase in PTH, and, lastly, calcium and phosphate modifications. Vitamin D is a hormone whose actions take place through a specific receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is ubiquitous. Accordingly, heterogeneous biological effects can be added to the classical effects on mineral bone metabolism. In the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism, an important role is also played by alterations of calcium transport, which is under the control of two receptors: VDR and CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). The expression of these receptors is reduced during CKD. Recent findings have allowed to identify a new hormonal system, the FGF23-Klotho axis, that integrates the old and simple, but now inadequate, PTH-Vit D axis. FGF23 is a circulating factor produced by osteocytes that inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity. As such, FGF23 is involved in phosphate homeostasis and its serum levels increase along with the progression of CKD. Interestingly, FGF23 has very low affinity for its receptor and requires the activity of Klotho, an anti-aging gene, to become active. These new actors allow us to identify a bone-kidney axis, whose real physiological importance is still under evaluation.


Integrative predictive model of coronary artery calcification in atherosclerosis.

A protein kinase network regulates the function of aminophospholipid flippases. Limited exposure of aminophospholipids on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells and is maintained by the action of inward-directed P-type ATPases ("flippases"). Yeast S. cerevisiae has five flippases (Dnf1, Dnf2, Dnf3, Drs2, and Neo1), but their regulation is poorly understood. Two paralogous plasma membrane-associated protein kinases, Pkh1 and Pkh2 (orthologs of mammalian PDK1), are required for viability of S. cerevisiae cells because they activate several essential downstream protein kinases by phosphorylating a critical Thr in their activation loops. Two such targets are related protein kinases Ypk1 and Ypk2 (orthologs of mammalian SGK1), which have been implicated in multiple processes, including endocytosis and coupling of membrane expansion to cell wall remodeling, but the downstream effector(s) of these kinases have been elusive. Here we show that a physiologically relevant substrate of Ypk1 is another protein kinase, Fpk1, a known flippase activator. We show that Ypk1 phosphorylates and thereby down-regulates Fpk1, and further that a complex sphingolipid counteracts the down-regulation of Fpk1 by Ypk1. Our findings delineate a unique regulatory mechanism for imposing a balance between sphingolipid content and aminophospholipid asymmetry in eukaryotic plasma membranes.

Transgenic expression of fern Pteris vittata glutaredoxin PvGrx5 in Arabidopsis thaliana increases plant tolerance to high temperature stress and reduces oxidative damage to proteins. A glutaredoxin of the fern Pteris vittata PvGRX5 was previously implicated in arsenic tolerance. Because of possible involvements of glutaredoxins in metabolic adaptations to high temperature stress, transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing PvGRX5 were evaluated for thermotolerance. Homozygous lines expressing PvGRX5 exhibited significantly greater tolerance to high temperature stress than the vector control and wild-type, based upon growth during stress and during recovery from stress, and this was related to leaf glutaredoxin specific activities. Measurements of tissue ion leakage, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein carbonyl content showed that PvGRX5-expressors were significantly (P < 0.05) less affected by the high temperature treatment compared to wild-type and vector control lines for damage to membranes and proteins. Immunoblots indicated that specific protein bands, carbonylated during the stress treatment in the control lines, were protected in PvGRX5-expressors, thus implicating PvGRX5 in heat tolerance, likely mediated through cellular protection against oxidative stress.


Pain prevalence in Singapore.

Heart block: a primary manifestation of sarcoidosis. We present the case of a 55-year-old male who presented with symptoms of dyspnoea and pre-syncope. A 12 lead electrocardiogram demonstrated extensive conduction abnormalities with 2:1 heart block, right bundle branch block and a small Q wave in lead V(1.) This indicated significant myocardial and septal involvement. Echocardiography confirmed the presence of right ventricular infiltration and dysfunction whilst cardiac magnetic resonance showed the infiltration to be nodular in nature. Although a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and lymphoma were initially considered, sarcoidosis was eventually confirmed following a cervical lymph node biopsy. This case firstly demonstrates the usefulness of the 12-lead electrocardiogram in determining the likely anatomical locality of significant bradyarrhythmias. Secondly it highlights the difficulties in diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis when cardiac dysfunction is the sole manifestation of the disease.

Central lower eyelid thinning with trichiasis: characterization and management of a unique subset of entropion in elderly patients. To characterize the clinical and pathologic features of central lower eyelid thinning with trichiasis and discuss the management of this unique subset of entropion in elderly patients. Retrospective study of patients with central lower eyelid thinning with trichiasis who presented between July 1996 and March 2006. Evaluation of management, including surgical intervention, using a modified Quickert "4-snip" block excision combined with lower eyelid retractor plication. Forty-one lower eyelids in 25 patients (22 men, 3 women; age range, 65-92 years; mean age, 79.6 +/- 6.6 years). All lower eyelids had medialization of the lateral eyelashes progressing posteriorly to frank trichiasis in the thinnest central zone. Seventeen patients (68%) had blepharitis. Twenty lower eyelids (48.8%) were refractory to initial treatment or presented with more severe disease and required incisional surgery; 16 of these were considered to have a successful postoperative outcome. Pathology reports from the specimens obtained frequently revealed the absence of meibomian glands, subconjunctival fibrosis, and tarsal scarring. Central lower eyelid thinning with trichiasis is a distinct subset of entropion in elderly patients. Its management differs from the usual treatment for entropion in this age group. Surgeons should be aware of this unique condition to optimize diagnosis and treatment.

In vivo investigation of thiomer-polyvinylpyrrolidon nanoparticles using magnetic resonance imaging. This study focused on the investigation of the permeation enhancing effects of a stomach targeted, nanoparticulate drug delivery system. The polyacrylic acid-cysteine/polyvinylpyrrolidon nanoparticles were loaded with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium(III)dihydrogen salt (Gd-DTPA). Average particle size was determined to be 130 nm and the optimum for stability was found to be below a pH of 4.5. In vitro permeation studies were performed on rat gastric mucosa and revealed an eightfold increase in Gd-DTPA uptake when incorporated in the nanoparticles compared to evaluation in the presence of unformulated polyacrylic acid-cysteine. In vivo investigations with rats were performed via the noninvasive MRI method in order to track the nanoparticles way through the gastrointestinal tract. When Gd-DTPA was administered orally as nanoparticulate suspension, an increased MRI signal in the urinary bladder was detected after 34 min, providing evidence for systemic uptake and renal elimination of the contrast agent. As control experiments with Gd-DTPA only or in combination with unformulated polyacrylic acid-cysteine revealed no MRI signal increase at all, the significant permeation enhancing effect could be identified based on the nanoparticulate formulation.

[Survey about the perception of the gastroenteritis and the infection due to rotavirus by the mothers in France]. To describe the perception of the acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and the interest for the vaccination of the AGE due to Rotavirus. Observational investigation realized by phone by the IPSOS institute, with 1002 French women of 18 years and more, constituting a representative national sample, having at least a child below 2 years, between 7 and January 31st, 2008. AGE is mainly considered by the mothers questioned as a grave pathology (43.1%) or very grave (51.3%) for the children below 2 years. This perception is bound to the symptoms and to the complications known for the disease. For the questioned mothers, the AGE comes along very often or often with diarrheas (97.2%), vomits (94.3%) or dehydration (94%). Hospitalizations are also perceived as frequent. The quasi-totality of the questioned women (98.3%) considers finally that it is about a very contagious disease (75.4%) or rather contagious (22.8%). The AGE at the child below 2 years provoke very frequently a medical consultation (91.8%), during which some solutions of oral rehydration are prescribed in six cases on 10 (62%). The questioned mothers are for the greater part favorable (86.3%) to a drinkable vaccine to prevent the AGE due to Rotavirus, and 88.1% say that they would intend to protect their child with this vaccine. The questioned mothers know the potential gravity of the AGE and a very wide majority of them (86.3%) declare themselves favorable to the prevention of the AGE at Rotavirus by the vaccination.


Atlas-based vs. individual-based deterministic tractography of corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis.

Relation between NIRS signal and motor capability. Brain activities of three subjects performing a right-hand tapping task were measured by near-infrared spec-troscopy (NIRS). In experiments, the hemoglobin concentration change in the subjects' brains while they learned a new movement was analyzed. The results of these tests show that the channels covering the left primary motor cortex recorded a decreasing tendency in oxyHb when the subjects were repeating the tapping task. In contrast, the channels covering the supplementary motor cortex recorded an increasing tendency of oxyHb. These results suggest that the functional load on the brain decreases and the brain's active domain changes during motor learning.

Comparison of serum iohexol clearance and plasma creatinine clearance in clinically normal horses. Objective-To determine whether a limited sampling time method based on serum iohexol clearance (Cl(iohexol)) would yield estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in clinically normal horses similar to those for plasma creatinine clearance (Cl(creatinine)). Animals-10 clinically normal adult horses. Procedures-A bolus of iohexol (150 mg/kg) was administered IV, and serum samples were obtained 5, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after injection. Urinary clearance of exogenous creatinine was measured during three 20-minute periods. The GFR determined by use of serum Cl(iohexol) and plasma Cl(creatinine) was compared with limits of agreement plots. Results-Values obtained for plasma Cl(creatinine) ranged from 1.68 to 2.69 mL/min/kg (mean, 2.11 mL/min/kg). Mean serum Cl(iohexol) was 2.38 mL/min/kg (range, 1.95 to 3.33 mL/min/kg). Limits of agreement plots indicated good agreement between the methods. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Use of serum Cl(iohexol) yielded estimates of GFR in clinically normal adult horses similar to those for plasma Cl(creatinine). This study was the first step in the evaluation of the use of serum Cl(iohexol) for estimating GFR in adult horses.

Characterization of tailor-made copolymers of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate as nonviral gene transfer agents: influence of macromolecular structure on gene vector particle properties and transfection efficiency. Oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates (OEGMA) of various chain lengths (i.e., 9, 23, or 45 EG units) and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) were copolymerized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), yielding well-defined P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers with increasing OEGMA molar fractions (F(OEGMA)) but a comparable degree of polymerization (DP approximately 120). Increase of both F(OEGMA) and OEGMA chain lengths correlated inversely with gene vector size, morphology, and zeta potential. P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers prevented gene vector aggregation at high plasmid DNA (pDNA) concentrations in isotonic solution and did not induce cytotoxicity even at high concentrations. Transfection efficiency of the most efficient P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers was found to be >10-fold lower compared with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) 25 kDa. Although OEGMA copolymerization largely reduced gene vector binding with the cell surface, cellular internalization of the bound complexes was less affected. These observations suggest that inefficient endolysosomal escape limits transfection efficiency of P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymer gene vectors. Despite this observation, optimized p(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) gene vectors remained stable under conditions for in vivo application leading to 7-fold greater gene expression in the lungs compared with PEI. Tailor-made P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers are promising nonviral gene transfer agents that fulfill the requirements for successful in vivo gene delivery.

Role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidoreductases Bdh1p and Ara1p in the metabolism of acetoin and 2,3-butanediol. NAD-dependent butanediol dehydrogenase (Bdh1p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reversibly transforms acetoin to 2,3-butanediol in a stereospecific manner. Deletion of BDH1 resulted in an accumulation of acetoin and a diminution of 2,3-butanediol in two S. cerevisiae strains under two different growth conditions. The concentrations of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol are mostly dependent on Bdh1p activity, while those of (meso)-2,3-butanediol are also influenced by the activity of NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductases. One of them has been purified and shown to be d-arabinose dehydrogenase (Ara1p), which converts (R/S)-acetoin to meso-2,3-butanediol and (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol. Deletion of BDH2, a gene adjacent to BDH1, whose encoded protein is 51% identical to Bdh1p, does not significantly alter the levels of acetoin or 2,3-butanediol in comparison to the wild-type strain. Furthermore, we have expressed Bdh2p with a histidine tag and have shown it to be inactive toward 2,3-butanediol. A whole-genome expression analysis with microarrays demonstrates that BDH1 and BDH2 are reciprocally regulated.

Extraction of high quality RNA from polysaccharide matrices using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Polysaccharides are increasingly being used as biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Quantitative analysis of gene expression from cells in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds requires extraction of messenger RNA, which is complicated in polysaccharide materials by ionic complexing between nucleic acids and the matrix. We used a strongly cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), to extract RNA from human mesenchymal stem cells embedded in 3D chitosan, agarose and collagen matrices. CTAB extraction was compared to conventional guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods for RNA isolation by assessing RNA yield, purity (A260/A280 and A260/A230) and integrity (28S/18S and RIN). For polysaccharide-based matrices, CTAB extraction yielded significantly more RNA with higher purity than guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods alone. The extracted RNA was largely intact as indicated by 28S/18S ratios and RIN values, while these parameters could not be measured using conventional kits alone. For pure collagen matrices, the CTAB method was comparable or better than guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods in terms of RNA yield and quality. We further validated the CTAB protocol using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR to amplify both large and small amplicons. Our results show that the CTAB-based method is a facile and effective way to extract abundant, high quality RNA from polysaccharide and protein biomaterials.

Genital involvement in pemphigus vulgaris (PV): correlation with clinical and cervicovaginal Pap smear findings. The frequency of genital involvement in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) has not been clearly defined. We sought to evaluate the frequency of cervical, vaginal, and vulvar involvement in PV and to determine their association with genital symptoms, clinical involvement, and cytological status. The current study's sample included 34 female patients with PV. Gynecologic and ear, nose, and throat examinations and indirect immunofluorescence analyses were performed, and Pap smears were collected. Genital involvement was observed in 44.1% of patients. It was significantly associated with disease severity and clinical involvement. Pharyngeal involvement was observed in 61.8% of patients and was the second-most frequently involved mucosal region. Genital involvement was significantly associated with nasal mucosa involvement. Cervicovaginal Pap smears showed acantholytic cells of PV in 35.3% of patients. The sample size is small. Genital involvement in PV is not rare. Genital mucosa is the most affected mucosal region after oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Furthermore, genital involvement is significantly associated with nasal involvement and genital symptoms. The need for complete gynecologic evaluations of patients with PV, nasal involvement, and genital symptoms is emphasized.

Exposure to manufactured nanoparticles in different workplaces. In potential nano-objects can be released into the workplace air during production, during the handling of nanopowders and during the treatment of end-products that contain manufactured nanomaterials. Experimental studies that could mimic the exposure processes revealed the formation of larger agglomerates after release. Studies conducted in workplaces confirmed this assumption, however, the data are still very scarce and not easily to compare due to differences in the format of reporting the data. Number-, mass-, and surface area concentrations are reported, however, currently an estimate of the potential for worker exposure is not possible. It is recommended that future workplace exposure studies will be conducted according to a more harmonized approach for analyzing and reporting of the results.

[Clinical characteristics and survival in the operable breast cancer patients with different molecular subtypes]. According to the immunohistochemical (IHC) test of ER, PR and HER-2, breast cancer can be divided into 4 different molecular subtypes: Luminal A subtype (ER or PR positive and HER-2 negative), Luminal B subtype (ER or PR positive and HER-2 positive), HER-2 subtype (ER and PR negative, HER-2 positive) and Basal-like subtype (ER, PR and HER-2 negative). This study was to analyze the clinical features of different breast cancer subtypes, and try to find the evidence of combined and individualized treatment for patients with breast cancer. The data of 408 surgically treated breast cancer patients in the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological features and recurrence, metastasis as well as survival of these four subtypes were compared. Of the 408 cases, Luminal A subtype accounted for 60.8% (248/408), Luminal B subtype 7.8% (32/408), HER-2 subtype 12.5% (51/408), and Basal-like subtype 18.9% (77/408). Basal-like subtype had less lymph node metastases than other subtypes (P<0.05). HER-2 subtypes consisted of less patients aged 45 years or younger than other subtypes (P<0.05). Luminal B subtype contained less advanced cases than other subtypes (P<0.01). By August 2008, the median time of follow-up was 64 months (range, 3-79 months). Fifty-eight cases presented local recurrence or metastasis, and 51 of them died of the disease. The 5-year overall survival rates (OS) for patients with Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like and HER-2 subtype were 89.83%, 86.15%, 79.85% and 86.70% , respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the four subtypes were 83.52%, 68.88%, 71.66% and 75.83%, respectively. The rate of local recurrence or metastasis in Luminal A subtype was significantly lower than that in Luminal B and Basal-like subtypes (P<0.05). The DFS time in Luminal B subtype was shorter than that in Luminal A subtype (P=0.0481). The OS and DFS time in Basal-like subtype were all shorter than that in Luminal A subtype (P=0.0077 and P=0.0306, respectively). The distribution of each subtype in Chinese breast cancer patients is similar to that in European and American breast cancer patients. Luminal A is the most common subtype in Chinese breast cancer patients, and has a good prognosis. While Basal-like and Luminal B subtype have a poor prognosis.


New emerging potentials for human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells: immunological features and hepatocyte-like differentiative capacity.

Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin, alpha-oligoglucosyl quercetin 3-O-glucoside, is absorbed more easily than other quercetin glycosides or aglycone after oral administration in rats. Quercetin, a flavonol contained in various vegetables and herbal medicines, has various biological activities including anti-cancer, anti-allergic and anti-oxidative activities. However, low oral bioavailability of quercetin due to insolubility in water has limited its use as a food additive or dietary supplement. Since the water solubility is enhanced by glycosyl conjugation, in the present study, we evaluated the bioavailability of several quercetin glycosides with different sugar moieties in rats. Quercetin, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), and quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercitrin, IQC) in suspension, and quercetin-3-O-maltoside (Q3M), quercetin-3-O-gentiobioside (Q3G), alpha-monoglucosyl rutin (alphaMR), alpha-oligoglucosyl rutin (alphaOR), and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (alpha-oligoglucosyl isoquercitrin, EMIQ) dissolved in water, were orally administered to rats under anesthesia. Bioavailability (F value) was calculated from the concentrations of total quercetin in plasma from 0 to 12 h after the administration. F value of quercetin was 2.0%, and those of IQC, Q3M and EMIQ were 12%, 30%, and 35%, respectively. Although Q3G, alphaMR and alphaOR have high water solubility, their F values were low (3.0%, 4.1%, 1.8%, respectively). In the in vitro study, the homogenate of rat intestinal epithelium rapidly hydrolyzed IQC, Q3M and EMIQ to quercetin, and alphaMR and alphaOR to rutin. However, it could not hydrolyze Q3G or rutin to quercetin. Elongation of alpha-linkage of glucose moiety in IQC enhances the bioavailability of quercetin, and intestinal epithelial enzymes such as lactase-phrolizin hydrolase or mucosal maltase-glucoamylase would play important roles in the hydrolysis and absorption of these flavonol glycosides.

Sensorimotor factors affecting gait variability in older people--a population-based study. Intra-individual gait variability predicts falls and disability in older people. Knowledge of factors that contribute to gait variability may lead to interventions aimed at reducing decline in mobility and falls risk. The aim of this population-based study was to examine whether poorer performance on a range of sensorimotor measures was associated with greater gait variability. Individuals aged 60-86 years (n = 412) were randomly selected from the Southern Tasmanian electoral roll. Spatial (step length and step width) and temporal (step time and double support time [DST]) gait measures were recorded with a GAITRite walkway. Variability for each gait measure was the standard deviation of measurements recorded during six walks. Sensorimotor measures included visual contrast sensitivity, lower limb proprioception, quadriceps strength, reaction time, and body sway (eyes open and closed). Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between sensorimotor measures and gait variability. Greater sway on a foam mat (eyes closed) was associated with greater variability in all gait measures (p < .05). Slower reaction time was associated with greater variability in both temporal gait measures (p < .05), whereas poorer proprioception was only associated with greater DST variability (p = .01) and weaker quadriceps strength with greater step time variability. Other sensorimotor factors were not independently associated with gait variability. Body sway, reaction time, quadriceps strength, and proprioception are likely factors that may explain gait variability in the general older population. Further research is warranted to determine causality of these associations and whether intervention programs addressing these factors may reduce gait variability in older people.

Identification of an endogenous retroviral envelope gene with fusogenic activity and placenta-specific expression in the rabbit: a new "syncytin" in a third order of mammals. Syncytins are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been co-opted by the host to mediate a specialized function in placentation. Two of these genes have already been identified in primates, as well as two distinct, non orthologous genes in rodents. Here we identified within the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus-which belongs to the lagomorpha order- an envelope (env) gene of retroviral origin with the characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin, that we named syncytin-Ory1. An in silico search for full-length env genes with an uninterrupted open reading frame within the rabbit genome first identified two candidate genes that were tested for their specific expression in the placenta by quantitative RT-PCR of RNA isolated from a large set of tissues. This resulted in the identification of an env gene with placenta-specific expression and belonging to a family of endogenous retroelements present at a limited copy number in the rabbit genome. Functional characterization of the identified placenta-expressed env gene after cloning in a CMV-driven expression vector and transient transfection experiments, demonstrated both fusogenic activity in an ex vivo cell-cell fusion assay and infectivity of pseudotypes. The receptor for the rabbit syncytin-Ory1 was found to be the same as that for human syncytin-1, i.e. the previously identified ASCT2 transporter. This was demonstrated by a co-culture fusion assay between hamster A23 cells transduced with an expression vector for ASCT2 and A23 cells transduced with syncytin-Ory1. Finally, in situ hybridization of rabbit placenta sections with a syncytin-Ory1 probe revealed specific expression at the level of the junctional zone between the placental lobe and the maternal decidua, where the invading syncytial fetal tissue contacts the maternal decidua to form the labyrinth, consistent with a role in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytin-Ory1 gene is found in Leporidae but not in Ochotonidae, and should therefore have entered the lagomorpha order 12-30 million years ago. The identification of a novel syncytin gene within a third order of mammals displaying syncytiotrophoblast formation during placentation strongly supports the notion that on several occasions retroviral infections have resulted in the independent capture of genes that have been positively selected for a convergent physiological role.

[Prevalence and clinical features of human metapneumovirus infection in hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory tract infection in Suzhou area]. To determine whether human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was circulating in Suzhou area and the epidemiology and clinical features associated with hMPV infection. Samples were collected from January 2006 to December 2007; respiratory specimens were tested for the presence of hMPV by reverse-transcription polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR). PCR products of hMPV N gene from some patients were randomly selected for sequencing analysis, and the sequences of the nucleotides and deduced amino acids were compared with those in the GenBank. Of the 4702 patients screened, 8% had evidence of hMPV infection. The positive rate in 2006 and 2007 was 8.4% and 7.6%, respectively. The positive rates detected during January to March, November and December were higher. The median age of patients was 22. 56 months. The infected children were diagnosed as having upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), laryngitis (2.1%), bronchiolitis (27.1%), pneumonia (55.9%), and asthma exacerbation (11.7%). Sequence analysis of these hMPV N genes showed 99%-100% homology with the registered sequence in GenBank. (1) hMPV accounted for a significant proportion of respiratory tract infection in infants and children. (2) hMPV prevailed predominantly in the winter and spring time. (3) Clinically, hMPV infection can not be discriminated from the infection with other respiratory tract viruses.


[Study on the extraction of total flavonoids from Mentha spicata by ultrasonic method].

Discovery of halo-nitrobenzamides with potential application against human African trypanosomiasis. A series of halo-nitrobenzamide were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to block proliferation of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. A number of these compounds had significant activity against the parasite, particularly 2-chloro-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-nitrobenzamide 17 which exhibited low micromolar inhibitory potency against T. brucei and selectivity towards both malaria and mammalian cells.

Repeat Courses of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Deferring Whole-Brain Irradiation, for New Brain Metastases After Initial SRS. To report the outcomes of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), deferring whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), for distant intracranial recurrences and identify factors associated with prolonged overall survival (OS). We retrospectively identified 652 metastases in 95 patients treated with 2 or more courses of SRS for brain metastases, deferring WBRT. Cox regression analyzed factors predictive for OS. Patients had a median of 2 metastases (range, 1-14) treated per course, with a median of 2 courses (range, 2-14) of SRS per patient. With a median follow-up after first SRS of 15 months (range, 3-98 months), the median OS from the time of the first and second course of SRS was 18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15-24) and 11 months (95% CI 6-17), respectively. On multivariate analysis, histology, graded prognostic assessment score, aggregate tumor volume (but not number of metastases), and performance status correlated with OS. The 1-year cumulative incidence, with death as a competing risk, of local failure was 5% (95% CI 4-8%). Eighteen (24%) of 75 deaths were from neurologic causes. Nineteen patients (20%) eventually received WBRT. Adverse radiation events developed in 2% of SRS sites. Multiple courses of SRS, deferring WBRT, for distant brain metastases after initial SRS, seem to be a safe and effective approach. The graded prognostic assessment score, updated at each course, and aggregate tumor volume may help select patients in whom the deferral of WBRT might be most beneficial.

Effects of excess corticosterone on LKB1 and AMPK signaling in rat skeletal muscle. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by marked central obesity and insulin insensitivity, effects opposite those seen with chronic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This study was designed to determine whether chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids influences LKB1/AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle. Corticosterone pellets were implanted subcutaneously in rats (hypercorticosteronemia, Hypercort) for 2 wk. Controls were sham operated and fed ad libitum or were sham operated and food restricted (pair-weighted group, Pair) to produce body weights similar to Hypercort rats. At the end of the 2-wk treatment period, rats were anesthetized, and the right gastrocnemius-plantaris (gastroc) and soleus muscles were removed. Left muscles were removed after electrical stimulation for 5 min. No significant differences were noted between treatment groups in ATP, creatine phosphate, or LKB1 activity. The alpha- and beta-subunit isoforms were not significantly influenced in gastroc by corticosterone treatment. Expression of the gamma3-subunit decreased, and gamma1- and gamma2-subunit expression increased. Both alpha2-AMPK and alpha1-AMPK activities were increased in the gastroc in response to electrical stimulation, but the magnitude of the increase was less for alpha2 in the Hypercort rats. Despite elevated plasma insulin and elevated plasma leptin in the Hypercort rats, phosphorylation of TBC1D1 was lower in both resting and stimulated muscle compared with controls. Malonyl-CoA content was elevated in gastroc muscles of resting Hypercort rats. These changes in response to excess glucocorticoids could be responsible, in part, for the decrease in insulin sensitivity and adiposity seen in Cushing's syndrome.

Cellular response and activation of apoptosis by mithramycin SK in p21(WAF1)-deficient HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells. HCT116 (p21(-/-)) human colon carcinoma cells treated with mithramycin SK (MSK), a novel analog of the antitumor antibiotic mithramycin A (MTA), were transiently arrested in G2/M, with some cells entering a faulty mitotic cycle without cytokinesis that resulted in G1-like cell arrest, which consisted of post-mitotic aneuploid G1 cells. Some of these cells synthesized DNA and elicited an apoptotic response. The absence of p21(WAF1) made HCT116 cells more sensitive to MSK than to the related MTA. MSK also showed higher antiproliferative activity than MTA on HCT116 cells with different genetic backgrounds, including those lacking the p53 gene. Apoptosis in MSK-treated p21(-/-) cells involved caspase 2 rather than caspase 3. Untreated HCT116 (p21(-/-)) cells presented a little caspase 3 activity, which increased slightly after treatment with MSK. The apoptotic response in p21(-/-) cells comprised caspase 2 acting as an executor caspase together with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that may be initiated by caspase 2. In contrast, caspase 3 was activated in wild-type HCT116 after treatment with MSK.


Self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels in older African-American adults.

Morphology engineering of Aspergillus niger for improved enzyme production. Supplementation with silicate microparticles was used as novel approach to control the morphological development of Aspergillus niger, important as the major world source of citric acid and higher-value enzymes, in submerged culture. With careful variation of size and concentration of the micromaterial added, a number of distinct morphological forms including pellets of different size, free dispersed mycelium, and short hyphae fragments could be reproducibly created. Aluminum oxide particles similarly affected morphology, showing that this effect is largely independent of the chemical particle composition. Image analysis of morphological development of A. niger during the cultivation process showed that the microparticles influence the morphology by collision-induced disruption of conidia aggregates and probably also the hindrance of new spore-spore interactions in the very early stage of the process. Exemplified for different recombinant A. niger strains enzyme production could be strongly enhanced by the addition of microparticles. Linked to the formation of freely dispersed mycelium, titers for glucoamylase (GA) expressed as intracellular enzyme (88 U/mL) and fructofuranosidase secreted into the supernatant (77 U/mL), were up to fourfold higher in shake flasks. Moreover, accumulation of the undesired by-product oxalate was suppressed by up to 90%. The microparticle strategy could be successfully transferred to fructofuranosidase production in bioreactor, where a final titer of 160 U/mL could be reached. Using co-expression of GA with green fluorescent protein, enzyme production was localized in the cellular aggregates of A. niger. For pelleted growth, protein production was maximal only within a thin layer at the pellet surface and markedly decreased in the pellet interior, whereas the interaction with the microparticles created a highly active biocatalyst with the dominant fraction of cells contributing to production.

Lumbar spinal stenosis: prognostic factors for bilateral microsurgical decompression using a unilateral approach. We describe a prospective cohort study that investigated the effectiveness of microsurgical bilateral decompression using unilateral laminotomy for lumbar spinal stenosis and assessed the factors influencing the outcome. A total of 165 consecutive patients underwent decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis. They were divided into 3 age groups: A (<65 years), B (65-75 years), and C (>75 years). Further classification was performed according to body mass index (BMI): BMI 1 (<26), BMI 2 (26-30), and BMI 3 (>30), anesthesiological risk factors (American Society of Anesthesiologists), and the number of levels decompressed. The outcome was monitored by an independent observer at 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. The following parameters were evaluated: pain (visual analog scale and analgesic consumption), functional improvement (Neurogenic Claudication Outcome Score), and walking performance, defined as walking distance x speed (treadmill). One week after surgery, pain decreased in 85.9% of patients, and a comparison of the pre- and postoperative use of analgesics showed that 38% of nonopioid use and 74% of opioid use were discontinued, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption increased 13%. One year after surgery, pain remained decreased in 83.9% of patients, Neurogenic Claudication Outcome Score increased in 90.3% of patients, and walking performance improved in 92.2% of patients. BMI greater than 30 was the only negative prognostic factor for pain reduction (P = 0.012) and Neurogenic Claudication Outcome Score improvement (P = 0.019). Surprisingly, patients who underwent multilevel decompression benefitted more from surgery than those who underwent single-level decompression. Microsurgical bilateral decompression using unilateral laminotomy is an effective surgical option for lumbar spinal stenosis, even in high-risk patients with multilevel stenosis.

[Role of the activation of interleukin-6/STAT3 in cholangiocyte proliferation induced by cold ischemia reperfusion and injury].

A diagnostic approach for identifying anti-neuronal antibodies in children with suspected autoimmune encephalitis. We assessed the validity of immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to detect anti-neuronal antibodies in an attempt to establish a diagnostic approach for pediatric autoimmune encephalitis. Both IHC and ICC had higher sensitivity than immunoblotting and could differentiate between antibodies directed towards intracellular and cell surface antigens. There was a significant correlation between the IHC and ICC results. When patients were divided into encephalitis and non-encephalitis groups, there was no difference in the positivity rate and staining pattern of IHC and ICC between them. In conclusion, IHC and ICC are useful methods to screen for anti-neuronal antibodies. A combination of IHC, ICC, and specific cell-based assays is expected to be an efficient approach for the diagnosis of autoantibody-mediated encephalitis.

Correlation of bacterial colonization status between mother and child: the Generation R Study. Determinants of bacterial colonization in children have been described. In the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort study, we determined whether the colonization statuses of mothers and children are correlated. Such a correlation was observed for Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Direct transmission, genetic susceptibility and/or unidentified environmental factors may play a role here.


Peroneal tendon subluxation: the other lateral ankle injury.

Ion selective electrode for cesium based on 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene. A polyvinylchloride (PVC) based liquid membrane ion selective electrode (ISE) for cesium was fabricated with 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene as ionophore. Different membrane constituents were investigated to realise optimum performance of the ISE developed. Of the four plasticizers and two ion additives studied, the best response was observed with membrane having 2-nitro phenyl octyl ether (oNPOE) as plasticizer and potassium tetrakis (perchloro phenyl) borate (KTpClPB) as ion additive. Linear response over concentration range of 10(-5)-10(-1)M CsCl was obtained. The Nernstian slope of the response was 56 mV per decade for Cs with a response time less than 20s. Matched potential method has been applied to find out the selectivity for Cs over several ions like Rb(+), K(+), Na(+), NH(4)(+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Ce(3+). The response of ISE for Cs(+) was fairly constant over the pH range of 3-11. The lifetime of the electrode is 9 months which is the longest life for any membrane-based Cs-ISE so far developed. The concentration of cesium in two simulated high level active waste streams was determined and results agreed well with those obtained independently employing atomic absorption spectrometry.

Effect of homocysteinylation on high density lipoprotein physico-chemical properties. High density lipoproteins (HDL) exert a protective effect against homocysteinylation due to the activity of the enzyme paraoxonase/thiolactonase associated to the lipoprotein surface. However, a small amount of N-homocysteinylated HDL (N-Hcy-HDL) is present in human plasma, suggesting that homocysteinylation of plasma lipoproteins occurs in vivo. Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of homocysteinylation on apoprotein structure and physico-chemical properties of HDL using the analysis of the fluorescent emission spectra of tryptophan and Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene). Our results demonstrated that the increase in -SH groups in HDL homocysteinylated in vitro (Hcy-HDL) was associated with apoprotein conformational changes and modifications of physico-chemical properties. A significant decrease of paraoxonase and lactonase activity of HDL bound PON1 has also been observed in Hcy-HDL. A significant decrease of the enzyme activity has been observed also in purified PON1 homocysteinylated following the same experimental conditions used for HDL. Moreover, we demonstrated that oxidized HDL were more susceptible to homocysteinylation with respect to control HDL. The modifications of apoprotein conformation and physico-chemical properties in Hcy-HDL and the decrease of paraoxonase-1 activity could affect the protective effect of HDL against oxidative damage and/or homocysteinylation and could contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in patients affected by diseases associated with oxidative damage, in renal disorders and in patients affected by genetic or nutritional disorders of homocysteine or folate metabolism.

Marked elevations in pro-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites in females with irritable bowel syndrome.

Orthogonal basis expansion based atrial activity reconstruction for atrial fibrillation electrocardiogram analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for extracting atrial activity from single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal sustained with atrial fibrillation (AF), based on a short-time expansion of an orthogonal basis function set. The method preserves the time variation of spectral content of the underlying AF signal, thus time-frequency analysis of the AF signal can be successfully performed. The new method is compared to the standard average beat subtraction (ABS) method using synthetic AF sustained ECG data. The orthogonal basis expansion method has a higher correlation with the original AF signal compared to the ABS method for a range of signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels, and correlation is improved by 16% at an SNR of 0dB. Time-frequency analysis of the reconstructed AF signal based on Bessel distribution also shows the superiority of the orthogonal basis expansion method over ABS.

Reproductive factors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk in the California Teachers Study. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a malignancy etiologically linked to immunomodulatory exposures and disorders. Endogenous female sex hormones may modify immune function and influence NHL risk. Few studies have examined associations between reproductive factors, which can serve as surrogates for such hormonal exposures, and NHL risk by subtype. Women in the California Teachers Study cohort provided detailed data in 1995-1996 on reproductive history. Follow-up through 2007 identified 574 women with incident B-cell NHL. Hazard rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between reproductive factors and all B-cell NHL combined, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias/small lymphocytic lymphomas. Pregnancy was marginally associated with lower risk of B-cell NHL (RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.68-1.04). Much of the reduction in risk was observed after one full-term pregnancy relative to nulligravid women (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.54-1.06; P for trend <0.01), particularly for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P for trend = 0.13), but not among women who had only incomplete pregnancies. Age at first full-term pregnancy was marginally inversely associated with B-cell NHL risk overall (P for trend = 0.08) and for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P for trend = 0.056). Breast feeding was not associated with B-cell NHL risk overall or by subtype. Full-term pregnancy and early age at first full-term pregnancy account for most of the observed reduction in B-cell NHL risk associated with gravidity. Pregnancy-related hormonal exposures, including prolonged and high-level exposure to progesterone during a full-term pregnancy may inhibit development of B-cell NHL.

Joystick control for powered mobility: current state of technology and future directions. Recent advancements in control interface technology have made the use of end devices such as power wheelchairs easier for individuals with disabilities, especially persons with movement disorders. In this article, we discuss the current state of control interface technology and the devices available clinically for power wheelchair control. We also discuss our research on novel hardware and software approaches that are revolutionizing joystick interface technology and allowing more customizability for individual users with special needs and abilities. Finally, we discuss the future of control interfaces and what research gaps remain.

Defining the optimal therapy sequence in synchronous resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a decision analysis approach. Approximately 5%-20% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients present with synchronous potentially resectable liver metastatic disease. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest a benefit of the 'liver first' approach, i.e. resection of the liver metastasis followed by resection of the primary tumour. A formal decision analysis may support a rational choice between several therapy options. Survival and morbidity data were retrieved from relevant clinical studies identified by a Web of Science search. Data were entered into decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro 2009, Williamstown, MA, USA). Transition probabilities including the risk of death from complications or disease progression associated with individual therapy options were entered into the model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the model's validity under a variety of assumptions. The result of the decision analysis confirms the superiority of the 'liver first' approach. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this assumption is valid on condition that the mortality associated with the hepatectomy first is < 4.5%, and that the mortality of colectomy performed after hepatectomy is < 3.2%. The results of this decision analysis suggest that, in patients with synchronous resectable colorectal liver metastases, the 'liver first' approach is to be preferred. Randomized trials will be needed to confirm the results of this simulation based outcome.

Thermo-mechanical characterization of polypyrrole compliance using stochastic system identification. Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole are studied as novel biologically inspired actuators. Their capacity to generate stresses of up to 5 MPa, strains of up to 10% at low voltages (2 V) make them ideal candidates to be used as artificial muscle materials. It has been shown that the modulus of polypyrrole can change when the material is electrochemically excited. In this paper we develop a technique that uses a stochastic stress input that can be used to measure the compliance frequency response (between 10(-2) Hz and 100 Hz) of polypyrrole in-situ. We validate the compliance calculated from the stochastic stress input by comparing it with the compliance calculated from a single sinusoidal stress input. We also measure the compliance as a function of temperature using both techniques and show that the stochastic compliance follows the same trends as the compliance calculated from single sinusoidal stress input.

Neoplastic and non-neoplastic complications of solid organ transplantation in patients with preexisting monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) occurs in 3-7% of the elderly population, with higher prevalence in renal failure patients, and is associated with a 25-fold increased lifetime risk for plasma cell myeloma (PCM), also known as multiple myeloma. Using the California State Inpatient, Emergency Department, and Ambulatory Surgery Databases components of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), we sought to determine whether patients with MGUS who undergo solid organ allograft (n = 22,062) are at increased adjusted relative risk (aRR) for hematologic malignancy and other complications. Among solid organ transplant patients, patients with preexisting MGUS had higher aRR of PCM (aRR 19.46; 95% CI 7.05, 53.73; p < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (aRR 1.66; 95% CI 1.15, 2.41; p = 0.007), and infection (aRR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06, 1.45; p = 0.007). However, when comparing MGUS patients with and without solid organ transplant, there was decreased aRR for PCM with transplant (aRR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13, 0.88; p = 0.027), and increased venous thromboembolic events (aRR 2.33; 95% CI 1.58, 3.44; p < 0.001) and infectious risks (aRR 1.44; 95% CI 1.23, 1.70; p < 0.001). While MGUS increased the risk of PCM overall following solid organ transplantation, there was lower risk of PCM development compared to MGUS patients who did not receive a transplant. MGUS should not preclude solid organ transplant.

Clonally transmissible cancers in dogs and Tasmanian devils. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) and canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) are the only known naturally occurring clonally transmissible cancers. These cancers are transmitted by the physical transfer of viable tumor cells that can be transplanted across histocompatibility barriers into unrelated hosts. Despite their common etiology, DFTD and CTVT have evolved independently and have unique life histories and host adaptations. DFTD is a recently emerged aggressive facial tumor that is threatening the Tasmanian devil with extinction. CTVT is a sexually transmitted tumor of dogs that has a worldwide distribution and that probably arose thousands of years ago. By contrasting the biology, molecular genetics and immunology of these two unusual cancers, I highlight the common and unique features of clonally transmissible cancers, and discuss the implications of clonally transmissible cancers for host-pathogen evolution.

A novel motif in fungal class 1 histone deacetylases is essential for growth and development of Aspergillus. Acetylation of the N-terminal tails of core histones is an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic organisms. In filamentous fungi, little is known about the enzymes that modify histone tails. However, it is increasingly evident that histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases are critical factors for the regulation of genes involved in fungal pathogenicity, stress response, and production of secondary metabolites such as antibiotics or fungal toxins. Here, we show that depletion of RpdA, an RPD3-type histone deacetylase of Aspergillus nidulans, leads to a pronounced reduction of growth and sporulation of the fungus. We demonstrate that a so far unnoticed motif in the C terminus of fungal RpdA histone deacetylases is required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme and consequently is essential for the viability of A. nidulans. Moreover, we provide evidence that this motif is also crucial for the survival of other, if not all, filamentous fungi, including pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus or Cochliobolus carbonum. Thus, the extended C terminus of RpdA-type enzymes represents a promising target for fungal-specific histone deacetylase-inhibitors that may have potential as novel antifungal compounds with medical and agricultural applications.


How bacteria maintain location and number of flagella?


Keap1 regulates inflammatory signaling in Mycobacterium avium-infected human macrophages.

Expression profile of Notch-1 in mechanically overloaded plantaris muscle of mice. We investigated the expression pattern of Notch-1 in normal and hypertrophied plantaris muscle of mice. We performed immunofluorescence of both Notch-1 and the Notch-1-linking molecules. Immunofluorescence labeling revealed Notch-1 protein in Pax7-positive satellite cells during days 2-6. We observed clear co-localization between Notch-1 and myogenin (4.9+/-1.3%) in the hypertrophied muscle at 4days. Several mononuclei (possibly satellite cells) possessed both Notch-1 and Foxo1 in the plantaris muscle subjected to mechanical overloading (4.1+/-1.2%). Notch-1 may play an important role in the maintenance of quiescent satellite cells.

Cancer research: from folate antagonism to molecular targets. The antifolates aminopterin and methotrexate have two firsts in the treatment of malignancy. Aminopterin was the first drug reported to cause remissions in children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and methotrexate (MTX), the antifolate that has supplemented aminopterin in the clinic, was the first drug that was shown to be curative for patients with a solid tumour, choriocarcinoma. More than 50 years after its introduction in the clinic, MTX is still being used and studied. The role of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the principal target of aminopterin, has been studied extensively, and DHFR gene amplification and mutations have been implicated in drug resistance. Recent research focusses on studies of the translational regulation of DHFR and transfer of mutant DHFR and other drug resistance genes by viral vectors to protect haematopoietic cells. Based upon the detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of antifolates, both as inhibitors of DHFR and thymidylate syntase (TS), new agents have been developed that show effectiveness in the treatment of human malignancies. MTX remains a potent and widely used agent.

Childhood adversities and quality of sleep in adulthood: A population-based study of 26,000 Finns. To find out if childhood adversities predict poor sleep quality in working age. Survey data from the Health and Social Support (HeSSup) study was used (N=25,605, 59% women). Negative childhood adversities and quality of sleep in adulthood were assessed by the questionnaire in 1998. Multinomial regression models were used. A graded association between childhood adversities and the quality of sleep in adulthood was found. Odds ratio (OR) of poor quality of sleep for those with multiple childhood adversities (3-6) was 3.64 (95% CI 2.94-4.50). The association between childhood adversities and the quality of sleep remained significant after adjustments for work status, use of psychotropic drugs, health behaviours, recent life events and child-parent relationships. Poor quality of sleep was clearly increased among those with both poor child-mother (OR 10.4, 95% CI 6.73-16.07) or poor child-father (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.89-7.50) relationships and multiple childhood adversities. In the analyses of specific childhood adversities, frequent fear of a family member and serious conflicts in the family showed the strongest associations. The strong association between childhood adversities and the quality of sleep in adulthood highlights the importance of early life circumstances on adult health. Early stage recognition, prevention and supportive measures against childhood adversities and serious family conflicts should be promoted.


Computer tomography aided 3D analysis of the distal dorsal radius surface and the effects on volar plate osteosynthesis.

Autophagy: links with the proteasome. The two main protein degradation systems of eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, have been thought of as quite separate systems. However, recent findings strongly suggest that there is crosstalk and even cooperation between these two degradation pathways. Ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been investigated for some time, but much less is known about autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins. We will here discuss recent findings that shed some light on the cellular processes deciding when and how misfolded proteins are specifically selected for autophagic degradation in favor of proteasomal degradation.

[Comparison of PCR, ELISA-CSP and direct microscopic observation methods for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in Anopheles gambiae M in Senegal]. A comparative study between the Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA-CSP) for circumsporozoitic antigen detection method, the direct observation after dissection and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique used to identify Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA markers was carried out. This to evaluate the sensibility and the specificity of the PCR, for the determination of both sporozoitic index (ICSP) and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). The study is conducted in laboratory on eighty six specimens of Anopheles gambiae M infected after being fed with the blood of a gametocytes carrier from Dielmo (Senegal). Salivary glands of forty-eight specimens randomly selected (test A) among the infected eighty six are microscopically observed after manual dissection for the sporozoites detection. The content of these salivary glands and the crushed head/thorax of the remaining 38 specimens (test B) are tested in ELISA-CSP and PCR. The positive and negative results obtained were recorded and summarized for each method. A pair-comparison of the results obtained with each method generally revealed a good sensibility and an excellent specificity The kappa coefficient (K) of test A indicated a "moderate" to "excellent" concordance between the three different methods performed. By using the crushed head/thorax sample, generally used to determine the transmission parameters (ICSP and EIR), the PCR/ELISA-CSP concordance was excellent. In the light of the values of sensibility and specificity obtained, this PCR is comparable to the other methods for the assessment of sporozoitic index and entomological inoculation rate.


Defensin promoters as potential tools for engineering disease resistance in cereal grains.

Early synapse formation in developing interneurons of the adult olfactory bulb. New olfactory bulb granule cells (GCs) are GABAergic interneurons continuously arising from neuronal progenitors and integrating into preexisting bulbar circuits. They receive both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from olfactory bulb intrinsic neurons and centrifugal afferents. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of newborn GC synaptogenesis in adult mouse olfactory bulb. First, we established that GABAergic synapses onto mature GC dendrites contain the GABA(A) receptor alpha2 subunit along with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin. Next, we characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically the development of GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs onto newborn GCs labeled with eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) using lentiviral vectors. Already when reaching the GC layer (GCL), at 3 d post-vector injection (dpi), newborn GCs exhibited tiny voltage-dependent sodium currents and received functional GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, recognized immunohistochemically by apposition of specific presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. Thereafter, GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic contacts increased differentially in the GCL, and at 7 dpi, PSD-95 clusters outnumbered gephyrin clusters. Thus, the weight of GABAergic input was predominant at early stages of GC maturation, but not later. Newborn GC dendrites first reached the external plexiform layer at 4 dpi, where they received functional GABAergic contacts at 5 dpi. Reciprocal synapses initially were formed on GC dendritic shafts, where they might contribute to spine formation. Their presence was confirmed ultrastructurally at 7 dpi. Together, our findings unravel rapid synaptic integration of newborn GCs in adult mouse olfactory bulb, with GABAergic and glutamatergic influences being established proximally before formation of output synapses by apical GC dendrites onto mitral/tufted cells.

Nrf2 is a potential prognostic marker and promotes proliferation and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2 or NFE2L2) is abundantly expressed in cancer cells and relates to proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance. Our early observations also found that expression of Nrf2 was up-regulated in kinds of cancer including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. But there are limited reports about the expression, significance, function of Nrf2 in HCC. First, Nrf2 expression was analyzed in HCC cell lines and tumor samples. Then, the relationship of Nrf2 with clinicopathological factors and survival were analyzed. Further, the effect of Nrf2 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis was examined in vitro by modulating expression of Nrf2 through specific shRNA or expression plasmid. Last, the potential mechanisms were also investigated. Nrf2 was up-regulated in HCC, and expression of Nrf2 was correlated with tumor differentiation, metastasis, and tumor size. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that high Nrf2 expression might be a poor prognostic factor. Further studies demonstrated that inhibition of Nrf2 expression inhibited proliferation by inducing apoptosis and repressed invasion, and up-regulation of Nrf2 expression resulted in opposite phenotypes. Moreover, there are positive correlation between Nrf2 expression and that of Bcl-xL and MMP-9. Nrf2 is a potential prognostic marker and promotes proliferation and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma partly through regulating expression of Bcl-xL and MMP-9.

Distinct effects of calorie restriction and exercise on mammary gland gene expression in C57BL/6 mice. Energy balance, including diet, weight, adiposity, and physical activity, is associated with carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies indicate that obesity and sedentary and/or active behavior are risk factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women and survival in both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Thus, understanding the influence of energy balance modulation on changes in gene expression patterns in the normal mammary gland is important for understanding mechanisms linking energy balance and breast cancer. In a 6-week-long study, female C57BL/6 mice (9-week-old) were randomized into four groups: (a) food consumed ad libitum (AL), (b) AL with access to running wheels (AL+EX), (c) 30% calorie restricted (CR), and (d) 30% CR with access to running wheels (CR+EX). CR mice received 70% of calories but 100% of all other nutrients compared with AL mice. Diet and exercise treatments, individually and combined, had significant effects on body composition and physical activity. Affymetrix oligomicroarrays were used to explore changes in gene expression patterns in total RNA samples from excised whole mammary glands. Contrasting AL versus CR resulted in 425 statistically significant expression changes, whereas AL versus AL+EX resulted in 45 changes, with only 3 changes included among the same genes, indicating that CR and EX differentially influence expression patterns in noncancerous mammary tissue. Differential expression was observed in genes related to breast cancer stem cells, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the growth and survival of breast cancer cells. Thus, CR and EX seem to exert their effects on mammary carcinogenesis through distinct pathways.

Insights into GATA-1-mediated gene activation versus repression via genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis. The transcription factor GATA-1 is required for terminal erythroid maturation and functions as an activator or repressor depending on gene context. Yet its in vivo site selectivity and ability to distinguish between activated versus repressed genes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed GATA-1 ChIP-seq in erythroid cells and compared it to GATA-1-induced gene expression changes. Bound and differentially expressed genes contain a greater number of GATA-binding motifs, a higher frequency of palindromic GATA sites, and closer occupancy to the transcriptional start site versus nondifferentially expressed genes. Moreover, we show that the transcription factor Zbtb7a occupies GATA-1-bound regions of some direct GATA-1 target genes, that the presence of SCL/TAL1 helps distinguish transcriptional activation versus repression, and that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is involved in epigenetic silencing of a subset of GATA-1-repressed genes. These data provide insights into GATA-1-mediated gene regulation in vivo.

Recognizing emotions in faces: effects of acute tryptophan depletion and bright light. In healthy never-depressed individuals, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) may selectively decrease the accurate recognition of fearful facial expressions. Here we investigated the perception of facial emotions after ATD in more detail. We also investigated whether bright light, which can reverse ATD's mood-lowering effect, can also reverse its effect on the perception of facial emotions. On two separate test days, spent in a room that was either bright (n = 14) or dim (n = 16), healthy never-depressed women completed a facial emotion perception task six hours after ingesting tryptophan-deficient and balanced amino acid mixtures. Treatments were administered double blind and in randomized order using a crossover design. In dim light ATD decreased recognition accuracy of anger, disgust, and surprise. The labeling of fear and sadness was not affected. In bright light no effects of ATD were seen. Bright light was identified as a potential confounding factor in task performance. The effects of ATD on facial emotion perception may be less emotion-specific than thought previously, and occurred in a direction opposite to what might be expected based on theories of mood-congruent bias.

Neurochemical and behavioural effects of acute and chronic memantine administration in rats: Further support for NMDA as a new pharmacological target for the treatment of depression? A growing body of evidence has pointed to the NMDA receptor antagonists as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of major depression. The present study was aimed to evaluate behavioural and molecular effects of the acute and chronic treatment with memantine and imipramine in rats. To this aim, rats were acutely or chronically for 14 days once a day treated with memantine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and imipramine (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) and then subjected to the forced swimming and open-field tests. The acute treatment with memantine at all doses and imipramine at doses (20 and 30 mg/kg) reduced immobility time of rats compared to the saline group (p < 0.05), without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity and chronic treatment with memantine and imipramine, at all doses tested, reduced immobility time of rats compared to the saline group (p < 0.05), without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) hippocampal levels were assessed in imipramine- and memantine-treated rats by ELISA sandwich assay. Interesting enough, acute administration, but not chronic administration of memantine at higher dose (20 mg/kg) increased BDNF protein levels in the rat hippocampus (p < 0.05). Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor could be a new pharmacological target for the treatment of depression.

Sexing of turkey poults by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to probe the molecular composition of germinal cells and to identify the gender of turkey poults. Germinal cells obtained from a feather pulp were characterized by FT-IR micro spectroscopy. The sample set consisted of growing contour feathers from 23 male and 23 female turkey poults. Significant spectral variations were observed in the range between 1,000 and 1,250 cm(-1). The spectra of male turkey poults exhibit a significantly higher content of RNA than those of female turkeys. Spectral classification was performed by a non-supervised method based on the principal component analysis. An evaluation of the first and third PCs led to a classification of female and male poults with an accuracy of more than 95%.

Same-day-discharge ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention: initial single-centre experience. Progress in techniques and equipment facilitates same-day-discharge percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To present initial experience of a same-day-discharge intention-to-treat ad hoc PCI strategy with a preferentially radial approach. The first 102 same-day-discharge PCIs performed in our centre were analysed retrospectively. Subjects were stable or stabilised coronary patients, free of cardiac insufficiency, with a normal Allen test and residing within 60min of the centre. Discharge was authorized after six hours' event-free monitoring. The principal assessment criterion combined major adverse cardiovascular events, stroke, major haemorrhage and unscheduled medical consultation in the 30 days following PCI. Overall patient satisfaction and anxiety associated with same-day discharge were assessed by telephone questionnaire at some time after the intervention. Between January 2006 and March 2008, 95 day-hospital patients underwent 102 distinct PCIs (50 complex, 13 bifurcation lesions, nine intravascular ultrasound, 18 fractional flow reserve, two Rotablator procedures). Crossover to overnight admission was necessary for 5.9% (n=6) of interventions. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar to those of an unselected Western population. At 30 days, four clinical events were observed (3.9% of interventions), which occurred within 6 hours (n=2) or after the 24th hour. Classical 24-hour admission would thus have provided no added benefit. On an analogue scale, overall satisfaction was high (8.9/10) and anxiety associated with same-day discharge was low (1.7/10). A same-day-discharge ad hoc PCI strategy proved reliable and safe for most patients selected a priori on simple clinical criteria, entailing no unexpected complications due to shorter medical monitoring.

APOE and ACE polymorphisms and dementia risk in the older population over prolonged follow-up: 10 years of incidence in the MRC CFA Study. dementia risk conferred by apolipoprotein-E (APOE) and angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphisms have been reported for the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) at 6-year follow-up. We concentrate on incident dementia risk over 10 years. participants come from MRC CFAS, a multi-centre longitudinal population-based study of ageing in England and Wales. Three follow-up waves of data collection were used: 2, 6 and 10 years. Logistic regressions were undertaken to investigate associations between APOE (n = 955) and ACE (n = 856) alleles/genotypes and incident dementia. Two types of control groups were used: non-demented and highly functioning non-demented. Results were back-weighted. compared to APOE epsilon3, epsilon2 conferred protection of odds ratio (OR) = 0.3 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.1-0.6) and epsilon4 risk of OR = 2.9 (95% CI = 1.7-4.9) for incident dementia. Compared to epsilon3/epsilon3, the epsilon3/epsilon4 and epsilon4/epsilon4 genotypes conferred risks of OR = 3.6 (95% CI = 1.8-7.3) and OR = 7.9 (95% CI = 1.6-39.2), respectively. The epsilon3/epsilon2 genotype protected against dementia (OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7), and epsilon2/epsilon2 had a similar protective effect but with wide CIs (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-1.7). Restricting the control group accentuated these differentials. The effects of ACE alleles/genotypes on incident dementia risk were small. APOE but not ACE is associated with late-onset incident dementia in the population. Using longer term follow-up with proper adjustment for attrition and incident cases increases estimates of risk.

Action goals influence action-specific perception. We examined the processes that mediate the emergence of action-specific influences on perception that have recently been reported for baseball batting and golf putting (Witt, Linkenauger, Bakdash, & Proffitt, 2008; Witt & Proffitt, 2005). To this end, we used a Schokokusswurfmaschine: Children threw a ball at a target, which, if hit successfully, launched a ball that the children then had to catch. In two experiments, children performed either a throwing-and-catching task or a throwing-only task, in which no ball was launched. After each task, the size of the target or of the ball was estimated. Results indicate that action-specific influences on perceived size occur for objects that are related to the end goal of the action, but not for objects that are related to intermediate action goals. These results suggest that action-specific influences on perception are contingent upon the primary action goals to be achieved.

Contrasting effects of G1.2/G2.2 and SOF1/SOF2 embryo culture media on pre- and post-implantation development of non-transgenic and transgenic cloned goat embryos. This study compared the efficiency of two embryo culture media (SOF1/SOF2 and G1.2/G2.2) for pre- and post-implantation development of somatic cell nuclear transfer goat embryos derived from non-transgenic and transgenic (for htPA and hrcfIX genes) fibroblasts. Despite similar cleavage rates, G1.2/G2.2 supported significantly higher blastocyst development than SOF1/SOF2 (30-35% versus 21%; P < 0.05), irrespective of cell transgenesis. However, following embryo transfer, pregnancy outcomes (establishment, full-term development and live birth) were all significantly higher (P < 0.05) for embryos developed in SOF1/SOF2 versus G1.2/G2.2. Gene expression profiling of 17 developmentally important genes revealed that: (i) SOX2, FOXD3, IFNT, FZD, FGFR4, ERK1, GCN5, PCAF, BMPR1, SMAD5, ALK4, CDC25 and LIFR were significantly induced in blastocysts developed in SOF1/SOF2 but not G1.2/G2.2; (ii) OCT4, CTNNB and CDX2 were similarly expressed in both groups; and (iii) AKT was significantly higher in G1.2/G2.2 than SOF1/SOF2 (P < 0.05). Following IVF, although blastocyst development in G1.2/G2.2 was significantly higher than SOF1/SOF2 counterparts, the majority of assessed genes were similarly expressed in blastocysts developed in both groups. It was concluded that the long-term programming effects of embryo culture medium and/or embryo production method may irreversibly affect post-implantation development of cloned embryos through defined molecular pathways.

Effects of acute administration of melatonin on attentional, executive, and working memory processes in rats. Melatonin is a potential candidate for additive therapy in cancer, neurodegenerative, and mental disorders requiring administration during the activity phase. Nevertheless, because melatonin has mostly been used as a hypnotic, less is known about its cognitive effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute administration of melatonin on executive, attentional, and working memory processes in rats during the activity phase. Three doses of melatonin (6, 18, or 36 mg/kg) were tested and compared to a saline control group in two behavioral tests: the Attentional Set Shifting task (for attentional and executive processes assessment) and the Spontaneous Alternation test in a Y-maze (for working memory assessment). Our results revealed that, up to 36 mg/kg, the acute administration dose of melatonin did not alter the attentional or executive processes, nor the working memory in rats. Consequently, this result may be encouraging for the use of melatonin in additive therapy during the activity phase.

H19-derived miR-675 contributes to bladder cancer cell proliferation by regulating p53 activation. Long noncoding RNA 19 (H19) has been shown to promote bladder cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, little is known about how miR-675, mature product of H19, contributes to bladder cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we first evaluated the expression of miR-675 in bladder cancer tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and defined its biological functions by flow cytometry and Western blotting. We found that miR-675 expression levels were remarkably increased in bladder cancer tissues as compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues or normal bladder tissue from health donors; moreover, enhanced miR-675 expression was also observed in bladder cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of H19 significantly increased bladder cancer cell proliferation and miR-675 expression in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-675 promoted bladder cancer cell proliferation, while suppression of miR-675 induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and promoted cell apoptosis. Western blotting analysis further identified that miR-675 inhibited p53 activation, decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 expression in bladder cancer cells; those effects may result in the abnormal proliferation of bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, abnormal enhanced miR-675 expression increases bladder cancer growth by regulating p53 activation, and thus may be helpful in the development of effective treatment strategies for bladder cancer. 

Long-term effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate in children with epilepsy under the age of 2 years: 4-year follow-up. This is a long-term, open label, observational study aimed to broaden our clinical experiences in managing infants and toddlers with epilepsy. The long-term retention rate and side effects of topiramate (TPM) in them were evaluated and compared with carbamazepine (CBZ). A total of 146 children were involved in the study (TPM=41, CBZ=105). The retention rates at 24 , 36, and 48 months were 46.3%, 34.1%, 26.8% for TPM and 36.2%, 23.8%, 13.3% for CBZ, respectively. At 6 months after starting antiepileptic drugs (AED), the seizure freedom or clinical efficacy (seizure reduction rate more than 50 percent) were 73.2% for TPM and 62.9% for CBZ. The major side effects led to discontinuation included psychomotor slowing, poor oral intake from TPM and sleepiness and skin rash from CBZ. TPM was discontinued due to side effects in one case (2.4%) and lack of efficacy in five cases (12.2%), whereas CBZ was discontinued due to lack of efficacy (22.9%) and side effects (6.7%). As compared with CBZ, TPM showed the same long-term retention rate in children under the age of 2 yr, and no serious side effects. It is therefore concluded that TPM can be considered as a major AED for treating children with epilepsy under the age of 2 yr.

Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient. Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

Effect of time of birth on maternal morbidity during childbirth hospitalization in California. This observational study aimed to determine the relationship between time of birth and maternal morbidity during childbirth hospitalization. Composite maternal morbidities were determined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and vital records codes, using linked hospital discharge and vital records data for 1,475,593 singleton births in California from 2005 through 2007. Time of birth, day of week, and sociodemographic, obstetric, and hospital volume risk factors were estimated using mixed effects logistic regression models. The odds for pelvic morbidity were lowest between 11 PM-7 AM compared to other time periods and the reference value of 7-11 AM. The odds for pelvic morbidity peaked between 11 AM-7 PM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1101-1500 = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.09; 1501-1900 = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10). Odds for severe morbidity were higher between 11 PM-7 AM (AOR, 2301-0300 = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41; 0301-0700 = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.41) compared to other time periods. The adjusted odds were not statistically significant for weekend birth on pelvic morbidity (AOR, Saturday = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02]; Sunday = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.03) or severe morbidity (AOR, Saturday = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18; Sunday = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13). Cesarean birth, hypertensive disorders, birthweight, and sociodemographic factors that include age, race, ethnicity, and insurance status were also significantly associated with severe morbidity. Even after controlling for sociodemographic factors and known risks such as cesarean birth and pregnancy complications such as hypertensive disorders, birth between 11 PM-7 AM is a significant independent risk factor for severe maternal morbidity.

Identification of a resistance gene Rpi-dlc1 to Phytophthora infestans in European accessions of Solanum dulcamara. Initial screening of 14 Solanum dulcamara accessions enabled the identification of individuals resistant and susceptible to Phytophthora infestans. Crosses between contrasting genotypes resulted in three F(2)-BC(1) populations segregating for resistance to late blight in a laboratory assay and under field conditions. Genetic profiling of one of these populations using 128 AFLP primers generated three markers linked to the resistant phenotype. Blast analysis of the sequenced markers resulted in a plausible gene position on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 9 that could be confirmed by CAPS markers. Thus, we describe a first resistant gene, named Rpi-dlc1, from S. dulcamara, a Solanum species native to Europe. In addition, one population was tested for broadness of resistance responses using a set of seven additional P. infestans isolates, varying in virulence. This indicated the possible presence of additional Rpi genes.

Novel H1N1 virus infection and pregnancy. Human infection with the novel H1N1 influenza virus, initially popularly termed "swine flu," was first reported in April 2009 and has since prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level. During pregnancy both mother and baby are at increased risk when infected with either pandemic or seasonal influenza. Because of concerns about the severity of the disease during pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has implemented enhanced surveillance for infection with this novel virus in pregnant women and has placed them in a group that merits priority vaccine administration. The benefit of treatment with the antiviral medication oseltamivir outweighs its theoretical risk, as pregnant women are at increased risk of severe complications from H1N1 virus infection. In addition to confirmed H1N1 cases, the associated symptoms, particularly fever, merit immediate attention. Moreover, precautions must be taken by both patients and health care professionals when confirmed or suspected H1N1-infected pregnant women present to labor and delivery, or the doctor's office. After delivery, pregnant women infected with H1N1 may breastfeed but must follow specific guidelines. Although the current strain of H1N1 virus has fairly mild sequelae, the virus may have mutated over the summer months and we must anticipate a possible second wave of more severe illness moving into fall 2009 and winter 2010.

Contrasting models of the female reproductive tract in four o'clocks (Nyctaginaceae). • In angiosperms, several carpel tissues are specialized to facilitate pollen-tube elongation to achieve fertilization. We evaluated the possible evolutionary pathways of the diverse female reproductive tracts in Nyctaginaceae.• We studied the anatomy of a range of species representing different tribes, using light, fluorescence, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy.• Stigmas have multicellular, multiseriate papillae, except for Boerhavia diffusa with unicellular papillae. The styles are solid, with a strand of transmitting tissue linking the stigma with the ventral ovary wall. In Allionia, Boerhavia, and Mirabilis, the transmitting tissue branches into two independent tracts at the base of the ovary and continues across the lateral margins of the funicle to the micropyle; it is composed of cells with thick walls surrounded by abundant extracellular matrix. Bougainvillea, Pisonia, and Pisoniella have a diffuse transmitting tissue and an obturator, a proliferation of cells covered by a layer of secretory papillae that encloses the funicle, placenta, and ventral wall of the gynoecium and contacts with the micropyle.• We propose two models of female reproductive tract, (A) one in which an obturator is absent and the transmitting tissue is compact and branched and (B) one in which an obturator is present and the transmitting tissue is diffuse. On the basis of character optimization, we hypothesize that model B represents the ancestral (plesiomorphic) condition in the family and model A originated once during evolution, within the tribe Nyctagineae.

Evolving novel anti-HER2 strategies. The approval of trastuzumab for use in metastatic breast cancer marked a breakthrough in the understanding of the biology of the disease. However, like most cancer therapies, the disease finds a way to advance despite the treatments developed to eradicate it. Although trastuzumab has had a large effect on the treatment of early and advanced-stage disease, a substantial proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still progress after receiving the drug. Potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab include bypass mechanisms, mutations of the HER2 target, masking of HER2 proteins, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor, and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) deficiency. Many therapies are being developed to target these mechanisms in patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. Additionally, treatment strategies other than trastuzumab with unique mechanisms of action are being assessed in this specific group of patients. In this review, we discuss the emerging data assessing therapeutic approaches in the management of trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive disease.

Emotion specific modulation of automatic amygdala responses by 5-HTTLPR genotype. A functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been reported to modulate amygdala responsiveness to negative environmental cues. However, it remains unclear whether 5-HTTLPR modulates amygdala responses specifically to negative stimuli or rather to emotionally salient stimuli in general. In 44 healthy subjects, amygdala responses to subliminally presented happy and sad facial expressions were assessed by means of fMRI at 3 Tesla. All subjects were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and the recently discovered 5-HTT rs25531. We observed a robust emotion by genotype group interaction in the right amygdala. Risk allele carriers (S or L(G)) showed similar amygdala responses to happy faces compared to homozygous L(A)L(A) carriers but increased amygdala responses to sad faces. The right amygdala was the only anatomical region across the whole brain demonstrating this interaction at a reasonable threshold. It appears that whereas 5-HTT gene variation modulates automatic amygdala responsiveness to sad faces, no such association was found for happy faces. We conclude that 5-HTTLPR genotype predominantly impacts the central processing predominantly of negative environmental cues but not of emotionally salient stimuli in general.

A giant local interneuron modulates the rhythmic activities of the antennal lobe in Pupae Drosophila. In Drosophila, olfaction is tightly related to feeding and reproduction. There are three classes of neurons forming synapses in the olfactory circuit: the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs). Here, we showed that giant local interneurons named GLNs, which were different from the classical neurons in the olfactory circuits, displayed distinctive rhythmic activities in the dorsolateral side of antennal lobe (AL) in Drosophila Pupae. Anatomically, GLNs were much larger than ipsilateral LNs and extended arborizations throughout the AL. Electrophysiologically, GLN exhibited typical 4-phased rhythmic spontaneous membrane activities, and the surrounding cells were dye-coupled when biocytin was injected into the cell body of GLN. Our study demonstrated that spontaneous activities of GLNs correlated with that of LNs and PNs. After the GLNs were damaged, the membrane activities of ipsilateral LNs and PNs became smaller, but faster. By depressing the firing frequencies of PNs and LNs, GLNs modulated the synchronization of AL and might play an important role as a "modulator" in the local circuit. 

New Regression Equation for 123I-IMP Non-invasive Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement Using the Graph Plot Method. A graph plot (GP) method using 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) has been proposed as a simple and non-invasive estimation of quantitative cerebral bloodflow (CBF). A regression equation for the GP method was estimated by the data of resting state. Therefore, the accuracy of CBF values in high flow range may be an underestimated possibility in this method.The aim of this study was to formulate a new regression equation for the GP method by the data of resting state and acetazolamide (ACZ) challenge, and to clarify the accuracy of it. The images of 26 consecutive patients who underwent both 123I-IMP chest radioisotope-angiography (RIA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations were used to construct the new regression equation. Examinations of the resting state and ACZ challenge were performed in different days. All patients were analyzed by both the GP method and autoradiography (ARG) method which is the conventional examination with the one-point arterial blood sampling. A linear regression equation between the index of the input function was obtained by the GP method and CBF value of ARG. The linear regression equation based on the resting data was compared with the equation based on the resting and ACZ challenge (rest+stress) data. Goodliner correlation was obtained between the index of the input function obtained by the GP method and CBF value of the ARG method in the rest+stress state (y=2.75x+15.1, r=0.78). In contrast, correlation results between the index of the input function obtained by the GP method and CBF value of the ARG method in the resting state was expressed as y=2.28x+18.4, r=0.54 rCBF values based on the resting data was 20% underestimated in the high flow range compared with values based on the rest+stress data. The new linear regression equation for the GP method is useful for clinical study. Key words: non-invasive cerebral blood flow measurement method, graph plot (GP), autoradiography (ARG), 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP).

Severe transient hypertension after greater palatine foramen block in a patient taking midodrine. We report an episode of transient, severe hypertension occurring within 2 minutes of injection of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 U of epinephrine in a patient taking midodrine for orthostatic hypotension. We hypothesize that the patient's autonomic nervous system was dangerously susceptible to the effect of local anesthetic when combined with the vasoactive systemic effect of midodrine. Surgeons should minimize the use of vasoconstrictors in patients treated with midodrine to avoid hypertensive complications.

Noncoding Transcriptional Landscape in Human Aging. Aging is a universal phenomenon in metazoans, characterized by a general decline of the organism physiology associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Aging of an organism correlates with a decline in function of its cells, as shown for muscle, immune, and neuronal cells. As the DNA content of most cells within an organism remains largely identical throughout the life span, age-associated transcriptional changes must be achieved by epigenetic mechanisms. However, how aging may impact on the epigenetic state of cells is only beginning to be understood. In light of a growing number of studies demonstrating that noncoding RNAs can provide molecular signals that regulate expression of protein-coding genes and define epigenetic states of cells, we hypothesize that noncoding RNAs could play a direct role in inducing age-associated profiles of gene expression. In this context, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of gene expression might be important for the overall transcriptional landscape observed in aged human cells. The possible functions of lncRNAs and other noncoding RNAs, and their roles in the regulation of aging-related cellular pathways will be analyzed. 

Transthoracic sonography in comparison to multislice computed tomography in detection of peripheral pulmonary embolism. The aim of the study was to compare transthoracic sonography (TS) with multislice computed tomography (MSCT) in the detection of peripheral pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition, the study verified peripheral parenchymal findings visualized by TS and MSCT. A total of 33 patients (16 females, 17 males; mean age = 65.4 years) with symptoms of suspected PE were enrolled in the study. TS and MSCT were undertaken within 24 h of the beginning of clinical PE signs. Ten patients suffered from PE as visualized by MSCT. The sensitivity of TS for detecting PE was 70.0% and the specificity was 69.6%. Preferentially, PE and peripheral parenchymal findings were situated in the lower lobes. Oligemia was the main parenchymal alteration detected by MSCT. TS demonstrated that wedge-shaped consolidations were frequently associated with PE. In addition, localized pleural effusion was a typical finding in the presence of PE for both TS and MSCT. TS had moderate sensitivity and specificity compared with MSCT. Furthermore, the study revealed that PE is often associated with peripheral parenchymal changes, both of which are detectable by TS and MSCT. In case of contraindication with MSCT, TS is a potential technique for diagnosing PE-related parenchymal findings and can serve as an alternative method in the diagnosis of PE. However, a negative result with TS does not rule out a PE.

Re-evaluation of groundwater monitoring data for glyphosate and bentazone by taking detection limits into account. Current regulatory assessment of pesticide contamination of Danish groundwater is exclusively based on samples with pesticide concentrations above detection limit. Here we demonstrate that a realistic quantification of pesticide contamination requires the inclusion of "non-detect" samples i.e. samples with concentrations below the detection limit, as left-censored observations. The median calculated pesticide concentrations are shown to be reduced 10(4) to 10(5) fold for two representative herbicides (glyphosate and bentazone) relative to the median concentrations based upon observations above detection limits alone. 


Hypomethylation and genome instability in the germline of exposed parents and their progeny is associated with altered miRNA expression.

Brainstem pitch representation in native speakers of Mandarin is less susceptible to degradation of stimulus temporal regularity. It has been demonstrated that neural encoding of pitch in the auditory brainstem is shaped by long-term experience with language. To date, however, all stimuli have exhibited a high degree of pitch saliency. The experimental design herein permits us to determine whether experience-dependent pitch representation in the brainstem is less susceptible to progressive degradation of the temporal regularity of iterated rippled noise (IRN). Brainstem responses were recorded from Chinese and English participants in response to IRN homologues of Mandarin Tone 2 (T2(IRN)). Six different iterations steps were utilized to systematically vary the degree of temporal regularity in the fine structure of the IRN stimuli to produce a pitch salience continuum ranging from low to high. Pitch-tracking accuracy and pitch strength were computed from the brainstem responses using autocorrelation algorithms. Analysis of variance of brainstem responses to T2(IRN) revealed that pitch-tracking accuracy is higher in the native tone language group (Chinese) relative to the non-tone language group (English) except for the three lowest steps along the continuum, and moreover, that pitch strength is greater in the Chinese group even in severely degraded stimuli for two of the six 40-ms sections of T2(IRN) that exhibit rapid changes in pitch. For these same two sections, exponential time constants for the stimulus continuum revealed that pitch strength emerges 2-3 times faster in the tone language than in the non-tone language group as a function of increasing pitch salience. These findings altogether suggest that experience-dependent brainstem mechanisms for pitch are especially sensitive to those dimensions of tonal contours that provide cues of high perceptual saliency in degraded as well as normal listening conditions.

Adverse Effects of Iodine-derived Intravenous Radiopaque Contrast Media. Although the advent of nonionic low-osmolar contrast agents has reduced the probability of a reaction to radiopaque contrast media derived from tri-iodinated benzoic acid, reactions still occur. Radiologic technologists must understand and know how to manage adverse effects of contrast media. Prompt attention to patients who exhibit the early signs of an adverse reaction can help to ensure the reaction does not progress to become severe or life-threatening. 

Electroconvulsive therapy in the presence of a metallic skull plate after meningioma resection. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and safe treatment even in the frail and in the medically ill. A case report of ECT being administered to a patient with a history of a recently resected meningioma and the presence of a metallic skull plate is presented here. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder in remission but had an acute manic episode with psychotic features after resection of suprasellar meningioma. He presented with superimposed delirium that complicated the presentation. Because there was no effective resolution with medications, ECT was administered. This case documents the safe administration of ECT in complicated situations such as these. This case also demonstrates that ECT can be successfully administered in the presence of superimposed delirium and after a recent meningioma resection. Clinical skills and expertise are required to safely and effectively administer ECT in such cases.

Spatial and symbolic implicit sequence learning in young and older adults. In three experiments, we examined the effects of age and spatial processing on implicit sequence learning. In experiment 1, 48 older adults (OA) and 48 young adults (YA) performed the alternating serial reaction time task (ASRT) under one of four conditions in which spatial processing demands were either present or absent from stimulus presentation (spatial vs. symbolic cueing) and/or response execution (spatial manual vs. vocal responses). Surprisingly, OA exhibited more learning than YA in the two vocal response conditions. In two follow-up experiments, we increased the response selection demands of the sequence learning task by asking new groups of YA and OA participants to make word categorization responses with 1:1 stimulus-response mapping (experiment 2) and 2:1 mapping (experiment 3) rather than letter reading (vocal response condition of experiment 1). The results showed that YA had increased learning under the more challenging response selection conditions (experiments 2 and 3) while OA did not. We propose that (1) manipulating the spatial aspects of implicit sequence learning does not necessarily impact the amount of learning for OA, (2) implicit sequence learning depends on both the structure of response execution and relative task difficulty, and (3) these factors affect implicit sequence learning for both YA and OA.

Implantation metastasis of prostate cancer in a suprapubic cystostomy tube needle tract. A 64-year-old male patient with a serum PSA value of 51.91 ng ml(-1) and an magnetic resonance imaging scan suggestive of prostate cancer was admitted with bilateral hydronephrosis and anemia. A suprapubic cystostomy had been inserted 6 months earlier, owing to voiding difficulties. The patient was found to have huge multiple bladder stones and a massively thickened bladder wall. A sectio alta with bladder stone removal and bilateral ureteral stenting was performed. Histopathological examination revealed the growth of prostate cancer cells in the cystostomy tube needle tract.

Cell carriers as the next generation of cell therapy for cartilage repair: a review of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure. Since the first patient was implanted with autologous cultured chondrocytes more than 20 years ago, new variations of cell therapies for cartilage repair have appeared. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a first-generation cell therapy, uses suspended autologous cultured chondrocytes in combination with a periosteal patch. Collagen-covered autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation, a second-generation cell therapy, uses suspended cultured chondrocytes with a collagen type I/III membrane. Today's demand for transarthroscopic procedures has resulted in the development of third-generation cell therapies that deliver autologous cultured chondrocytes using cell carriers or cell-seeded scaffolds. To review the current evidence of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure, the most widely used carrier system to date. Also discussed are the characteristics of type I/III collagen membranes, behavior of cells associated with the membrane, surgical technique, rehabilitation, clinical outcomes, and quality of repair tissue. Systematic review. Relevant publications were identified by searching Medline from its inception (1949) to December 2007; peer-reviewed publications of preclinical and clinical cell behavior, manufacturing process, surgical technique, and rehabilitation protocols were identified. Preclinical and clinical studies were included if they contained primary data and used a type I/III collagen membrane. Data from these studies demonstrate that patients treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation have an overall improvement in clinical outcomes. Reduced visual analog scale pain levels (range, 1.7-5.32 points) and improvements in the modified Cincinnati (range, 3.8-34.2 points), Lysholm-Gillquist (range, 23.09-47.6 points), Tegner-Lysholm (range, 1.39-3.9 points), and International Knee Documentation Classification scale (P <.05) were observed. Patients had good-quality (hyaline-like) repair tissue as assessed by arthroscopic evaluation (including International Cartilage Repair Society score), magnetic resonance imaging, and histology, as well as a low incidence of postoperative complications. The findings suggest that matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation is a promising third-generation cell therapy for the repair of symptomatic, full-thickness articular cartilage defects.

VCD spectroscopic properties of the beta-hairpin forming miniprotein CLN025 in various solvents. Electronic and vibrational circular dichroism are often used to determine the secondary structure of proteins, because each secondary structure has a unique spectrum. Little is known about the vibrational circular dichroic spectroscopic features of the beta-hairpin. In this study, the VCD spectral features of a decapeptide, YYDPETGTWY (CLN025), which forms a stable beta-hairpin that is stabilized by intramolecular weakly polar interactions and hydrogen bonds were determined. Molecular dynamics simulations and ECD spectropolarimetry were used to confirm that CLN025 adopts a beta-hairpin in water, TFE, MeOH, and DMSO and to examine differences in the secondary structure, hydrogen bonds, and weakly polar interactions. CLN025 was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis with N(alpha)-Fmoc protected amino acids. The VCD spectra displayed a (-,+,-) pattern with bands at 1640 to 1656 cm(-1), 1667 to 1687 cm(-1), and 1679 to 1686 cm(-1) formed by the overlap of a lower frequency negative couplet and a higher frequency positive couplet. A maximum IR absorbance was observed at 1647 to 1663 cm(-1) with component bands at 1630 cm(-1), 1646 cm(-1), 1658 cm(-1), and 1675 to 1680 cm(-1) that are indicative of the beta-sheet, random meander, either random meander or loop and turn, respectively. These results are similar to the results of others, who examined the VCD spectra of beta-hairpins formed by (D)Pro-Xxx turns and indicated that observed pattern is typical of beta-hairpins.


A re-evaluation of the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Erectile dysfunction in severe sleep apnea patients and response to CPAP. The aim of this study was to investigate frequency and degree of ED in patients with severe sleep apnea and to evaluate the results of only continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on ED in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). This was a prospective clinical trial study. Patients with severe sleep apnea (40) were randomized into two groups. Multiple questionnaire investigation and laboratory evaluation were performed for ED, severity of OSAS and psychological status. Group 1 was treated with CPAP and group 2 was treated with only antidepressant medication for at least 1 month. Patients were evaluated after 1 month of therapy and compared with initial ones. Before CPAP, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores were significantly correlated only with body mass index (BMI; P=0.007) and not correlated significantly with Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (P=0.286), lowest SaO(2) (P=0.182), Beck's Depression Inventory scores (P=0.302) and apnea/hypopnea index (P=0.279). After 1 month of regular CPAP usage, mean value of IIEF-5 score was 15.71+/-5.12 before CPAP and were improved up to 19.06+/-3.94, statistically significant. All subjects responded positively to the CPAP treatment and their erection status was improved positively. We have found a correlation between severe OSAS and ED. CPAP is effective in improvement of sexual performance of these patients.


Peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kD): A review of its use in chronic hepatitis B.

Longitudinal MRI and MRSI characterization of the quinolinic acid rat model for excitotoxicity: peculiar apparent diffusion coefficients and recovery of N-acetyl aspartate levels. Quinolinic acid (QA) induced striatal lesion is an important model for excitotoxicity that is also used for efficacy studies. To date, the morphological and spectroscopic indices of this model have not been studied longitudinally by MRI; therefore the objectives of this study were aimed at following the lesion progression and changes in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) as viewed by MRI and MRSI, respectively, in-vivo over a period of 49 days. We found that the affected areas exhibited both high and low apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) even 49 days post QA injection in three of the six tested animals. MRI-guided histological analysis correlated areas characterized by high ADCs on day 49 with cellular loss, while areas characterized by lower ADCs were correlated with macrophage infiltration (CD68 positive stain). Our MRSI study revealed an initial reduction of NAA levels in the lesioned striatum, which significantly recovered with time, although not to control levels. Total-striatum normalized NAA levels recovered from 0.67 +/- 0.15 (of the contralateral row) on day 1 to 0.90 +/- 0.12 on day 49. Our findings suggest that NAA should be considered as a marker for neuronal dysfunction, in addition to neuronal viability. Some behavioral indices could be correlated to permanent neuronal damage while others demonstrated a spontaneous recovery parallel to the NAA recovery. Our findings may have implications in efficacy-oriented studies performed on the QA model.

A genome-wide analysis of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data to detect intra-species variations and evolutionary relationships. Array-based comparative genomics hybridization (aCGH) has gained prevalence as an effective technique for measuring structural variations in the genome. Copy-number variations (CNVs) form a large source of genomic structural variation, but it is not known whether phenotypic differences between intra-species groups, such as divergent human populations, or breeds of a domestic animal, can be attributed to CNVs. Several computational methods have been proposed to improve the detection of CNVs from array CGH data, but few population studies have used CGH data for identification of intra-species differences. In this paper we propose a novel method of genome-wide comparison and classification using CGH data that condenses whole genome information, aimed at quantification of intra-species variations and discovery of shared ancestry. Our strategy included smoothing CGH data using an appropriate denoising algorithm, extracting features via wavelets, quantifying the information via wavelet power spectrum and hierarchical clustering of the resultant profile. To evaluate the classification efficiency of our method, we used simulated data sets. We applied it to aCGH data from human and bovine individuals and showed that it successfully detects existing intra-specific variations with additional evolutionary implications.

Psychological distress and self-perception of oral health status among an immigrant population from Ethiopia. To examine the association between psychological distress (PD) and perception of oral health status among a group of Ethiopian immigrants compared to the 'gold standard' of clinical diagnosis. Three hundred and forty Ethiopian immigrants, aged 18 years or more, were interviewed using a version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (World Health Organization) for the assessment of psychological status and perceived dental and periodontal health status. Clinical data for dental and periodontal health status were used as the 'gold standard' against the self-perceived assessment scores among the PD and no psychological distress (NPD) groups. These were compared for sensitivity and specificity. One hundred and thirty-five subjects (40%) presented PD. Seventy-eight percent of the PD subjects reported a negative dental health status, as compared to 42% of the NPD subjects. Seventy-three percent of the PD subjects reported a negative periodontal health status, as compared to 44% of the NPD subjects (p<0.001). The sensitivity for self-perceived dental health status among the PD subjects was found to be 0.78 and the specificity was found to be 0.40, as compared to 0.59 and 0.69, respectively, among the NPD subjects (p<0.001). The sensitivity for self-perceived periodontal health status among the PD subjects was found to be 0.78 and the specificity was found to be 0.40, as compared to 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, among the NPD subjects (p<0.001). Results demonstrate that PD may modify self-perception of health status. Self-perceived health and disease should be an integral element in the continuum of professional clinical health assessment and subsequent health care planning. The relevance of PD is evident in this immigrant ethnic group and should be considered and further studied in other at-risk minority communities.

Exaggerated IDO1 expression and activity in Langerhans cells from patients with atopic dermatitis upon viral stimulation: a potential predictive biomarker for high risk of Eczema herpeticum. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a heterogenous and highly complex disease characterized by an increased microbial colonization. For unknown reasons, a subgroup of patients with AD develops Eczema herpeticum (EH), a severe viral complication due to spreading of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme which is assumed to be instrumental in the antibacterial and antiviral defence mechanisms. Comparative investigation of the IDO1 expression and activity in freshly isolated monocytes, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and in vitro-generated Langerhans cells (LC) obtained from AD patients with HSV infections and EH and nonatopic controls. We demonstrate an increase in Trp degradation in the serum of patients during acute EH episodes. Circulating pDC from patients with history of EH display an increased IDO1 expression. An increased Trp degradation is detected in the supernatants of circulating monocytes from AD patients with acute EH. Mature LC from AD patients with history of EH and with acute EH display an increased IDO1 expression and activity, respectively. In LC from patients with history of EH, viral signals induce an exaggerated IDO1 expression and activity. IDO1 expression and activity in LC seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of EH in AD and could represent a predictive biomarker for patients with risk to develop EH and other viral complications.

Expression of chick Coactosin in cells in morphogenetic movement. Coactosin is a 17 kDa actin binding protein that belongs to the actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin homology family. Coactosin inhibits barbed-end capping of actin filament, and is involved in actin polymerization. Coactosin is expressed in cephalic and trunk neural crest cells, cranial ganglia and dorsal root ganglia. Coactosin is also expressed in the cells that are forming mesonephric duct, and endodermal cells. Immunocytochemistry with anti-Coactosin antibody shows that Coactosin is localized in the cytoplasm, and associated with actin stress fibers in cultured neural crest cells. Coactosin is also expressed in the axon of oculomotor nerve and trigeminal nerve. In the growth cone of the oculomotor nerve axons, both Coactosin mRNA and protein were localized, which is indicative of the role of Coactosin in pathfinding of the growth cone. Coactosin is expressed in those that require dynamic and highly coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton, that is, neural crest cells, cells in the tip of the mesonephros, endodermal cells and axons.

[Association between interleukin-8 in lung tissues and stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases]. To investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 in lung tissues from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its association with stages of COPD. The levels of mRNA and protein of IL-8 were measured with semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patients with mild COPD (n=21), patients with advanced COPD (n=15), and controls (n=15). The correlations between IL-8 levels and stages of COPD, lung function (FEV1/ FVC%, FEV1% pred) and cigarette smoking were analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis. The levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein in the lung tissues of COPD patients were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The patients with advanced COPD had higher levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein than the patients with mild COPD (P<0.05). The COPD patients who smoked had higher levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein than those who did not smoke (P<0.05). But no significant differences in the levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein were found between smokers and and nonsmokers who did not have COPD (P>0.05). Increased expression of IL-8 in patients with COPD was positively correlated with stages of COPD (r=0.81, P<0.05); negatively correlated with lung function (FEV1/FVC%, FEV1% pred) (r=-0.62, -0.56, P<0.05), and positively correlated with volumes of cigarette smoking (r=0.53, P<0.05). IL-8 is associated with stages of COPD, which may serve as an indication for clinical progress. Cigarette smoking increases IL-8 expression in the lung tissues of COPD patients.

Three-dimensional digital evaluation of dental arches in infants with cleft lip and/or palate. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the dimensions of the dental arches on three-dimensional digital study models in children with and without cleft lip and palate before the primary surgery. The sample consisted of 223 digital models of children aged 3-9 months, divided into 5 groups: without craniofacial deformities, unilateral and bilateral incomplete cleft lip and alveolus, unilateral and bilateral complete cleft lip and alveolus, unilateral cleft lip and palate, and bilateral cleft lip and palate. Dental casts of the maxillary dental arches of the children were used. The dental casts underwent a process of scanning through 3D scanner and the measurements used for the correlation among groups were made on the scanned images. Statistical analysis was performed by t test and ANOVA followed by Tukey test. The results showed that the intercanine distance and anterior cleft width was wider in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate. The intertuberosity distances and posterior cleft width was wider in children with bilateral cleft lip and palate among the groups. Children with cleft lip and palate before the primary surgery had wider maxillary arch dimensions than the children without cleft lip and palate. 

Impaired everyday memory associated with encephalopathy of severe malaria: the role of seizures and hippocampal damage. Seizures are common in children admitted with severe falciparum malaria and are associated with neuro-cognitive impairments. Prolonged febrile seizures are associated with hippocampal damage and impaired memory. It was hypothesized that severe malaria causes impaired everyday memory which may be associated with hippocampal damage. An everyday memory battery was administered on 152 children with cerebral malaria (CM) (mean age, 7 y 4 months [SD 13 months]; 77 males) 156 children (mean age, 7 y 4 months [SD, 14 months]; 72 males) with malaria plus complex seizures (MS) and 179 children (mean age, 7 y 6 months [SD, 13 months]; 93 males) unexposed to either condition. CM was associated with poorer everyday memory [95% CI, -2.46 to -0.36, p = 0.004] but not MS [95% CI, -0.91 to 1.16, p = 1.00] compared to unexposed children. Children with exposure to CM performed more poorly in recall [95% CI, -0.79 to -0.04, p = 0.024] and recognition subtests [95% CI, -0.90 to -0.17, p = 0.001] but not in prospective memory tests compared to controls. The health factors that predicted impaired everyday memory outcome in children with exposure to CM was profound coma [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.88, p = 0.037] and multiple episodes of hypoglycaemia [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.78, p = 0.020], but not seizures. The findings show that exposure to CM was associated with a specific impairment of everyday memory. Seizures commonly observed in severe malaria may not have a causal relationship with poor outcome, but rather be associated with profound coma and repeated metabolic insults (multi-hypoglycaemia) that are strongly associated with impaired everyday memory.

[Callus induction and plant regeneration of Liriope spicata var. prolifera anther]. To study the technique of the callus induction from anther and plant regeneration of medicinal plants Liriope spicata var. prolifera. Callus was induced from anther of L. spicata var. prolifera on a MS medium supplemented with different hormones. The squash methods combined with a microscope were used to analyze chromosomes of regenerated plantlets. MS +2,4-D 1.0 mg x L(-1) + KT 2.0 mg x L(-1) gave the highest induction ratio which was 41.07%. MS +6-BA 1.5-2.0 mg x L(-1) + NAA 0.1-0.3 mg x L(-1) was suitable for the induction and proliferation of indefinite buds. The buds were transferred to 1/2 MS medium supplemented with NAA 0.1-0.3 mg x L(-1) for rooting. The shoots produced roots of culture and formed complete plantlets. The regenerated plantlets originated from somatic cells. At the same time, the effects of pretreatment of low temperature at 4 degrees C on the callus induction were studied and discussed. This paper sets up the method of tissue culture of anther somatic-cells and intermediate propagation of L. spicata var. prolifera.

Evidence for a partially structured state of the amylin monomer. Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) is the main component in amyloid deposits formed in type II diabetes. We used triplet quenching to probe the dynamics of contact formation between the N-terminal disulfide loop and a C-terminal tryptophan in monomeric amylins from human and rat. Quenching rates measured in the absence of denaturant are four times larger than those in 6 M guanidinium chloride, indicating a decrease in the average end-to-end distance (collapse) at low denaturant concentrations. We were surprised to find an even greater (sevenfold) increase in quenching rates on removal of denaturant for a hydrophilic control peptide containing the disulfide loop compared to the same peptide without the loop (twofold change). These results suggest that collapse is driven by backbone-backbone and backbone-side chain interactions involving the disulfide loop portion of the chain rather than by the formation of side-chain hydrophobic contacts. Molecular dynamics simulations of the control peptide show that the collapse results from hydrogen-bonding interactions between the central residues of the chain and the disulfide loop. The quenching experiments also indicate that the monomer of the human, amyloidogenic form of amylin is more compact than the rat form, which does not form amyloid. We discuss these newly observed differences between human and rat amylin in solution and their possible relation to aggregation and to the physiological function of amylin binding to the calcitonin receptor.


Inorganic polyphosphate inhibits an aspartic protease-like activity in the eggs of Rhodnius prolixus (Stahl) and impairs yolk mobilization in vitro.

Over-expression of Müllerian inhibiting substance mRNA in the Turner syndrome ovary. Turner Syndrome (TS) is a disorder of human females associated with complete or partial loss of one of the X chromosomes, varying degrees of multiple congenital malformations and gonadal dysgenesis. However, the reason for the premature loss of germ cells in the TS ovaries is currently unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the gonadal dysgenesis the mRNA expression of Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) was examined in human fetal and adult TS ovaries and compared with normal ovaries by in situ hybridization. The expression of MIS was found to be increased in the granulosa cells of the TS ovaries as compared to that in normal ovaries, and these granulosa cells were organized to form testicular tubule like structures. MIS was also found to be ectopically expressed in the oocytes of the developing TS gonads. The stromal cells of the streak gonads of adult TS women abundantly expressed MIS. We speculate that the absence of a second X chromosome leads to over-expression of MIS that may be co-responsible for failure of ovarian differentiation in TS. MIS may be a potential negative regulator of ovarian development in humans.


Neurotensin promotes the dendrite elongation and the dendritic spine maturation of the cerebral cortex in vitro.


Pregnancy outcome after cervical conisation: a retrospective cohort study in the Leuven University Hospital.

Thyroid hormone in cardiac surgery. Thyroid hormone has a wide range of cardiovascular effects which are mediated at both genomic and non-genomic levels. As a stress response to surgery, the non-thyroidal illness syndrome or euthyroid sick syndrome occurs in the post-operative period following cardiac surgery. There remains debate about the potential benefits of the treatment of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome in this setting with acute thyroid hormone supplementation. This review article sets out to discuss the potential benefits of thyroid hormone supplementation and the results from trials relating to both adult and paediatric cardiac surgical population as well as in the setting of brain stem death to optimise the potential cardiac donor.

Ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction enhances beta-galactosidase gene transfection and expression in HKCs. To investigate the efficiency and safety of ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction in enhancing beta-galactosidase gene (beta-gal gene) transfer into human proximal tubular cells(HKCs). beta-gal gene was transfected to HKCs as a mark gene with ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction. Cultured HKCs were grouped to receive the following 7 treatments respectively: ultrasound alone; microbubble alone; naked plasmid; ultrasound and plasmid; microbubble and plasmid; ultrasound, microbubble, and plasmid; and VigoFect and plasmid. In Group 6, HKCs were exposed to ultrasound under different sound intensities and time. X-gal staining, trypan blue staining, and Hochest staining were used to detect the transfection efficiency, cell survival rate, and cell apoptosis rate, respectively. Beta-galactosidase expression could be observed in the ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction groups. Along with the increasing of sound intensity and exposure time, the cell survival rate of HKCs decreased, and the cell apoptosis rate increased gradually. The transduction efficiency and survival rate in middle intensity (0.3 W/cm(2)*60 s) of ultrasound exposure were higher than those of other groups, similar to those of Group 7. Under optimum sound intensity and exposure time, ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction can increase gene transfer into HKCs. This non-invasive gene transfer method may be a useful tool for clinical gene therapy.

Dunaliella as an attractive candidate for molecular farming. Pharmaceutical recombinant proteins are widely used in human healthcare. At present, several protein expression systems are available to generate therapeutic proteins. These conventional systems have distinct advantages and disadvantages in protein yielding; in terms of ease of manipulation, the time required from gene transformation to protein purification, cost of production and scaling-up capitalization, proper folding and stability of active proteins. Depending on the research goal and priorities, a special system may be selected for protein expression. However, considering the limited variety of organisms currently used and their usage restrictions, there are still much more pharmaceutical proteins waiting to be economically and efficiently produced. Distinguished biological and technical features of microalgae Dunaliella such as inexpensive medium requirement, fast growth rate, the ease of manipulation, easy scaling up procedure, facility of milking in bioreactors and the ability of post-translational modifications make this microorganism an attractive candidate for molecular farming.


The macaque midbrain reticular formation sends side-specific feedback to the superior colliculus.

The two mutations, Q204X and nt821, of the myostatin gene affect carcass and meat quality in young heterozygous bulls of French beef breeds. The availability of genetic tests to detect different mutations in the myostatin gene allows the identification of heterozygous animals and would warrant the superiority of these animals for slaughter performance if this superiority is confirmed. Thus, 2 mutations of this gene, Q204X and nt821, were studied in 3 French beef breeds in the program Qualvigène. This work was done with 1,114 Charolais, 1,254 Limousin, and 981 Blonde d'Aquitaine young bulls from, respectively, 48, 36, and 30 sires and slaughtered from 2004 to 2006. In addition to the usual carcass traits recorded at slaughter (e.g., carcass yield, muscle score), carcass composition was estimated by weighing internal fat and dissecting the 6th rib. The muscle characteristic traits analyzed were lipid and collagen contents, muscle fiber section area, and pH. Regarding meat quality, sensory qualities of meat samples were evaluated by a taste panel, and Warner-Bratzler shear force was measured. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the blood samples of all calves, the blood samples of 78% of the dams, and the blood or semen samples of all the sires. Genotypes were determined for 2 disruptive mutations, Q204X and nt821. Analyses were conducted by breed. The superiority of carcass traits of calves carrying one copy of the mutated allele (Q204X or nt821) over noncarrier animals was approximately +1 SD in the Charolais and Limousin breeds but was not significant in the Blonde d'Aquitaine. In the Charolais breed, for which the frequency was the greatest (7%), young bulls carrying the Q204X mutation presented a carcass with less fat, less intramuscular fat and collagen contents, and a clearer and more tender meat than those of homozygous-normal cattle. The meat of these animals also had slightly less flavor. Also in the Charolais breed, 13 of 48 sires were heterozygous. For each sire, the substitution effect of the wild allele by the mutant allele was approximately +1 SD for carcass conformation and yield, showing that the estimate of the substitution effect was independent of family structure, as it ought to be for a causal mutation. These results illustrate the challenge of using genetic tests to detect animals with the genetic potential for greater grades of carcasses and meat quality.


Preparation of lorazepam-loaded microemulsions for intranasal delivery and its pharmacokinetics.

Carotid Plaques Correlates in Patients With Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. We compared factors associated with the presence of carotid plaques and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, in 241 patients with FH (98, 40.7% men; mean age 41 ± 18.4 years). Patients with FH having carotid plaques (36.5%) had mean age, apolipoprotein (apo) B, glucose, apoA1, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP, waist/hip ratio (WHR), and body mass index higher than patients without plaques. Logistic regression revealed that apoB (odds ratio [OR] per 1 unit change 1.03,P= .005), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; OR per 1 standard deviation [SD] change 0.59,P= .015), and non-HDL-C (OR per 1SD change 1.53,P= .04) were significantly associated with the presence of plaques. The cIMT correlated with obesity parameters, BP, apoB, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, creatinine, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alanine transaminase (P< .001). Regression analysis revealed that cIMT was significantly associated with apoB, SBP, and WHR. These results confirm the role of apoB-containing lipoproteins and low HDL-C with the presence of carotid plaques and apoB, BP, and WHR with cIMT. 


[The effect of valsartan and fluvastatin on the connective tissue growth factor expression in experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy].

Besides CYP2C19*2, the variant allele CYP2C9*3 is associated with higher on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing elective coronary stent implantation. The prodrug, clopidogrel, plays an important role in the prevention of thrombotic events in patients undergoing coronary stenting. However, a substantial number of atherothrombotic events still occur, which can partially be explained by heightened residual platelet reactivity. Several studies report that the genetic variation in CYP2C19 (*2) is associated with an impaired response to clopidogrel. To evaluate the effect of genetic variants affecting clopidogrel's absorption (ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T), metabolism (CYP2C9*2, *3, CYP2C19*3, CYP3A4*1B, and CYP3A5*3), and pharmacodynamics (P2Y1 A1622G) on top of the influence of CYP2C19*2 on platelet reactivity in patients undergoing elective coronary stenting on dual antiplatelet therapy. Platelet function was assessed by light transmittance aggregometry and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay in 428 consecutive patients. Patients were either on chronic clopidogrel maintenance therapy (75 mg/day for > or =5 days before the intervention) or received a 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose (1-5 days before the intervention, followed by 75 mg/day). Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the associations between genetic variants and platelet reactivity and poor responder status. In both the treatment groups, CYP2C19*2-carriage was associated with higher platelet reactivity (P<0.002) and poor responder status; 75 mg group: adjusted odds ratio (ORadj): 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-7.2, 300 mg group: ORadj: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.6-10.4. In the 300 mg group, CYP2C9*3-carriage was associated with higher platelet reactivity (P<0.05) and poor responder status (ORadj: 11.1, 95% CI: 1.6-78.8, P=0.016). Besides CYP2C19*2, the variant allele CYP2C9*3 plays an important role in the response to clopidogrel in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing coronary stenting.

First-line capecitabine monotherapy for slowly progressing metastatic breast cancer: do we need aggressive treatment? Primary treatment goals in less aggressive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are prolonged survival, good quality of life and control of the disease and its symptoms. High activity, oral administration and no alopecia make capecitabine monotherapy attractive in slowly evolving disease. We retrospectively analysed 226 patients who had received single-agent capecitabine as 1st-line chemotherapy at our institution. The median interval between breast cancer diagnosis and MBC was 52 months (range 0-479); 76% had received endocrine therapy for MBC, 58% had visceral involvement and 30% had 3 or more metastatic sites. The median starting dose was 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily. Disease was improved in 56% of the patients (median duration: 13.2 months) and stabilised in 20%. Median time to treatment failure was 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.1-10.5); median overall survival from initiating capecitabine was 23.6 months (95% CI: 19.7-27.4). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy for MBC, visceral disease, hormone receptor status and initial capecitabine dose did not influence time to treatment failure. Among 161 patients <75 years, 90% received further chemotherapy. Based on these findings, 1st-line capecitabine should be considered in slowly progressing disease, offering an active, well-tolerated oral treatment with minimal toxicity and no alopecia. More toxic treatments may be reserved for more aggressive disease.


Analysis of genes early expressed during Aspergillus flavus colonisation of hazelnut.

Angiocentric glioma: a case report and review of the literature. Angiocentric glioma (AG) is a rare central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm that was only recently recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). AG occurs in a broad age range, shows no gender predilection, and arises superficially in the cerebrum, usually resulting in medically intractable seizures. Most cases are cured by surgical excision alone, consistent with a WHO grade I neoplasm. We report a case of an AG in the right frontal lobe of a 57-year-old female, emphasizing the cytologic and immunohistochemical features, including confirmation and comparison with the surgical specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first report detailing the cytology of AG, including demonstration of important diagnostic findings that were only appreciated in the cytologic preparations and not in the smears or the surgical specimen. We also compare and contrast AG to other entities in the differential diagnosis and include a review of the literature.

[Effects of heroin and purine nucleotide compensation on neutral alpha-glucosidase in rat epididymides]. To study the changes of neutral alpha-glucoside activity in the epididymis of heroin-dependent and heroin-withdrawal rats, and to investigate the effects of intervention with purine nucleotide (AMP and GMP). Eighty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 groups of equal number, control, nucleotide, heroin, heroin + nucleotide, 3 d withdrawal, 9 d withdrawal, 3 d nucleotide (nucleotide administrated for 3 days after heroin withdrawal) and 9 d nucleotide (nucleotide administrated for 9 days after heroin withdrawal). Neutral alpha-glucosidase activity in the epididymis was detected in each group of rats. Compared with the control group, neutral alpha-glucoside activity was markedly decreased in the heroin group (P < 0.05), and also in the 3 d and 9 d withdrawal groups, although with no significant differences (P > 0.05). Heroin reduces neutral alpha-glucoside activity in the epididymis of rats, and this effect may continue for some time after drug withdrawal, while purine nucleotide can keep neutral alpha-glucosidase activity in a relatively stable state.

Biologic principles of immunotherapy for malignant gliomas. The most common primary brain neoplasm is glioblastoma multiforme, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Despite the recommended treatment regimen of aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, the median survival remains approximately only 14 months. Due to these minimal improvements in survival of patients despite recent advances in conventional treatments, new modalities such as immunotherapy are being investigated and studied. A hurdle to developing effective immunotherapy is the immunosuppressive characteristics that are the hallmark of malignant gliomas. Effective therapeutic strategies will require overcoming these mechanisms, by augmenting tumor antigen presentation, perhaps in a setting isolated from the tumor microenvironment. The heterogeneity of potential glioma antigens warrants potential targeting of multiple tumor-specific antigens, and discovery and investigation of additional antigens. This article describes the current strategies and principles of immunotherapy for malignant gliomas.


Hepatoprotective and anticlastogenic effects of ethanol extract of Irvingia gabonensis (IG) leaves in sodium arsenite-induced toxicity in male Wistar rats.

Device-scale perpendicular alignment of colloidal nanorods. The self-assembly of nanocrystals enables new classes of materials whose properties are controlled by the periodicities of the assembly, as well as by the size, shape, and composition of the nanocrystals. While self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles has advanced significantly in the past decade, assembly of rod-shaped nanocrystals has seen limited progress due to the requirement of orientational order. Here, the parameters relevant to self-assembly are systematically quantified using a combination of diffraction and theoretical modeling; these highlight the importance of kinetics on orientational order. Through drying-mediated self-assembly, we achieve unprecedented control over orientational order (up to 96% vertically oriented rods on 1 cm(2) areas) on a wide range of substrates (ITO, PEDOT:PSS, Si(3)N(4)). This opens new avenues for nanocrystal-based devices competitive with thin film devices, as problems of granularity can be tackled through crystallographic orientational control over macroscopic areas.

ELMOD2, a candidate gene for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, regulates antiviral responses. Viral infections and abnormal host response are thought to cause epithelial injury in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To understand IPF pathogenesis, we have used overexpression cell models and expression microarrays to discover genes networked with ELMO domain containing 2 (ELMOD2) gene genetically implicated in IPF. The identified pathways were confirmed in vitro, and ELMOD2 protein expression was characterized in tissue samples. Here 303 genes were significantly altered after ELMOD2 transfection of human alveolar epithelial A549 cell line. The enriched pathways were interferon induction, viral response, antigen processing and presentation, and I-/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. ELMOD2 showed immunoreactivity in macrophages and type II alveolar epithelial cells in normal human lung. In A549 cells, forced expression of ELMOD2 increased type I and type III interferon mRNA expression, and ELMOD2-specific siRNA molecules inhibited expression of these antiviral cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor three (TLR3) activation. In human macrophages silencing of ELMOD2 inhibited TLR3-dependent expression of type I and type III interferon genes. Influenza A virus infection decreased ELMOD2 mRNA expression in A549 cells and macrophages suggesting negative regulation in viral infections. In summary, our results show that TLR3 pathway is dependent on ELMOD2.-Pulkkinen, V., Bruce, S., Rintahaka, J., Hodgson, U., Laitinen, T., Alenius, H., Kinnula, V. L., Myllärniemi, M., Matikainen, S., Kere, J. ELMOD2, a candidate gene for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, regulates antiviral responses.

Aliphatic hyperbranched polyester: a new building block in the construction of multifunctional nanoparticles and nanocomposites. Herein we report the design and synthesis of multifunctional hyperbranched polyester-based nanoparticles and nanocomposites with properties ranging from magnetic, fluorescence, antioxidant and X-ray contrast. The fabrication of these nanostructures was achieved using a novel aliphatic and biodegradable hyperbranched polyester (HBPE) synthesized from readily available diethyl malonate. The polymer's globular structure with functional surface carboxylic groups and hydrophobic cavities residing in the polymer's interior allows for the formation of multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles, which are able to encapsulate a diversity of hydrophobic cargos. Via simple surface chemistry modifications, the surface carboxylic acid groups were modified to yield nanoparticles with a variety of surface functionalizations, such as amino, azide and propargyl groups, which mediated the conjugation of small molecules. This capability achieved the engineering of the HBPE nanoparticle surface for specific cell internalization studies and the formation of nanoparticle assemblies for the creation of novel nanocomposites that retained, and in some cases enhanced, the properties of the parental nanoparticle building blocks. Considering these results, the HBPE polymer, nanoparticles and composites should be ideal for biomedical, pharmaceutical, nanophotonics applications.


Automated control of inspired oxygen in ventilated preterm infants: crossover physiological study.

Timeliness of Diagnosing Lung Cancer: Number of Procedures and Time Needed to Establish Diagnosis: Being Right the First Time. To study number of procedures and time to diagnose lung cancer and factors affecting the timeliness of clinching this diagnosis. Retrospective cohort study of lung cancer patients who consecutively underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy in 1 year (October 2013 to September 2014). Out of 101 patients diagnosed with lung cancer from bronchoscopy, average time interval between first abnormal computed tomogram (CT) scan-to-1st procedure, 1st procedure-to-diagnosis, and 1st abnormal CT scan-to-diagnosis was 16 ± 26, 11 ± 19, and 27 ± 33 days, respectively. These intervals were significantly longer in those requiring repeat procedures. Multivariate analysis revealed inconclusive 1st procedure to be the predictor of prolonged (>30 days) CT scan to diagnosis time (P = 0.04). Twenty-nine patients (28.7%) required repeat procedures (n = 63). Reasons behind repeating the procedures were inadequate procedure (n = 14), inaccessibility of lesion (n = 9), inappropriate procedure (n = 5), mutation analysis (n = 2), and others (n = 2). Fifty had visible endo-bronchial lesion, 20 had positive bronchus sign, and 83 had enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph-nodes or central masses adjacent to the airways. Fewer procedures, and shorter procedure to diagnosis time, were observed in those undergoing convex probe endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) (P = 0.04). Most patients exhibit enlarged mediastinal lymph node or mass adjacent to the central airway accessible by convex probe EBUS-TBNA. Hence, combining it with conventional bronchoscopic techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage, brush, and forceps biopsy increases detection rate, and reduces number of procedures and time to establish diagnosis. This may translate into cost and resource savings, timeliness of diagnosis, greater patient satisfaction, and conceivably better outcomes.

Alterations in gene expression and sensitivity to genotoxic stress following HdmX or Hdm2 knockdown in human tumor cells harboring wild-type p53.

Accelerating X-ray fluorescence computed tomography. This paper presents new approaches to accelerating X-ray fluorescence tomography (XFCT) that are grounded in both novel image acquisition strategies that improve the quality of the data acquired and in image reconstruction strategies that reduce the amount of data acquired. First, we introduce an alternative imaging scheme that uses an emission tomography (ET) system to collect the fluorescence photons representing an entire 2D slice or volumetric projection of the object at one time. Preliminary results indicate that this could achieve a ten to hundredfold improvement in imaging speed. Secondly, novel image reconstruction algorithms are introduced that allow for improved quantitative accuracy as well as for imaging of regions of interest, which will lead to further reduction in data-acquisition time.


Traumatic bilateral carotid artery dissection following severe blunt trauma: a case report on the difficulties in diagnosis and therapy of an often overlooked life-threatening injury.

Cryptorchidism and its long-term complications. Cryptorchidism is the most frequent defect of the male urogenital tract at birth. It represents a risk factor for primitive testiculopathy associated with long-term complications (infertility, testicular neoplasia, and hormonal changes). An only consensus exists: "children with bilateral cryptorchidism who are not treated in early age are certainly set to become infertile". The majority of Authors agrees that the cryptorchid testicle will be in for structural and functional alterations and the rate of infertility is inversely proportional to the age at the time of orchidopexy. Cryptorchidism causes secretory primitive testicular pathology responsible for infertility. It is correlated to a non-specific severe histopathological pattern that can be useful to predict future infertility at the moment of orchidopexy. Also cryptorchidism represents the major risk factor associated with germ cell testicular neoplasia (5-10 times more probably than a normal testicle) due to genetic, hormonal, environmental factors.

Lippia origanoides chemotype differentiation based on essential oil GC-MS and principal component analysis. Chromatographic (GC/flame ionization detection, GC/MS) and statistical analyses were applied to the study of essential oils and extracts obtained from flowers, leaves, and stems of Lippia origanoides plants, growing wild in different Colombian regions. Retention indices, mass spectra, and standard substances were used in the identification of 139 substances detected in these essential oils and extracts. Principal component analysis allowed L. origanoides classification into three chemotypes, characterized according to their essential oil major components. Alpha- and beta-phellandrenes, p-cymene, and limonene distinguished chemotype A; carvacrol and thymol were the distinctive major components of chemotypes B and C, respectively. Pinocembrin (5,7-dihydroxyflavanone) was found in L. origanoides chemotype A supercritical fluid (CO(2)) extract at a concentration of 0.83+/-0.03 mg/g of dry plant material, which makes this plant an interesting source of an important bioactive flavanone with diverse potential applications in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical products.

One decade of self exclusion: Missouri casino self-excluders four to ten years after enrollment. For more than a decade, casinos around the world have offered self-exclusion programs (SEPs) to gamblers seeking help with their gambling behavior. Despite the proliferation of SEPs, little is known about the long-term outcomes for gamblers who utilize these programs. The current study assessed the experiences of a sample (N = 113) of Missouri self-excluders (SEs) for as long as 10 years after their initial enrollment in the Missouri Voluntary Exclusion Program (MVEP). Most SEs had positive experiences with MVEP and reduced their gambling and gambling problems after enrollment. However, 50% of SEs who attempted to trespass at Missouri casinos after enrollment were able to, indicating that the benefit of MVEP was attributable more to the act of enrollment than enforcement. SEs who engaged in complementary treatment or self-help groups had more positive outcomes than those who did not, suggesting that SEPs ought to encourage and provide information about additional support and treatment options to participants.

Discrete logic modelling as a means to link protein signalling networks with functional analysis of mammalian signal transduction. Large-scale protein signalling networks are useful for exploring complex biochemical pathways but do not reveal how pathways respond to specific stimuli. Such specificity is critical for understanding disease and designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logical models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 82 proteins covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically increased predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number of interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear to be functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of model to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. Our approach, therefore, represents a means to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks.

Quality of life in patients related to gender differences before and after coronary artery bypass surgery. The different aspects of quality of life (QOL) in patients of different sex structure have been examined as well as the presumption that sex structure could be a predictor of QOL changes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study included 243 consecutive patients who underwent an elective CABG. The QOL analysis was performed by using structured interviews with the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire part 1. Compared to men, women had worse preoperative QOL (in all sections except the section of sleep) and worse postoperative QOL (in all sections). Six months after CABG the QOL statistically improved in men and in women. Multivariate analysis showed that being female was an independent predictor of QOL worsening in section of pain [P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=3.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-8.88]. Compared to men, women have worse preoperative and postoperative QOL. Female sex was an independent predictor of QOL worsening six months after CABG.

Circuit techniques for wireless brain interfaces. Efficient, miniaturized wireless recording is critical for both existing and emerging health-monitoring applications. One important example of this is in the brain interface community, where new technologies allow improved observation and understanding of brain functions. This, in turn, drives the need for ever smaller, lower power, and higher performance circuitry for chronic recording. This paper describes circuit and system techniques for low power wireless brain interfaces. Active and passive architectures are described and compared, and measured in-vivo data from both are presented.

The FAS -670A>G polymorphism influences susceptibility to systemic sclerosis phenotypes. To investigate the possible role of the FAS -670A>G functional polymorphism in the genetic predisposition to systemic sclerosis (SSc) susceptibility or clinical phenotype. A total of 2,900 SSc patients and 3,186 healthy controls were included in this study. We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of the FAS -670A>G polymorphism in 9 distinct ethnic cohorts, including 6 cohorts of European ancestry (a Spanish cohort of 228 SSc patients and 265 controls, a Dutch cohort of 203 SSc patients and 277 controls, a German cohort of 313 SSc patients and 247 controls, an Italian cohort of 323 SSc cases and 89 controls, a British cohort of 269 SSc patients, and a Swedish cohort of 182 patients) and 3 distinct ethnic cohorts from the US (a cohort of 1,047 white patients and 692 controls, a cohort of 159 Hispanic patients and 137 controls, and a cohort of 176 black SSc patients and 194 controls). Genotyping was performed using a TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay. In the British, Italian, and American white cohorts we observed an association of the FAS -670G allele with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) (odds ratios [ORs] 1.25, 1.43, and 1.18, respectively). A meta-analysis comprising all 9 cohorts revealed an association of both the FAS -670G allele (OR 1.10) and the FAS -670GG genotype (OR 1.13) with the lcSSc phenotype. In a meta-analysis including only white subjects, both the FAS -670G allele and the FAS -670GG genotype remained associated with lcSSc (allele OR 1.12; genotype OR 1.16). In addition, a recessive model of the -670GG genotype exhibited a strong association with SSc, lcSSc, and anticentromere antibody-positive lcSSc (OR 1.23, OR 1.33, and OR 1.45, respectively). Our data show that the FAS -670A>G polymorphism plays a role in lcSSc susceptibility. A similar trend has been observed in other autoimmune diseases.

Basonuclin-2 requirements for zebrafish adult pigment pattern development and female fertility. Relatively little is known about the generation of adult form. One complex adult trait that is particularly amenable to genetic and experimental analysis is the zebrafish pigment pattern, which undergoes extensive remodeling during post-embryonic development to form adult stripes. These stripes result from the arrangement of three classes of neural crest-derived pigment cells, or chromatophores: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. Here, we analyze the zebrafish bonaparte mutant, which has a normal early pigment pattern but exhibits a severe disruption to the adult stripe pattern. We show that the bonaparte mutant phenotype arises from mutations in basonuclin-2 (bnc2), encoding a highly conserved, nuclear-localized zinc finger protein of unknown function. We show that bnc2 acts non-autonomously to the melanophore lineage and is expressed by hypodermal cells adjacent to chromatophores during adult pigment pattern formation. In bonaparte (bnc2) mutants, all three types of chromatophores differentiate but then are lost by extrusion through the skin. We further show that while bnc2 promotes the development of two genetically distinct populations of melanophores in the body stripes, chromatophores of the fins and scales remain unaffected in bonaparte mutants, though a requirement of fin chromatophores for bnc2 is revealed in the absence of kit and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor activity. Finally, we find that bonaparte (bnc2) mutants exhibit dysmorphic ovaries correlating with infertility and bnc2 is expressed in somatic ovarian cells, whereas the related gene, bnc1, is expressed within oocytes; and we find that both bnc2 and bnc1 are expressed abundantly within the central nervous system. These findings identify bnc2 as an important mediator of adult pigment pattern formation and identify bonaparte mutants as an animal model for dissecting bnc2 functions.

Functional outcome of indocyanine green-assisted macular surgery: 7-year follow-up. To evaluate the long-term functional results after surgery for macular pucker and macular holes with indocyanine green (ICG) staining of the internal limiting membrane. Long-term functional and anatomical outcomes of 16 eyes of 16 patients were evaluated for 7.3 years after ICG-assisted macular surgery. Examinations performed included best-corrected visual acuity, Goldmann perimetry, Arden color contrast test, optical coherence tomography, and fundus photography. Ten eyes had undergone surgery for macular holes, and 6 eyes had been treated for macular pucker. Indocyanine green with a concentration of 0.05% and an osmolarity of 275 mOsm had been used to stain the internal limiting membrane. Mean follow-up time was 7.3 years. Eighty-eight percent (14) of the eyes had undergone cataract surgery either in a combined intervention primarily (n = 3) or in the years after the ICG-assisted macular surgery (n = 11). One patient was still phakic with a pronounced cataract at last follow-up. Over all patients, best-corrected visual acuity did not increase significantly from 20/200 (median) before macular surgery to the present 20/70 (median). Large visual field defects (VFDs) were found in 10 of 16 patients after internal limiting membrane staining using ICG. In 8 of these 10 eyes, the VFDs had been diagnosed immediately after vitrectomy and remained unchanged throughout the period of review. In 2 eyes, a VFD was noted at the last follow-up visit despite an unremarkable Goldmann perimetry performed at follow-up visits after 3 months and 6 months. Pathologic color testing was found in 15 of 16 patients when comparing the operated and the fellow eye. A nonglaucomatous optic nerve atrophy was found in 11 of 16 eyes. The optical coherence tomography revealed macular hole closure in all 10 patients. Indocyanine green-assisted macular surgery might lead to optic nerve atrophy in the long-term and persistent VFDs. In addition, new VFDs may occur in the postoperative course. An affection of color vision also underlines the potential impact of ICG on visual function. A long-term observation of patients after ICG-assisted vitrectomy seems mandatory to reliably detect functional adverse events.

Acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume independently of coronary flow reserve. Vascular endothelium is covered with an extensive mesh of glycocalyx constituents, which acts like an effective barrier up to several micrometers thick that shields the luminal surface of the vasculature from direct exposure to flowing blood. Many studies report that various enzymatic and pharmaceutical challenges are able to increase glycocalyx porosity, resulting in farther permeation of plasma macromolecules and greater access of red blood cells into glycocalyx domain. Attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties therefore potentially increases the amount of blood that effectively occupies available microvascular volume. We tested in the present study whether attenuation of coronary glycocalyx barrier properties actually increases coronary blood volume and whether such changes would be noticeable during measurements of coronary flow reserve using adenosine. In anesthetized goats (n = 6) with cannulated left main coronary artery that were perfused under controlled pressure, coronary blood volume was measured via the indicator-dilution technique using high-molecular-weight (2,000 kDa) dextrans as plasma tracer and labeled red blood cells as red blood cell tracer. Coronary blood volume was determined at baseline and during intracoronary infusion of adenosine causing maximal vasodilation (0.2-0.6 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) before and after intracoronary hyaluronidase treatment (170,000 units) of the glycocalyx. With an intact glycocalyx, coronary blood volume was 18.9 +/- 1.1 ml/100 g heart tissue at baseline, which increased to 26.3 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g after hyaluronidase treatment of the coronary glycocalyx. Maximal vasodilation by administration of adenosine further increased coronary blood volume to 33.9 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g, a value not different from the maximal coronary blood volume of 33.2 +/- 5.3 ml/100 g obtained by administration of adenosine in the absence of hyaluronidase treatment. Adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance were not affected by hyaluronidase treatment. We conclude that acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume by approximately 40%, which is of similar magnitude as additional changes in coronary blood volume during subsequent maximal vasodilation with adenosine. Furthermore, maximal coronary blood volume following administration of adenosine was similar with and without prior hyaluronidase degradation of the glycocalyx, suggesting that adenosine and hyaluronidase potentially increase glycocalyx porosity to a similar extent. Hyaluronidase-mediated changes in coronary blood volume did not affect baseline and adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance, demonstrating that measurements of coronary flow reserve are insufficient to detect impairment of coronary blood volume recruitment in conditions of damaged glycocalyx.

Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression Analyses by RNA Sequencing Reveal Local High Nitrate-Triggered Lateral Root Initiation in Shoot-Borne Roots of Maize by Modulating Auxin-Related Cell Cycle Regulation. Plants have evolved a unique plasticity of their root system architecture to flexibly exploit heterogeneously distributed mineral elements from soil. Local high concentrations of nitrate trigger lateral root initiation in adult shoot-borne roots of maize (Zea mays) by increasing the frequency of early divisions of phloem pole pericycle cells. Gene expression profiling revealed that, within 12 h of local high nitrate induction, cell cycle activators (cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin B) were up-regulated, whereas repressors (Kip-related proteins) were down-regulated in the pericycle of shoot-borne roots. In parallel, a ubiquitin protein ligase S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein1-cullin-F-box protein(S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein 2B)-related proteasome pathway participated in cell cycle control. The division of pericycle cells was preceded by increased levels of free indole-3-acetic acid in the stele, resulting in DR5-red fluorescent protein-marked auxin response maxima at the phloem poles. Moreover, laser-capture microdissection-based gene expression analyses indicated that, at the same time, a significant local high nitrate induction of the monocot-specific PIN-FORMED9 gene in phloem pole cells modulated auxin efflux to pericycle cells. Time-dependent gene expression analysis further indicated that local high nitrate availability resulted in PIN-FORMED9-mediated auxin efflux and subsequent cell cycle activation, which culminated in the initiation of lateral root primordia. This study provides unique insights into how adult maize roots translate information on heterogeneous nutrient availability into targeted root developmental responses. 

Low-dose fluticasone propionate with and without salmeterol in steroid-naïve patients with mild, uncontrolled asthma. The role of combination ICS/LABA as initial controller therapy in mild, persistent asthma is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of initial controller therapy with fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 microg twice daily to the efficacy of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (FSC) 100/50 microg twice daily in patients with persistent asthma symptoms while using as-needed SABA alone. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 45 general practice and 15 specialist centers. A total of 526 adult patients were randomized to receive FP or FSC for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) from baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoints included symptom- and rescue-free days; asthma exacerbation rate; asthma-related health-care utilization; and the onset of effect. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events. Mean morning PEF was significantly greater in the FSC versus the FP group (P<0.001); this greater effect was evident as early as the first week of treatment (P<0.001). The percentages of symptom-free days and rescue-free days in the FSC group were 7.7% (P=0.009) and 8.4% (P=0.001) higher than the FP group, respectively. Trends toward lower exacerbation-related health care-utilization for FSC versus FP were not statistically significant and exacerbation rates were not significantly different. The incidence of adverse events was low with both treatments. :Treatment with FSC was a more effective initial controller therapy than FP monotherapy in ICS-naïve patients who had uncontrolled asthma while using as-needed SABA alone.

[The effect of high-fat diet and catch-up growth on gastric emptying and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration in rats]. To investigate the effect of high-fat diet and catch-up growth on gastric emptying and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats. Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups, i. e. normal control group (NC group), refed with normal diet group (RN group), high fat diet group (HF group) and refed with high fat diet group (RH group). The weight and diet of rats were recorded. At the onset of refeeding (4 weeks ) and after 2 or 4 weeks of refeeding (6 or 8 weeks), animals were sacrificed and then gastric emptying study test and the assessment of plasma GLP-1 concentration were carried out. Compared with NC group, rats in HF group possessed accelerated gastric emptying rate (95.61% vs 96.16%, 94.24% vs 96.11%, 93.08% vs 95.50%) and increased GLP-1 concentration (12.02 pmol/L vs 16.27 pmol/L, 10.77 pmol/L vs 13.93 pmol/L, 9.47 pmol/L vs 11.53 pmol/L) at 4, 6, 8 weeks respectively. Similarly, compared with NC group, RN group possessed slowed gastric emptying rate (95.61% vs 87.60%) and decreased GLP-1 concentration (12.02 pmol/L vs 9.69 pmol/L) at 4 weeks, but accelerated gastric emptying rate (94.24% vs 96.11%, 93.08% vs 94.52%) and increased GLP-1 concentration (10.77 pmol/L vs 12.57 pmol/L, 9.47 pmol/L vs 9.80 pmol/L) at 6 and 8 weeks respectively. Compared with HF group, RH group obtained slowed gastric emptying rate (96.16% vs 90.70%) and decreased GLP-1 concentration (16.27 pmol/L vs 9.69 pmol/L) at 4 weeks, but accelerated gastric emptying rate(96.11% vs 98.02%) and slightly lower GLP-1 concentration (13.93 pmol/L vs 13.44 pmol/L) at 6 weeks, and further slowed gastric emptying rate (96.50% vs 92.57%) and lower GLP-1 concentration (11.53 pmol/L vs 10.00 pmol/L). Although both high-fat diet and catch-up growth affect the gastrointestinal function, the latter has a greater impact, which could account for some pathophysiological changes caused by catch-up growth.


Liquid versus foam sclerotherapy.

An integrated expression phenotype mapping approach defines common variants in LEP, ALOX15 and CAPNS1 associated with induction of IL-6. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important modulator of inflammation and immunity whose dysregulation is associated with a number of disease states. There is evidence of significant heritability in inter-individual variation in IL6 gene expression but the genetic variants responsible for this remain to be defined. We adopted a combined approach of mapping protein and expression quantitative trait loci in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing for approximately 2000 loci implicated in cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory syndromes to show that common SNP markers and haplotypes of LEP (encoding leptin) associate with a 1.7- to 2-fold higher level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 expression. We subsequently demonstrate that basal leptin expression significantly correlates with LPS-induced IL-6 expression and that the same variants at LEP which associate with IL-6 expression are also major determinants of leptin expression in these cells. We find that variation involving two other genomic regions, CAPNS1 (encoding calpain small subunit 1) and ALOX15 (encoding arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase), show significant association with IL-6 expression. Although this may be a subset of all such trans-acting effects, we find that the same ALOX15 variants are associated with induced expression of tumour necrosis factor and IL-1beta consistent with a broader role in acute inflammation for ALOX15. This study provides evidence of novel genetic determinants of IL-6 production with implications for understanding susceptibility to inflammatory disease processes and insight into cross talk between metabolic and inflammatory pathways. It also provides proof of concept for use of an integrated expression phenotype mapping approach.

[Prevalence of asthma symptoms and risk factors among adolescents in Tubarão and Capivari de Baixo, Santa Catarina State, Brazil]. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and severity of asthma symptoms and to investigate the association between asthma symptoms and personal, geographic, and socioeconomic variables in 13-14-year-old schoolchildren enrolled in the 7th and 8th grades in Tubarão and Capivari de Baixo, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study using the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) written questionnaire, applied to 1,870 adolescents enrolled in 42 schools in the two cities, from March to May 2005. Prevalence of current asthma (defined as wheezing in the previous 12 months) was 11.8%, and there was a 7.8% lifetime prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma. Prevalence of wheezing that interrupted sleep (one or more nights per week) was 2.1%; 8.1% had 1-3 wheezing attacks per year; and 3.7% had wheezing that disturbed their speech. According to multivariate analysis, female gender, family history, parental asthma, rental housing, and smoking inside the home were risk factors for current asthma. Prevalence and severity of current asthma were less than in other Brazilian studies.

Critical involvement of Rho GTPase activity in the efficient transplantation of neural stem cells into the injured spinal cord. Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells is a promising approach toward functional restoration of the damaged neural tissue, but the injured spinal cord has been shown to be an adverse environment for the survival, migration, and differentiation of the donor cells. To improve the efficiency of cell replacement therapy, cell autonomous factors in the donor cells should be optimized. In light of recent findings that Rho family GTPases regulate stem cell functions, genetic manipulation of Rho GTPases can potentially control phenotypes of transplanted cells. Therefore we expressed mutant forms of Rho GTPases, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, in the neural stem/progenitor cells and examined their survival and migration after transplantation. Manipulation of the individual Rho GTPases showed differential effects on survival, with little variation in their migratory route and predominant differentiation into the oligodendroglial lineage. Combined suppression of both Rac and Rho activity had a prominent effect on promoting survival, consistent with its highly protective effect on drug-induced apoptosis in culture. Manipulation of Rac and Rho activities fully rescued suppression of cell survival induced by the spinal cord injury. Our results indicate that precise regulation of cell autonomous factors within the donor cells can ameliorate the detrimental environment created by the injury.


Single-Stranded DNA Aptamers against Pathogens and Toxins: Identification and Biosensing Applications.

Evaluating Individual Training Adaptation With Smartphone-Derived Heart Rate Variability in a Collegiate Female Soccer Team. Monitoring individual responses throughout training may provide insight to coaches regarding how athletes are coping to the current program. It is unclear if the evolution of heart rate variability (HRV) throughout training in team-sport athletes can be useful in providing early indications of individual adaptation. This study evaluated relationships between changes in resting cardiac autonomic markers derived from a novel smartphone device within the first 3 weeks of a 5-week conditioning program and the eventual change in intermittent running performance at week 5 among 12 collegiate female soccer players. Change variables from weeks 1 to 3 of the weekly mean and weekly coefficient of variation for resting heart rate ([INCREMENT]RHRmean and [INCREMENT]RHRcv, respectively) and log-transformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals multiplied by 20 ([INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDmean and [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDcv, respectively) were compared with changes in Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1 performance ([INCREMENT]Yo-Yo). A very large and significant correlation was found between [INCREMENT]Yo-Yo and [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDcv (r = -0.74; p = <0.01) and a large nonsignificant correlation was found with [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDmean (r = 0.50; p = 0.096). This study suggests that a decrease in Ln rMSSDcv within the first 3 weeks of training is a favorable response, indicative of positive adaptation. Collecting daily HRV data with a smartphone application using ultrashort HRV measures seems useful for athlete monitoring.

Viral oncolysis that targets Raf-1 signaling control of nuclear transport. The central role of Raf protein kinase isoforms in human cancer demands specific anti-Raf therapeutic inhibitors. Parvoviruses are currently used in experimental cancer therapy due to their natural oncotropism and lytic life cycle. In searching for mechanisms underlying parvovirus oncolysis, we found that trimers of the major structural protein (VP) of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM), which have to be imported into the nucleus for capsid assembly, undergo phosphorylation by the Raf-1 kinase. Purified Raf-1 phosphorylated the capsid subunits in vitro to the two-dimensional pattern found in natural MVM infections. VP trimers isolated from mammalian cells translocated into the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized human cells. In contrast, VP trimers isolated from insect cells, which are devoid of Raf-1, were neither phosphorylated nor imported into the mammalian nucleus. However, the coexpression of a constitutively active Raf-1 kinase in insect cells restored VP trimer phosphorylation and nuclear transport competence. In MVM-infected normal and transformed cells, Raf-1 inhibition resulted in cytoplasmic retention of capsid proteins, preventing their nuclear assembly and progeny virus maturation. The level of Raf-1 activity in cancer cells was consistent with the extent of VP specific phosphorylation and with the permissiveness to MVM infection. Thus, Raf-1 control of nuclear translocation of MVM capsid assembly intermediates provides a novel target for viral oncolysis. MVM may reinforce specific therapies against frequent human cancers with deregulated Raf signaling.

Enrolment of young adolescents in a microbicide acceptability study. Clinical trials of microbicides should include adolescent participants. There may be unique challenges including obtaining informed consent, meeting eligibility criteria and adherence to study demands. We report on our experience enrolling young adolescents in a microbicide surrogate acceptability study and the implication of our experience for other types of clinical trials. Adolescent females were enrolled in a microbicide surrogate acceptability study for 6 months which required parental consent. They were asked to use the product every time they had coitus. They had face-to-face interviews at intake, 3 and 6 months, and completed weekly phone diaries. Of the 208 enrolled, 95 participants were between 14 and 17 years. Ten were pregnant at intake, and 15 did not have sex during the study. Of the remaining 70 adolescents, 46 (66%) used the product at least once during the 6-month period, and all but seven attended a face-to-face interview after intake. It will be possible to include young adolescents in clinical studies, even if parental consent is required. However, there will be challenges, and researchers need to anticipate those challenges and reduce barriers to enrolling young adolescents.

[Quantitative Approach to Melamine Detection in Egg White with Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy]. Due to the harmfulness of melamine to human, the quantitative detection of melamine in egg is very necessary. In the present study, the surface enhanced Raman spectra technology combined with chemometric analysis method was used to conduct melamine quantitative detection in egg white. Firstly, the melamine egg sample could be got by the method of artificial feeding hens usingdifferent feeding formulation. Then the surface enhanced Raman spectra of egg white was determined using portable Raman spectroscopy (Opto Trace RamTracer-200) and Raman enhancement reagents, and the melamine content within the white eggs was measured with gas chromatography mass spectrometry technology. The software of Raman Analyzer was used for baseline correction of Raman spectra. The correlation coefficient method was used to choose 320 spectral variables from the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy as input variables to establish partial least squares quantitative calibration model . And the peaks-decomposition method was used to establish peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model. Both models selected 90 and 44 samples respectively as calibration sets and validation sets during model establishment, and both models achieved good prediction effect. The determination coefficient between predicted values of partial least squares quantitative calibration model and measured values of gas chromatography mass spectrometry was 0.856, and root mean square error of prediction was 1.547. The determination coefficient was 0.947 and RMSEP was 0.893 for the peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model. This study demonstrated that the method can effectively quantitatively detect melamine in eggs. Testing a sample only takes 15 minutes, which can provide a new way for the melamine egg detection.


Is a nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis using the modified Kakita method a safe procedure?

Metabolic co-dependence gives rise to collective oscillations within biofilms. Cells that reside within a community can cooperate and also compete with each other for resources. It remains unclear how these opposing interactions are resolved at the population level. Here we investigate such an internal conflict within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to control biofilm growth. 

Microarray on digital versatile disc for identification and genotyping of Salmonella and Campylobacter in meat products. Highly portable, cost-effective, and rapid-response devices are required for the subtyping of the most frequent food-borne bacteria; thereby the sample rejection strategies and hygienization techniques along the food chain can be tailor-designed. Here, a novel biosensor is presented for the generic detection of Salmonella and Campylobacter and the discrimination between their most prevalent serovars (Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium) and species (Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli), respectively. The method is based on DNA microarray developed on a standard digital versatile disc (DVD) as support for a hybridization assay and a DVD driver as scanner. This approach was found to be highly sensitive (detection limit down to 0.2 pg of genomic DNA), reproducible (relative standard deviation 4-19 %), and high working capacity (20 samples per disc). The inclusivity and exclusivity assays indicated that designed oligonucleotides (primers and probes) were able to discriminate targeted pathogens from other Salmonella serovars, Campylobacter species, or common food-borne pathogens potentially present in the indigenous microflora. One hundred isolates from meat samples, collected in a poultry factory, were analyzed by the DVD microarraying and fluorescent real-time PCR. An excellent correlation was observed for both generic and specific detection (relative sensitivity 93-99 % and relative specificity 93-100 %). Therefore, the developed assay has been shown to be a reliable tool to be used in routine food safety analysis, especially in settings with limited infrastructure due to the excellent efficiency-cost ratio of compact disc technology.

Getting heavier, younger: trajectories of obesity over the life course.

Culture of bovine embryos in intermediate host oviducts with emphasis on the isolated mouse oviduct. The oviduct provides the optimal environment for the transport of sperm and oocyte at the earliest stages of mammalian embryo development. During the early postfertilization period, several major developmental events occur in the embryo including (i) the first cleavage division, (ii) activation of the embryonic genome, (iii) compaction of the morula, and (iv) formation of the blastocyst. Most of these events are initiated in the oviduct. The absence of assistance from the oviduct may compromise the developmental ability of the cattle embryo under in vitro culture conditions. The oviducts of several mammalian species, including rabbits, cow, sheep (in situ), and mice (organ culture), can sustain early bovine embryos and yield blastocysts of better quality compared with those of culture conditions in vitro, leading to normal pregnancy rates in recipient animals. This review focuses on the use of oviducts in vitro or in vivo as intermediate hosts for postfertilization culture environment of bovine in vitro-produced zygotes with emphasis on the mouse model.

Paliperidone palmitate maintenance treatment in delaying the time-to-relapse in patients with schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We assessed efficacy and tolerability of the injectable atypical antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate in delaying time-to-relapse in adults with schizophrenia. Eligible patients (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total score < 120) were transitioned from previous antipsychotics to paliperidone palmitate during a 9-week, open-label phase. Patients received the first 2 intramuscular injections of paliperidone palmitate (50mg eq) one-week apart, then subsequent injections (25, 50, or 100mg eq, flexibly-dosed), once-monthly. Stable patients (PANSS total score < or = 75) continued into the 24-week maintenance phase. At maintenance phase endpoint, stabilized patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either continue paliperidone palmitate (at stabilized dose) or begin placebo in the variable-duration, double-blind phase. The preplanned interim analysis (conducted after 68 relapse events) included 312 patients: mean age = 40 years, 55% men, 66% white, and mean transition baseline PANSS total score (SD): placebo, 69.5 (16.89); paliperidone palmitate, 69.3 (17.39). Time-to-relapse (primary endpoint) favored paliperidone palmitate (p<0.0001, log-rank test) at interim and final analysis (n=408). The hazard ratio (placebo/paliperidone palmitate) at the final analysis was 3.60 (95% CI: 2.45, 5.28). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates (final analysis set) were: 67% for transition and maintenance phases, and 45% (placebo) and 44% (paliperidone palmitate) for the double-blind phase. Across phases, the incidence of glucose-related adverse events was low (< or = 4%), while mean weight increased by 1.9 kg for paliperidone palmitate and remained unchanged for placebo patients. Injection site tolerability was comparable between groups. Paliperidone palmitate significantly delayed time-to-relapse compared with placebo and presented no new safety signals.

Laser Raman and ac impedance spectroscopic studies of PVA: NH4NO3 polymer electrolyte. Ion conducting polymer electrolyte PVA:NH(4)NO(3) has been prepared by solution casting technique and characterized using XRD, Raman and ac impedance spectroscopic analyses. The amorphous nature of the polymer films has been confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. An insight into the deconvoluted Raman peaks of upsilon(1) vibration of NO(3)(-) anion for the polymer electrolyte reveals the dominancy of ion aggregates at higher NH(4)NO(3) concentration. From the ac impedance studies, the highest ion conductivity at 303 K has been found to be 7.5x10(-3)Scm(-1) for 80PVA:20NH(4)NO(3). The conductivity of the polymer electrolytes has been found to depend on the degree of dissociation of the salt in the host polymer matrix. The combination of the above-mentioned analyses has proven worth while and in fact necessary in order to achieve better understanding of these complex systems.


Efficient algorithm development of CIS speech processing strategy for cochlear implants.

On clustering fMRI using Potts and mixture regression models. In this paper, we propose a model based clustering method for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to detect the functional connectivity network. The Potts model, which represents spatial interactions of neighboring voxels, is introduced to integrate the temporal mixture regression modeling into one single unified model. The estimation of the parameters is achieved through a restoration maximization (RM) algorithm for computation efficiency and accuracy. Additional features of our method include: the optimal number of clusters can be automatically determined; global trends and informative paradigms of the data are extracted by a dimension reduction algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a statistical significance test. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can lead to robust and sensitive detection of functional networks.

Management of alcohol recurrence before and after liver transplantation. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and can lead to steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary effective treatment for patients with ALD is total alcohol abstinence, although sometimes impossible, liver transplant (LT) is the gold standard treatment for end-stage ALD, which represents the second most common diagnosis among patients undergoing this procedure. Liver transplant in ALD has better results than those for other etiologies. The alcohol consumption recidivism after LT is frequent and 10% to 15% of these resume heavy drinking with consequences to the new liver. The "6-month rule" of abstinence is an arbitrary threshold used in many transplant centers and has never been shown to affect survival after LT. The optimal abstinence period in pre-transplant remains unclear. The patients in the pre- and post-transplant period need evaluation of a multidisciplinary team, as psychiatrist, addiction specialists, including counselling and attendance to support groups. The impact of alcohol relapse on post-transplant outcomes is not entirely clear but is worse with continuing heavy drinking, with poorer survival beyond the fifth post-transplant year malignancy and cardiovascular disease and not recurrent liver failure. Acute alcoholic hepatitis, in careful selected cases, should be transplanted and have comparable survival outcomes. Prevention of alcoholic recidivism has proved to be the most important treatment after liver transplantation.

The addition of 400 cGY total body irradiation to a regimen incorporating once-daily intravenous busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin reduces relapse without affecting nonrelapse mortality in acute myelogenous leukemia. A combination of fludarabine (Flu) and daily i.v. busulfan (Bu) is well tolerated and effective in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The addition of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may reduce morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but lead to increased relapse. To compensate for this effect, we added 400 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) to the Flu/Bu regimen in 89 patients, and compared outcomes with those achieved in 90 patients who received the drug combination alone. Although nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 3 years did not differ between the groups, the inclusion of TBI significantly reduced relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15-0.54; P = .0001). Consequently, both overall survival (OS; HR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.3-0.84; P = .009) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.26-0.72; P = .001) were improved with the inclusion of TBI. This study confirms the importance of regimen intensity in allogeneic HSCT for AML. The combination of daily i.v.

Heart failure tools. Our heart failure team was part of the Accelerating Best Care in Pennsylvania program through a grant by our State Representative, Todd Eachus. Our team met weekly and identified high leverage points that needed to be addressed-one being that of discharge instructions. We also identified the need for standing order sets for heart failure admissions. We implemented standing order sets in July of 2005, making them mandatory for use in 2006. We also placed a "yellow" heart failure form on the front of all heart failure patients to alert nursing staff to the fact that this was a heart failure admission. We also asked the pharmacy to printout patient profiles to compare meds at discharge for these patients, and a memo was sent to our medical staff reminding them of their responsibility of filling out disease-specific "Heart Failure Discharge Instructions" and writing out the meds. The disease-specific heart failure discharge instruction form was a newly developed form strictly for use with heart failure patients.

Solvent effects on ionization potentials of guanine runs and chemically modified guanine in duplex DNA: effect of electrostatic interaction and its reduction due to solvent. We examined the ionization potential (IP) corresponding to the free energy of a hole on duplex DNA by semiempirical molecular orbital theory with a continuum solvent model. As for the contiguous guanines (a guanine run), we found that the IP in the gas phase significantly decreases with the increasing number of nucleotide pairs of the guanine run, whereas the IP in water (OP, oxidation potential) only slightly does. The latter result is consistent with the experimental result for DNA oligomers in water. This decrease in the IP is mainly due to the attractive electrostatic interaction between the hole and a nucleotide pair in the duplex DNA. This interaction is reduced in water, which results in the small decrease in the IP in water. This mechanism explains the discrepancy between the experimental result and the previous computational results obtained by neglecting the solvent. As for the chemically modified guanine, the previous work showed that the removal of some solvent (water) molecules due to the attachment of a neutral functional group to a guanine in a duplex DNA stabilizes the hole on the guanine. One might naively have expected the opposite case, since a polar solvent usually stabilizes ions. This mechanism also explains this unexpected stabilization of a hole as follows. When some water molecules are removed, the attractive electrostatic interaction stabilizing the hole increases, and thus, the hole is stabilized. In order to design the hole energetics by a chemical modification of DNA, this mechanism has to be taken into account and can be used.

Rh Immunoprophylaxis for Women With a Serologic Weak D Phenotype. It is standard practice for pregnant RhD-negative women who have not already formed anti-D to receive antepartum Rh immunoprophylaxis and, if they deliver an RhD-positive neonate, to receive postpartum Rh immunoprophylaxis. An estimated 0.6% to 1.0% of white women have red blood cells that express a serologic weak D phenotype. Of these women, approximately 80% will have a weak D type 1, 2, or 3 that could be managed safely as RhD-positive. Surveys of laboratory practice reveal a lack of standards for interpreting the RhD type for women with a serologic weak D and for determining their need for Rh immunoprophylaxis. RhD genotyping is recommended to determine the molecular basis of serologic weak D phenotypes in pregnant women as a basis for determining their candidacy for Rh immunoprophylaxis. 

Development of an arterial tonometer sensor. In this study, we developed arterial tonometer sensor array using piezoresistive sensor elements and PDMS coating. Computer simulation for the pressure response of the sensor was compared with measurement results. The pressure attenuation ratios for simulation and measurement by 3mm PDMS coating were 0.2145 and 0.2952, respectively. It is expected that sensitivity of the sensor array depending on PDMS coating thickness can be determined using proposed method. And by designing the sensor bonding layer and wire bonding layer separately, it can improve wire connection reliability.

Decision support system for resource allocation in disaster management. Natural and man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, plane crashes, high-rise building collapses, major nuclear facility malfunctions, pose an ever-present challenge to public emergency services. Disasters may result in a large volume of responders arriving on-scene to provide assistance to victims. Coordination of responding resources is a major problem in disasters. In this paper we introduce a decision support framework built on rapid information collection and resource tracking functionalities. Based on this information collected from emergency response service agencies, operation research techniques are used to find an optimal solution for resource deployment and dispatching.

Internet-based biofeedback-assisted relaxation training in the treatment of hypertension: a pilot study. The effectiveness of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment with Internet-based client-therapist contact for hypertension was tested in outpatient settings. A pilot study with a randomized controlled design was adopted with two conditions (treatment versus passive controls), lasting for 8 weeks. There were two assessment time points (pre-treatment and post-treatment) measuring clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and administration of a questionnaire collecting demographic and subjective data. Participants included 19 Swedish adults diagnosed with hypertension. The treatment group lowered their SBP 5.9 mm Hg and their DBP 7.6 mm Hg while the control group lowered their SBP 0.8 mm Hg and DBP 3.0 mm Hg. The effect of treatment was significant for DBP but not for SBP. There were no other significant effects of treatment. This pilot study shows encouraging results regarding Internet-based biofeedback treatment for hypertensive adults. However, further research using a larger sample is needed.

A spinosyn-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster nicotinic acetylcholine receptor identified through chemically induced target site resistance, resistance gene identification, and heterologous expression. Strains of Drosophila melanogaster with resistance to the insecticides spinosyn A, spinosad, and spinetoram were produced by chemical mutagenesis. These spinosyn-resistant strains were not cross-resistant to other insecticides. The two strains that were initially characterized were subsequently found to have mutations in the gene encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit Dalpha6. Subsequently, additional spinosyn-resistant alleles were generated by chemical mutagenesis and were also found to have mutations in the gene encoding Dalpha6, providing convincing evidence that Dalpha6 is a target site for the spinosyns in D. melanogaster. Although a spinosyn-sensitive receptor could not be generated in Xenopus laevis oocytes simply by expressing Dalpha6 alone, co-expression of Dalpha6 with an additional nAChR subunit, Dalpha5, and the chaperone protein ric-3 resulted in an acetylcholine- and spinosyn-sensitive receptor with the pharmacological properties anticipated for a native nAChR.

Shopping for fruits and vegetables. Food and retail qualities of importance to low-income households at the grocery store. Purchasing fruits and vegetables is an integral part of managing food consumption and dietary quality. This study examined how low-income adults who had primary responsibility for household food purchases considered retail produce decisions. We used a qualitative research approach based on grounded theory and an ecological conceptual framework. Twenty-eight low-income rural, village, and inner city heads of households in upstate New York, USA, were selected by purposive and theoretical sampling and interviewed about fruit and vegetable shopping habits, attitudes toward local food stores, and where and how they would prefer to buy produce. Analyses revealed their concerns were organized around five themes: store venue; internal store environment; product quality; product price; relationships with the stores. An unanticipated finding was the differing social relations that appear to exist between participant consumers, store employees and management, and the store itself as a representation of the larger retail food system. Attitudes toward retail food stores in this study are described as passive or fatalistic indifference, supportive, opportunistic, and confrontational (change agents). These attitudes are related to how shoppers considered retail fruit and vegetable choice, access, and availability. These findings suggest ways to individualize nutrition education and consumer education messages.

Ecological connectivity shapes quasispecies structure of RNA viruses in an Antarctic lake. RNA viruses exist as complex mixtures of genotypes, known as quasispecies, where the evolution potential resides in the whole community of related genotypes. Quasispecies structure and dynamics have been studied in detail for virus infecting animals and plants but remain unexplored for those infecting micro-organisms in environmental samples. We report the first metagenomic study of RNA viruses in an Antarctic lake (Lake Limnopolar, Livingston Island). Similar to low-latitude aquatic environments, this lake harbours an RNA virome dominated by positive single-strand RNA viruses from the order Picornavirales probably infecting micro-organisms. Antarctic picorna-like virus 1 (APLV1), one of the most abundant viruses in the lake, does not incorporate any mutation in the consensus sequence from 2006 to 2010 and shows stable quasispecies with low-complexity indexes. By contrast, APLV2-APLV3 are detected in the lake water exclusively in summer samples and are major constituents of surrounding cyanobacterial mats. Their quasispecies exhibit low complexity in cyanobacterial mat, but their run-off-mediated transfer to the lake results in a remarkable increase of complexity that may reflect the convergence of different viral quasispecies from the catchment area or replication in a more diverse host community. This is the first example of viral quasispecies from natural aquatic ecosystems and points to ecological connectivity as a modulating factor of quasispecies complexity. 

Glass ionomer cements and their role in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions. Glass ionomer based materials are clinically popular in several areas of restorative dentistry, but restoration of cervical lesions has proven particularly successful. Various etiologies, conformations, locations and structural characteristics make non-carious cervical lesions more challenging to adhesive restorative procedures and marginal seal in the long run. Due to their characteristics, glass ionomer cements (GICs) have precise indication for these cases. Moreover, the use of a GIC base underneath composite resin, the so-called 'sandwich' or mixed technique, allows associating the good characteristics of composite resins and GICs, and has been considered quite useful in the restoration of non-carious cervical defects. The aim of this paper is to critically review the literature and discuss peculiar features of GICs regarding their role in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions.

Developing bones are differentially affected by compromised skeletal muscle formation. Mechanical forces are essential for normal adult bone function and repair, but the impact of prenatal muscle contractions on bone development remains to be explored in depth in mammalian model systems. In this study, we analyze skeletogenesis in two 'muscleless' mouse mutant models in which the formation of skeletal muscle development is disrupted; Myf5(nlacZ/nlacZ):MyoD(-/-) and Pax3(Sp/Sp) (Splotch). Ossification centers were found to be differentially affected in the muscleless limbs, with significant decreases in bone formation in the scapula, humerus, ulna and femur, but not in the tibia. In the scapula and humerus, the morphologies of ossification centers were abnormal in muscleless limbs. Histology of the humerus revealed a decreased extent of the hypertrophic zone in mutant limbs but no change in the shape of this region. The elbow joint was also found to be clearly affected with a dramatic reduction in the joint line, while no abnormalities were evident in the knee. The humeral deltoid tuberosity was significantly reduced in size in the Myf5(nlacZ/nlacZ):MyoD(-/-) mutants while a change in shape but not in size was found in the humeral tuberosities of the Pax3(Sp/Sp) mutants. We also examined skeletal development in a 'reduced muscle' model, the Myf5(nlacZ/+):MyoD(-/-) mutant, in which skeletal muscle forms but with reduced muscle mass. The reduced muscle phenotype appeared to have an intermediate effect on skeletal development, with reduced bone formation in the scapula and humerus compared to controls, but not in other rudiments. In summary, we have demonstrated that skeletal development is differentially affected by the lack of skeletal muscle, with certain rudiments and joints being more severely affected than others. These findings indicate that the response of skeletal progenitor cells to biophysical stimuli may depend upon their location in the embryonic limb, implying a complex interaction between mechanical forces and location-specific regulatory factors affecting bone and joint development.


Photostabilization effect of quercetin on the UV filter combination, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane-octyl methoxycinnamate.

Refractory metabolic acidosis as a complication of high-dose midazolam infusion for pediatric status epilepticus. The use of midazolam for the treatment of status epilepticus in children has generally been shown to be well tolerated and safe. Furthermore, encouraging efficacy has been observed when pediatric patients with status epilepticus have received continuous intravenous infusions of midazolam. A 9-year-old girl was treated with high-dose, continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam for the management of refractory status epilepticus. The patient developed a severe hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and resultant hemodynamic compromise, necessitating significant inotropic support and the initiation of a vasopressor infusion. We speculate that this complication was due to the preparation of parenteral midazolam with hydrochloric acid. The midazolam infusion was stopped, and, in less than 5 hours, the patient's metabolic acidosis resolved. The patient's inotropic and vasopressor infusions could only be weaned after discontinuing the use of high-dose midazolam. Although this complication was observed in only 1 pediatric patient with cortical dysplasia, caution and close clinical and laboratory surveillance should be exercised when administering continuous intravenous infusions of midazolam to pediatric patients.

Continuing medical education challenges in chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) affects at least 4 million people in the United States, yet only 16% of people with CFS have received a diagnosis or medical care for their illness. Educating health care professionals about the diagnosis and management of CFS may help to reduce population morbidity associated with CFS. This report presents findings over a 5-year period from May 2000 to June 2006 during which we developed and implemented a health care professional educational program. The objective of the program was to distribute CFS continuing education materials to providers at professional conferences, offer online continuing education credits in different formats (e.g., print, video, and online), and evaluate the number of accreditation certificates awarded. We found that smaller conference size (OR = 80.17; 95% CI 8.80, 730.25), CFS illness related target audiences (OR = 36.0; 95% CI 2.94, 436.34), and conferences in which CFS research was highlighted (OR = 4.15; 95% CI 1.16, 14.83) significantly contributed to higher dissemination levels, as measured by visit rates to the education booth. While print and online courses were equally requested for continuing education credit opportunities, the online course resulted in 84% of the overall award certificates, compared to 14% for the print course. This remained consistent across all provider occupations: physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and allied health professionals. These findings suggest that educational programs promoting materials at conferences may increase dissemination efforts by targeting audiences, examining conference characteristics, and promoting online continuing education forums.


Significance of aortic atherosclerotic disease in possibly embolic stroke: 64-multidetector row computed tomography study.

Cell cycle dependence of protein subcellular location inferred from static, asynchronous images. Protein subcellular location is one of the most important determinants of protein function during cellular processes. Changes in protein behavior during the cell cycle are expected to be involved in cellular reprogramming during disease and development, and there is therefore a critical need to understand cell-cycle dependent variation in protein localization which may be related to aberrant pathway activity. With this goal, it would be useful to have an automated method that can be applied on a proteomic scale to identify candidate proteins showing cell-cycle dependent variation of location. Fluorescence microscopy, and especially automated, high-throughput microscopy, can provide images for tens of thousands of fluorescently-tagged proteins for this purpose. Previous work on analysis of cell cycle variation has traditionally relied on obtaining time-series images over an entire cell cycle; these methods are not applicable to the single time point images that are much easier to obtain on a large scale. Hence a method that can infer cell cycle-dependence of proteins from asynchronous, static cell images would be preferable. In this work, we demonstrate such a method that can associate protein pattern variation in static images with cell cycle progression. We additionally show that a one-dimensional parameterization of cell cycle progression and protein feature pattern is sufficient to infer association between localization and cell cycle.


Histological and morphometric analyses of seasonal testicular variations in the Jungle Crow (Corvus macrorhynchos).

Canine fossa trephine for the severely diseased maxillary sinus. The appropriate surgical approach to the severely diseased maxillary sinus is still debatable. Some advocate creating a wide maxillary antrostomy to allow for increased ventilation and improved delivery of postoperative medication. Others, however, recommend more aggressive surgery with complete clearance of all diseased tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of canine fossa puncture and canine fossa trephine (CFT) for the severely diseased maxillary sinus. A retrospective chart review was performed on 97 patients who underwent a CFT as a part of endoscopic sinus surgery or modified Lothrop procedure. Outcomes were measured in terms of the maxillary sinus endoscopy grade at last follow-up and need for revision surgery. Two groups were formed: those who experienced recurrence of disease and those who were disease free at last follow-up. A comparison was made between the two groups and differences were noted. A CFT was performed in 97 patients with nasal polyposis (NP) who had an average number of 2.38 previous sinus surgeries. At an average follow-up of 27.8 months, 80 of the patients were disease free. In 17 patients disease recurred, and 11 of those required revision surgery with a CFT. Those patients who had recurrence of disease tended to be more allergic, have higher Lund-Mackay score, and had an increased number of prior sinus surgeries. In addition, allergic fungal sinusitis was associated with a poorer prognosis after CFT. CFT allows for complete clearance of all gross disease in the maxillary sinus. CFT decreases the chance of disease recurrence in patients with severe NP.

Criterion-related validity of the short International Physical Activity Questionnaire against exercise capacity in young adults. Self-reported physical activity (PA) is well associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity. The short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short) is a frequently used instrument for cross-national assessments of PA in adults. The purpose of this study was to validate IPAQ-short against exercise capacity in Greek young adults. One hundred and thirteen men and 105 women, aged 20-29 years, were randomly selected from a larger population of young health-science students. A Greek version of IPAQ-short (IPAQ-Gr) was administered to all participants before their exercise capacity evaluation with a maximal Bruce treadmill test. Multiple regression and correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between all IPAQ-Gr outcomes with exercise capacity based on maximal treadmill time. Spearman's correlations for total and vigorous PA against maximal treadmill time were significant in all groups examined, ranging from 0.35 to 0.43. Moderate and walking PA correlations were poor and nonsignificant, ranging from near-zero values to 0.19. In multiple linear regression analysis, only sex, smoking, and vigorous PA from all personal and log-transformed IPAQ-Gr data were significantly associated with maximal treadmill time. Partial correlation analysis for the overall population, adjusted for sex and smoking, showed that total PA (r=0.37) and vigorous PA (r=0.47) were significantly associated with exercise capacity. IPAQ-Gr was tested against exercise capacity and showed acceptable validity properties in Greek young adults. Total and vigorous weekly PA expenditure were well associated with exercise capacity, presenting significant validity correlations against maximal treadmill time.

Vancomycin MIC creep in MRSA isolates from 1997 to 2008 in a healthcare region in Hong Kong. To assess whether vancomycin MIC creeps among blood methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from 5 hospitals in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2008. Blood cultures MRSA isolates from 1997 to 1999 (period 1), 2004 (period 2) and 2006-2008 (period 3) were retrieved. Etest method was used to determine their vancomycin MIC. The genotypic features were determined by PCR and sequencing. 247 blood MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MIC were 0.375, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for 15 (6.1%), 68 (27.5%), 89 (36%) and 75 (30.4%) isolates, respectively. There was an increase in the percentage of isolates with an MIC=1mg/L from 10.4% (5/48) during period 1 to 21.6% (8/37) during period 2 and 38.3% (62/162) during period 3 (period 1 vs. period 3, P<0.001). Molecular typing showed that this was due to increased percentages of clonal cluster (CC) 8/SCCmec III/IIIA (agr group I), CC45/SCCmec IV/V (agr group IV) and other minor clones with elevated MIC over time. This study found vancomycin MIC creep among blood MRSA isolates over time. As elevated MIC within the susceptible range may reduce vancomycin efficacy, clinical laboratories should adopt methods with the required precision to accurately determine MICs.


Role of caspase 8 as a determinant in trail sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines.

The Contributions of Thrombophilic Mutations to Genetic Susceptibility to Deep Venous Thrombosis in Iraqi Patients. There is a paucity of data on the contribution of various thrombophilic mutations to the development of venous thrombosis in Iraqi patients. Therefore we designed a study to assess the frequencies of known thrombophilic mutations in this population. 100 consecutive Iraqi patients with color Doppler confirmed deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Their DNAs were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse hybridization for factor V Leiden (FVL), the prothrombin (PT) G20210A SNP, and the MTHFR C677T SNP. The factor V A4070G mutation was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-PCR. The prevalence of FVL was 13% in patients versus 2% in controls (odd ratios [OR] 7.3; p=0.007). Patients with recurrent thrombosis also had a significantly higher frequency of Factor V Leiden (OR 8.4, p=0.0007). The prothrombin G20210A, SNP, the factor V A4070G SNP, and the MTHFR 677 TT genotypes were present among patients at 5%, 9%, and 11%, respectively, and among controls at 2%, 6%, and 6%; none of these single mutation prevalence differences were significant. Interestingly, however, when these polymorphisms were studied in aggregate we found that 24% of patients had two or more thrombophilic alleles, compared to only 8% of the controls (OR 3.6; p=0.002). This subgroup included significantly more patients with proximal (p=0.007) and recurrent thrombosis (p=0.012), as well as younger patients (≤40 years) (p=0.026). Two or more thrombophilic alleles, as well as FVL on its own, were both significantly associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis and recurrence in Iraqi patients. Single thrombophilic mutations on their own were not associated with an increased risk.

The influence of reproductive hormones on brain function in the menopausal transition. Reproductive hormones have long been thought to have a significant impact on brain function in humans. Estrogens, progestins and androgens have all been shown to have effects on nerve growth and function in vitro. The neurofunctional domains of cognition, mood and sleep are now receiving increased study to determine both the relationship of endogenous sex steroids through the menopausal transition and the effect of menopausal hormone therapy on these complex functions. All three domains are the source of frequent concern in midlife women, but the relative contribution of ovarian versus somatic aging is only now being untangled. Cognitive function has been most extensively studied, with mixed results in both observational studies and clinical trials, largely due to the remarkably complex aspects of human cognition requiring extensive and targeted testing of specific components. Both mood and sleep disorders have been associated with the menopausal transition, but observed effects appear modest. To date, clinical trial data are insufficient to support the use of hormone therapy specifically for the prevention or treatment of cognitive, mood or sleep disorders in midlife women.

Encephalopathy, visual disturbance and hearing loss-recognizing the symptoms of Susac syndrome. A 23 year-old female presented to a neurology department with a 3 year history of recurrent episodes involving hearing loss, encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and visual field deficits. In the 3 years before presentation, the patient had been treated with methylprednisolone for suspected acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis and peripheral otogenic dysfunction from which she made a complete recovery, and for a visual defect in both eyes caused by bilateral branch retinal arterial occlusion, from which she partially improved and commenced long-term treatment with acetylsalicylic acid. Detailed history, clinical examination, extensive laboratory work-up, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, cerebral and spinal MRI, periventricular single-voxel (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, retinal fluorescence angiography, optical coherence tomography, audiometry, neurophysiological work-up (EEG, evoked potentials). Susac syndrome, characterized by a combination of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss. Long-term immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine (150 mg/day) and prednisolone (10 mg/day), and inhibition of thrombocyte function with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/day).

Microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents and in targeted drug delivery. The development of microbubbles has had considerable impact on the field of diagnostic ultrasound. These minute, gas- or lipid-filled spheres have enabled imaging in the kidney, liver, heart, and myocardium with resolutions that were previously unachievable. Insonation of these microagents generates high-energy cavitational oscillations, which, in addition to providing contrast, can increase local drug diffusivity through microstreaming or bubble collapse. The ability of focused insonation to induce such collapse on ligated microbubbles offers opportunities to deliver targeted therapies in novel ways. Microbubbles have had considerable impact on cancer research in terms of both imagining tumors and through the delivery of therapeutic agents and on the delivery of substances across biological obstructions such as the blood-brain barrier. This review offers a discussion of current approaches used in microbubble construction, of the underlying physics involved in their creation and destruction, and of current applications for these particles, the latter demonstrating their importance for high-contrast medical ultrasound. Challenges to overcome and future areas of microbubble application are also discussed.

A multi-dimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) and routine assessment of patient index data (RAPID3) scores are informative in patients with all rheumatic diseases. Although indices have been developed for many rheumatic diseases in usual care, they are rarely used in usual care. In most visits to rheumatologists, the only quantitative data collected are laboratory tests. Patient history data often are more important in management of patients with rheumatic diseases than other diseases. A two-page multidimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) can be completed by the patient in 5 to 10 minutes and reviewed by the physician in 10 seconds, with RAPID3 scored in 5 to 10 seconds. The MDHAQ is useful in rheumatic diseases, to improve management documentation and outcomes. MDHAQ data for physical function, pain, global status, and RAPID3 scores appear preferable to no quantitative data.

Direct health care costs of patients with type 2 diabetes within a privately insured employed population, 2000 and 2005. To assess the incremental economic burden of privately insured patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in 2000 and 2005 in the United States. Adults with T2DM and 24 months of continuous health plan enrollment were identified in the MarketScan databases (2000 and 2005). Control groups of persons without diabetes were selected for comparison using propensity score matching. Total adjusted health care costs were estimated using generalized linear modeling. Adjusted health care costs of patients with T2DM in 2005 were 136% higher than those of the matched controls ($12,733 vs $5406, P < 0.001). Similarly, costs of patients with T2DM in 2000 were 146% higher than those of the matched controls ($12,423 vs $5058, P < 0.001). Expenditures were similar for individuals with T2DM in 2000 and 2005. T2DM continues to impose a substantial economic burden to self-insured employers.


Symmetrical Curvilinear Cytotoxic Edema Along the Surface of the Brain Stem: A Probable New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Finding of Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis.

Screening and assessing 11 Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins as potential serodiagnostical markers for discriminating TB patients from BCG vaccinees. Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin tests often yield poor specificity, so that to develop new serological antigens for distinguishing between Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination is a priority, especially for developing countries like China. We predicted the antigenicity for selected open reading frames (ORFs) based on the genome sequences of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG, as well as their functions and differences of expression under different stimulus. The candidate ORFs were cloned from H37Rv sequences and expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. We studied the serodiagnostic potential of 11 purified recombinants by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and involving a cohort composed of 58 TB patients (34 males and 24 females), 8 healthy volunteers and 50 PPD-negative individuals before and after BCG vaccination. For all the 11 antigens, the median OD values for the sera from TB patients were statistically significantly higher than those for PPD-negative individuals before or after BCG vaccination (P<0.01). They had at least 92% specificity in healthy controls and six seroantigens (Rv0251c, Rvl973, Rv2376c, Rv2537c, Rv2785c and Rv3873A) were never reported with seroantigenicities previously. Thus the approach combining comparative genomics, bioinformatics and ELISA techniques can be employed to identify new seroantigens distinguishing M. tuberculosis infection from BCG vaccination.

Non-invasive diagnosis of chronic beryllium disease in workers exposed to hazardous dust in Israel. Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is caused by prolonged occupational exposure to beryllium and is characterised by various clinical presentations, mostly pulmonary. The inflammatory process involves non-caseous granulomas and proliferation of CD4+ cells. CBD is diagnosed by lung biopsy showing tissue granuloma formation, and by the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) for past exposure and sensitisation to beryllium. The induced sputum (IS) technique was developed for diagnosing asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung diseases. A CD4/CD8 ratio >2.5 in T cells from IS is a positive result for granulomatous lung diseases. We previously revealed that dental technicians are exposed to excessive levels of beryllium. The efficacy of IS (CD4/CD8 >2.5) and BeLPT in diagnosing CBD in 17 workplaces where beryllium was present was evaluated. All consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of CBD referred to our institution for diagnosis and management were enrolled. Results of the gold standard lung biopsy with BeLPT were compared to the non-invasive IS+BeLPT. Kappa and McNemar tests evaluated agreement levels. Correlations between demographic and clinical parameters and a confirmed diagnosis of CBD were analysed. The two approaches were compared in 57 of 98 subjects. There was a high level of agreement (kappa 0.920) between IS+BeLPT and biopsy+BeLPT. IS+BeLPT had a specificity of 97.3% and sensitivity of 87.5%. 21 of 87 exposed workers (24%) had CBD, of whom 12 were dental technicians (p=0.044 dental technicians versus all other occupations). This study demonstrated that the CD4/CD8 ratio in IS together with positive/negative BeLPT findings can be used in diagnosing CBD.

Carrier-free immobilized enzymes for biocatalysis. Methods for the preparation of carrier-free insoluble enzymes are reviewed. The technology of cross-linked enzyme aggregates has now been applied to a range of synthetically useful activities. Fusion proteins are also gaining momentum because they allow a relatively selective aggregation or even a specific self-assembly of the desired enzyme activity into insoluble particles in the absence of potentially denaturing chemicals required for precipitation and cross-linking. Recycling of insoluble protein particles for multiple rounds of batchwise reaction has been demonstrated in selected biotransformations. However, for application in a fully continuous biocatalytic process, low resistance to mechanical stress and high compressibility are issues for consideration on carrier-free enzyme particles.


Diagnostic Accuracy of the Cognitive State Test in the Detection of Dementia Among Iranian Older Adults.

[The role of the short-wave therapy in rehabilitation of elderly patents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. The positive clinical effects of using the short-wave therapy in rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are presented in this article. 49 patients were included in this investigation. The criteria of successful rehabilitation were more expressive in the cases when the short-wave therapy was included in rehabilitative program.

Comparison between obtained mydriasis in type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic patients. To evaluate and compare obtained mydriasis with phenylephrine 10% associated with tropicamide 1% in type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic patients. A total of 50 patients (100 eyes) scheduled for fundoscopy were dilated with phenylephrine 10% and yropicamide 1% (group 0: n = 20 type 2 diabetic patients, 40 eyes, and group 1: n = 30 non-diabetic patients, 60 eyes). Only one drop per eye of each drug was administered. In both groups, pupil diameter was measured after 40 minutes of eye drops instillation. Both groups were similar regarding age (p = 0.06, Mann-Whitney test). Mean pupil diameter in group 0 was 8.57 and 8.73 in group 1. There was no statistic difference between both groups (p = 0.44). Pupil diameter was greater than 7 mm in all patients (100%). When an appropriate drug combination is used, diabetic patients can achieve mydriasis as satisfactory as non-diabetic patients, allowing adequate fundus examination and/or retinopathy treatment.

A large scale study of the psychometric characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale: findings and evidence for increased self-destructive behaviors in adult females with autism spectrum disorder. The psychometric characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale were studied in over 2,000 people with Intellectual Disability (ID). Reliability ranged from good to excellent. Aggression toward others and objects was highest in the youngest adults, in those in the moderate to severe range of ID, and in those with an autism spectrum diagnosis. Self-injury was highest in those in the severe to profound range of ID and in those with autism, particularly the females. Females with autism were also more likely to make the most self-deprecating statements. Our data suggest that adult females with autism are a unique group and support the notion that mood and anxiety disorders play a role in self-destructive behaviors in this population.

Vagal afferent-dependent cholecystokinin modulation of visceral pain requires central amygdala NMDA-NR2B receptors in rats. Cholecystokinin (CCK), a gut hormone that is released during feeding, exerts gastrointestinal effects in part through vagal pathway. It is reported to be a potential trigger for increased postprandial visceral sensitivity in healthy subjects and, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. NR2B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central amygdala (CeA) participate in pain modulation. Systemically administered CCK activates the CeA-innervating neurons. Here, we investigated whether CCK modulation of visceral sensitivity is mediated through CeA NMDA-NR2B receptors and whether this modulation involves vagal pathway. We first examined the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD) following i.p. injection of CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) in a rat model. Next, the NR2B antagonist ifenprodil and the NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 were microinjected into the CeA before systemic CCK injection. NR2B phosphorylation was detected by Western blot. To down-regulate NR2B gene expression, NR2B-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered into CeA neurons by electroporation. In addition, the effects of functional deafferentation by perivagal application of capsaicin and pretreatment with the CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide were investigated. CCK-8 increased VMR to CRD in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was blunted by intra-CeA administration of ifenprodil (but not NVP-AAM077) and was accompanied by phosphorylation of NR2B subunits in the CeA. CCK failed to increase VMR to CRD in NR2B siRNA-treated rats. Perivagal capsaicin application and pretreatment with devazepide prevented CCK-induced pronociception and CeA NR2B phosphorylation. The pronociception induced by systemic CCK, which is vagal afferent-dependent, requires activation of CeA NMDA-NR2B receptors.

[Analysis of 14 minerals of mulberry fruit in different mature stage by ICP-OES method]. In the present study, the contents of nutritional elements such as Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Se, Mn and Mo and heavy elements such as Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr and Co of mulberry fruits in three different mature stages were analyzed by ICP-OES. The results showed that the contents of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu decreased with maturation development. The contents of the above mentioned mineral elements in green stage were 2.99, 2957.49, 809.00, 559.95, 36.30, 10.07, 2.12 and 1.32 mg x kg(-1), respectively, their contents in pink stage were 169% (Zn) to 14% (Na) lower, the contents of these elements in red stage were 1.63, 2367.13, 489.30, 221.54, 19.01, 2.64, 0.40 and 0.59 mg x kg(-1), and the same changing trend remained in black stage, but the difference was much smaller. The content of Se was the highest in green stage (1.24 mg x kg(-1)), decreased in pink stage, increased in red stage (0.88 mg x kg(-1)), but decreased to 0.65 mg x kg(-1) in black stage. There was no significant change in Pb content in the first three stages, but a substantial decrease occurred in black stage, and the highest content of Pb was 0.27 mg x kg(-1) in green stage. The content of Cr increased during ripening, which was 54.07 mg x kg(-1) in red stage, but in black stage it decreased to the same level as that in pink stage. Both the Pb and Cr contents were not over allowance of Chinese National Standard. These data can be well reference for harvesting stage design and evaluation of function and safety of mulberry fruits.

Dynamic control for synchronization of separated cortical areas through thalamic relay. Binding of features and information which are processed at different cortical areas is generally supposed to be achieved by synchrony despite the non-negligible delays between these areas. In this work we study the dynamics and synchronization properties of a simplified model of the thalamocortical circuit where different cortical areas are interconnected with a certain delay, that is longer than the internal time scale of the neurons. Using this simple model we find that the thalamus could serve as a central subcortical area that is able to generate zero-lag synchrony between distant cortical areas by means of dynamical relaying (Vicente et al., 2008). Our results show that the model circuit is able to generate fast oscillations in frequency ranges of the beta and gamma bands triggered by an external input to the thalamus formed by independent Poisson trains. We propose a control mechanism to turn "On" and "Off" the synchronization between cortical areas as a function of the relative rate of the external input fed into dorsal and ventral thalamic neuronal populations. The current results emphasize the hypothesis that the thalamus could control the dynamics of the thalamocortical functional networks enabling two separated cortical areas to be either synchronized (at zero-lag) or unsynchronized. This control may happen at a fast time scale, in agreement with experimental data, and without any need of plasticity or adaptation mechanisms which typically require longer time scales.

Nutrient removal in an electrically enhanced membrane bioreactor. Integration of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) into wastewater treatment facilities has gained popularity in recent years due to increasingly stringent discharge permits. However, up to now no research has been conducted on the combination of nitrification, denitrification and electrochemical phosphorus removal into a MBR system. In this study a novel electrically enhanced MBR (EMBR) system was used. Without pH adjustment and external carbon source supplementation, using synthetic feed, ammonium-nitrogen was completely eliminated; COD, total nitrogen and ortho-phosphorus were removed by 94.3%, 77% and 86.6%, respectively. The power consumption was 0.22 kW/m(3) of the influent synthetic wastewater. With a control MBR run in parallel, the applied voltage gradient of 1.82 V/cm did not exhibit adverse influence on the microbial growth. This system has the potential to achieve phosphorus removal through alternating the direct current intensity.

Daily consumption of milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduces cell adhesion molecules in healthy children. Several studies have suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals have beneficial effects on lipid profile and systemic inflammation in adults. We examined the effects of a daily intake of milk enriched with longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) for 5 months, on several cardiovascular (CVD) risk biomarkers in healthy children aged 8-14 years. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a total of 107 children of both genders were assigned to two study groups: 1) a supplemented group (SG, n=53) who consumed 0.6 L/day of an enriched dairy product, and 2) a control group (CG, n=54) who consumed 0.6 L/day of standard whole milk. Both groups consumed the dairy drinks for 5 months, in addition to their usual diet. Serum levels of adhesion molecules as indices of vascular endothelial cell activation were assessed in both groups at 0 and 5 months as well as white blood cell counts, lipid profile, serum proteins, total serum calcium, 25-OH vitamin D, glucose, insulin and adiponectin. In the enriched dairy drink supplemented group, adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 as well as lymphocyte levels decreased while plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and serum calcium concentrations increased. In the control group, serum total protein, transferrin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations decreased. The consumption of a milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduced indices of endothelial cell activation in the studied group of healthy children.

Hydroxyurea-induced hematological response in transfusion-independent beta-thalassemia intermedia: case series and review of literature. Hydroxyurea (HU) may improve the symptoms in thalassemia patients by increasing gamma-globin chain expression. However, the efficacy of HU in beta-thalassemia intermedia (TI) is unclear. The authors treated 16 transfusion-independent TI patients (8 males) aged 10.7 +/- 5.0 years with HU, 20 mg/kg/day 4 days per week, for 6 months. Hemoglobin (Hb) and HbF levels were measured prior to treatment, during the treatment period (monthly), and following the completion of treatment. Mutations in the beta-globin gene as well as the XmnI polymorphism were determined. Treatment was well tolerated. There was a significant increase in both Hb and HbF (p < .001), and the increments were strongly correlated (r = .94; p < .001). XmnI polymorphism was not correlated with hematological response. Hb (p = .026) and HbF (p = .046) showed a more significant rise in patients with a Fr8/9 allele than those with one or two IVS-II-1 alleles. HU therapy was associated with a significant hematological response in our TI patients. The Fr8/9 mutation, but not the XmnI polymorphism, was a predictor of good hematological response. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the results obtained in this study.

Comparison of early and long-term results of percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, complicated or not by cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock (CS) still remains one of the most important factors affecting the mortality rate of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the data with follow-up longer than 1 year are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and long-term treatment results of patients with STEMI, complicated or not by CS, who underwent percutaneus coronary interventions. A retrospective registry included data of all patients with STEMI admitted to our centre from January 1999 to December 2001. One thousand three hundred and eighty-five patients with STEMI were hospitalized and 1237 of them were treated with immediate percutaneus coronary interventions. Among this subpopulation, 117 (9.5%) patients were with STEMI complicated with CS on admission (group I) and 1120 (90.5%) patients were with STEMI without complications from CS on admission (group II). The groups differed significantly with regard to baseline clinical characteristics, angiographic picture, and in-hospital course. A total of 38.5% of patients with myocardial infarction complicated by CS and 2.5% of patients without shock (P<0.001) died during hospitalization. At the 5-year follow-up, 58.1% of group I patients and 14.8% of group II patients (P<0.001) died. A significant difference in the 5-year mortality rate was also observed in patients who survived the in-hospital period (31.9 vs. 12.6%; P<0.001). CS continues to be closely connected with a very high mortality rate both in the hospital and in the long-term, also among patients who survived the in-hospital period.

Role of saposin C and D in auditory and vestibular function. Saposins are small proteins derived from a precursor protein, prosaposin. Each of the four saposins (A-D) is necessary for the activity of lysosomal glycosphingolipid hydrolases. Individual saposin mutations lead to lysosomal storage diseases, some of which are associated with hearing loss. Here we evaluate the effects of the loss of saposins C and D on auditory and vestibular function in transgenic mice. Transgenic mice with either loss of saposin C function or a combined loss of saposin C + D function were studied. Light microscopy and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate histologic and morphologic changes in the auditory and vestibular organs. Acoustic brainstem response thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were used to study the auditory phenotype. A null mutation of saposin C did not result in any identifiable histologic changes or loss of hearing through postnatal day 55. Combined losses of saposins C and D similarly did not result in any changes in organ of Corti histology or loss of hearing. However, inclusions within the vestibular end organs was noted, consistent with afferent and efferent neuronal sprouting, although to a much milder degree than seen in the previously studied prosaposin knockout mouse. Loss of saposin C and D function, although causing mild phenotypic changes in the vestibular end organs, otherwise results in minimal functional impairment and no changes in the auditory system. It is more likely that the auditory and vestibular effects of the loss of prosaposin are mediated through the actions of saposin A and/or B. NA.

Relationship of plasma creatinine and lactic acid in type 2 diabetic patients without renal dysfunction.

Glutamate regulates Ca2+ signals in smooth muscle cells of newborn piglet brain slice arterioles through astrocyte- and heme oxygenase-dependent mechanisms. Glutamate is the principal cerebral excitatory neurotransmitter and dilates cerebral arterioles to match blood flow to neural activity. Arterial contractility is regulated by local and global Ca(2+) signals that occur in smooth muscle cells, but modulation of these signals by glutamate is poorly understood. Here, using high-speed confocal imaging, we measured the Ca(2+) signals that occur in arteriole smooth muscle cells of newborn piglet tangential brain slices, studied signal regulation by glutamate, and investigated the physiological function of heme oxygenase (HO) and carbon monoxide (CO) in these responses. Glutamate elevated Ca(2+) spark frequency by approximately 188% and reduced global intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) to approximately 76% of control but did not alter Ca(2+) wave frequency in brain arteriole smooth muscle cells. Isolation of cerebral arterioles from brain slices abolished glutamate-induced Ca(2+) signal modulation. In slices treated with l-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid, a glial toxin, glutamate did not alter Ca(2+) sparks or global [Ca(2+)](i) but did activate Ca(2+) waves. This shift in Ca(2+) signal modulation by glutamate did not occur in slices treated with d-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid, an inactive isomer of l-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid. In the presence of chromium mesoporphyrin, a HO blocker, glutamate inhibited Ca(2+) sparks and Ca(2+) waves and did not alter global [Ca(2+)](i). In isolated arterioles, CORM-3 [tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(II)], a CO donor, activated Ca(2+) sparks and reduced global [Ca(2+)](i). These effects were blocked by 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)-quinoxalin-1-one, a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Collectively, these data indicate that glutamate can modulate Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) waves, and global [Ca(2+)](i) in arteriole smooth muscle cells via mechanisms that require astrocytes and HO. These data also indicate that soluble guanylyl cyclase is involved in CO activation of Ca(2+) sparks in arteriole smooth muscle cells.

Effect of body mass index on bleeding frequency and activated partial thromboplastin time in weight-based dosing of unfractionated heparin: a retrospective cohort study.

Reduced expression of ATP7B affected by Wilson disease-causing mutations is rescued by pharmacological folding chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and curcumin. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive copper overload disorder of the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, a protein localized to the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment comprises reduction of circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment aimed at improvement of protein folding and restoration of protein function. This necessitated systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of distinct ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression, whereas messenger RNA abundance was unaffected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 degrees C, and homology modeling suggested that these proteins were misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, whereas other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcumin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression of most ATP7B mutants. These findings might enable novel treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing the protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper export activity. 1795.).

Relation of callous-unemotional traits to length of stay among youth hospitalized at a state psychiatric inpatient facility. We examined the association of callous-unemotional (C/U) traits with length of psychiatric hospitalization among two samples each with 50 participants: a group of 7-11 year-olds (39 males and 11 females) receiving services on a children's unit, and a group of 12-17 year-olds (27 males and 23 females) receiving services on an adolescent unit. Our analyses focused on the additionally predictive value of C/U traits above and beyond the influence of pre-established risk factors for length of stay, including age, gender, ethnicity, overall levels of functioning and psychopathology, and the diagnosis of a Conduct Disorder or Oppositional Defiant Disorder. In both samples, hierarchic regression analyses indicated that C/U traits were associated with longer lengths of stay, whereas none of the previously identified risk factors were significant. The discussion of these results focuses on the importance of developing non-coercive and non-confrontational therapeutic treatment regimens for youth with C/U traits receiving inpatient psychiatric services.


Inverse intensity weighting in generalized linear models as an option for analyzing longitudinal data with triggered observations.

[Somatotype and schizophrenia. A case-control study]. To compare somatotypes of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls and to examine some associations between somatic (joint mobility, somatotype) and psychopathological (anxiety, clinical seriousness and schizophrenic types) features. Thirty four in-patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia assessed by SCID-I, aged 18 to 50 years, were recruited as cases. Thirty two subjects of a general non-clinical population were recruited as controls. Heath-Carter method and 5 questions to detect joint hypermobility were used to assess both somatotype and joint hypermobility. Trait anxiety (STAI) and BPRS were assessed at medical discharge. There were no statistically significant differences between mean somatotype groups (cases: 4(1/2) 5(1/2) 1(1/2); controls: 5 - 5 - 1(1/2)). Schizophrenic patients showed significantly more divergence among themselves in relationship to their own common mean [t = 1.98; gl = 64; p = 0.05] and accounted for more ectomorphic categories than the control group. Somatotype means of paranoid and disorganized types were significantly more homogeneous (with greater values of ectomorphism) than undifferentiated type [X2 = 6.61; gl = 2; p = 0.037]. There was a tendency towards positive association between anxiety - joint hypermobility and anxiety- ectomorphism, but it did not reach a statistically significant level. In spite of their limitations, the results provide suggestive data for identification of subtypes in mental illnesses that can be used as a nosologic knowledge or as potential risk markers.

[The studies of GLUT1 expression and neuron apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic-ischemia brain damage rat model]. To investigate the relationship between the expression of glucose transporter protein 1 and the apoptosis of neuron during hypoxic-ischemia brain damage in neonatal rats. Total 120 10-day old SD rats were divided into normal group, sham control group and hypoxic-ischemia (HI) group. In HI group, hypoxic-ischemia brain damage (HIBD) were generated according to Rice-Vannucci method, brain tissues were harvested at 2, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after HI. The brain samples were also collected at the same time points in normal group and sham control group. The pathological changes was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the mRNA expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the protein expressions of GLUT1 and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) were detected by immunohistochemistry, the apoptosis of neuron was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. HE staining showed that the degree of brain cell damage increased with time after HI, the loss of neuronal cells peaked at 48 h, while the cells in control group apperanted in an orderly and normal morphology. The mRNA and protein expressions of GLUT1 were increased after HI, which began to increase at 2 h, and reach the peak at 24 h. and the expression levels at each time points were statistically higher (P< 0.01) than those in control group. CC3 protein expression also began to increase at 2 h, peaked at 48 h after HI, which was higher than that of control group (P<0.01). The number of positive cells was significantly increased after HI,with a peak at 48 h. The mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 in brain tissue increased significantly after hypoxic-ischemia, and the peak time was earlier than that of CC3 protein and cellular apoptosis. This suggests that GLUT1 expression upregulation may be a certain degree of inhibition on neuronal apoptosis.

Characterizing the Aedes aegypti population in a Vietnamese village in preparation for a Wolbachia-based mosquito control strategy to eliminate dengue. A life-shortening strain of the obligate intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, called wMelPop, is seen as a promising new tool for the control of Aedes aegypti. However, developing a vector control strategy based on the release of mosquitoes transinfected with wMelPop requires detailed knowledge of the demographics of the target population. In Tri Nguyen village (611 households) on Hon Mieu Island in central Vietnam, we conducted nine quantitative entomologic surveys over 14 months to determine if Ae. aegypti populations were spatially and temporally homogenous, and to estimate population size. There was no obvious relationship between mosquito (larval, pupal or adult) abundance and temperature and rainfall, and no area of the village supported consistently high numbers of mosquitoes. In almost all surveys, key premises produced high numbers of Ae. aegypti. However, these premises were not consistent between surveys. For an intervention based on a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti, release ratios of infected to uninfected adult mosquitoes of all age classes are estimated to be 1.8-6.7ratio1 for gravid females (and similarly aged males) or teneral adults, respectively. We calculated that adult female mosquito abundance in Tri Nguyen village could range from 1.1 to 43.3 individuals of all age classes per house. Thus, an intervention could require the release of 2-78 wMelPop-infected gravid females and similarly aged males per house, or 7-290 infected teneral female and male mosquitoes per house. Given the variability we encountered, this study highlights the importance of multiple entomologic surveys when evaluating the spatial structure of a vector population or estimating population size. If a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti were to occur when wild Ae. aegypti abundance was at its maximum, a preintervention control program would be necessary to ensure that there was no net increase in mosquito numbers. However, because of the short-term temporal heterogeneity, the inconsistent spatial structure and the impact of transient key premises that we observed, the feasibility of multiple releases of smaller numbers of mosquitoes also needs to be considered. In either case, fewer wMelPop-infected mosquitoes would then need to be released, which will likely be more acceptable to householders.


Tumor cell/endothelial cell tight contact upregulates endothelial adhesion molecule expression mediated by NFkappaB: differential role of the shear stress.

Developmental steps of the human cervical spine: parameters for evaluation of skeletal maturation stages. The central objective of this investigation was to focus on the development of the cervical spine observed by lateral cephalometric radiological images of children and adolescents (6-16 years old). A sample of 26 individuals (12 girls and 14 boys) was classified according to stages of cervical spine maturation in two subcategories: group I (initiation phase) and group II (acceleration phase). The morphology of the cervical spine was assessed by lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained in accordance with an innovative method for establishing a standardized head posture. A total of 29 linear variables and 5 angular variables were used to clarify the dimensions of the cervical vertebrae. The results suggest that a few measurements can be used as parameters of vertebral maturation both for males and females. The aforementioned measurements include the inferior depth of C2-C4, the inferior depth of C5, the anterior height of C4-C5, and the posterior height of C5. We propose original morphological parameters that may prove remarkably useful in the determination of bone maturational stages of the cervical spine in children and adolescents.

RNA helicase HEL-1 promotes longevity by specifically activating DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans. The homeostatic maintenance of the genomic DNA is crucial for regulating aging processes. However, the role of RNA homeostasis in aging processes remains unknown. RNA helicases are a large family of enzymes that regulate the biogenesis and homeostasis of RNA. However, the functional significance of RNA helicases in aging has not been explored. Here, we report that a large fraction of RNA helicases regulate the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, we show that a DEAD-box RNA helicase, helicase 1 (HEL-1), promotes longevity by specifically activating the DAF-16/forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor signaling pathway. We find that HEL-1 is required for the longevity conferred by reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) and is sufficient for extending lifespan. We further show that the expression of HEL-1 in the intestine and neurons contributes to longevity. HEL-1 enhances the induction of a large fraction of DAF-16 target genes. Thus, the RNA helicase HEL-1 appears to promote longevity in response to decreased IIS as a transcription coregulator of DAF-16. Because HEL-1 and IIS are evolutionarily well conserved, a similar mechanism for longevity regulation via an RNA helicase-dependent regulation of FOXO signaling may operate in mammals, including humans.

[Influence of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the functional proteinuria in rats]. Influence of enalaprilat, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on a functional proteinuria associated with increase in diuresis unduced by furosemide, 1-deamino-arginine vasotocin (1d-AVT) injection or water loading was investigated in experiments with Wistar rats. Intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/100 g b.w. of enalaprilat resulted in reduction of glomerular filtration rate, solute-free water reabsorption and solutes excretion, particularly potassium excretion, after 1d-AVT administration and decrease in diuresis and solute-free water excretion after oral water loading. Enalaprilat injection did not influence on the level of proteinuria induced by the various types ofdiuresis and albuminuria during water diuresis and 1d-AVT-dependent saluresis. The data obtained have shown that decrease in angiotensin II production in the renal structures does not affect protein excretion rate during examined forms of proteinuria and suggest existence of a multicomponent system of the pressure stabilization in the glomerular apparatus.


Integrated management of sugarcane whitegrubs in Australia: an evolving success.

c-Jun activation is required for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced cell death in breast cancer cells. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to mediate tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. However, the downstream mediators of the JNK pathway linking tamoxifen to effectors of apoptosis have yet to be identified. In this study, we analysed whether c-Jun, the major nuclear target of JNK, has a role in tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of SkBr3 breast cancer cells. We show that before DNA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activation, cytotoxic concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) induced JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun at JNK sites earlier shown to regulate c-Jun-mediated apoptosis. In addition, OHT induced ERK-dependent expression of c-Fos and transactivation of an AP-1-responsive promoter. In particular, the ectopic expression of dominant-negative constructs blocking either AP-1 activity or c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation prevented DNA fragmentation after OHT treatment. Furthermore, both c-Fos expression and c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation preceded OHT-dependent activation of caspase 3-7 in different types of tamoxifen-sensitive cancer cells, but not in OHT-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the c-Jun/c-Fos AP-1 complex has a pro-apoptotic role in OHT-treated cancer cells and suggest that pharmacological boosts of c-Jun activation may be useful in a combination therapy setting to sensitize cancer cells to tamoxifen-mediated cell death.

We hypothesized that de novo variants (DNV) might participate in the genetic determinism of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD, onset before 65 years). We investigated 14 sporadic EOAD trios first by array-comparative genomic hybridization. Two patients carried a de novo copy number variation (CNV). We then performed whole-exome sequencing in the 12 remaining trios and identified 12 non-synonymous DNVs in six patients. The two de novo CNVs (an amyloid precursor protein (APP) duplication and a BACE2 intronic deletion) and 3/12 non-synonymous DNVs (in PSEN1, VPS35 and MARK4) targeted genes from a biological network centered on the Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. We showed that this a priori-defined genetic network was significantly enriched in amino acid-altering DNV, compared with the rest of the exome. The causality of the APP de novo duplication (which is the first reported one) was obvious. In addition, we provided evidence of the functional impact of the following three non-synonymous DNVs targeting this network: the novel PSEN1 variant resulted in exon 9 skipping in patient's RNA, leading to a pathogenic missense at exons 8-10 junction; the VPS35 missense variant led to partial loss of retromer function, which may impact neuronal APP trafficking and Aβ secretion; and the MARK4 multiple nucleotide variant resulted into increased Tau phosphorylation, which may trigger enhanced Aβ-induced toxicity. Despite the difficulty to recruit Alzheimer disease (AD) trios owing to age structures of the pedigrees and the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, this strategy allowed us to highlight the role of de novo pathogenic events, the putative involvement of new genes in AD genetics and the key role of Aβ network alteration in AD.

Home Telemedicine in Heart Failure: A Pilot Study of Integrated Telemonitoring and Virtual Provider Appointments.

Otoacoustic emissions in newborns evoked by 0.5kHz tone bursts. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are currently widely used in newborn hearing screening programs. OAEs evoked by transients (TEOAEs) in newborns are usually characterized by large response levels at higher frequencies but lower frequencies are affected by physiological noise. The purpose of the present study was to acquire responses at lower frequencies by measuring OAEs evoked by 0.5kHz tone bursts (TBOAEs). Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were recorded from 49 newborns. Measurements were made using the ILO 292 equipment from Otodynamics. In each ear, three measurements were made: first with a standard click stimulus at 80dB pSPL (CEOAEs), a second using a 0.5kHz tone burst at 80dB pSPL (TBOAEs), and a third recording of spontaneous OAEs (SOAEs). Global and half-octave-band values of OAE signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and response level were used to assess statistical differences between CEOAEs and 0.5kHz TBOAEs. Additionally, time-frequency (TF) analysis of signals was performed using the matching pursuit method. Global levels were highest for CEOAEs. However, at low frequencies (0.7-1kHz), 0.5kHz TBOAEs had significantly higher levels and SNRs than CEOAEs. At these frequencies, SNRs of CEOAEs were usually below 0dB. At 0.5kHz there were no statistically significant differences between CEOAEs and TBOAEs. In ears with recordable SOAEs, CEOAEs and TBOAEs had higher levels and SNRs than in ears without SOAEs. Use of 0.5kHz TBOAEs may be a useful addition to standard CEOAE tests in newborns. They provide information about lower frequencies, a region where CEOAEs are usually prone to noise. The presence of SOAEs affects the magnitudes of both CEOAEs and TBOAEs.

Dimensional structure of the demand control support questionnaire: a Brazilian context. According to Karasek, job strain results from an interaction between high demands and low decision latitude. To reassess the dimensional structure and evaluate the internal consistency of demand control support questionnaire (DCSQ), a shortened version of job content questionnaire that was not sufficiently evaluated in validation studies. The study investigated 825 workers who completed the DCSQ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; to 399 workers, the questionnaire was self-administered at a hospital (2004-2005), and 426 workers were interviewed at nine restaurants (2006-2007). Confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation models was used to test theoretical structure of dimensionality. Internal consistency was evaluated by composite reliability and convergent validity by average variance extracted. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the instrument in three dimensions: demands, skill discretion and decision authority. The best fit model was achieved by removing social support at work and the item repetitive work (skill discretion). A cross-loading from learning new things on demands and an error measurement correlation between work fast and work intense were confirmed. Composite reliability was acceptable for all dimensions, except for demands (0.58), which also showed inadequate average variance extracted (0.32). This final model was confirmed in separate analyses according to work setting, but the loadings of demands were lower for restaurant workers. Our results indicated that skill discretion and decision authority formed two distinct dimensions. Additionally, the item repetitive work should be removed, as well as one of the items work fast or work intense (demands). Future research is still required to confirm these findings.

Methods for rapid identification of a functional single-chain variable fragment using alkaline phosphatase fusion.

Binding balls: fast detection of binding sites using a property of spherical Fourier transform. The functional prediction of proteins is one of the most challenging problems in modern biology. An established computational technique involves the identification of three-dimensional local similarities in proteins. In this article, we present a novel method to quickly identify promising binding sites. Our aim is to efficiently detect putative binding sites without explicitly aligning them. Using the theory of Spherical Harmonics, a candidate binding site is modeled as a Binding Ball. The Binding Ball signature, offered by the Spherical Fourier coefficients, can be efficiently used for a fast detection of putative regions. Our contribution includes the Binding Ball modeling and the definition of a scoring function that does not require aligning candidate regions. Our scoring function can be computed efficiently using a property of Spherical Fourier transform (SFT) that avoids the evaluation of all alignments. Experiments on different ligands show good discrimination power when searching for known binding sites. Moreover, we prove that this method can save up to 40% in time compared with traditional approaches.


Impact of mine waste on airborne respirable particulates in northeastern Oklahoma, United States.

Effect of arachidonic acid on hypoxia-induced IL-6 production in mouse ES cells: Involvement of MAPKs, NF-kappaB, and HIF-1alpha. This study examined the role of arachidonic acid (AA) in hypoxia-induced production of interleukin (IL)-6 and its related signaling pathways in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Hypoxia with AA induced IL-6 production, which was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, hypoxia increased the levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) phosphorylation, which were blocked by antioxidant (vitamin C). Inhibition of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK blocked hypoxia- or hypoxia with AA-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression was regulated by NF-kappaB activation. Consequently, the increased HIF-1alpha expression induced activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The expression of each signaling molecule stimulated an increase in IL-6 production that was greater in hypoxic conditions with AA than with hypoxia alone. Finally, inhibition of IL-6 production using IL-6 antibody or soluble IL-6 receptor attenuated the hypoxia-induced increases in DNA synthesis of mouse ES cells. In conclusion, AA potentiates hypoxia-induced IL-6 production through the MAPKs, NF-kappaB, and HIF-1alpha pathways in mouse ES cells.

The intersection of safety and adherence: new incretin-based therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. One of the challenges facing health care providers in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is maintaining the balance between achieving hemoglobin A(1c) targets while simultaneously minimizing adverse events-most notably hypoglycemia and weight gain-that may negatively affect adherence to therapy and thus treatment outcomes. Incretin-based treatments, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, are the newest class of therapies for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from clinical trials in which liraglutide, exenatide, saxagliptin, or sitagliptin were employed as monotherapy or added to ongoing antidiabetic treatment indicate that the incretin-based therapies have very low risk for the development of hypoglycemia and either decrease body weight (GLP-1-receptor agonists) or are weight neutral (DPP-4 inhibitors). Decreased risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain may improve adherence. Avoiding weight gain, which is commonly associated with older oral antidiabetic agents and some insulins, also has the potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease. Future pharmacoeconomic studies may demonstrate translation of these benefits into good cost-effectiveness for these therapies.

Involvement of proteinase-activated receptors 1 and 2 in spreading and phagocytosis by murine adherent peritoneal cells: modulation by the C-terminal of S100A9 protein. Proteinase-activated receptors (PAR) are widely recognized for their modulatory properties in inflammatory and immune responses; however, their direct role on phagocyte effector functions remains unknown. S100A9, a protein secreted during inflammatory responses, deactivates activated peritoneal macrophages, and its C-terminal portion inhibits spreading and phagocytosis of adherent peritoneal cells. Herein, the effect of PAR1 and PAR2 agonists was investigated on spreading and phagocytosis by adherent peritoneal cells, as well as the ability of murine C-terminal of S100A9 peptide (mS100A9p) to modulate this effect. Adherent peritoneal cells obtained from mouse abdominal cavity were incubated with PAR1 and PAR2 agonists and spreading and phagocytosis of Candida albicans particles were evaluated. PAR1 agonists increased both the spreading and the phagocytic activity, but PAR2 agonists only increased the spreading index. mS100A9p reverted both the increased spreading and phagocytosis induced by PAR1 agonists, but no interference in the increased spreading induced by PAR2 agonists was noticed. The shorter homologue peptide to the C-terminal of mS100A9p, corresponding to the H(92)-E(97) region, also reverted the increased spreading and phagocytosis induced by PAR1 agonists. These findings show that proteinase-activated receptors have an important role for spreading and phagocytosis of adherent peritoneal cells, and that the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal of S100A9 protein is a remarkable candidate for use as a novel compound to modulate PAR1 function.

Follicular neoplasm of the thyroid gland: unique cytologic appearances in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has become a standard first-line diagnostic procedure for palpable and nonpalpable nodules of the thyroid gland. Six cytologic diagnostic categories have recently been proposed to unify the terminology that is linked to proper clinical management. We report a case of follicular neoplasm diagnosed on FNA specimen that had a very artistic appearance of the microfollicle formation on both Diff-Quik and Papanicolaou-stained slides.

The metabolic syndrome predicts incident congestive heart failure: a 20-year follow-up study of elderly Finns. We investigated whether the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components defined by four different criteria including subjects with prevalent diabetes in their definitions were associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) independent of interim myocardial infarction (MI) and prevalent diabetes during a 20-year follow-up in an elderly population-based study. The MetS was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA) criteria. The association of the MetS with incident CHF (303 cases) was investigated with Cox regression analyses in a 20-year follow-up study of 1032 Finns, aged 65-74 years at baseline. Among all subjects the MetS by all four criteria was significantly associated with a 1.45-1.74-fold risk for incident CHF after the adjustment for confounding factors. When subjects with interim MI during the follow-up and with prevalent diabetes were excluded, the MetS was significantly associated with a 1.37-1.87-fold risk for incident CHF after the adjustment for confounding factors. Of the single components of the MetS, the following were associated with incident CHF: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)> or = 6.1 mmol/l, Hazards ratio (HR) 1.46 or FPG > or = 5.6 mmol/l, HR 1.62)]; raised blood pressure (BP) [(BP > or = 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive medications, HR 1.89); central obesity (waist circumference > or = 94 cm in men or > or = 80 cm in women, HR 1.49); (waist circumference > or = 102 cm in men or > or = 88 cm in women, HR 1.48); obesity (body mass index > or = 30 kg/m(2), HR 1.79); and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<1.03 mmol/l in men or <1.29 mmol/l in women, HR 1.55). The MetS defined by four different criteria predicted CHF independent of interim MI and prevalent diabetes in elderly Finns, but not above and beyond the risk associated with one component of the MetS, hypertension.

Bioactivation of lamotrigine in vivo in rat and in vitro in human liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and epidermal keratinocytes: characterization of thioether conjugates by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Previous studies suggested that lamotrigene (LTG) underwent bioactivation to a reactive aryl epoxide intermediate in rats. Nevertheless, definitive structures of these thioether conjugates, which are often needed to substantiate the mechanism of bioactivation and identity of reactive intermediate(s), were not fully established. In the present study, GSH, cysteinylglycine, and N-acetyl cysteine conjugates of LTG were isolated from bile of rats orally dosed with LTG (100 mg/kg), and their structures were fully elucidated by LC/MS and NMR. The definitive structural characterization of these metabolites provided evidence for the existence of a reactive aryl epoxide that was trapped as a GSH adduct. In vitro studies using various hepatic cellular and subcellular fractions obtained from human and rat were performed to demonstrate that LTG underwent bioactivation to form a GSH conjugate that was identical to the one initially characterized from in vivo studies. Human P450 2A6 and rat P450 2C11 appeared to be the primary enzymes activating LTG in human and rat liver microsomes, respectively. Interindividual variation in the bioactivation of LTG was demonstrated with 20 individual human liver microsomes. Furthermore, it was shown that human epidermal keratinocytes were capable of forming the same GSH conjugate, suggesting that LTG could be bioactivated in skin cells. The results from these studies suggest that LTG has the potential to undergo hepatic and nonhepatic bioactivation, leading to a reactive aryl epoxide intermediate in human. The bioactivation of LTG in epidermal cells provides a possible explanation for the idiosyncratic cutaneous reactions associated with LTG therapy.

Citizenship beyond politics: the importance of political, civil and social rights and responsibilities among women and men. Previous research has suggested that men are more engaged as citizens than are women. Yet, little is known about gender cleavages across a variety of citizenship norms. To what extent do men and women define citizenship differently? To address that question, this study examines the importance men and women assign various citizenship rights and responsibilities using 2004 ISSP data from 18 Western, industrialized nations. Using a disaggregated approach to understanding definitions of citizenship, we examine political, civil, and social rights and responsibilities. After controlling for a variety of demographic and attitudinal influences, we find that men and women are not different in their views regarding the importance of political responsibilities. However, women do view political rights as significantly more important than do men. Further, in comparison to men, women view both civil and social responsibilities and rights domains as significantly more important.

Camp BONES: a partnership initiative to engage underrepresented adolescents in a career in nursing at the baccalaureate level. The nursing profession is confronted with significant challenges related to the ever-increasing shortage and lack of diversity in the workforce. To address these challenges, a program for underrepresented middle school students was developed collaboratively between local school districts, academia, and health care partners. The program, Camp BONES, included a 2-week summer camp and follow-up weekend and summer camp experiences for students. Experiences were provided to explore critical thinking skills in the simulated laboratories at the university, as well as at clinical practice areas in nursing. The program was guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and self-efficacy theory. Early evaluation of the program revealed positive accolades and students' increasing interest in pursuing nursing as a career. Collaborative programs between academia and practice areas, such as Camp BONES, provide important opportunities for middle school students to explore and engage in the nursing profession during the formative years.

Stimulation by sparkling water of gastroduodenal HCO3- secretion in rats. We examined the effect of sparkling water on gastroduodenal HCO3- secretion in rats and investigated the factors involved in these responses. Under urethane anesthesia, a chambered stomach or a proximal duodenal loop was superfused with saline, and HCO3- secretion was measured at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat. The amount of CO2 in sparkling water was about 7.2 g/L. The mucosal exposure with sparkling water increased the secretion of HCO3- in both the stomach and duodenum. The HCO3- response in the duodenum was partially inhibited by indomethacin, acetazolamide or sensory deafferentation and was totally abolished by the co-administration of the former two agents. By contrast, the response in the stomach was almost totally inhibited by acetazolamide and partially mitigated by indomethacin but not sensory deafferentation. DIDS [an inhibitor of the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE) and the Na+-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC)] and DMA [an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1)] partially mitigated the HCO3- response in the duodenum but not the stomach. The mucosal application of sparkling water increased prostaglandin E2 content in these tissues. Sparkling water stimulates HCO3- secretion in both the stomach and the duodenum, but the mechanisms involved differ in these two tissues; the response in the former is mainly due to the intracellular supply of HCO3- with the aid of carbonic anhydrase, while in the latter the response is dependent on the NHE1, AE and NBC, and is mediated by endogenous prostaglandins as well as capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons, in addition to the intracellular supply of HCO3-.

Phlebosclerotic colitis in a cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension: the first case in Korea. Phlebosclerotic colitis is a rare form of ischemic colitis characterized by the thickening of the wall of the affected colon due to fibrous degeneration of submucosal layer of colon and fibrotic obstruction of the colono-mesenteric vein, resulting in the disturbance of venous return from the colon. The pathogenic mechanism of this entity remains unknown but chronic liver disease with portal hypertension is maybe thought to be one of the speculated mechanisms. Here we first report the case of surgically confirmed phlebosclerotic colitis, that was in the early stage but showed the aggressive nature, in a 61-yr-old cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension in Korea.

[Regulations governing the training of diagnostic imaging residents: the residents' statute and the medical specialties law]. The current system for training medical specialists in Spain originated in 1963, and diagnostic radiology was one of the first specialties recognized. There are currently three types of regulations that govern the training of specialists: a) professional, The Health Professions Law; b) labor: The Residents' Statute; and c) educational, The New Medical Specialties Law and the Diagnostic Imaging Program This system consists of an exclusive contract with the training organization, a unified system of access, and a training program in accredited units that includes tutoring, evaluation, and progressive assignment of responsibilities. Residents have a right to be trained and evaluated, to participate in the teaching unit, and to their labor rights. In exchange, they must complete the tasks assigned in the program and abide by the institution's rules. Residents must be supervised directly in the first year and thereafter they should be given progressively more responsibility.

Analyses of associations between three positionally cloned asthma candidate genes and asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese population. Six asthma candidate genes, ADAM33, NPSR1, PHF11, DPP10, HLA-G, and CYFIP2, located at different chromosome regions have been positionally cloned following the reported linkage studies. For ADAM33, NPSR1, and CYFIP2, the associations with asthma or asthma-related phenotypes have been studied in East Asian populations such as Chinese and Japanese. However, for PHF11, DPP10, and HLA-G, none of the association studies have been conducted in Asian populations. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test the associations between these three positionally cloned genes and asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese population. Two, five, and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the identified top regions of PHF11, DPP10, and HLA-G, respectively, were genotyped in 1183 independent samples. The study samples were selected based on asthma affectation status and extreme values in at least one of the following three asthma-related phenotypes: total serum immunoglobulin E levels, bronchial responsiveness test, and skin prick test. Both single SNP and haplotype analyses were performed. We found that DPP10 was significantly associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and BHR asthma after the adjustment for multiple testing; while the associations of PHF11 with positive skin reactions to antigens and the associations of HLA-G with BHR asthma were only nominally significant. Our study is the first one to provide additional evidence that supports the roles of DPP10 in influencing asthma or BHR in a Chinese population.

Postgraduate Symposium: Long-chain n-3 PUFA: intakes in the UK and the potential of a chicken meat prototype to increase them. With the wide acceptance of the long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA EPA and DHA as important nutrients playing a role in the amelioration of certain diseases, efforts to understand factors affecting intakes of these fatty acids along with potential strategies to increase them are vital. Widespread aversion to oil-rich fish, the richest natural source of EPA and DHA, highlights both the highly suboptimal current intakes in males and females across all age-groups and the critical need for an alternative supply of EPA and DHA. Poultry meat is a popular and versatile food eaten in large quantities relative to other meats and is open to increased LC n-3 PUFA content through manipulation of the chicken's diet to modify fatty acid deposition and therefore lipid composition of the edible tissues. It is therefore seen as a favourable prototype food for increasing human dietary supply of LC n-3 PUFA. Enrichment of chicken breast and leg tissue is well established using fish oil or fishmeal, but concerns about sustainability have led to recent consideration of algal biomass as an alternative source of LC n-3 PUFA. Further advances have also been made in the quality of the resulting meat, including achieving acceptable flavour and storage properties as well as understanding the impact of cooking on the retention of fatty acids. Based on these considerations it may be concluded that EPA- and DHA-enriched poultry meat has a very positive potential future in the food chain.

Pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are more effective than pyridoxine in rescuing folding-defective variants of human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase causing primary hyperoxaluria type I. Vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine (PN) is one of the most widespread pharmacological therapies for inherited diseases involving pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, including primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1). PH1 is caused by a deficiency of liver-peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which allows glyoxylate oxidation to oxalate leading to the deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney. Only a minority of PH1 patients, mostly bearing the F152I and G170R mutations, respond to PN, the only pharmacological treatment currently available. Moreover, excessive doses of PN reduce the specific activity of AGT in a PH1 cellular model. Nevertheless, the possible effect(s) of other B6 vitamers has not been investigated previously. Here, we compared the ability of PN in rescuing the effects of the F152I and G170R mutations with that of pyridoxamine (PM) and PL. We found that supplementation with PN raises the intracellular concentration of PN phosphate (PNP), which competes with PLP for apoenzyme binding leading to the formation of an inactive AGT-PNP complex. In contrast, PNP does not accumulate in the cell upon PM or PL supplementation, but higher levels of PLP and PM phosphate (PMP), the two active forms of the AGT coenzyme, are found. This leads to an increased ability of PM and PL to rescue the effects of the F152I and G170R mutations compared with PN. A similar effect was also observed for other folding-defective AGT variants. Thus, PM and PL should be investigated as matter of importance as therapeutics for PH1 patients bearing folding mutations.

Prohibitin protects proximal tubule epithelial cells against oxidative injury through mitochondrial pathways. Oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to renal tubular atrophy and fibrosis following renal transplantation. Studies have shown that mitochondrial chaperone prohibitin (PHB) has antioxidant effects. Here we used the human renal proximal tubule epithelial cell line, HK-2 cells as an in vitro model to assess the role of PHB in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced renal tubular oxidative injury. Our results showed that H2O2 treatment inhibited PHB expression in a time-dependent manner in HK-2 cells. PHB overexpression could protect cell from oxidative stress-induced injury by inhibiting H2O2-induced cell apoptosis and intracellular ROS generation and promoting endogenous antioxidant defense components including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced cell injury was suppressed in PHB-overexpressed tubule epithelial cells through mitochondria-mediated pathway, including inhibition of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 or UCP2 and Bax expression, mitochondrial ROS production, promotion of ATP production and Bcl-2 expression, inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potential loss and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and followed by caspase-3 activation. Meanwhile, inhibition of PHB expression by small interference RNA resulted in less resistance of HK-2 cells to H2O2 toxicity as shown in decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, ROS production, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These data indicated that PHB protected the tubule epithelial cells from oxidative stress-induced damage through the inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondria dysfunction, and ultimately inhibition of cell apoptosis, and that increasing PHB content in mitochondria constituted a new therapeutic target for transient ischemic injury and chronic allograft nephropathy or CAN following renal transplantation. 

[Particularities of alkane oxidation in Rhodococcus erythropolis EK-1 strain--producer of surface-active substances]. The hexadecane oxidation of Rhodococcus erythropolls EK-1 was established to be catalyzed by the alkane hydroxylase complex containing Fe-S proteid rubredoxin. Alkane hydroxylase activity was increased twice in the presence of 10 mg/l iron ions in the cultivation medium. Sodium ions were shown to be an activator of alkane hydroxylase. Four types of alcohol dehydrogenases (NAD, NADP, pyrroloquinoline quinone and N,N-dimethyll-4-nitrosoaniline-dependent enzymes) were found in hexadecane-grown cells of R. erythropolis EK-1. The obtained data are the basis for the improvement of surface active substances technology.

Prophylaxis with Centella asiatica confers protection to prepubertal mice against 3-nitropropionic-acid-induced oxidative stress in brain. While the usage of Centella asiatica (CA) is on the increase worldwide, evidence demonstrating its protective efficacy against neurotoxicants is scarce. Hence the present study aimed to understand the neuroprotective efficacy of a standardized aqueous extract of CA against 3-nitropropionic-acid(3-NPA)-induced oxidative stress in the brain of prepubertal mice. We assessed the degree of oxidative stress in cytoplasm of brain regions of male mice (4 wk- old) given CA prophylaxis (5 mg/kg bw) for 10 days followed by 3-NPA administration (i.p.75 mg/kg bw) on the last 2 days. The neurotoxicant elicited marked oxidative stress in the brain of untreated mice as evident by enhanced malondialdehyde levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, hydroperoxides and protein carbonyls (a measure of protein oxidation) in striatum and other regions (cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus), while CA prophylaxis completely ameliorated the 3-NPA- induced oxidative stress. Depletion of glutathione (GSH) levels, total thiols, perturbations in antioxidant enzymes and cholinergic enzymes in brain discernible among 3-NPA-treated mice were predominantly restored to normalcy with CA prophylaxis. It is hypothesized that the prophylactic protection offered by CA extract against neurotoxicant exposure may be largely due to its ability to enhance GSH, thiols and antioxidant defenses in the brain of prepubertal mice.

Design and development of a hand robotic rehabilitation device for post stroke patients. Robot-mediated rehabilitation is a rapidly advancing discipline that seeks to develop improved treatment procedures using new technologies, e.g., robotics, coupled with modern theories in neuroscience and rehabilitation. A robotic device was designed and developed for rehabilitation of upper limbs of post stroke patients. A novel force feedback bimanual working mode provided real-time dynamic sensation of the paretic hand. Results of the preliminary clinical tests revealed a quantitative evaluation of the patient's level of paresis and disability.

Pericarp color and haplotype diversity in weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea) from Thailand. Weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) is an important resource for breeding and evolutionary studies. The present study was carried out to identify the genotype of weedy rice strains responsible for variation of pericarp color by sequencing exon 6 of the Rc gene. Haplotype analysis revealed that rice strains with light red- and red-pericarp lacked the 14 bp deletion in the Rc gene, while rice strains with white-, brown and light green-pericarp contained the 14 bp deletion. A single nucleotide polymorphism (C-->A SNP) in exon 6 of the Rc gene was not found in all the weedy rice strains examined. This indicates that white pericarp allele in weedy rice gene pools of today might have originated by gene flow from locally grown modern rice varieties with white pericap into established gene pools of wild rice.

Quantitative analysis of function and perfusion during dobutamine stress in the detection of coronary stenoses: two-dimensional strain and contrast echocardiography investigations. The recent development of accurate methods to measure two-dimensional strain during dobutamine stress echocardiography has reactivated the debate as to the respective value of myocardial perfusion versus myocardial function assessment in detecting coronary stenoses. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of progressive coronary constrictions on two-dimensional strain and myocardial contrast echocardiography parameters during stress conditions. Nine open-chest pigs were studied in the setting of various degrees of coronary constrictions. Two-dimensional strain and myocardial contrast echocardiography with Flash refilling sequence acquisitions were obtained at rest and during dobutamine infusion. Values of longitudinal strain (LS), circumferential strain (CS), radial strain (RS), and wall thickening, as well as myocardial perfusion parameter (A.b), were then calculated. At rest, accuracy for detecting coronary stenosis was higher for CS, LS, and A.b (74%, 67%, and 69%, respectively) than for RS or wall thickening (62% and 64%, respectively). Dobutamine stress echocardiography increased the accuracy of A.b and LS to 77% and to 73%, respectively. Sensitivity during stress was higher for CS (93%) and A.b (77%), whereas specificity was higher for LS (89%) than for other parameters. Combined evaluations (CS+A.b, CS+LS, and LS+A.b) during dobutamine stress echocardiography improved both sensitivity and accuracy for detecting coronary stenosis. Quantitative evaluation of contraction by LS and CS analysis and perfusion (A.b) during stress echocardiography resulted in similar accuracy levels, whereas the radial component was less accurate.

Atrophic enlargement of CSF volume after subarachnoid hemorrhage: correlation with neuropsychological outcome. Ventricular dilation and sulcal enlargement are common sequelae after aSAH. Our aim was to quantify the late ventricular dilation and volumes of the CSF spaces after aSAH and to determine if they correlate with neurologic and cognitive impairments frequently detected in these patients. 3D T1-weighted images needed for volumetry were available in 76 patients 1 year after aSAH, along with 75 neuropsychological assessments. Volumes of CSF segments and ICV were quantified by SPM in 76 patients and 30 control subjects to determine CSF/ICV ratios. The mCMI was calculated to roughly evaluate the ventricular dilation. The contributing factors for enlarged ventricles and CSF volumes were reviewed from radiologic, clinical, and neuropsychological perspectives. The mCMI was higher in patients with aSAH (0.23 +/- 0.06) compared with control subjects (0.20 +/- 0.04; P = .020). In line with these planimetric measurements, the SPM-based CSF/ICV ratios were higher in patients with aSAH (35.58 +/- 7.0) than in control subjects (30.36 +/- 6.25; P = .001). Preoperative hydrocephalus, higher HH and Fisher grades, and focal parenchymal lesions on brain MR imaging, but not the treatment technique, were associated with ventricular enlargement. The clinical outcome and presence of neuropsychological deficits correlated significantly with CSF enlargement. Ventricular and sulcal enlargement, together with reduced GM volumes, after aSAH may indicate general atrophy rather than hydrocephalus. Enlarged CSF spaces correlate with cognitive deficits after aSAH. A simple measure, mCMI proved to be a feasible tool to assess the diffuse atrophic brain damage after aSAH.

Evaluation of hearing function after Gamma Knife surgery of vestibular schwannomas.

Individuals with eating disorders and the use of online support groups as a form of social support. The increase in Internet use in recent years has fostered the development of online support groups to help individuals cope with a number of conditions. Individuals with eating disorders may particularly benefit from such groups as they provide a means of sharing experiences, knowledge, and support with like-minded individuals without the anxiety and worry of others negatively evaluating their appearance. The aim of this study was to examine the nature and types of social support that took place on an anorexia discussion forum. The deductive thematic analysis of 325 messages indicates that the primary function of the group was the communication of encouragement and esteem and information support notably in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and interaction with healthcare specialists. Considering the high rate of relapse among individuals with eating disorders, it is imperative that some form of support is available when they leave treatment centers. Regulated computer-mediated support groups provide a low-cost, easily accessible self-help service to individuals with eating disorders.


Endogenous retroviruses: Thierry Heidmann wins the 2009 Retrovirology prize.

Assessment of estrogen receptors and apoptotic factors in cryopreserved human ovarian cortex. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine frozen-thawed ovarian tissues for features of follicular health and atresia by histology; (ii) to assess the expression of estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) by real-time PCR; (iii) to evaluate the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as an apoptotic index, in the ovarian tissues before and after cryopreservation. Ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from 11 patients. The fragments were subdivided into two groups, fresh (control tissues) and cryopreserved tissues obtained by direct plunging into liquid nitrogen. Both tissue groups were subjected to a histological evaluation of the healthy and atretic follicles, immunohistochemical localization of the ER, and a real-time PCR (qPCR) to evaluate the expression of ER, Bax, Bcl-2 as well as beta-actin, as control gene. Damage was observed in 31% of primordial, 45% of primary, and 75% of secondary follicles in the cryopreserved tissue group. The qPCR analysis showed that the level of ERbeta was greater in fresh than cryopreserved tissues, whereas the ERalpha expression and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were similar in both tissue groups. A significant inverse association was observed between ERalpha mRNA levels in the fresh tissue group and subjects' ages. The results show that cryopreservation and thawing of human ovarian tissue does not affect the morphology of primordial or primary follicles and that cryopreservation does not affect apoptosis. However, cryopreservation seems to have an inhibitory effect on the level of ERbeta. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the differential effects of freezing follicles at different stages of follicular development and ovarian steroidogenesis.

Analysis of psoriatic patients registered in Asahikawa Medical College Hospital from 1983 to 2007. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which has been increasing during the last 50 years in Japan. The aim of the present study is to analyze psoriatic patients registered from 1983-2007 in Asahikawa Medical College Hospital, which is located in the northern part of Japan. A total of 607 cases were registered at the first inspection in the Department of Dermatology, Asahikawa Medical College. Men (403 cases, 66.4%) were predominant over women (204 cases, 33.6%). The clinical types of psoriasis were psoriasis vulgaris (91.5%), guttate psoriasis (4.2%), psoriasis arthropathica (2.8%), psoriatic erythroderma (0.6%), generalized pustular psoriasis (0.6%), localized pustular psoriasis (0.15%) and infantile psoriasis (0.15%). Topical corticosteroids (78.1%) and vitamin D3 (18.1%) products were the main previous topical agents. Previous systemic treatments included etretinate (7.7%), cyclosporine (1.5%) and methotrexate (0.3%). Use of topical vitamin D3 and cyclosporine therapies have been gradually increasing during the past 25 years. Regarding the previous phototherapy, topical psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy (PUVA) (4.9%) was predominant over ultraviolet B (0.9%), and systemic PUVA (0.7%). Use of ultraviolet B phototherapy has been increasing during the past 5 years. The results are essentially similar to those of a survey of psoriasis in Japan from 1982-2001. Although the incidence of psoriasis might be higher in Hokkaido Prefecture, there is essentially no variation in the disease profile of psoriatic patients.

Intervening inhibition underlies simple-cell receptive field structure in visual cortex. Synaptic inputs underlying spike receptive fields are important for understanding mechanisms of neuronal processing. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from neurons in mouse primary visual cortex, we examined the spatial patterns of their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs evoked by On and Off stimuli. Neurons with either segregated or overlapped On/Off spike subfields had substantial overlaps between all the four synaptic subfields. The segregated receptive-field structures were generated by the integration of excitation and inhibition with a stereotypic 'overlap-but-mismatched' pattern: the peaks of excitatory On/Off subfields were separated and flanked colocalized peaks of inhibitory On/Off subfields. The small mismatch of excitation/inhibition led to an asymmetric inhibitory shaping of On/Off spatial tunings, resulting in a great enhancement of their distinctiveness. Thus, slightly separated On/Off excitation, together with intervening inhibition, can create simple-cell receptive-field structure and the dichotomy of receptive-field structures may arise from a fine-tuning of the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs.

The critical role of hemodynamics in the development of cerebral vascular disease. Atherosclerosis and intracranial saccular aneurysms predictably localize in areas with complex arterial geometries such as bifurcations and curvatures. These sites are characterized by unique hemodynamic conditions that possibly influence the risk for these disorders. One hemodynamic parameter in particular has emerged as a key regulator of vascular biology--wall shear stress (WSS). Variations in geometry can change the distribution and magnitude of WSS, thus influencing the risk for vascular disorders. Computer simulations conducted using patient-specific data have suggested that departures from normal levels of WSS lead to aneurysm formation and progression. In addition, multiple studies indicate that disturbed flow and low WSS predispose patients to extracranial atherosclerosis, and particularly to carotid artery disease. Conversely, in the case of intracranial atherosclerosis, more studies are needed to provide a firm link between hemodynamics and atherogenesis. The recognition of WSS as an important factor in cerebral vascular disease may help to identify individuals at risk and guide treatment options.

Clinical characteristics of renal cell carcinoma in Korean patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease compared to sporadic bilateral or multifocal renal cell carcinoma. This study was done to analyze the clinical characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in Korean patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Between January 1996 and July 2008, 1,514 patients were diagnosed with RCC and 24 patients were diagnosed with VHL disease at our institute. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the 24 patients diagnosed with VHL. The mean age of patients with VHL was 39.2+/-12.6 yr; the mean age of patients with both VHL and RCC was 42.5+/-10.3 yr. Among the 24 patients with VHL, 7 patients had retinal angiomas, 11 had RCC, 16 had renal lesions, 18 had pancreatic lesions and 21 had cerebellar hemangioblastomas. There was no significant difference between survival rates of patients with VHL alone and those with VHL and RCC. However, cancer-specific survival rates were significantly different between patients with both VHL and RCC and patients with sporadic bilateral or multifocal RCC. In our Korean study, the incidence of RCC in patients with VHL disease is 45.8% and the incidence of VHL disease in patients with RCC is 0.73%. Due to the low overall incidence of VHL in Korea, extended multi-institutional studies are needed to establish the true characteristics of VHL disease.

Non-traumatic nasal septal abscess in an immunocompetent patient. Nasal septal abscess is an uncommon condition. Most commonly it is secondary to nasal trauma, which leads to haematoma, and subsequent abscess formation. There are other less common causes like sinusitis, dental infections and furunculosis. Non-traumatic nasal septal abscess has also been reported in immunocompromised individuals. We report a case of non-traumatic, spontaneous nasal septal abscess, in a healthy immunocompetent patient with no evidence of sinusitis or other localized infections. Using Medline and Google.co.uk search applications, there has been one previous report of such a condition. We stress the importance of excluding nasal septal abscess in patients presenting with nasal obstruction especially with signs of toxaemia.

Reporting biological assay screening results for maximum impact. A very large corpus of biological assay screening results exist in the public domain. The ability to compare and analyze this data is hampered due to missing details and lack of a commonly used terminology to describe assay protocols and assay endpoints. Minimum reporting guidelines exist that, if followed, would greatly enhance the utility of biological assay screening data so it may be independently reproduced, readily integrated, effectively compared, and rapidly analyzed. 


Acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by H9N2 virus in mice.

Comparison of magnitude of astigmatism induced by lateral rectus recession. To study the relationship between the amount of surgical recession with magnitude and axis of induced astigmatism. From March 2003 to April 2007, 62 patients with intermittent exotropia who had undergone unilateral or bilateral lateral rectus recession were identified retrospectively. The subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 (34 eyes, 34 patients) with a lateral rectus recession < or = 9.5 mm and group 2 (56 eyes, 28 patients) with a recession < or = 8 mm. Induced astigmatism was defined as the difference between preoperative and postoperative astigmatism, which was calculated using double-angle vector analysis. Cylinder power and axis of induced astigmatism were analyzed at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. Larger changes in induced astigmatism were found in group 1 than in group 2 at 1 week after recession (0.8 D cylinder, axis 91 degrees vs. 0.3 D cylinder, axis 88 degrees, Student's t-test, p < 0.01). There was a statistically meaningful correlation between the amount of recession and the cylinder power of induced astigmatism at 1 week after recession (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.27, p < 0.01). However, this significant difference between the two groups was not maintained thereafter. Relaxation of astigmatism was observed toward the preoperative value over time in both groups; however, there was a statistically significant difference in the cylinder power of induced astigmatism compared with that of preoperative astigmatism in both groups until the 3-month follow-up (p < 0.01). The larger recessions had more induced astigmatism during the first week after surgery. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of induced astigmatism thereafter between the two groups. Large lateral rectus recession does not seem to produce a sustained astigmatic change compared with moderate recession.

Classification and Epidemiology of Traumatic Dentoalveolar Injuries in Dogs and Cats: 959 Injuries in 660 Patient Visits (2004-2012). The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology of traumatic dentoalveolar injuries (TDI) in dogs and cats and to evaluate the applicability of a human classification system for TDI in dogs and cats. All patients diagnosed with a TDI were identified from the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service case log and the hospital patient processing software. The study population consisted of 621 dogs and cats, in a total of 660 patient visits from 2004 to 2012, admitted for oral treatment and subsequently diagnosed with at least one TDI Medical records including diagnostic imaging studies were reviewed to group the injury according to a classification system used in humans for TDI. Patient signalment, tooth injured, and number of injuries per patient were recorded and tabulated. The overall prevalence of TDI was 26.2%. The mean +/- SD number of TDI per patient was 1.45 +/- 0.85. All 14 classes of TDI recognized by the classification system utilized in humans were identified, and all (100%) TDI identified in this study were classifiable using this system. Enamel-dentin-pulp fracture was the most common TDI (49.6%). The most commonly injured teeth were the mandibular or maxillary canine teeth (35.5%). The most common age for dogs and cats with TDI were 3-6 years (33.0%) and 7-10 years (31.3%). With a frequency of 1 in 4 animals, TDI are common and represent a significant pet health concern. Most TDI are considered severe and require timely, and sometimes immediate, treatment. The adoption and utilization of a complete classification system, such as the one used in this study, is recommended in order to improve future epidemiological study of TDI in animals.

Preferred and actual participation roles during health care decision making in persons with cancer: a systematic review. The preferred and actual participation roles during decision making have been studied over the past two decades; however, there is a lack of evidence on the degree of match between patients' preferred and actual participation roles during decision making. A systematic review was carried out to identify published studies that examined preferred and actual participation roles and the match between preferred and actual roles in decision making among patients with cancer. PubMed (1966 to January 2009), PsycINFO (1967 to January 2009), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2009) databases were searched to access relevant medical, psychological, and nursing literature. Twenty-two studies involving patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, gynecological, and other cancers showed discrepancies between preferred and actual roles in decision making. These groups of patients wanted a more shared or an active role versus a less passive role. Across all cancer types, patients wanted more participation than what actually occurred. Research to date documents a pervasive mismatch between patients' preferred and actual roles during decision making. Yet, there is lack of innovative interventions that can potentially increase matching of patients' preferred and actual role during decision making. Role preferences are dynamic and vary greatly during decision making, requiring regular clinical assessment to meet patients' expectations and improve satisfaction with treatment decisions.

Quantification of functional alterations after in vitro traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by mechanical forces, producing tissue deformation at the moment of injury. Complex cellular, neurochemical and metabolic alterations are initiated by the deformation and result in delayed cell death and dysfunction. Using an in vitro model of TBI based on organotypic brain slice cultures, we have quantitatively studied the relationship between tissue deformation and functional outcome. Specifically, we studied the effects of low levels of tissue deformation on the functional outcomes as measured by electrophysiology recordings. In response to 5% and 10% biaxial Lagrangian strain, the maximal evoked response and the excitability of neural networks were found to be decreased. Additionally, the different anatomic subregions of the hippocampus displayed different levels of impairment to the injuries. These results suggest that the network function was affected by low levels of applied strain which induced minimal cell death in previous studies.

Wavelet analysis to detect gait events.

Some putative prebiotics increase the severity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in mice. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients believed to beneficially affect host health by selectively stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria residing in the gut. Such beneficial bacteria have been reported to protect against pathogenic infections. However, contradicting results on prevention of Salmonella infections with prebiotics have been published. The aim of the present study was to examine whether S. Typhimurium SL1344 infection in mice could be prevented by administration of dietary carbohydrates with different structures and digestibility profiles. BALB/c mice were fed a diet containing 10% of either of the following carbohydrates: inulin, fructo-oligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, galacto-oligosaccharide, apple pectin, polydextrose or beta-glucan for three weeks prior to oral Salmonella challenge (107 CFU) and compared to mice fed a cornstarch-based control diet. The mice fed with diets containing fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) or xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) had significantly higher (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05) numbers of S. Typhimurium SL1344 in liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes when compared to the mice fed with the cornstarch-based control diet. Significantly increased amounts (P < 0.01) of Salmonella were detected in ileal and fecal contents of mice fed with diets supplemented with apple pectin, however these mice did not show significantly higher numbers of S. Typhimyrium in liver, spleen and lymph nodes than animals from the control group (P < 0.20).The acute-phase protein haptoglobin was a good marker for translocation of S. Typhimurium in mice. In accordance with the increased counts of Salmonella in the organs, serum concentrations of haptoglobin were significantly increased in the mice fed with FOS or XOS (P < 0.001). Caecum weight was increased in the mice fed with FOS (P < 0.01), XOS (P < 0.01), or polydextrose (P < 0.001), and caecal pH was reduced in the mice fed with polydextrose (P < 0.001). In vitro fermentation in monocultures revealed that S. Typhimurium SL1344 is capable of fermenting FOS, beta-glucan and GOS with a corresponding decline in pH. Supplementing a cornstarch-based rodent diet with 10% FOS or XOS was found to increase the translocation of S. Typhimurium SL1344 to internal organs in mice, while 10% apple pectin was found to increase the numbers of S. Typhimurium in intestinal content and feces.

"I felt for a long time like everything beautiful in me had been taken out": Women's suffering, remembering, and survival following the loss of child custody. Child Protective Services' (CPS) placements of children in out-of-home care disproportionately impact families marginalized by poverty, racism and criminalization. CPS' mandate to protect children from neglect and abuse is frequently criticized as failing to address the multiple social and structural domains shaping parents' lives, especially mothers. We conducted a thematic narrative analysis of in-depth interviews to explore the impact of child custody loss on 19 women who use drugs residing in Toronto, Canada. We also assessed the potential roles of intersectional forms of violence and inequities in power that can both give rise to child custody loss and mediate its consequences. Trauma was identified as a key impact of separation, further exacerbated by women's cumulative trauma histories and ongoing mother-child apartness. Women described this trauma as unbearable and reported persistent symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions. Practices of dissociation through increased use of drugs and alcohol were central in tending to the pain of separation, and were often synergistically reinforced by heightened structural vulnerability observed in increased exposure to housing instability, intimate partner violence, and initiation of injection drug use and sex work. Women's survival hinged largely on hopefulness of reuniting with children, a goal pivotal to their sense of future and day-to-day intentions toward ameliorated life circumstances. Findings highlight needs for strategies addressing women's health and structural vulnerability following custody loss and also direct attention to altering institutional processes to support community-based alternatives to parent-child separation.

[Synthetic biology for metabolic engineering--a review]. In the last few decades, with the development of recombinant DNA technology, metabolic engineering has made tremendous advances. Synthetic biology is a newly and rapidly emerging discipline. It has great potential in assisting and simplifying the study of metabolic engineering. This review focuses on the recent development of synthetic biology and its application in optimizing metabolic pathway and engineering cellular chassis.

Stanniocalcin-1 Potently Inhibits the Proteolytic Activity of the Metalloproteinase Pregnancy-associated Plasma Protein-A. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is a disulfide-bound homodimeric glycoprotein, first identified as a hypocalcemic hormone important for maintaining calcium homeostasis in teleost fish. STC1 was later found to be widely expressed in mammals, although it is not believed to function in systemic calcium regulation in these species. Several physiological functions of STC1 have been reported, although many molecular details are still lacking. We here demonstrate that STC1 is an inhibitor of the metzincin metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which modulates insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling through proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). STC1 potently (Ki = 68 pm) inhibits PAPP-A cleavage of IGFBP-4, and we show in a cell-based assay that STC1 effectively antagonizes PAPP-A-mediated type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation. It has recently been found that the homologous STC2 inhibits PAPP-A proteolytic activity, and that this depends on the formation of a covalent complex between the inhibitor and the proteinase, mediated by Cys-120 of STC2. We find that STC1 is unable to bind covalently to PAPP-A, in agreement with the absence of a corresponding cysteine residue. It rather binds to PAPP-A with high affinity (KD = 75 pm). We further demonstrate that both STC1 and STC2 show inhibitory activity toward PAPP-A2, but not selected serine proteinases and metalloproteinases. We therefore conclude that the STCs are proteinase inhibitors, probably restricted in specificity to the pappalysin family of metzincin metalloproteinases. Our data are the first to identify STC1 as a proteinase inhibitor, suggesting a previously unrecognized function of STC1 in the IGF system. 

Suppression of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamottin via the inhibition of protein kinase Cdelta/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of bergamottin, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor from Citrus paradis (grapefruit), on tumor invasion and migration and the possible mechanisms involved in this inhibition were investigated in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. Bergamottin reduced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced activation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and further inhibited cell invasion and migration. Bergamottin suppressed PMA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 protein, mRNA and transcription activity levels through suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation without changing the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 level. Bergamottin also reduced PMA-enhanced MMP-2 expression through suppression of membrane-type 1 MMP, but did not alter tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 levels. Bergamottin inhibited PMA-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and IkappaBalpha degradation, which are upstream of PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion. Furthermore, bergamottin strongly repressed the PMA-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are dependent on the protein kinase C-delta pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the anti-invasive effects of bergamottin might occur through inhibition of protein kinase C-delta, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and JNK phosphorylation and reduction of NF-kappaB activation, leading to downregulation of MMP-9 expression. These results suggest that the suppression of MMP expression contributes, at least in part, to the antitumor activity of bergamottin.


Spectral affinity in protein networks.

Off-the-shelf mobile handset environments for deploying accelerometer based gait and activity analysis algorithms. Over the last decade, there has been substantial research interest in the application of accelerometry data for many forms of automated gait and activity analysis algorithms. This paper introduces a summary of new "of-the-shelf" mobile phone handset platforms containing embedded accelerometers which support the development of custom software to implement real time analysis of the accelerometer data. An overview of the main software programming environments which support the development of such software, including Java ME based JSR 256 API, C++ based Motion Sensor API and the Python based "aXYZ" module, is provided. Finally, a sample application is introduced and its performance evaluated in order to illustrate how a standard mobile phone can be used to detect gait activity using such a non-intrusive and easily accepted sensing platform.

Serum adiponectin levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes: Serial changes and relation to infarct size. The role of adiponectin in patients with acute coronary syndromes is incompletely defined. This study investigated adiponectin levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes and the association between adiponectin and 30-day infarct size and 1-year clinical outcomes. Retrospective analysis of 120 participants with acute coronary syndromes enrolled in the Immediate Myocardial Metabolic Enhancement During Initial Assessment and Treatment in Emergency care Trial. Blood levels were tested three times within 24 h of onset of ischaemic symptoms. Infarct size was measured at 30 days. The 1-year clinical outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. Using linear mixed models, log adiponectin levels decreased by -0.005 µg/mL per hour (p = 0.035). After stratifying the analysis by gender, there was no decrease in log adiponectin in men; however, levels decreased by -0.01 µg/mL per hour in women (p = 0.02). Results of multivariable regression models showed no association between log adiponectin and infarct size (β = -1.1, p = 0.64). Log adiponectin levels did not predict 1-year outcomes using Cox-proportional hazard models. There was a small decrease in plasma adiponectin shortly after symptoms of ischaemia, more noticeable in women. No relationship was found between adiponectin and infarct size or clinical outcomes. This adds to evidence showing no clear association between adiponectin and adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

Spectral analysis of heart period and pulse transit time derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram in sepsis patients. Sepsis is a potentially lethal condition, and is one of the major causes of death in non-coronary intensive care units. Sepsis syndrome progresses through a number of increasingly severe stages, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) through sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Each stage of sepsis is potentially characterized by differing autonomic nervous system responses. Spectral analysis of cardiovascular variability has been regarded as a possible non-invasive method to study this autonomic regulation, and in this study, the variabilities of heart period (RRi) and pulse transit time (PTT) derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethys-mogram were investigated in three different groups: normal subjects (n = 11), SIRS (n = 7) and severe sepsis patients (n = 16), by computing spectral and cross-spectral measures in the low-frequency (LF) and the high-frequency (HF) ranges. SIRS and severe sepsis patients were found to have lower RRi (p < 0.01), augmented LF power in PTT (p < 0.01) and a lower RRi-PTT ratio (alpha(PTT)) in the LF and HF bands (p < 0.01) as compared with the normal subjects, which might indicate a suppression of baroreflex-mediated autonomic control of heart rate and an increased sympathetic influence on ventricular contractility in sepsis. The results have highlighted the potential value of spectral analysis of RRi and PTT variabilities as a non-invasive tool for clinical evaluation of cardiac autonomic regulation in sepsis patients.

Distinct passenger strand and mRNA cleavage activities of human Argonaute proteins. Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind to small RNAs and mediate small RNA-induced silencing in eukaryotes. Using a minimal in vitro system, we show that bacterially expressed human AGO1 and AGO2 but not AGO3 and AGO4 possess strand-dissociating activity of microRNA (miRNA) duplexes. Both AGO1 and AGO2 function as RNA chaperones, capable of performing multiple rounds of strand dissociation. Unexpectedly, both AGO1 and AGO2 demonstrate passenger strand cleavage activity of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex, but only AGO2 has target RNA cleavage activity. These observations indicate that passenger strand and mRNA endonuclease activities are mechanistically distinct. We further validate these observations in mammalian extracts and cultured mammalian cells, in which we demonstrate that AGO1 uses only miRNA duplexes when assembling translational repression-competent complexes, whereas AGO2 can use both miRNA and siRNA duplexes. We show that passenger strand cleavage and RNA chaperone activities that are intrinsic to both AGO1 and AGO2 are sufficient for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading.

Underlying mechanism of drug-drug interaction between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil: Gemfibrozil acyl-glucuronide is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C8. While co-administered gemfibrozil can increase the area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) of pioglitazone more than 3-fold, the underlying mechanism of the drug-drug interaction between gemfibrozil and pioglitazone has not been fully understood. In the present study, gemfibrozil preincubation time-dependently inhibited the metabolism of pioglitazone in the cytochrome P450 (CYP)- and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-activated human liver microsomes. We estimated the kinact and K'app values, which are the maximum inactivation rate constant and the apparent dissociation constant, of gemfibrozil to be 0.071 min(-1) and 57.3 μM, respectively. In this study, the kobs, in vivo value was defined as a parameter that indicates the potency of the mechanism-based inhibitory effect at the blood drug concentration in vivo. The kobs, in vivo values of potent mechanism-based inhibitors, clarithromycin and erythromycin, were estimated to be 0.0096 min(-1) and 0.0051 min(-1), respectively. The kobs, in vivo value of gemfibrozil was 0.0060 min(-1), which was comparable to those of clarithromycin and erythromycin, suggesting that gemfibrozil could be a mechanism-based inhibitor as potent as clarithromycin and erythromycin in vivo.

Parathyroidectomy decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of parathyroidectomy on systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) in hypertensive patients with PHPT. A retrospective review of medical records was performed in 368 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy and 96 patients undergoing thyroidectomy by a single surgeon. We evaluated changes in serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and BP before and 6 months after surgery. In patients undergoing parathyroidectomy with hypertension (n = 147), a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP was observed; systolic BP decreased from 152.5 +/- 10.5 to 140.3 +/- 16.2 mmHg (P < .001) and diastolic BP decreased from 94.5 +/- 6.8 to 81.7 +/- 10.3 mmHg (P < .001). In these patients, PTH decreased from 136 +/- 186 to 58.7 +/- 44.3 pg/mL (P < .001) and serum calcium decreased from 11.1 +/- 0.6 to 9.5 +/- 0.7 mg/dL (P < .001). In patients undergoing parathyroidectomy without hypertension (n = 145) and thyroidectomy alone (n = 96), no significant change in systolic or diastolic BP was observed. Parathyroidectomy in hypertensive patients seems to reduce both systolic and diastolic BP . The mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown and deserve further study.

Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae in Taiwan and comparison of 3 phenotypic confirmatory methods for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacter cloacae remains unclear in Taiwan. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. cloacae in Taiwan. 116 clinical isolates of E. cloacae were tested for cefepime susceptibility. Isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime were tested for the ESBL phenotype by the combination-disk synergy tests (CDSTs) using cefotaxime and ceftazidime alone or in combination with clavulanic acid, the ESBL Etest using cefepime with or without clavulanic acid, and the double-disk synergy test (DDST) using cefepime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Thirty eight isolates had an MIC of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime. Of these, 27 had an ESBL phenotype; 24 were determined by DDST, 25 by CDST, and 21 by ESBL Etest. ESBL genes were identified in 24 isolates. One isolate without an ESBL phenotype but with an MIC of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime was confirmed to have the ESBL gene. DDST, CDSTs, and ESBL Etest detected 24, 22, and 21 of 25 isolates with the ESBL genotype, respectively. DDST had the highest sensitivity of 96.0% for detecting ESBLs among isolates and a specificity of 69.2%. CDSTs and ESBL Etest had sensitivities of 88.0% and 84.0%, respectively, and specificities of 69.2% and 100%, respectively. The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing E. cloacae was 21.6%. A combination of DDST using cefepime and amoxicillin-clavulanate and CDSTs using cefotaxime and ceftazidime alone or in combination with clavulanic acid enhance the detection of ESBL production in Taiwan.

Contraceptive service needs of women with young children presenting for pediatric care. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the need for contraceptive services and contraceptive method use among women with young children presenting to child health clinics. A secondary objective is to characterize the factors, including access to care and health needs, that exist in this population and to evaluate their association with contraceptive method use. This is a cross-sectional study of women with children under age 36 months presenting to four child health practices in the Baltimore, Maryland, area. Participating women completed a survey to assess desire for pregnancy, contraceptive method use and related characteristics. A total of 238 participants (82%) were in need of contraceptive services (fertile and not desiring pregnancy). Overall, 59 (25%) of women in need were not using a contraceptive method (unmet need) and 79 (33%) were using a highly effective method (implant or intrauterine device). Factors associated with lower odds of unmet need for contraceptive services included attendance at a routine postpartum visit and visiting a healthcare provider to discuss contraception after pregnancy. Approximately half of index pregnancies were unintended and this was the only health factor associated with greater odds of using of a highly effective contraceptive method. Most women presenting with young children for pediatric care indicated that they were not currently trying to become pregnant and reported current methods of pregnancy prevention that ranged from none to highly effective. Women who had not sought postpregnancy contraceptive care were more likely to have unmet need for contraceptive services. Child health clinics may be a novel site for providing contraceptive care to women with children as part of a strategy to reduce unplanned pregnancies.

Bisexuality, sexual risk taking, and HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men accessing voluntary counseling and testing services in Mumbai, India. To describe sociodemographics, sexual risk behavior, and estimate HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Mumbai, India. Eight hundred thirty-one MSM attending voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services at the Humsafar Trust, answered a behavioral questionnaire and consented for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and HIV testing from January 2003 through December 2004. Multivariate logistic regression was performed for sociodemographics, sexual risk behavior, and STIs with HIV result as an outcome. HIV prevalence among MSM was 12.5%. MSM who were illiterate [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08 to 4.84], married (AOR 2.70; 95% CI: 1,56 to 4.76), preferred male partners (AOR 4.68; 95% CI: 1.90 to 11.51), had partners of both genders (AOR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.23), presented with an STI (AOR 3.31; 95% CI: 1.96 to 5.61); or presented with a reactive venereal disease research laboratory test (AOR 4.92; 95% CI: 2.55 to 9.53) at their VCT visit were more likely to be HIV infected. MSM accessing VCT services in Mumbai have a high risk of STI and HIV acquisition. Culturally appropriate interventions that focus on sexual risk behavior and promote condom use among MSM, particularly the bridge population of bisexual men, are needed to slow the urban Indian AIDS epidemic.

Altered lung function at mid-adulthood in mice following neonatal exposure to hyperoxia. Infants born very preterm are usually exposed to high oxygen concentrations but this may impair lung function in survivors in later life. However, the precise changes involved are poorly understood. We determined how neonatal hyperoxia alters lung function at mid-adulthood in mice. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice inhaled 65% oxygen (HE group) from birth for 7 days. They then breathed room air until 11 months of age (P11mo); these mice experienced growth restriction. Controls breathed only room air. To exclude the effects of growth restriction, a group of dams was rotated between hyperoxia and normoxia during the exposure period (HE+DR group). Lung function was measured at P11mo. HE mice had increased inspiratory capacity, work of breathing and tissue damping. HE+DR mice had further increases in inspiratory capacity and work of breathing, and reduced FEV100/FVC. Total lung capacity was increased in HE+DR males. HE males had elevated responses to methacholine. Neonatal hyperoxia alters lung function at mid-adulthood, especially in males. 

Screening of antimycotics in Swedish sewage treatment plants--waters and sludge. Concentrations of six pharmaceutical antimycotics were determined in the sewage water, final effluent and sludge of five Swedish sewage treatment plants (STPs) by solid phase extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The antimycotics were quantified by internal standard calibration. The results were used to estimate national flows that were compared to predictions based on sales figures. Fluconazole was the only one of the six investigated antimycotics that was detected (at concentrations ranging from 90 to 140 ng L(-1)) in both raw sewage water and final effluent. Negligible amounts of this substance were removed from the aqueous phase, and its levels were below the limit of quantification in all of the analyzed sludge samples. In contrast, clotrimazole, ketoconazole and econazole were present in all of the sludge samples, at concentrations ranging between 200 and 1000 microg kg(-1), dry weight. There were close correlations between the national measured and predicted antimycotic mass flows. Antimycotic fate analysis, based on sales figures, indicated that 53% of the total amount of fluconazole sold appeared in the final effluents of the STPs, while 1, 155, 35, 209 and 41% of the terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, econazole and miconazole sold appeared in the digested dewatered sludge.


Stereo Photo Measured ONH Shape Predicts Development of POAG in Subjects With Ocular Hypertension.

Simultaneous recording of brain activity and functional connectivity in the mouse brain. Combining of two measurement system of different scale in the mouse brain has been challenging issue due to the small size of the mouse brain. We present a novel approach to record brain activity and connectivity simultaneously by using intracranial electrode and flexible multichannel film electrode. 40 channel ultra-thin nanofabricated microelectrode covering the mouse skull was applied in this study. The null space in the microarray was cut off so that the secondary sensor or stimulator can approach to the brain. Hereby, we performed a simultaneous recording of local field potential and multichannel EEG recording in a freely moving mouse under pharmacologically driven absence seizure. A brain activity in the thalamus was depicted together with cortical EEG map. The connectivity levels between different cortical sites or between thalamus and cortical site were measured during seizure. The time lag map of cortical EEG with respect to the thalamus represents the propagation delay of the seizure.

Factors for determining survival in acute organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphate poisoning has a high mortality rate. Recently, differences among organophosphorus insecticides in human self-poisoning were reported. This study investigated the prognostic risk factors and the mortality of different organophosphates following acute organophosphate poisoning. This retrospective study included 68 patients with acute organophosphate poisoning. We investigated patient survival according to initial parameters, including the initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, serum cholinesterase level, and hemoperfusion and evaluated the mortality according to organophosphate types. Thirteen of the 68 patients died. The agents responsible for mortality were different. The APACHE II score was a significant predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.194; p<0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089 to 1.309) and respiratory failure (OR, 1.273; p<0.01; 95% CI, 1.122 to 1.444). The mortality was 0% for dichlorvos, malathion, chlorpyrifos and profenofos. However, other organophosphates showed different mortality (16.7% for O-ethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate, 25% for phenthoate, 37.5% for phosphamidon, 50% for methidathion). The usefulness of hemoperfusion appears to be limited. The initial APACHE II score is a useful prognostic indicator, and different organophosphates have different mortality.

Corticotropin releasing factor in the rat colon: expression, localization and upregulation by endotoxin. Little is known about CRF expression and regulation in the rat colon compared to the brain. We investigated CRF gene expression, cellular location, and regulation by endotoxin and corticosterone in the male rat colon at 6h after intraperitoneal (ip) injection. CRF mRNA level, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was 1.3-fold higher in the distal than proximal colon and 3.4-fold higher in the proximal colonic submucosa plus muscle layers than in mucosa. CRF immunoreactivity was located in the epithelia, lamina propria and crypts, and co-localized with tryptophan hydroxylase, a marker for enterochromaffin (EC) cells, and in enteric neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 microg/kg, ip) increased defecation by 2.9-fold and upregulated CRF mRNA by 2.5-fold in the proximal and 1.1-fold in the distal colon while there was no change induced by corticosterone as monitored by quantitative PCR. LPS-induced increased CRF mRNA expression occurred in the submucosa plus muscle layers (1.5-fold) and the mucosa of proximal colon (0.9-fold). LPS increased significantly CRF immunoreactivity in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of proximal and distal colon compared to saline groups. These results indicate that in rats, CRF is expressed in both proximal and distal colon and more prominently in enteric neurons of the submucosa plus muscle layers and subject to upregulation at the gene and protein levels by LPS through corticosteroid independent pathways. These data suggests that colonic CRF may be part of the local effector limb of the CRF(1) receptor mediated colonic alterations induced by acute stress.

The effects of behavioral skills training on caregiver implementation of guided compliance. The effectiveness of a behavioral skills training package that consisted of modeling, rehearsal, and feedback was evaluated to increase correct implementation of guided compliance by caregivers of 3 children who exhibited noncompliance. Results showed that the training package improved performance of guided compliance. Generalization probes indicated that the skills learned were exhibited in different settings 3 to 6 weeks after training ended.

The BAM complex subunit BamE (SmpA) is required for membrane integrity, stalk growth and normal levels of outer membrane {beta}-barrel proteins in Caulobacter crescentus. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is an essential compartment containing a specific complement of lipids and proteins that constitute a protective, selective permeability barrier. Outer membrane beta-barrel proteins are assembled into the membrane by the essential hetero-oligomeric BAM complex, which contains the lipoprotein BamE. We have identified a homologue of BamE, encoded by CC1365, which is located in the outer membrane of the stalked alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. BamE associates with proteins whose homologues in other bacteria are known to participate in outer membrane protein assembly: BamA (CC1915), BamB (CC1653) and BamD (CC1984). Caulobacter cells lacking BamE grow slowly in rich medium and are hypersensitive to anionic detergents, some antibiotics and heat exposure, which suggest that the membrane integrity of the mutant is compromised. Membranes of the DeltabamE mutant have normal amounts of the outer membrane protein RsaF, a TolC homologue, but are deficient in CpaC*, an aggregated form of the outer membrane secretin for type IV pili. Delta bamE membranes also contain greatly reduced amounts of three TonB-dependent receptors that are abundant in wild-type cells. Cells lacking BamE have short stalks and are delayed in stalk outgrowth during the cell cycle. Based on these findings, we propose that Caulobacter BamE participates in the assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, including one or more substrates required for the initiation of stalk biogenesis.

[Rapid determination of melamine in eggs by high performance liquid chromatography]. A rapid method for the determination of melamine in eggs was established using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The melamine in a test sample was extracted with ultrasonic in 1% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and then purified with precipitation, centrifugation and filtration, at last tested by HPLC system. The total time of HPLC analysis for each sample was only 10 min. The linear range was from 0.05 to 20.0 mg/L as the linear correlation coefficient was 0. 999 9. The limit of quantification was 0. 10 mg/kg (S/N > 10). The average recoveries were between 94.2% and 107% in the spiked range of 1.0 - 6.0 mg/kg in eggs. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of parallel determination were between 1.53% and 2.06% (n = 6). This method is simple, fast, sensitive and suitable for the determination of melamine in eggs.

[Mechanism of hedysari polysaccharide in the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HEP-G2 cells]. To study the effects of Hedysari polysaccharide (HPS) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HEP-G2 cells and its mechanism. MTT assay, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to the effects of HPS in anti-proliferation, cell cycle arresting and apoptosis induction. Flow cytometry was also used to detect the effects detect of HPS on protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax. HPS could cause apparent inhibition on cell growth, induce G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis on HEP-G2 cells. HPS could down-regulate bcl-2 protein expression and up-regulate Bax protein expression. HPS has anti-tumor effects, maybe by the way of inhibiting the cell growth, arresting the G2/M phase, inducing apoptosis, down-regulating bcl-2 and up-regulating Bax protein expression.

Mean platelet volume in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an indicator of platelet activation. Platelet activation and aggregation are central processes in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present up to one-third of the general population and the majority of patients with cardio-metabolic risk factors such as abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes and other components of the metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim of the current study was to investigate the MPV in patients who had NAFLD. MPV values of the patients with NAFLD and of the patients without fatty liver disease were compared. NAFLD patients had significantly higher body mass index compared to the control cases. Among biochemical variables, fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride were significantly higher in the NAFLD group. NAFLD cases also had lower platelet count and higher MPV (10.43 +/- 1.14 vs. 9.09 +/- 1.25; p < 0.001, respectively). MPV was positively correlated with AST (r: 0.186, p < 0.042), ALT level (r: 0.279; p 0.002) and the presence of NAFLD (0.492; p < 0.001) but negatively correlated with platelet number (r: -0.26; p 0.004) and creatinine (r: -0.255; p 0.005). In logistic regression analysis (age, gender, NAFLD, body mass index, high-density lipid (HDL) cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose were used as covariates) only NAFLD was found to be the independent predictor of MPV (Odds Ratio (OR) 21.98) [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.404-201.048; p: 0.006]. We have shown for the first time in the literature that, patients with NAFLD have higher MPV. It may have prognostic value in NAFLD patients indicating a possible cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk increase.

Proteomic comparison of detergent-extracted sperm proteins from bulls with different fertility indexes. Intrinsic factors such as proteins modulate the fertilising ability of male gametes. We compared detergent-extracted sperm protein composition of bulls with different fertility indexes in order to highlight putative fertility markers of sperm. Frozen semen from 23 Holstein bulls with documented fertility was used. According to their 'fertility solution' (SOL), as calculated by the Canadian dairy network, bulls were divided into four groups: high fertility (HF) (SOL>3.0; n=6), medium-HF (2.9>SOL>2.0; n=5), medium-low fertility (-2.8>SOL>-4.9; n=8) and low fertility (LF; SOL<-5.0; n=4), with a SOL=0 being the average. Triton X-100 protein extracts from ejaculated spermatozoa were subjected to two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, and polypeptide maps were quantitatively analysed by ImageMaster software. Nine protein spots showed significant differences between the HF and LF groups, and eight of these proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. T-complex protein 1 subunits epsilon and (CCT5 and CCT8), two isoforms of epididymal sperm-binding protein E12 (ELSPBP1), proteasome subunit alpha type-6 and binder of sperm 1 (BSP1) were more expressed in the LF group than in the HF group. On the other hand, adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK1) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) were more expressed in the HF group than in the LF group. The presence and expression level of ELSPBP1, BSP1, AK1 and PEBP1 were confirmed by western blot. A linear regression model established that CCT5 and AK1 explained 64% (P<0.001) of the fertility scores. The reported functions of these proteins are in agreement with a putative involvement in defective sperm physiology, where lower or higher levels can jeopardise sperm ability to reach and fertilise the oocyte.

Adiponectin: an indispensable molecule in rosiglitazone cardioprotection following myocardial infarction. Patients treated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist manifest favorable metabolic profiles associated with increased plasma adiponectin (APN). However, whether increased APN production as a result of PPAR-gamma agonist treatment is an epiphenomenon or is causatively related to the cardioprotective actions of PPAR-gamma remains unknown. To determine the role of APN in rosiglitazone (RSG) cardioprotection against ischemic heart injury. Adult male wild-type (WT) and APN knockdown/knockout (APN(+ or -) and APN(- or -)) mice were treated with vehicle or RSG (20 mg/kg per day), and subjected to coronary artery ligation 3 days after beginning treatment. In WT mice, RSG (7 days) significantly increased adipocyte APN expression, elevated plasma APN levels (2.6-fold), reduced infarct size (17% reduction), decreased apoptosis (0.23 + or - 0.02% versus 0.47 + or - 0.04% TUNEL-positive in remote nonischemic area), attenuated oxidative stress (48.5% reduction), and improved cardiac function (P<0.01). RSG-induced APN production and cardioprotection were significantly blunted (P<0.05 versus WT) in APN(+ or -), and completely lost in APN(- or -) (P>0.05 versus vehicle-treated APN(- or -) mice). Moreover, treatment with RSG for up to 14 days significantly improved the postischemic survival rate of WT mice (P<0.05 versus vehicle group) but not APN knockdown/knockout mice. The cardioprotective effects of PPAR-gamma agonists are critically dependent on its APN stimulatory action, suggesting that under pathological conditions where APN expression is impaired (such as advanced type 2 diabetes), the harmful cardiovascular effects of PPAR-gamma agonists may outweigh its cardioprotective benefits.

Elevated Plasma Soluble CD14 Levels Correlate with the Monocyte Response Status During Hantaan Virus Infection in Humans. Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. CD14, a pattern recognition receptor recognizing lipopolysaccharide, is highly expressed on monocytes and can be shed as soluble CD14 (sCD14) upon monocyte activation. To understand the role of sCD14 in HFRS, the sCD14 plasma concentrations from 45 HFRS patients were quantified, and the relationships between the plasma sCD14 level and the monocyte response status and clinical parameters were analyzed. The plasma sCD14 levels were significantly higher in the HFRS patients and they correlated with monocyte expansion and activation, which were characterized by increased blood monocyte counts, the proportion of CD14(++)CD16(+) intermediate monocytes, as well as elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and soluble CD163 (sCD163) levels. Additionally, the high plasma sCD14 levels positively correlated with white blood cell counts and blood urea nitrogen levels and negatively correlated with platelet counts in the HFRS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that elevated plasma sCD14 levels are associated with the monocyte response status during HTNV infection in humans. 

A deterministic model of home and community care client counts in British Columbia. In British Columbia (BC) Home and Community Care (HCC) services provide a range of health care and support services for British Columbians with acute, chronic, palliative or rehabilitative health care needs. Although it is not surprising that almost 80% of HCC clients are senior citizens (aged 65 and older), this does lead to some concern. In particular, the most recent population projections suggest that the senior population of BC will double in the next twenty years. Predicting how this will impact HCC is of high importance in preparing for future years. In this paper we discuss the development of a deterministic multistate Markov model of the HCC system, its validation, and its predictions for future client counts for various HCC client groupings. This model was originally developed for the BC Ministry of Health Services, and is currently being used as a first step to developing a strategic direction plan for BC's HCC sector. The model makes several notable steps forward in terms of research and modelling of HCC. First, past literature regarding models of HCC appears to be only concerned with publicly funded (government run) residential care environments. Our model advances this in two directions by including at home care and non-publicly funded care. Second, our model considers both the predicted changes in the age demographics of British Columbia, as well as the predicted changes in the relationship between age and health status.

Isolation and characterization of hyper phenol tolerant Bacillus sp. from oil refinery and exploration sites. Bacillus cereus MTCC 9817 strain AKG1 and B. cereus MTCC 9818 strain AKG2 were isolated from petroleum refinery and oil exploration site, respectively. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain AKG1 showed the closest relation to B. cereus 99.63% and Bacillus coagulans 99.63% followed by 99.34% homology with Bacillus thuringiensis strain 2PR56-10. AKG2 is mostly related to B. thuringiensis strain CMG 861 with 99.37% homology. The similarity search between AKG1 and AKG2 gave the lowest similarity 99.19% among same genus similar sequences. At phenol concentration of 1000 mg/L, the optimum growth conditions for AKG1 were found to be 37 degrees C and pH 7.0 and the same were found to be 37 degrees C and pH 7.5 for AKG2. The growth kinetics of the strains AKG1 and AKG2 are best fitted by Yano model (maximum growth rate, mu(max)=1.024 h(-1) and inhibition constant, K(I)=171,800 mg/L) and Edward model (mu(max)=0.5969 h(-1) and K(I)=1483 mg/L) respectively. Growth kinetics of both the strains are also well fitted by the Haldane model with mu(max)=0.4396 h(-1) and K(I)=637.8 mg/L for AKG1 and mu(max)=0.9332 h(-1) and K(I)=494.4 mg/L for AKG2.

Neuroprotective Effects of (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rats Through Attenuation of Inflammation. Stroke is the second leading cause of death among adults worldwide. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective functions in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms in this process and its contribution to the protection function remain unknown. The current study examined the neuroprotective effects of EGCG after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. tMCAO for 120 min was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with EGCG (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or Vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Neurological score, infarct ratio and inflammation-related molecules (assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantitative real-time PCR or western blotting) were estimated at 24 h after operation. EGCG prevented the impairment of neurological function and decreased the infarct volume, compared with the Vehicle group. The inflammation-related molecules TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 levels usually caused by ischemia/reperfusion were significantly ameliorated by EGCG. EGCG also inhibited the upregulation of nuclear factor-kappa B/p65 (NF-κB/p65), and induction of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The present study indicates that EGCG may be a promising therapeutic agent for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through attenuation of inflammation.

A higher meal frequency may be associated with diminished weight loss after bariatric surgery. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between meal frequency, the occurrence of vomiting and weight loss among patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass up to 9 months after surgery. Female patients (n = 80) were followed at 3-month intervals for 9 months. Weight, BMI, 24-hour dietary recall, drug consumption and vomiting episodes were recorded and compared with nutritional outcome. The BMI values at 3, 6 and 9 months were 45.1 +/- 9.7, 39.9 +/- 7.6 and 35.4 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2), respectively. The corresponding choleric intakes were 535.6 +/- 295.7, 677.1 +/- 314.7 and 828.6 +/- 398.2 kcal/day, and the numbers of daily meals were 5.0 +/- 2.5, 4.7 +/- 1.8 and 4.9 +/- 1.0, respectively. The peak of vomiting episodes occurred within 6 months; however, patients tolerated this complication despite its high prevalence. A significant negative correlation between weight loss and diet fractioning, but not vomiting, was observed throughout the entire postoperative period (P = 0.001). 1) Frequent small meals were associated with a reduction in weight loss after gastric bypass and a decrease in vomiting episodes at 6 months, and 2) vomiting did not interfere with nutritional outcome. Unless required because of vomiting or other reasons, multiple small meals may not be advantageous after such intervention.

Incidence and patterns of mandibular condyle fractures. The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of the prevalence, type, and treatment modalities of condylar fractures of the mandible. Data were collected from patients during an 8-year period (1999 to 2007). The data recorded included demographic data, etiology, diagnosis, type, dislocation, use of protective devices, state of the dentition, associated facial and general trauma, soft tissue lesions, treatment methods, and the interval between trauma and treatment. Data analysis included a descriptive analysis, chi(2) test, Fisher's exact test, t test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. During the 8-year period, 209 unilateral fractures and 54 bilateral fractures were treated, with a male/female ratio of 3.05:1 and a mean age of 28.4 years, for a total of 317 condylar fractures. Male gender was significantly associated with the presence of a condylar fracture (P < .05). The most common cause of condylar fractures was road traffic accidents (57.8%). Of the 317 fractures, 300 were classified as simple fractures, and 249 fractures were not displaced. Protective devices significantly decreased the number of condylar fractures occurring from road traffic accidents (P < .05). Symphysis fractures were significantly associated with both unilateral and bilateral fractures of the mandibular condyle (P < .05). Subcondylar displaced fractures were significantly associated with surgical treatment (P < .05). Young adults were involved in most of the accidents. Road traffic accidents were the main cause of condylar fractures. The mandatory use of safety helmets and seatbelts and education of those using the road are essential to decrease the number of facial fractures.

A novel subtype of AP-1-binding motif within the palmitoylated trans-Golgi network/endosomal accessory protein Gadkin/gamma-BAR. Membrane traffic between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes is mediated in part by the assembly of clathrin-AP-1 adaptor complex-coated vesicles. This process involves multiple accessory proteins that directly bind to the ear domain of AP-1gamma via degenerate peptide motifs that conform to the consensus sequence diameterG(P/D/E)(diameter/L/M) (with diameter being a large hydrophobic amino acid). Recently, gamma-BAR (hereafter referred to as Gadkin for reasons explained below) has been identified as a novel AP-1 recruitment factor involved in AP-1-dependent endosomal trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. How precisely Gadkin interacts with membranes and with AP-1gamma has remained unclear. Here we show that Gadkin is an S-palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein that lacks stable tertiary structure. S-Palmitoylation is required for the recruitment of Gadkin to TGN/endosomal membranes but not for binding to AP-1. Furthermore, we identify a novel subtype of AP-1-binding motif within Gadkin that specifically associates with the gamma1-adaptin ear domain. Mutational inactivation of this novel type of motif, either alone or in combination with three more conventional AP-1gamma binding peptides, causes Gadkin to mislocalize to the plasma membrane and interferes with its ability to render AP-1 brefeldin A-resistant, indicating its physiological importance. Our studies thus unravel the molecular basis for Gadkin-mediated AP-1 recruitment to TGN/endosomal membranes and identify a novel subtype of the AP-1-binding motif.

Distinct transcriptional profiles characterize bone microenvironment mesenchymal cells rather than osteoblasts in relationship with multiple myeloma bone disease. Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a high incidence of osteolytic bone lesions, which have been previously correlated with the gene expression profiles of MM cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional patterns of cells in the bone microenvironment and their relationships with the presence of osteolysis in MM patients. Both mesenchymal (MSC) and osteoblastic (OB) cells were isolated directly from bone biopsies of MM patients and controls to perform gene expression profiling by microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction on selected bone-related genes. We identified a series of upregulated and downregulated genes that were differentially expressed in the MSC cells of osteolytic and nonosteolytic patients. Comparison of the osteolytic and nonosteolytic samples also showed that the MSC cells and OB had distinct transcriptional patterns. No significantly modulated genes were found in the OBs of the osteolytic and nonosteolytic patients. Our data suggest that the gene expression profiles of cells of the bone microenvironment are different in MM patients and controls, and that MSC cells, but not OBs, have a distinct transcriptional pattern associated with the occurrence of bone lesions in MM patients. These data support the idea that alterations in MSC cells may be involved in MM bone disease.

Triamcinolone attenuates macrophage/microglia accumulation associated with NMDA-induced RGC death and facilitates survival of Müller stem cell grafts. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in glaucoma models is associated with accumulation of activated microglia, a sign of neural degeneration which has been shown to constitute a barrier for transplant cell survival and migration. This study investigated the use of triamcinolone (TA) to control macrophage/microglia accumulation in a model of RGC depletion to create a permissive environment for stem cell grafting. Intravitreal NMDA alone or in combination with TA was used to induce rapid onset of RGC death in 3-4 week old Lister hooded (LH) rat eyes prior to Müller stem cell transplantation into the vitreoretinal space. The effect of NMDA on RGC death and microglial accumulation was assessed immuno-histochemically, whilst electroretinography (ERG) was used to assess RGC function. Post transplantation, survival of grafted cells and their association with microglia were also examined by immunohistochemical methods. Intravitreal injection of NMDA alone resulted in severe macrophage/microglia accumulation associated with extensive RGC death 4-7 days post-treatment. Combination of NMDA with TA significantly reduced microglial numbers in the RGC when compared to NMDA only treated eyes while still depleting the retina of RGC. At the same time, NMDA/TA treatment also caused functional RGC loss as demonstrated by reduction of the scotopic threshold response. Upon transplantation with Müller stem cells, NMDA/TA treatment caused significant reduction in the number of transplant associated macrophage/microglia compared to eyes treated with NMDA alone. On this basis it is proposed that intravitreal injection of TA may be useful as an effective anti-inflammatory agent to control macrophage/microglia accumulation induced by RGC death, thereby creating a retinal environment permissive to cell transplantation studies.

Preparation and in vitro evaluation of chitosan-coated alginate/calcium complex microparticles loaded with fluorescein-labeled lactoferrin. An attempt was made to prepare FITC-labeled-lactoferrin (LF-FTC)-loaded microparticles, durable under gastrointestinal conditions, first by the combination of alginate/calcium complexation and emulsification-evaporation and next by treatment with chitosan solution. The obtained microparticles were examined for particle characteristics, in vitro release profiles and physical stability in solutions of pH 1.2 and 6.8. The obtained chitosan-coated alginate/calcium complex microparticles (Ch/Al/Ca-MP) showed almost uniform size of 1-2 microm and a spherical shape with a non-smooth surface. The content and recovery of LF-FTC in Ch/Al/Ca-MP fell as the concentration of chitosan solution used in chitosan coating increased. The release rate of LF-FTC was faster in Ch/Al/Ca-MP prepared with more chitosan at pH 1.2 and 6.8. Ch/Al/Ca-MP coated with 0.25 and 0.5% (w/v) chitosan solution showed good gradual release characteristics in vitro. Furthermore, they were durable at pH 1.2 and 6.8, though swelling and softening of the microparticles occurred at pH 6.8. It is suggested that alginate/calcium complex microparticles coated with 0.25-0.5% (w/v) chitosan solution would be useful for the intestinal delivery of LF.

[Relationship between multi-locus fibrinogen polymorphisms and fibrinogen concentration, molecular reactivity and cerebral infarction]. To study the distribution characteristics of Beta-fibrinogen (Fg)B gene-854G/A, -455G/A, -249C/T, -148C/T, 448G/A and Bcl-1 G/A polymorphism in North China Han population, and the influence on plasma Fg concentration and molecular reactivity. Further more, to explore the role of Fg gene polymorphisms combining with multi-physiological and environmental factors in the development of cerebral infarction. Cluster sampling, health examination and questionnaires surveys of 1652 subjects from Tangshan Kailuan Group Corporation were conducted. Blood biochemistry, Fg concentration, fibrin monomer polymerized velocity (FMPV), absorbance maximum (Amax) and FMPV/Amax were measured. The six polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. In the population, the proportion of the FgB beta-249 T variation allele was 65.49%, while the proportion of the rest loci was predominantly wild type. The significant differences in Fg concentration and FMPV/Amax were found in -854 genotype groups. The Fg concentration in -854GA group was higher than those in GG and AA group. Only the distribution frequencies of FgB beta Bcl-1 A variation allele, GA and AA genotype in the cerebral infarction group were higher than those in non-infarction group, and the prevalence of cerebral infarction in AA genotype group was higher than other groups (the probability value of above-mentioned results were all P<0.01). FgB beta Bcl-1A allele and variation genotype were susceptible to cerebral infarction. FgB beta-455GA/448G linkage genotype may contribute to the increased plasma Fg concentration. FgB beta-854 was one of the main controlling gene loci for plasma Fg concentration and molecular reactivity.

Xanthohumol impairs glucose uptake by a human first-trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo cells) and impacts the process of placentation. In this study, we aimed to investigate modulation of glucose uptake by the HTR-8/SVneo human first-trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line by a series of compounds and to study its consequences upon cell proliferation, viability and migration. We observed that uptake of (3)H-deoxy-d-glucose ((3)H-DG; 10 nM) was time-dependent, saturable, inhibited by cytochalasin B (50 and 100 µM), phloretin (0.5 mM) and phloridzin (1 mM), insulin-insensitive and sodium-independent. In the short term (30 min), neither 5-HT (100-1000 µM), melatonin (10 nM) nor the drugs of abuse ethanol (100 mM), nicotine (100 µM), cocaine (25 µM), amphetamine (10-25 µM) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (10 µM) affected (3)H-DG uptake, while dexamethasone (100-1000 µM), fluoxetine (100-300 µM), quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (30-1000 µM), xanthohumol (XH) and resveratrol (1-500 µM) decreased it. XH was the most potent inhibitor [IC50 = 3.55 (1.37-9.20) µM] of (3)H-DG uptake, behaving as a non-competitive inhibitor of (3)H-DG uptake, both after short- and long-term (24 h) treatment. The effect of XH (5 µM; 24 h) upon (3)H-DG uptake involved mammalian target of rapamycin, tyrosine kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases intracellular pathways. Moreover, XH appeared to decrease cellular uptake of lactate due to inhibition of the monocarboxylate transporter 1. Additionally, XH (24 h; 5 µM) decreased cell viability, proliferation, culture growth and migration. The effects of XH upon cell viability and culture growth, but not the antimigratory effect, were mimicked by low extracellular glucose conditions and reversed by high extracellular glucose conditions. We thus suggest that XH, by inhibiting glucose cellular uptake and impairing HTR-8/SVneo cell viability and proliferation, may have a deleterious impact in the process of placentation. 

PBOND: web server for the prediction of proline and non-proline cis/trans isomerization. PBOND is a web server that predicts the conformation of the peptide bond between any two amino acids. PBOND classifies the peptide bonds into one out of four classes, namely cis imide (cis-Pro), cis amide (cis-nonPro), trans imide (trans-Pro) and trans amide (trans-nonPro). Moreover, for every prediction a reliability index is computed. The underlying structure of the server consists of three stages: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature selection and (3) peptide bond classification. PBOND can handle both single sequences as well as multiple sequences for batch processing. The predictions can either be directly downloaded from the web site or returned via e-mail. The PBOND web server is freely available at http://195.251.198.21/pbond.html.

Salivary gland neoplasms in oral and maxillofacial regions: a 23-year retrospective study of 6982 cases in an eastern Chinese population. There is little information in the English-language literature about the epidemiology of salivary gland neoplasms in the eastern Chinese population. A large retrospective study (6982 primary salivary tumors during 23 years) was carried out to investigate the clinicopathological features (tumor location, patient sex and age) of these tumors in this population. 3593 tumors were in males and 3389 in females. Pleomorphic adenoma (69%) was the most common tumor and 20% were located in minor glands. 92% of Warthin's tumors occurred in males. Malignant tumors were predominantly adenoid cystic carcinoma (30%) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (30%). Incidences of lymphoepithelial carcinomas (5%) and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (1%) of malignant tumors were identified. 28% of tumors originated from minor glands. Most findings were similar to those in the literature, with some variations. The salivary tumors slightly predominated in males. Relatively higher incidences of minor gland tumors and specifically of pleomorphic adenoma in minor glands were noted. Adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma constituted the most common malignancies. There was a high incidence of lymphoepithelial carcinomas but a low incidence of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. The historical significant male predominance of Warthin's tumor was confirmed.

Household water treatment in developing countries: comparing different intervention types using meta-regression. Household water treatment (HWT) is being widely promoted as an appropriate intervention for reducing the burden of waterborne disease in poor communities in developing countries. A recent study has raised concerns about the effectiveness of HWT, in part because of concerns over the lack of blinding and in part because of considerable heterogeneity in the reported effectiveness of randomized controlled trials. This study set out to attempt to investigate the causes of this heterogeneity and so identify factors associated with good health gains. Studies identified in an earlier systematic review and meta-analysis were supplemented with more recently published randomized controlled trials. A total of 28 separate studies of randomized controlled trials of HWT with 39 intervention arms were included in the analysis. Heterogeneity was studied using the "metareg" command in Stata. Initial analyses with single candidate predictors were undertaken and all variables significant at the P < 0.2 level were included in a final regression model. Further analyses were done to estimate the effect of the interventions over time by MonteCarlo modeling using @Risk and the parameter estimates from the final regression model. The overall effect size of all unblinded studies was relative risk = 0.56 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.63), but after adjusting for bias due to lack of blinding the effect size was much lower (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97). Four main variables were significant predictors of effectiveness of intervention in a multipredictor meta regression model: Log duration of study follow-up (regression coefficient of log effect size = 0.186, standard error (SE) = 0.072), whether or not the study was blinded (coefficient 0.251, SE 0.066) and being conducted in an emergency setting (coefficient -0.351, SE 0.076) were all significant predictors of effect size in the final model. Compared to the ceramic filter all other interventions were much less effective (Biosand 0.247, 0.073; chlorine and safe waste storage 0.295, 0.061; combined coagulant-chlorine 0.2349, 0.067; SODIS 0.302, 0.068). A Monte Carlo model predicted that over 12 months ceramic filters were likely to be still effective at reducing disease, whereas SODIS, chlorination, and coagulation-chlorination had little if any benefit. Indeed these three interventions are predicted to have the same or less effect than what may be expected due purely to reporting bias in unblinded studies With the currently available evidence ceramic filters are the most effective form of HWT in the longterm, disinfection-only interventions including SODIS appear to have poor if any longterm public health benefit.

Dynamics of plasmodesmal connectivity in successive interfaces of the cambial zone. Frequency, density and branching of plasmodesmata were counted in successive tangential and transverse walls in the cambial zone of tomato stems in order to examine development of the plasmodesmal network in a chronological order. Coincident with progress of cell development, plasmodesmal connectivity increased, both at the xylem- and phloem-side. In transverse walls, the number of secondary plasmodesmata enhanced considerably. The same held for tangential walls, with a superimposed plasmodesmal doubling during the first phase of phloem development. This plasmodesmal doubling was interpreted to result from the deposition of wall material between branched plasmodesmal strands. Structural plasmodesmal development was correlated with production of hydroxyl radicals which control local cell wall alterations. Successive phases of plasmodesmal deployment and modification were distinguished which may coincide with differential functional capacities as documented by intracellular injection of fluorochromes. Diffusion-driven symplasmic transport appeared to be transiently interrupted during cell maturation.

Effects of high nitrogen concentrations on the growth of submersed macrophytes at moderate phosphorus concentrations. Eutrophication of lakes leading to loss of submersed macrophytes and higher turbidity is a worldwide phenomenon, attributed to excessive loading of phosphorus (P). However, recently, the role of nitrogen (N) for macrophyte recession has received increasing attention. Due to the close relationship between N and P loading, disentanglement of the specific effects of these two nutrients is often difficult, and some controversy still exists as to the effects of N. We studied the effects of N on submersed macrophytes represented by Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara in pots positioned at three depths (0.4 m, 0.8 m, and 1.2 m to form a gradient of underwater light conditions) in 10 large ponds having moderate concentrations of P (TP 0.03 ± 0.04 mg L(-1)) and five targeted concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) (0.5, 2, 10, 20, and 100 mg L(-1)), there were two ponds for each treatment. To study the potential shading effects of other primary producers, we also measured the biomass of phytoplankton (ChlaPhyt) and periphyton (ChlaPeri) expressed as chlorophyll a. We found that leaf length, leaf mass, and root length of macrophytes declined with increasing concentrations of TN and ammonium, while shoot number and root mass did not. All the measured growth indices of macrophytes declined significantly with ChlaPhyt, while none were significantly related to ChlaPeri. Neither ChlaPhyt nor ChlaPeri were, however, significantly negatively related to the various N concentrations. Our results indicate that shading by phytoplankton unrelated to the variation in N loading and perhaps toxic stress exerted by high nitrogen were responsible for the decline in macrophyte growth. 

Hyaluronic Acid (800 kDa) Supplementation of University of Wisconsin Solution Improves Viability of Osteochondral Grafts and Reduces Matrix Metalloproteinase Expression during Cold Preservation. Osteochondral allografting is a promising option for the treatment of large cartilage defects. However, because the cell viability of osteochondral tissues (OCTs) gradually reduces during storage at 4°C, methods for maintaining the cell viability of fresh OCTs are needed to improve transplantation outcomes. Here, we evaluated whether the supplementation of preservation solution with one of three different molecular weight forms of hyaluronic acid (HA) improved the viability of rat OCTs during long-term cold storage. The supplementation of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with 800 kDa significantly improved the cell viability of OCT after 14 days at 4°C compared to nonsupplemented UW solution. In contrast, UW solution supplemented with either 1900 or 6000 kDa HA did not markedly improve the cell viability of the OCT. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the levels of matrix metalloproteinases 2, 3, and 9 were significantly decreased in OCT stored in UW solution supplemented with 800 kDa HA. Although further studies in human OCT are warranted, these findings demonstrate that the use of 800 kDa HA in place of serum may be a suitable approach for the long-term preservation of osteochondral allografts designated for the repair of large cartilage defects in the clinical setting.

[RHD variant in RhD/-/ mother with anti-D makes noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping impossible]. Noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping from maternal plasma of RhD(/-) pregnant women of Caucasian race may be used for predicting the risk of hemolytic disease because the RHD gene is usually absent in such populations. If detected in plasma of such women, the RHD gene originates from the RhD(+) fetus. The number of fetal copies of the gene in maternal plasma is extremely small. In the presented case of the RhD(/-) pregnant woman with anti-D it was impossible to give a fetal RHD result due to mother's RHD(+) genotype. The fetal RHD was determined from amniocytes. to present the difficulties related to the interpretation of results of invasive and noninvasive procedures. whole blood, plasma and amniotic fluid of the RhD(-) woman with anti-D (14 week of pregnancy) as well as whole blood of the newborn. RHD and RHCE*c were genotyped by real-time PCR in DNA isolated from maternal plasma and amniocytes and the RHD and d-genotypes were tested by SSP methods in DNA isolated from whole blood and amniocytes. RHD and RHCE*c were detected in DNA isolated from plasma. The high level of RHD suggested its origin from the mother's DNA therefore it was impossible to determine the fetal RHD. The d-little test identified a RHD(IVS3+ 1G>A) variant in the mother's genome. A weak signal of real-time PCR for the RHD was obtained in amniocytes but the RHD was not detected by SSP. The RHCE*c was detected by both methods. Results were inconclusive; the fetal RHD status remained unknown. The child was RhD(-) with RHD in its DNA undetected by either method. 1/The RHD(IVS3+ 1G>A) variant in the RhD(-) mother precluded formal noninvasive fetal RHD genotyping. 2/Real-time PCR is too sensitive for amniocyte testing and may lead to false results as it detects trace maternal DNA in amniotic fluid. 3/The frequency of RHD(IVS3+1G>A) occurrence in Poland requires further studies.

Relationship between Metabolic Syndrome and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Hallym Aging Study. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome (MS) is linked to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in Korean men. This was a longitudinal study that used data collected from 328 men aged 50-89 years who were randomly selected among 1,520 participants in 2004. We collected information from 224 (68.3%) men among the original responders on the biological, medical, psychological, social, lifestyle, and economic factors in 2007. The prevalence of the MS was 187/328 (57.0%) in 2004 and 125/224 (55.8%) in 2007 among men, respectively. There was no significantly greater increase in the IPSS in men with the MS than in men without the MS over a 3-year period of time (2.0 ± 9.37 versus 3.0 ± 8.44, p = 0.402, resp.). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis with control for age and life style factors, the risk factors for moderate/severe LUTS were age and erectile dysfunction (p < 0.05). However, the presence of the MS did not increase the risk of moderate/severe LUTS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.63-1.89, p = 0.748). Our cross-sectional and longitudinal risk factor analyses do not support the hypothesis that the MS is linked to LUTS in Korean men.

A computer-based self-tutorial in pediatric and adolescent gynecology is a feasible and satisfactory teaching adjunct to PAG.

Improved survival in systemic sclerosis is associated with better ascertainment of internal organ disease: a retrospective cohort study. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) has high mortality and morbidity. Current management focuses on early detection and treatment of organ-based manifestations. To determine whether the ascertainment of major organ complications of SSc has changed over time and if this is associated with better survival. Retrospective cohort analysis. A total of 520 SSc patients, 234 with disease onset between 1990 and 1993 (historical cohort) and 286 with disease onset between 2000 and 2003 (contemporary cohort), were included. Survival and frequency of internal organ complications were compared between the two cohorts. Five-year survival among diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) patients has improved from 69% in the 1990-93 cohort to 84% in the 2000-03 cohort (P = 0.018), whereas 5-year survival among the limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) patients has remained unchanged-93 and 91%, respectively. Sixteen per cent of the lcSSc subjects and 38% of the dcSSc subjects from the contemporary cohort were diagnosed for the clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis compared with 3 and 7%, respectively, of the historical cohort (P < 0.001). Similarly, the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension was more frequent in the patients from the contemporary cohort (8 and 7% for lcSSc and dcSSc, respectively) compared with [ < 1% (P = 0.002) and 1% (P = 0.148), respectively] the historical cohort. There was no significant difference between the two cohorts in terms of scleroderma renal crisis and cardiac involvement. Survival has substantially improved for the diffuse cutaneous subset of SSc with better and more complete ascertainment of lung complications as a result of systematic annual screening.

Short-term and long-term risk of incident ischemic stroke after transient ischemic attack. The relative risk of ischemic stroke associated with transient ischemic attack (TIA) is not well defined because most studies of stroke after TIA did not include comparison groups. We sought to estimate short-term and long-term relative risks of ischemic stroke associated with clinically diagnosed TIA. We used data from a population-based case-control study. Cases were hypertensive men and women and postmenopausal women, ages 30 to 79, with incident ischemic stroke. Control subjects were sampled within strata of age, sex, hypertension status, and calendar year. The index date was the stroke date for cases and a random date for control subjects. Clinically diagnosed TIA was ascertained from medical records. We used logistic regression to calculate ORs. The study included 1914 stroke cases and 9874 control subjects. Clinically diagnosed TIA was present in 215 (11.2%) cases and 252 (2.5%) control subjects. Analyses focused on the most recent TIA before the index date. For TIA <1 month before the index date, the adjusted OR for stroke was 30.4 (95% CI, 10.4 to 89.4); for TIA 1 to 3 months before the index date, it was 18.9 (8.58 to 41.6); for TIA 4 to 6 months before the index date, it was 3.16 (1.27 to 7.82); and for TIA >5 years before the index date, it was 1.87 (1.22 to 2.85). The relative risk of ischemic stroke was high for TIA diagnosed within the past 3 months and moderately high for TIA diagnosed >5 years in the past compared with no history of clinically diagnosed TIA.

A maze learning comparison of Elman, long short-term memory, and Mona neural networks. This study compares the maze learning performance of three artificial neural network architectures: an Elman recurrent neural network, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and Mona, a goal-seeking neural network. The mazes are networks of distinctly marked rooms randomly interconnected by doors that open probabilistically. The mazes are used to examine two important problems related to artificial neural networks: (1) the retention of long-term state information and (2) the modular use of learned information. For the former, mazes impose a context learning demand: at the beginning of the maze, an initial door choice forms a context that must be remembered until the end of the maze, where the same numbered door must be chosen again in order to reach the goal. For the latter, the effect of modular and non-modular training is examined. In modular training, the door associations are trained in separate trials from the intervening maze paths, and only presented together in testing trials. All networks performed well on mazes without the context learning requirement. The Mona and LSTM networks performed well on context learning with non-modular training; the Elman performance degraded as the task length increased. Mona also performed well for modular training; both the LSTM and Elman networks performed poorly with modular training.

Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae on the dorsum of the human tongue. The aim of this study was to correlate the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Xanthomonadaceae on the posterior dorsum of the human tongue with the presence of tongue coating, gender, age, smoking habit and denture use. Bacteria were isolated from the posterior tongue dorsum of 100 individuals in MacConkey agar medium and were identified by the API 20E system (Biolab-Mérieux). 43% of the individuals, presented the target microorganisms on the tongue dorsum, with greater prevalence among individuals between 40 and 50 years of age (p = 0.001) and non-smokers (p=0.0485). A higher prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae was observed on the tongue dorsum of the individuals evaluated. There was no correlation between these species and the presence and thickness of tongue coating, gender and presence of dentures.

Association of increased pulmonary interleukin-6 with the priming effect of intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide on hyperoxic lung injury in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The authors previously demonstrated the priming effect of intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hyperoxic lung injury in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To investigate the mechanism underlying this priming effect by determining biochemical profiles in a rat model of BPD. The rat model involved intra-amniotic LPS administration and postnatal hyperoxia (85%). The mRNA expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), as well as the protein levels of IL-6, VEGF, and protein carbonyl in lung tissue were compared between the LPS plus hyperoxia, the LPS only, the hyperoxia only, and the control groups. Morphometric analysis of lung tissues demonstrated that alveolarization was significantly inhibited only in the LPS plus hyperoxia group. IL-6 protein levels and its mRNA expression in the lungs were significantly increased only in the LPS plus hyperoxia group. Neither LPS nor hyperoxia increased IL-6 in the lungs independently. bFGF mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the LPS-treated groups. VEGF protein levels were significantly reduced by hyperoxia, whereas protein carbonyl levels were increased by intra-amniotic LPS or hyperoxia. No additional significant change to VEGF or protein carbonyl levels was produced by intra-amniotic LPS or hyperoxia. There were no significant differences in the mRNA expressions of VEGF, VEGFR-2, and TGF-beta(1). The priming effect of intra-amniotic LPS on hyperoxic lung injury may be associated with IL-6 elevation in the lungs.

Effect of 10% sodium ascorbate and 10% alpha-tocopherol in different formulations on the shear bond strength of enamel and dentin submitted to a home-use bleaching treatment. This in vitro study assessed the shear bond strength of human enamel and dentin submitted to a bleaching treatment with 10% carbamide peroxide and treatment with antioxidant agents containing 10% alpha-tocopherol and 10% sodium ascorbate formulated in solution and gel. Sixty human dental enamel slabs (E) and 60 human dental dentin slabs (D) were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10). Groups E1 and D1 were negative control groups and the bleaching agent was not applied. The bleaching agent was applied daily for two-hours on the dental slabs of all the other groups and, during the remaining 22 hours, the specimens were stored in an artificial saliva solution for a total of 14 days. Groups E2 and D2 were positive control groups and they only received application of the bleaching agents. Antioxidant agents were applied in Groups E3 and D3 (10% sodium ascorbate solution), E4 and D4 (10% alpha-tocopherol solution), E5 and D5 (10% sodium ascorbate gel) and E6 and D6 (10% alpha-tocopherol gel) for two hours. Cylinders were made with microhybrid resin composite and a total-etch adhesive system for shear bond strength tests. These tests were performed in a universal testing machine at a speed of 0.5 mm/minute to obtain the values in MPa. ANOVA (p > 0.05) showed no significant differences among groups E4, E5, E6 and E1. However, groups E3, E5 and E6 presented statistically similar values to group E2. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed no significant differences among D1 and all the other experimental groups; the same values occurred with D2, which did not differ from the experimental groups. Antioxidant treatment with 10% alpha-tocopherol solution was the only effective agent to revert the oxidizing effects of the bleaching treatment on enamel.

Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate induces both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in rat alveolar macrophages through crosstalk between p38, the lipoxygenase pathway and PPARalpha. Airway inflammation is important in asthma pathogenesis. Recent epidemiological data have indicated an association between asthma symptoms in children and exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Thus, we have studied inflammatory responses in primary rat alveolar macrophages (AMs) after exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the major primary metabolite of DEHP. First, we show that MEHP induces a dose-dependent release of the pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in AMs, giving a maximal (5-fold) increase at 0.7 mM. This concentration also induced some cell death. MEHP also induced phosphorylation of MAPK p38, while the p38 inhibitor SB 202190 reduced MEHP-induced TNF-alpha, suggesting a p38-dependent cytokine production. Next, we elucidated possible effects of MEHP on the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway and found that MEHP caused increased leukotriene (LTB(4)) release. Further, we found that the 5-LO inhibitor nordihydrogualaretic acid (NDGA) significantly reduced both MEHP-induced TNF-alpha release and MEHP-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), supporting an involvement of the 5-LO pathway in MEHP induced inflammatory reactions. Last, we found that MK-886, a known inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), increased the MEHP-induced TNF-alpha response. This indicates that MEPH-PPARalpha binding mediates an anti-inflammatory signal.

A new porcine in vivo animal model of disc degeneration: response of anulus fibrosus cells, chondrocyte-like nucleus pulposus cells, and notochordal nucleus pulposus cells to partial nucleotomy. In vivo animal study. To describe a new porcine disc degeneration model, and to analyze disc remodeling and degeneration after nucleotomy with special view to the different nucleus pulposus (NP) cell types. Thus far, predominantly smaller animals were used for disc degeneration models; however, such small discs were inappropriate to investigate cell implementation therapies. Though notochordal cells (NCs) are important for disc formation and maintenance, differences in the amount of NCs between human and animal discs have often been neglected. Twenty-four Goettingen minipigs underwent partial nucleotomy with a 16G biopsy cannula, to remove approximately 10% of total NP volume. Animals were followed up for 3, or 24 weeks and analyzed by radiographs, MRIs, (immuno)histology, gene expression analysis, and biomechanical testing. Three weeks after nucleotomy disc height was reduced by 26%, and magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity by 40%. At 24 weeks disc height was decreased by 32%. Increased degenerative changes were found in a histodegeneration score 3 and 24 weeks after nucleotomy, as well as considerable NP scarification after 3 weeks. In controls, cytokeratin-8 immunohistochemistry identified NCs in proximity to chondrocyte-like NP cells at approximately equal ratio. After nucleotomy, NCs were considerably reduced to <10% of total NP cells. Matrix genes were upregulated, except for aggrecan that decreased to 35% of initial values 3 weeks after nucleotomy. Matrix degrading factors (matrix metalloproteinases 13 and 3) were continuously upregulated, whereas transcripts of their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 3) were downregulated. No significant changes in segmental spinal flexibility or bone density were found after nucleotomy. We introduced a new disc degeneration model with relatively large discs that could be used for cell therapeutic approaches. The study gives further information about disc remodeling after nucleotomy and indicates the relevance of an altered cellular composition for the development of disc degeneration.

Expression and function of p-glycoprotein in normal tissues: effect on pharmacokinetics. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters limit intracellular concentration of their substrates by pumping them out of cell through an active, energy dependent mechanism. Several of these proteins have been originally associated with the phenomenon of multidrug resistance; however, later on, they have also been shown to control body disposition of their substrates. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is the first detected and the best characterized of ABC drug efflux transporters. Apart from tumor cells, its constitutive expression has been reported in a variety of other tissues, such as the intestine, brain, liver, placenta, kidney, and others. Being located on the apical site of the plasma membrane, Pgp can remove a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including clinically relevant drugs, their metabolites, and conjugates from cells. Driven by energy from ATP, it affects many pharmacokinetic events such as intestinal absorption, brain penetration, transplacental passage, and hepatobiliary excretion of drugs and their metabolites. It is widely believed that Pgp, together with other ABC drug efflux transporters, plays a crucial role in the host detoxication and protection against xenobiotic substances. On the other hand, the presence of these transporters in normal tissues may prevent pharmacotherapeutic agents from reaching their site of action, thus limiting their therapeutic potential. This chapter focuses on P-glycoprotein, its expression, localization, and function in nontumor tissues and the pharmacological consequences hereof.

Tissue vibration pulsatility for arterial bleeding detection using Doppler ultrasound. Trauma is the number one cause of death among Americans between 1 and 44 years old, and exsanguination due to internal bleeding resulting from arterial injuries is a major factor in trauma deaths. We have evaluated the feasibility of using tissue vibration pulsatility in arterial bleeding detection. Eight femoral arteries from four juvenile pigs were punctured transcutaneously with a 6 or 9-French catheter. Also, 11 silicone vessels wrapped with turkey breast were placed in a pulsatile flow phantom and penetrated with an 18-gauge needle. The tissue vibration pulsatility was derived as a ratio of the maximum spectral energy from 200 to 2500 Hz of tissue vibration in systole over a baseline value in diastole. Then, the tissue vibration pulsatility index (TVPI) was defined as the maximum tissue vibration pulsatility value for each experimental condition. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that the TVPI from injured vessels is significantly higher (p<0.005) than that of intact vessels. In addition, we constructed the 2D map of tissue vibration pulsatility during in vitro studies and found that it could be used for spatial localization of the puncture site. Our preliminary results indicate that the tissue vibration pulsatility may be useful for detecting arterial bleeding and localizing the bleeding site.

The physician at a distance: the use of videoconferencing in the treatment of patients with hypertension. We evaluated the feasibility and quality of uncomplicated hypertension care based on telemedicine in a rural area of northern Sweden. The intervention subjects were 91 consecutive patients with primary hypertension. For comparison, 182 age- and sex-matched patients with hypertension were randomly selected from a similar health centre. The telemedicine equipment consisted of a video link between the physician and the patients, supported by a system for accessing medical data via the Internet. During a 21-month study period, telemedicine was used in 270 (91%) of the 297 consultations in the intervention group. All health personnel involved in the telemedicine treatment rated the method as feasible. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved in the two groups during the study period. In the intervention group, a higher proportion had their blood pressure within treatment goals (systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) both at baseline and at follow-up than in the comparison group. An adjusted multivariate model (adjustment for sex, age, time between visits, change in number of drugs between first and last visit, blood pressure at first visit) showed that the intervention group had a higher probability (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.2) of reaching the target blood pressure levels than the reference group. Treatment of hypertension by means of telemedicine was quite feasible and at least as effective as face-to-face consultations with a physician.


[Effectiveness of various combinations of chemoradiotherapy for children and adolescents with Hodgkin's disease].

Use of rpsL as a Counterselectable Marker in Borrelia burgdorferi. We have demonstrated that rpsL, encoding the S12 protein of the small ribosomal subunit, can be used as a counterselectable marker in Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Mutations in rpsL confer streptomycin resistance. Streptomycin susceptibility is dominant in an rpsL merodiploid, and streptomycin selects for the loss of wild-type rpsL carried in trans. This is the first description of a counterselectable marker in B. burgdorferi.

A case of human intramuscular adrenal gland transplantation as a cure for chronic adrenal insufficiency. Intramuscular endocrine gland transplantation has been well described as it pertains to parathyroid autotransplantation; however, transplantation of the adrenal gland is less well characterized. While adrenal autotransplantation in the setting of Cushing's disease has been described, intramuscular adrenal allotransplantation as a cure for adrenal insufficiency to our knowledge has not been previously carried out. Current treatment for adrenal insufficiency leaves patients without diurnal variation in cortisol release and susceptible to the detrimental effects of chronic hypercortisolism. We describe here the case of a 5-year-old girl with renal failure who had adrenal insufficiency following fulminant meningococcemia that led to requirements for both stress-dose steroid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Ten months after the onset of her disease, she received a simultaneous renal and adrenal gland transplant from her mother. The adrenal gland allograft was morselized into 1 mm(3) segments and implanted into three 2 cm pockets created in her rectus abdominis muscle. Three years after surgery, her allograft remains fully functional, responding well to adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation and the patient does not require any steroid or mineral-corticoid supplementation. We believe this case represents the first description of successful functional intramuscular adrenal allograft transplantation with long-term follow up as a cure for adrenal insufficiency.


A case control study of differences in non-work injury and accidents among sawmill workers in rural compared to urban British Columbia, Canada.

Gold-catalyzed transannular [4+3] cycloaddition reactions. Macrocyclic propargyl acetates containing a furan ring were prepared by using a CrCl(2)-promoted reaction. In the presence of either a Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst, a tandem 3,3-rearrangement/transannular [4+3] cycloaddition reaction occurred to give propargyl acetates that are regio- and diastereospecific. The regiochemistry of the product is controlled by the position of the acetoxy group in the starting material and the stereochemistry of the reaction depends on the ring size.

SEM evaluation of the apical external root surface of teeth with chronic periapical lesion. The aim is to verify, under scanning electron microscopy, the occurrence of apical root resorption in anterior and posterior teeth with chronic and radiographically visible periapical lesions. Thirty-two teeth were extracted, the apical thirds (n = 39) were removed, and prepared to analyse the external apical root surface. All specimens presented irregular areas of root resorption with different depths, located mainly around the apical foramen. Teeth with chronic periapical lesions present areas of external apical root resorption with irregular surface and different depths located mainly around the apical foramen. Root resorptions may show different configurations and destroy the apical root structure more or less extensively.

Diabetic critical ischemia of lower limbs: distal arterial revascularisation. To evaluate the outcomes of ischemic diabetic foot lesions for which distal arterial bypass grafting was considered as the first-line vascular procedure. Between November 2004 and November 2006, 19 lower limbs of 17 diabetic patients with lower limb critical ischemia were operated in our department. The bypass grafts included five femoro-popliteal bypass grafts below knee and 14 distal bypass grafts. The 14 distal bypass grafts included; seven venous grafts on the dorsalis pedis artery, four femorotibial PTFE grafts and three femoroperoneal grafts. Arterio-venous fistula was applied to the distal anastomosis site in three limbs. At the time of discharge, the graft patency rate was 93.75%. The mean follow up period was 24 months. The primary cumulative patency rate was 63% at 2 year. The corresponding secondary patency rate was 87%. Among six ischemic ulcers, four ulcers healed within 2 to 12 months (66.6%). At 24 months, the cumulative rate of limb salvage was 76% and that of survival was 74%. Distal arterial bypass in diabetic lower limb ischemia improves blood circulation that accelerates foot ulcer healing. It can also avoid amputation or lower its level, and thus improving the patient's quality of life.

Secondary osteoporosis in patients with an osteoporotic fracture. Secondary osteoporosis is a common cause of osteoporosis, and there are many medical conditions associated with osteoporosis. Many of these present well before osteoporosis develops, and knowledge of these pre-existing conditions may influence the decision about whether to test and/or treat for osteoporosis. Men and premenopausal women with unexplained osteoporosis or a history of fragility fracture should undergo investigation for secondary osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women with risk factors for secondary osteoporosis should also be carefully evaluated. Beyond the well-recognised association with glucocorticoids, an increasing list of drugs has been implicated in causing bone loss and fractures. With appropriate consideration of secondary causes and relevant investigations, many of these conditions are preventable with newer therapies.

Gammaherpesvirus-driven plasma cell differentiation regulates virus reactivation from latently infected B lymphocytes. Gammaherpesviruses chronically infect their host and are tightly associated with the development of lymphoproliferative diseases and lymphomas, as well as several other types of cancer. Mechanisms involved in maintaining chronic gammaherpesvirus infections are poorly understood and, in particular, little is known about the mechanisms involved in controlling gammaherpesvirus reactivation from latently infected B cells in vivo. Recent evidence has linked plasma cell differentiation with reactivation of the human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV through induction of the immediate-early viral transcriptional activators by the plasma cell-specific transcription factor XBP-1s. We now extend those findings to document a role for a gammaherpesvirus gene product in regulating plasma cell differentiation and thus virus reactivation. We have previously shown that the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) gene product M2 is dispensable for virus replication in permissive cells, but plays a critical role in virus reactivation from latently infected B cells. Here we show that in mice infected with wild type MHV68, virus infected plasma cells (ca. 8% of virus infected splenocytes at the peak of viral latency) account for the majority of reactivation observed upon explant of splenocytes. In contrast, there is an absence of virus infected plasma cells at the peak of latency in mice infected with a M2 null MHV68. Furthermore, we show that the M2 protein can drive plasma cell differentiation in a B lymphoma cell line in the absence of any other MHV68 gene products. Thus, the role of M2 in MHV68 reactivation can be attributed to its ability to manipulate plasma cell differentiation, providing a novel viral strategy to regulate gammaherpesvirus reactivation from latently infected B cells. We postulate that M2 represents a new class of herpesvirus gene products (reactivation conditioners) that do not directly participate in virus replication, but rather facilitate virus reactivation by manipulating the cellular milieu to provide a reactivation competent environment.

Automated epilepsy diagnosis using interictal scalp EEG. Over 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy. Traditional diagnosis of epilepsy relies on tedious visual screening by highly trained clinicians from lengthy EEG recording that contains the presence of seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many automatic systems that can recognize seizure-related EEG signals to help the diagnosis. However, it is very costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities, especially in areas short of medical resources. We demonstrate in this paper that we can use the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier to collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person is epileptic. In our automated EEG recognition system, we extract three classes of features from the EEG data and build Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fed with these features. We optimize the feature extraction parameters and combine these PNNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves an impressive 94.07% accuracy.

[Alcohol drinking patterns and sleep quality of Japanese civil servants]. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether alcohol drinking patterns were associated with sleep quality. A cross-sectional survey was carried out by self-administered questionnaire in 2008 among 2,118 employees aged 18 to 65 years working in local government in Toyama. After excluding those without relevant data for this study, 661 men and 618 women represented the study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether alcohol drinking patterns (as measured by the frequency, the amount of alcohol per day and the timing of alcohol drinking) were associated with poor sleep quality (as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), after adjustment for potential confounding factors: age, family structure, work characteristics (as measured by the job-demand-control-support model, shift work and occupational class), chronic disease, body mass index, smoking status and physical activity. In comparison with men who did not drink, the adjusted odds ratio for poor sleep quality was 0.52 (95%confidence interval: 0.32-0.85) for those who drank alcohol once a week or more, 0.32 (0.13-0.84) for those who drank 1-3 glasses daily, 0.30 (0.13-0.70) for those who drank 7-14 glasses per week, 0.37 (0.17-0.77) for those who drank only at meals. In women, the drinking patterns were not significantly associated with sleep quality. The results of this study suggest that some alcohol drinking patterns may affect sleep quality among men who do not use sleeping medicine.

The association between emergency medical services staffing patterns and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. To determine whether the number of advanced life support-trained personnel at the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) was associated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival to hospital discharge. A retrospective database review using Utstein-style reporting definitions was conducted in Milwaukee County. All adult (>or= 18 years of age) OHCA cases of presumed cardiac etiology from January 1993 through December 2005 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Cardiac arrests resulting from a drug overdose, suicide, drowning, hypoxia, exsanguination, stroke, or trauma were excluded from the study. Also excluded were cases in which no crew configuration or responding unit was available, cases in which no resuscitation effort was attempted, and cases in which no time data were available. Return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge for OHCA patients treated by a crew with two paramedics were compared to those patients treated by crews with three or more paramedics. Multivariable logistic regression was used for the analysis and the results are reported as odds ratios (ORs). During the study period, there were 10,298 OHCAs of cardiac etiology. Of those, 10,057 (98%) cases had sufficient data to be included in the analysis. There were 4,229 patients treated by two paramedics (9% survived to discharge), 4,459 patients treated by three paramedics (9% survived to discharge), and 1,369 patients treated by four or more paramedics (8% survived to discharge). In the multivariable analysis, when referenced against crews with two paramedics and controlled for factors that have a known correlation with cardiac arrest survival, patients treated by crews with three paramedics (0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.97, p = 0.02) and crews with four or more paramedics (0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83, p < 0.01) were associated with reduced survival to hospital discharge. Return of spontaneous circulation was not influenced by the number of paramedics present. The presence of three or more paramedics at the scene of OHCA was not associated with improved survival to hospital discharge when compared to crews with two paramedics. Additional research is needed to determine the potential cause of this finding.

Genomics of pulmonary arterial hypertension: implications for therapy. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a vexing clinical disease with no cure. Despite advances and the discovery of a gene (BMPR2) associated with many of the hereditary forms of the disease, and some cases not previously known to be inherited, the reasons for mutations in this gene as a cause remain somewhat elusive. Clearly, a complex interplay exists between genetic alterations, environmental exposures (including infections), and disease development. This article addresses the advances in the genetics of PAH, including the identification of genetic etiologies and modulators, and the role of genetics in predicting disease progression and targeting therapeutics.

Mitosis: too much of a good thing (can be bad). Recent studies reveal that the precise regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential for an error-free mitosis. Kinetochore microtubule attachments that are too stable increase the rate of chromosome mis-segregation, a leading cause of chromosomal instability in tumors.

Accelerometer based measurement for the mapping of neck surface vibrations during vocalized speech. This paper presents a detailed study of the vibrations on the surface of the neck during a vocalization of predefined fundamental frequency and intensity. This study was carried out as part of a wider investigation into the use of laryngeal vibrations as a channel of communication. Another potential application of this study is in identifying a suitable location for a hands-free electro-larynx for laryngectomees. An analog accelerometer, with dimensions 5x5x1.6mm and of mass 80mg, was used to perform the measurements. It was connected to a 12-bit analog to digital converter via single strands of insulated wire with a diameter of 100 microm. The resulting low inertia of the measuring device minimised the effect of the measuring device on the phenomenon under investigation. The analog to digital converter simultaneously sampled the accelerometer output and a pre-amplified audio signal from a microphone. This preliminary study was carried out on two able-bodied male subjects. Measurements were taken from forty-five preselected locations on the neck. Each subject made the vowel sound /i/ (long 'e') at three different fundamental frequencies, 150Hz, 200Hz and 250Hz. Once the vocal pitch and intensity matched pre-defined target values, a 200 ms recording was captured by a virtual instrument designed in LabVIEW. A detailed map of skin surface vibration amplitude during vocalization is presented and suitable locations for laryngeal vibration measurement are identified. Further more, detailed analysis of the time varying acceleration function at various measurement positions reveals a rich and complex source of information. Novel visualizations of these signals are presented.

A single-center experience with intracardiac thrombosis in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. Intracardiac thrombosis in patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy can be life threatening. This study investigated the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of intracardiac thrombosis in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A retrospective review of the clinical records was performed in 83 children with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed from January 1995 to December 2008. Intracardiac thrombi were detected in 5 patients (6.0%). The intracardiac thrombi were found mainly in the left ventricle (n = 3). One patient had a thrombus in the left atrium at the time of diagnosis, and a right ventricular thrombus was found in 1 patient with unrepaired ventricular septal defect complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Intracardiac thrombosis developed during rapid deterioration of ventricular function, and all patients had a poor ejection fraction of the left ventricle. All patients were treated with heparinization, and thrombectomy was performed in 1 patient. Three patients achieved complete resolution of the thrombus without further embolic complications. Careful evaluation and aggressive anticoagulation are necessary for the prevention of intracardiac thrombosis in children with poor ventricular function, especially during rapid deterioration of ventricular function.

Group I afferent pathway contributes to functional knee stability. The hamstring reflex response has been suggested to play a substantial role in knee joint stabilization during anterior tibial translation. The present study was performed to determine which afferent pathways contribute to the hamstring reflex as well as the potential effects of specific afferent pathways on functional knee stability. Short- and medium-latency hamstring reflexes (SLR and MLR) were evoked by anterior tibial translation in 35 healthy subjects during standing with 30 degrees knee flexion. Nerve cooling, tizanidine, and ischemia were employed to differentiate afferent pathways. Two hours of thigh cooling (n = 10) resulted in a significant increase in MLR latency and, to a lesser extent, SLR latency. No significant changes were recorded in reflex sizes or maximum tibial translation. The ingestion of tizanidine (n = 10), a suppressor of group II afferents, strongly reduced the MLR size while SLR size or latency of both reflex responses was not significantly affected. Maximum tibial translation was unchanged [5.3 +/- 1.9 to 4.8 +/- 2 (SD) mm; P = 0.410]. Ischemia in the thigh (n = 15) led to a highly significant depression in SLR size (89 +/- 4%; P < 0.001) but only a slight and not significant decline of MLR size. In these subjects maximum tibial translation increased significantly (6.9 +/- 1.6 to 9.4 +/- 3.2 mm; P = 0.028). It is concluded that the hamstring SLR is mediated by Ia afferents, while group II afferents mainly contribute to the MLR. Suppression of SLR may increase maximum anterior tibial translation, thus indicating a possible functional role of Ia afferents in knee joint stabilization.

Ube2j2 ubiquitinates hydroxylated amino acids on ER-associated degradation substrates. Ubiquitin (Ub) modification of proteins plays a prominent role in the regulation of multiple cell processes, including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Until recently, ubiquitination of substrates was thought to occur only via isopeptide bonds, typically to lysine residues. Several recent studies suggest that Ub can also be coupled to nonlysine residues by ester/thiolester bonds; however, the molecular basis for these novel modifications remains elusive. To probe the mechanism and importance of nonlysine ubiquitination, we have studied the viral ligase murine K3 (mK3), which facilitates the polyubiquitination of hydroxylated amino acids serine/threonine on its ERAD substrate. In this paper, we identify Ube2j2 as the primary cellular E2 recruited by the mK3 ligase, and this E2-E3 pair is capable of conjugating Ub on lysine or serine residues of substrates. However, surprisingly, Ube2j2-mK3 preferentially promotes ubiquitination of hydroxylated amino acids via ester bonds even when lysine residues are present on wild-type substrates, thus establishing physiological relevance of this novel ubiquitination strategy.


Clinical reappraisal of total pancreatectomy for pancreatic disease.

Metal artifact suppression from reformatted projections in multi-slice helical CT using dual-front active contours. Metallic implants may cause severe artifacts in CT exams. Suppression of metal artifacts remains to be a very challenging problem, in which metal region segmentation is one of the most important steps. We proposed a novel, semiautomatic segmentation algorithm based on the dual-front active contour model and the boundary mapping strategy to detect the metal regions on reformatted projection data, and to effectively eliminate/suppress metal artifacts on reconstructed images. Experimental studies on clinical hip and shoulder CT exams demonstrated that the proposed method was able to segment multiple metal implants more accurately relative to threshold-based methods. The artifacts caused by dense metal implants were better suppressed.

Determining priority between attentional and referential-coding sources of the Simon effect through optokinetic stimulation. The "Simon effect" is the performance advantage for spatially corresponding target-response ensembles that is observed when coding of target position is irrelevant for the selection of motor responses. The "attentional-shift" account of the Simon effect holds that it arises from the congruency between response location and the direction of the last shift of attention toward the target. The "referential-coding" account traces the origin of the Simon effect back to the congruency between the response location and the position of the target with respect to a spatial reference frame. We were able to contrast these two hypotheses using full-field horizontal optokinetic stimulation (OKS). It was shown that OKS moving in one horizontal direction drives covert orienting of attention toward the side of arrival of OKS, i.e. the "In-coming" side, which is opposed to the direction of OKS motion toward the "Out-going" side (Teramoto et al., 2004; Watanabe, 2001). We therefore asked healthy participants to discriminate between slow and fast velocities of leftward or rightward OKS. "Fast" and "slow" responses were associated to response buttons positioned in the left or right side of space. The "attentional-shift" account of the Simon effect predicts that response compatibility should be related to the direction of the attentional shift induced by OKS, i.e. in the direction opposite to OKS motion. By contrast, the "referential-coding" hypothesis predicts that response compatibility should be related to the direction of OKS displacement with respect to its starting position. We observed faster RTs when the response button was on the "In-coming" side of space, opposite to the direction of OKS motion. This result supports priority of attentional over referential-coding factors in the genesis of the Simon effect.

Interventions for apnoea of prematurity: a personal view.

[False aneurysm of the right ventricular outflow tract due to infective endocarditis after repair of congenital heart disease]. A case of an enormous false aneurysm of the right ventricular outflow tract due to infective endocarditis is reported in a 12-year old girl who underwent Rastelli repair of congenital heart disease with reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract by bovine jugular vein graft (Contegra). The false aneurysm was associated to desinsertion of the patch of the ventricular septal defect and compresses the right ventricle leading to heart failure and shock. Surgical treatment was performed in emergency but the child died after surgery. Infectious false aneurysm of the right ventricle after surgical reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is very rare. At our knowledge, only three cases have been reported in the literature. We report here another case.

Isolation with migration models for more than two populations. A method for studying the divergence of multiple closely related populations is described and assessed. The approach of Hey and Nielsen (2007, Integration within the Felsenstein equation for improved Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in population genetics. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104:2785-2790) for fitting an isolation-with-migration model was extended to the case of multiple populations with a known phylogeny. Analysis of simulated data sets reveals the kinds of history that are accessible with a multipopulation analysis. Necessarily, processes associated with older time periods in a phylogeny are more difficult to estimate; and histories with high levels of gene flow are particularly difficult with more than two populations. However, for histories with modest levels of gene flow, or for very large data sets, it is possible to study large complex divergence problems that involve multiple closely related populations or species.


Lack of association of GPX1 and MnSOD genes with symptom severity and response to clozapine treatment in schizophrenia subjects.

Eye movements when reading implausible sentences: investigating potential structural influences on semantic integration. The disruption that occurs in response to reading about implausible events in unambiguous sentences can be informative about the time course of semantic interpretation (e.g., Hagoort, Hald, Bastiaansen, & Petersson, 2004; Nieuwland & Van Berkum, 2006; Warren & McConnell, 2007). Two eye-tracking studies used implausible sentences to investigate whether local factors like the structural relationships and the distance between words cueing a plausibility violation influence how quickly those words are integrated into a global semantic interpretation. Experiment 1 suggested that eye-movement disruption was unaffected by the number of words intervening between the words cueing the implausibility. Experiment 2 demonstrated that eye-movement disruption to implausibility occurred along the same time course regardless of whether the words cueing the implausibility were in a theta-assigning relation or not. These results suggest that these local structural factors do not influence how quickly new words are integrated into a semantic representation, but rather the global event representation determines the time course over which implausibility is detected.

Progress in Understanding Algal Bloom-Mediated Fish Kills: The Role of Superoxide Radicals, Phycotoxins and Fatty Acids. Quantification of the role of reactive oxygen species, phycotoxins and fatty acids in fish toxicity by harmful marine microalgae remains inconclusive. An in vitro fish gill (from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) assay was used to simultaneously assess the effect in superoxide dismutase, catalase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities caused by seven species of ichthyotoxic microalgae (Chattonella marina, Fibrocapsa japonica, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimotoi, Alexandrium catenella, Karlodinium veneficum, Prymnesium parvum). Quantification of superoxide production by these algae was also performed. The effect of purified phycotoxins and crude extracts was compared, and the effect of fatty acids is discussed. The raphidophyte Chattonella was the most ichthyotoxic (gill cell viability down to 35%) and also the major producer of superoxide radicals (14 pmol cell-1 hr-1) especially after cell lysis. The raphidophyte Heterosigma and dinoflagellate Alexandrium were the least toxic and had low superoxide production, except when A. catenella was lysed (5.6 pmol cell-1 hr-1). Catalase showed no changes in activity in all the treatments. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lactate dehydrogenase exhibited significant activity increases of ≤23% and 51.2% TCC (total cellular content), respectively, after exposure to C. marina, but SOD showed insignificant changes with remaining algal species. A strong relationship between gill cell viability and superoxide production or superoxide dismutase was not observed. Purified brevetoxins PbTx-2 and -3 (from Karenia brevis, LC50 of 22.1 versus 35.2 μg mL-1) and karlotoxin KmTx-2 (from Karlodinium; LC50 = 380 ng mL-1) could almost entirely account for the fish killing activity by those two dinoflagellates. However, the paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) GTX1&4, C1&C2, and STX did not account for Alexandrium ichthyotoxicity. Only aqueous extracts of Alexandrium were cytotoxic (≤65% decrease of viability), whereas crude methanol and acetone extracts of Chattonella, Fibrocapsa, Heterosigma, Karlodinium and Prymnesium decreased cell viability down to 0%. These and our previous findings involving the role of fatty acids confirm that superoxide radicals are only partially involved in ichthyotoxicity and point to a highly variable contribution by other compounds such as lipid peroxidation products (e.g. aldehydes).


Matrix metalloproteinases in recurrent corneal melting associated with primary Sjörgen's syndrome.

Use of manometric temperature measurements (MTM) to characterize the freeze-drying behavior of amorphous protein formulations. The freeze-drying behavior and cake morphology of a model protein in an amorphous formulation were studied at varying protein concentrations using conservative (-25 degrees C) and aggressive (+25 degrees C) shelf temperatures at constant chamber pressure during primary drying. The two cycles were characterized by manometric temperature measurements (MTM) in a SMART freeze dryer that estimates the sublimation rate (dm/dt), product temperature at the freeze-drying front (T(p-MTM)) and product resistance (R(p)) during a run. The calculated sublimation rates (dm/dt) were 3-4 times faster in the aggressive cycle compared to the conservative cycle. For conservatively dried cakes R(p) increased with both dry layer thickness and protein concentration. For aggressively dried cakes (where freeze-drying occurs at the edge of microcollapse), R(p) also increased with protein concentration but was independent of the dry layer thickness. The sublimation rate was influenced by R(p), dry layer thickness and T(p-MTM) in the conservative cycle, but was governed mainly by T(p-MTM) in the aggressive cycle, where R(p) is independent of the dry layer thickness. The aggressively dried cakes had a more open and porous structure compared to their conservatively dried counterparts.

Enhanced detection of thiophenol adsorbed on gold nanoparticles by SFG and DFG nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are applied to study vibrational resonance of the thiophenol molecule adsorbed on two different gold samples. One sample is made of 17 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) fixed on a silicon substrate that has been previously functionalized with a silane monolayer (aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES). This sample is fully characterized through visible reflection spectroscopy and AFM. The second sample is a gold monocrystal also covered with thiophenol molecules. From their comparison, an enhancement factor of 21 is deduced for the SFG signal on AuNPs with respect to the Au(111), related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). From a combined analysis of the SFG and DFG spectra, we demonstrate that SFG/DFG spectroscopy is able to identify the nature of the substrate where the molecules are adsorbed. This opens new perspectives for this nonlinear spectroscopy by adding to its well-known intrinsic surface specificity, the ability to selectively probe the chemical layer capping the AuNPs.


Subcutaneous Mycosis Due to Cladosporium cladosporioides and Bipolaris cynodontis from Assam, North-East India and Review of Published Literature.

Examining the Positivity Effect in Autobiographical Memory Across Adulthood. The positivity effect in memory is characterized by enhanced memory for emotionally positive information or decreased memory for emotionally negative information with increased age. The goals of the current study were to (a) examine the positivity effect in autobiographical memory using instructions that limited experimental constraints, (b) examine the relationship between memory valence and subjective well-being, and (c) examine the relationship between age and other memory characteristics across adulthood. In the current study, 281 individuals between the ages of 18 and 94 (Mage=53.14, SD=17.04) completed a modified Memory Experiences Questionnaire using online survey methods. Participants answered questions about emotional valence and other phenomenological characteristics regarding two memories, including any specific memory of their choosing and a personally meaningful memory. Results indicated that memory valence was unrelated to age, thus failing to provide evidence for the positivity effect. However, memory valence was found to be a significant predictor of life satisfaction. Age moderated the relationship between memory valence and subjective well-being but did so differently across the two memories. Age was also associated with increased vividness, coherence, sensory detail, time clarity, and a first-person perspective for the personally meaningful memory.

Purification and characterization of an organic solvent-tolerant lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa CS-2. An extracellular lipase secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa CS-2 was purified to homogeneity about 25.5-fold with an overall yield of 45.5%. The molecular mass of the lipase was estimated to be 33.9 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 36 kDa by gel filtration. The optimum temperature and pH were 50 degrees C and 8.0. The lipase was found to be stable at pH 4-10 and below 50 degrees C. Its hydrolytic activity was highest against p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) among p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids with various chain lengths. The lipase was activated in the presence of Ca(2+), while it was inactivated by other metal ions more or less. EDTA significantly reduced the lipase activity, indicating the lipase was a metalloenzyme. Gum Arabic and polyvinyl alcohol 124 enhanced lipase activity but Tween-20, Tween-80, and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide strongly inhibited the lipase. It exhibited stability in some organic solvents. The lipase was activated in the presence of acetonitrile. Conversely, it was drastically inactivated by methanol and ethanol.

Pitfalls in the evaluation and resuscitation of the trauma patient. The management of the trauma patient presents the practitioner with a host of challenges, and the pace, variety of venues, and multidisciplinary nature of the field combine to create a system complexity that is laden with potential pitfalls. This review summarizes some of the general principles of medical errors and examines some of the more common pitfalls encountered in the initial resuscitation and evaluation of the major trauma patient.


Trisomy 8 as a sole aberration in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) of the vagina.

The analysis of clonal expansions in normal and autoimmune B cell repertoires. Clones are the fundamental building blocks of immune repertoires. The number of different clones relates to the diversity of the repertoire, whereas their size and sequence diversity are linked to selective pressures. Selective pressures act both between clones and within different sequence variants of a clone. Understanding how clonal selection shapes the immune repertoire is one of the most basic questions in all of immunology. But how are individual clones defined? Here we discuss different approaches for defining clones, starting with how antibodies are diversified during different stages of B cell development. Next, we discuss how clones are defined using different experimental methods. We focus on high-throughput sequencing datasets, and the computational challenges and opportunities that these data have for mining the antibody repertoire landscape. We discuss methods that visualize sequence variants within the same clone and allow us to consider collections of shared mutations to determine which sequences share a common ancestry. Finally, we comment on features of frequently encountered expanded B cell clones that may be of particular interest in the setting of autoimmunity and other chronic conditions. 

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Integrating genomics into therapy. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common malignancy of childhood, is a genetically complex entity that remains a major cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. Major advances in genomic and epigenomic profiling during the past decade have appreciably enhanced knowledge of the biology of de novo and relapsed ALL and have facilitated more precise risk stratification of patients. These achievements have also provided critical insights regarding potentially targetable lesions for the development of new therapeutic approaches in the era of precision medicine. In this review, the authors delineate the current genetic landscape of childhood ALL, emphasizing patient outcomes with contemporary treatment regimens as well as therapeutic implications of newly identified genomic alterations in specific subsets of ALL.

Prevalence of potential bacterial respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity of hospitalised individuals. To assess the prevalence of oral colonisation by bacterial respiratory pathogens in hospitalised patients. Thirty patients undergoing myocardium revascularisation surgery were evaluated. At baseline (pre-operative phase), full-mouth clinical periodontal assessment was performed. Saliva and biofilm samples were obtained from subjects at baseline and at the post-operative phase, after orotracheal extubation. DNA was extracted from samples and species of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus and Dialister pneumosintes were detected by PCR or culture (for staphylococci isolates). Most of the subjects were males, with history of hypertension and smoking. Thirteen were edentulous (ED) and 17 were dentate (DE), with moderate chronic periodontitis. The most prevalent bacteria in saliva were Staphylococcus spp. (85.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (83.8%), and Acinetobacter spp. (53.3%). There was a trend for D. pneumosintes to be more frequently detected in DE (43.7%) than ED (11.5%) patients. In plaque samples, DE with >14 teeth showed a higher prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. (100%) than individuals with < or =14 teeth (69.1%; p=0.048). Conversely, P. aeruginosa was more prevalent in subjects with fewer teeth (35.5%) than with >14 teeth (5.7%; p=0.037). All staphylococci isolates were coagulase-negative, and about 11% were positive for the mecA gene. These mecA-positive isolates showed a tendency to increase in all samples, whereas P. aeruginosa reduced after surgery. A strong correlation between the presence of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was observed (rho=0.886, p<0.05). The oral cavity of hospitalised patients harbours high frequencies of bacterial respiratory pathogens, supporting its potential role as a reservoir for these species.

Rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease among children: a 12-year study. Data suggest an increase in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the trend of the incidence of IBD in children. A retrospective investigation was conducted on a cohort of children diagnosed with IBD between 1991 and 2002 who were registered in the IBD center at Texas Children's Hospital. The diagnosis of IBD was based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological examinations. There were 272 children eligible for the analysis; 56% diagnosed with Crohn disease (CD), 22% with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 22% with indeterminate colitis. The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1 in CD, 0.6:1 in UC, and 0.8:1 in indeterminate colitis. From 1991 to 2002, the incidence rate has doubled from 1.1/100,000/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.36) to 2.4/1001,000/year (95% CI 2.10-2.77). This trend was valid for CD but not for UC. Whites had higher incidence rate of IBD than African Americans or Hispanics: 4.15/100,000/year (95% CI 3.48-4.82) versus 1.83/100,000/year (95% CI 1.14-2.51), and 0.61/100,000/year (95% CI 0.33-0.89), respectively. African Americans were predominantly diagnosed with CD. The results demonstrate the rising incidence of IBD among children with evidence of more CD than UC. Recognition of these results will have important implications for diagnosis and management of IBD in children.


Interactions between anti-ulcer drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cirrhotic patients with bleeding esophagogastric varices.

Quality assurance in non-interventional studies. Nowadays, drug research and surveillance after authorisation becomes more and more important for several reasons. Non-interventional studies (NIS) investigate various aspects of drug use including efficacy and safety under real life conditions. Such kind of health services research should be on a high scientific, methodological and organisational level. Therefore accompanying measures to improve or to keep the quality are highly recommended. The aim of quality management is: first to avoid bias of results by using an appropriate study design and an adequate data analysis, second to assure authenticity, completeness and validity of the data and third to identify and resolve deficiencies at an early stage. Basic principles are laid down in corresponding guidelines and recommendations of authorities, institutes and societies. Various guidelines for good epidemiological practice (GEP) were published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and international and regional societies for epidemiology. In addition in Germany the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) together with the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) and the German Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA) have published respectively recommendations dealing with quality aspects of non-interventional observational studies. Key points are the advanced publishing of information about the project, developing of a study plan/protocol containing the scientific objectives, a sample size justification and a description of the planned analyses and the publishing of a summary of the results timely after completion of the study. The quality of the data can be improved by using standardized case report forms (CRF) and the CRF should be reviewed and tested before start of study by some participants. A source data verification (SDV) should be performed in randomly selected centres - in between 2% and 5% of the centres depending on the number of participating centres. Before start of statistical analysis a statistical analysis plan (SAP) should be created. The use of standardized tables and figures is highly recommended. The basis of the report writing should be the STROBE-statement "Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology Initiative" containing a checklist of 22 points to be covered in the report. The development of own standard operating procedures (SOP) describing the processes during planning, conduct and evaluation of a non-interventional study as well as the quality management and the regular training of all involved people is also highly recommended. All accompanying measures to improve or to keep the quality of the NIS should not violate the concept of non-intervention.

Ultrashort fluorescence lifetimes of hydrogen-bonded base pairs of guanosine and cytidine in solution. The optically excited electronic states of hydrogen-bonded homo- and heterodimers of guanosine (G) and deoxycytidine (C) were investigated by femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy. The base pairs were prepared in CHCl(3) solution by employing tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) groups at the OH positions of the ribose (G) or deoxyribose (C) moieties to enhance the solubilities of the nucleosides in organic solvents. The H-bonded complexes that were obtained were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed following electronic excitation at a series of UV wavelengths from lambda(pump) = 294 nm, close to the electronic origins of the bases, to lambda(pump) = 262 nm, where significant excess vibronic energy is deposited in the molecules, at nucleoside concentrations of c(0) = 0.1 and 1.0 mM. The experimental results revealed the existence of an ultrafast deactivation pathway for the optically prepared electronically excited state(s) of the G.C Watson-Crick base pair, which was found to have a lifetime of tau(GC) = 0.30(3) ps (with 2sigma error limits) irrespective of the pump wavelength. A similar short decay time, tau(GG) = 0.32(2) ps, was observed for the respective excited G.G homodimer. In contrast, the excited G monomer displayed a significantly longer-lived and wavelength-dependent deactivation, requiring three time constants, between 0.43(6) ps < or = tau(G,1) < or = 1.2(1) ps, 4.2(8) ps < or = tau(G,2) < or = 8(1) ps, and tau(G,3) = 195(32) ps. Self-complexation of C, on the other hand, led to a longer-lived excited state with a lifetime estimated between 1 ps < or = tau(CC) < or = 10 ps, compared to the dominant initial subpicosecond decay time of the C monomer of tau(C,1) = 0.80(4) ps.

Perceived facilitators to change in hospital pharmacy practice in England. Traditionally, hospital pharmacists' roles have been associated with dispensing medications prescribed by doctors and offering advice about medicines to patients and other healthcare professionals. In England, significant changes in the structure of hospital pharmacy practice began in the 1970s and currently hospital pharmacists are undertaking a number of advanced roles including prescribing. This study investigated the facilitators to change in hospital pharmacy practice in England in order to identify lessons that might assist in the potential changes needed in other countries for extended clinical roles. The study was conducted in England. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with 28 participants, comprising 22 pharmacists and 6 pharmacy technicians from England. They were recruited through a snowball sampling technique. Transcribed interviews were entered into the QSR NVivo 10 software for data management and analysed thematically. Main outcome measure Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians' perception of the facilitators to hospital pharmacy practice change in England. Three major themes emerged from this study: drivers for change, strategies for change and efficiency. Many of the drivers identified were linked to changes in the structure of hospital pharmacy including education and training; specialisation in practice and career structure. Strategies employed to achieve practice change included broadening the role of pharmacy technicians in order to free-up pharmacists' time; seizing opportunities for extended roles; developing a relationship with the medical profession and professional leadership influence. Participants perceived that the development of pharmacists' clinical roles have resulted in a more efficient healthcare provision where patients were offered seamless services. Changes in the professional structure of pharmacy including education and training, specialisation, career structure and the roles of pharmacy technicians could benefit the development of pharmacists' clinical roles in other countries.


Have rates of erectile dysfunction improved within the past 17 years after radical prostatectomy? A systematic analysis of the control arms of prospective randomized trials on penile rehabilitation.

Analysis of prognostic factors in patients with gastric varices after endoscopic treatment. The prognostic factors, including gastric variceal bleeding itself, in patients with gastric varices (GV) after endoscopic treatment remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors in patients with GV after endoscopic treatment as well as to evaluate safety and efficacy of our endoscopic treatment. This study enrolled 115 patients who underwent endoscopic treatment for GV between October 1988 and December 2003 using cyanoacrylate and 5% ethanolamine oleate. Successful hemostasis, recurrence rates, rebleeding rates, survival rates, complications and prognostic factors after the treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment sessions for GV were performed 3.4 +/- 2.5 times. All cases, including 14 emergency cases, were treated successfully. The cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 3 and 5 years after the treatment were 7.0%, 15.6% and 20.0%, respectively, and the cumulative rebleeding rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 3.5%, 8.7% and 14.8%, respectively. The overall survival rates were 78.3%, 63.7% and 51.5% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Grade B or C in Child-Pugh classification, emergency or elective cases, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma were identified as significant negative prognostic factors after endoscopic treatment by multivariate analysis. Although several complications were observed, there was no mortality. Grade B or C in Child-Pugh classification, emergency or elective situation, and association with hepatocellular carcinoma are negative prognostic factors after endoscopic treatment.

The FGFR4 Y367C mutant is a dominant oncogene in MDA-MB453 breast cancer cells. Mutational analysis of oncogenes is critical for our understanding of cancer development. Oncogenome screening has identified a fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) Y367C mutation in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB453. Here, we investigate the consequence of this missense mutation in cancer cells. We show that MDA-MB453 cells harbouring the mutation are insensitive to FGFR4-specific ligand stimulation or inhibition with an antagonistic antibody. Furthermore, the FGFR4 mutant elicits constitutive phosphorylation leading to an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade as shown by an enhanced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Cloning and ectopic expression of the FGFR4 Y367C mutant in HEK293 cells revealed high pErk levels and enhanced cell proliferation. Based on these findings, we propose that FGFR4 may be a driver of tumour growth, particularly when highly expressed or stabilized and constitutively activated through genetic alterations. As such, FGFR4 presents an option for further mutational screening in tumours and is an attractive cancer target with the therapeutic potential.


High-level expression and purification of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) with SUMO fusion.

Quality of life evaluation of patients with neurogenic bladder submitted to reconstructive urological surgeries preserving the bladder. Treatment of neurogenic bladder (BN) aims to upper urinary tract protection. When the conservative clinical measures are insufficient, surgical treatment is indicated. Though admittedly important, the quality of life (QoL) has been little studied in these patients, there are even contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate QoL before and after bladder augmentation in patients with BN refractory to medical treatment. We analyzed, prospectively, the data of 67 patients who underwent surgical treatment for BN by questionnaire SF-36(®) and Qualiveen(®) QoL before and after six months of operation. Comparisons using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon and the assumption of normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test were made. According to the analysis of the SF-36(®) questionnaire, the patients had higher QoL indices in the postoperative period in the areas functional capacity, general state of health, vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects and mental health (n = 67; p <0.05). The questionnaire also revealed Qualiveen(®) best result in quality of life index in the postoperative period, and show lower specific negative impact by urinary problems (n = 36; p <0.05). The results show that, despite not being the main objective, the bladder augmentation results in significant improvement in QoL, probably related to the perception of better health and the resolution of urinary incontinence. Thus, the bladder augmentation associated with other urologic reconstruction techniques allows the upper urinary tract protection, and contribute to a better quality of life of patients with BN.

The threat of misdiagnosis of primary osteosarcoma over the age of 60: a series of seven cases and review of the literature. Osteosarcoma is the most common, non-haematopoietic, primary malignant bone tumour with an incidence of 0.3-0.5 per 100,000. There is some discrepancy in literature concerning the peaks of incidence of osteosarcoma. Some describe only one peak which arises in adolescence, whilst others report a bimodal age distribution with a second peak over the age of 60. In this retrospective study, we evaluated osteosarcoma patients over age 60 treated at our department and reviewed previous studies from the literature. Sixty-four patients (40 male, 24 female) with a mean age of 29 years (from 7 to 82) were treated for primary osteosarcomas. At the time of diagnosis, seven patients (two male and five female) were over 60 years of age with a mean follow-up of 46 months after definite diagnosis. Three out of seven osteosarcomas were primarily radiologically or histologically misdiagnosed, but only one was mistreated with intramedullary nailing at a trauma centre. At last follow-up, two patients had died from the disease, three were alive with disease, and two had no evidence of osteosarcoma. We did not find an increased incidence of primary osteosarcoma in the elderly; yet, older patients had a higher rate of misdiagnosis due to untypical radiological findings in combination with longer times from the onset of first symptoms to definite diagnosis. In cases of pathological fracture, it is essential to assess whether it is caused by mechanical stress or a primary or secondary tumour before leading into mistreatment, especially in older patients.

[Zoledronic acid blocks cell cycle and induces apoptosis in lung cancer cell line 95D cells and their mechanisms of action]. To study the effect of zoledronic acid on cell cycle blocking and induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cell line 95D cells, and their mechanisms of action. The effect of zoledronic acid (ZOL) on proliferation of lung cancer cell line 95D cells was observed by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis of the lung cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry. The apoptosis in the cancer cells was also examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. The expressions of ERK, Bcl-2, Bax and survivin were measured by Western blot and RT-PCR. ZOL showed inhibitory effect on the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro, in a time-dependant and a dose-dependant manner. With time extending after ZOL treatment, the number of apoptosis cells was increased. The expression of ERK, Bcl-2 and survivin was down-regulated and that of Bax up-regulated. Zoledronic acid can block the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells in vitro.

Treatment of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in individuals with psychosis under universal healthcare. Most data on the quality of vascular care for individuals with psychiatric conditions come from countries without universal healthcare. To investigate the treatment of people with psychosis admitted for ischaemic heart disease or stroke under universal healthcare. A population-based study of administrative data comparing Canadians with and without a history of schizophrenia or related psychosis (n = 65,039). Of 49 248 admissions for ischaemic heart disease, 1285 had a history of psychosis. Despite a higher 1-year mortality, they were less likely to receive guideline-consistent treatment: e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI 0.25-0.48), beta-blockers (adjusted OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95) and statins (adjusted OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.63). Of 15 791 admissions for stroke, 594 had a history of psychosis. Despite higher 1-year mortality rates, they were less likely to receive cerebrovascular arteriography or warfarin. People with a history of psychosis do not receive equitable levels of vascular care under universal healthcare.

EMB history to increase health technology literacy in the general public for improved health worldwide. History provides common access to technology for both technical and non technical persons and for youngsters. Placed in an historical context complex health technology and health care can be more understandable and therefore more accessible to the general public; technical persons can understand past health technology advances to help propel the field. History is a reference for experts disguised as a story that anyone can understand and enjoy. This can be useful and effective at improving self advocate based health care.

Congenital vertical talus: a review. Congenital vertical talus, also known as congenital convex pes valgus, is an uncommon disorder of the foot, manifested as a rigid rocker-bottom flatfoot. Radiographically, it is defined by dorsal dislocation of the navicular on the talus. This condition requires surgical correction. If left untreated, this foot deformity results in a painful and rigid flatfoot with weak push-off power. This article provides an overview of this rare foot deformity, outlines appropriate workup of the disorder, and details current treatment options, with emphasis on the evolution of treatment of congenital vertical talus.

Activation of nitric oxide/cGMP/PKG signaling cascade mediates antihypertensive effects of Muntingia calabura in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. We previously reported that the leaf extract of Muntingia calabura L. (Tiliaceae) exerts a potent hypotensive effect in the normotensive rats. The antihypertensive activity of this plant extract, however, is currently unknown. In the present study, we investigated the antihypertensive effects of the n-butanol soluble fraction (BSF) from methanol leaf extract of M. calabura in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and delineated is underlying mechanisms. The intravenous bolus administration of the BSF (10-100 mg/kg) of M. calabura produced biphasic dose-related antihypertensive and bradycardiac effects in SHR. The BSF-induced initial cardiovascular depressive effects lasted for 10 min, and the delayed effects commenced 40 min and lasted for at least 120 min postinjection. These cardiovascular depressive effects of BSF treatments were greater in SHR than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Both the initial and delayed antihypertensive and bradycardiac effects of BSF (25 mg/kg, i.v.) in SHR, were significantly blocked by pretreatment with a nonselective nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, or a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. Moreover, the initial effects of BSF in SHR were inhibited by pretreatment with a selective endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor; whereas the delayed effects were attenuated by a selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor. These results indicate that the BSF from the leaf of M. calabura elicited both transient and delayed antihypertensive and bradycardiac actions in SHR, which might be mediated through NO generated respectively by eNOS and iNOS. Furthermore, activation of sGC/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway may participate in the M. calabura-induced biphasic cardiovascular effects.


Evolving self-rated health in middle and old age: how does it differ across Black, Hispanic, and White Americans?

Structural insights into the dual nucleotide exchange and GDI displacement activity of SidM/DrrA. GDP-bound prenylated Rabs, sequestered by GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) in the cytosol, are delivered to destined sub-cellular compartment and subsequently activated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) catalysing GDP-to-GTP exchange. The dissociation of GDI from Rabs is believed to require a GDF (GDI displacement factor). Only two RabGDFs, human PRA-1 and Legionella pneumophila SidM/DrrA, have been identified so far and the molecular mechanism of GDF is elusive. Here, we present the structure of a SidM/DrrA fragment possessing dual GEF and GDF activity in complex with Rab1. SidM/DrrA reconfigures the Switch regions of the GTPase domain of Rab1, as eukaryotic GEFs do toward cognate Rabs. Structure-based mutational analyses show that the surface of SidM/DrrA, catalysing nucleotide exchange, is involved in GDI1 displacement from prenylated Rab1:GDP. In comparison with an eukaryotic GEF TRAPP I, this bacterial GEF/GDF exhibits high binding affinity for Rab1 with GDP retained at the active site, which appears as the key feature for the GDF activity of the protein.

[Individual plan for school integration of students living with a chronic disease: four years of experience]. We developed the Individual plan for school integration (projet d'accueil individualisé, PAI) to promote quality of life and school and social integration of the increasing number of children living with a chronic disease. The PAI is utilized in every child with a chronic disease having an impact on his schooling, and defines the child's specific health needs, treatments and measures necessary at school. It clarifies the roles and responsibilities of partners involved. The number of PAl increases since its creation in 2004. Its prevalence is 1% for pre-school and primary, 0.6% for low secondary (12-14 years old) and 0.2% for post-mandatory schools. Its utility is acknowledged by families, schools and child's doctors. It reassures parents and teachers and develops a better knowledge of the children with chronic diseases at school.

Valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide for first-line therapy in hypertension. Goal blood pressure levels are only being achieved in approximately a third of hypertensive patients, which suggests that there is a need for new and/or improved approaches to the treatment of hypertension. The majority of patients with hypertension require combination therapy to control their blood pressure. The use of a combination of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action may provide greater efficacy and tolerability compared with monotherapy, and may allow more rapid achievement of target blood pressure. Moreover, the use of single-pill combinations has the potential to increase adherence and persistence, and reduce costs. The single-pill combination of valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide was recently approved by the US FDA for first-line use in hypertensive patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. The focus of this article is on those randomized, double-blind trials in which this combination was administered as first-line therapy in patients with essential hypertension.

HDL-mimicking peptide-lipid nanoparticles with improved tumor targeting. Targeted delivery of intracellularly active diagnostics and therapeutics in vivo is a major challenge in cancer nanomedicine. A nanocarrier should possess long circulation time yet be small and stable enough to freely navigate through interstitial space to deliver its cargo to targeted cells. Herein, it is shown that by adding targeting ligands to nanoparticles that mimic high-density lipoprotein (HDL), tumor-targeted sub-30-nm peptide-lipid nanocarriers are created with controllable size, cargo loading, and shielding properties. The size of the nanocarrier is tunable between 10 and 30 nm, which correlates with a payload of 15-100 molecules of fluorescent dye. Ligand-directed nanocarriers targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. The nanocarriers show favorable circulation time, tumor accumulation, and biodistribution with or without the targeting ligand. The EGFR targeting ligand is proved to be essential for the EGFR-mediated tumor cell uptake of the nanocarriers, a prerequisite of intracellular delivery. The results demonstrate that targeted HDL-mimetic nanocarriers are useful delivery vehicles that could open new avenues for the development of clinically viable targeted nanomedicine.

Estimation of plasma IC50 of donepezil for cerebral acetylcholinesterase inhibition in patients with Alzheimer disease using positron emission tomography. Estimate the value of in vivo plasma IC50 of donepezil, the concentration of donepezil in plasma that inhibits brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 50% at the steady-state conditions of donepezil between the plasma and the brain. N-[C] methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate ([C]MP4A) positron emission tomography was performed in 16 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) before and during the treatment of donepezil (5 mg/day) with a mean interval of 5.3 months. The plasma IC50 value of donepezil was estimated from plasma donepezil concentrations and cerebral cortical mean AChE inhibition rates measured by positron emission tomography, using one-parameter model. Donepezil reduced AChE activity uniformly in the cerebral cortex compared with the baseline in each AD patient, and the mean reduction rate in the cerebral cortex was 34.6%. The donepezil concentrations in the plasma ranged from 18.5 to 43.9 ng/mL with a mean of 28.9 +/- 7.3 ng/mL. The plasma IC50 value was estimated to be 53.6 +/- 4.0 ng/mL. Once the plasma IC50 of donepezil is determined, the brain AChE inhibition rate could be estimated from the plasma concentration of donepezil in each subject based on the plasma IC50. Now that the mean donepezil concentrations in the plasma, when the patients took 5 mg/day, remained 28.9 ng/mL, approximately half of the plasma IC50, higher dose of donepezil might provide further benefits for patients with AD. This technique can be also applied to measure the in vivo plasma IC50 of other cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine and galantamine.


Robo1: a potential role in ocular angiogenesis.

Comparative antioxidant, prooxidant and cytotoxic activity of sigmoidin A and eriodictyol. Sigmoidin A (SGN) is a prenylated flavanone derivative of eriodictyol (ERD) with reported moderate antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. Since ERD and other structurally similar antioxidant phenolic compounds have been shown to induce prooxidative macromolecular damage and cytotoxicity in cancer cells, the comparative IN VITRO effects of these structural analogues on cancer cell viability and Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage were studied. In the presence of Cu(II) ions, both SGN and ERD (7.4-236 microM) caused comparable concentration-dependent pBR322 plasmid DNA strand scission. The DNA damage induced by SGN and ERD could be abolished by ROS scavengers, glutathione (GSH) and catalase as well as EDTA and a specific Cu(I) chelator neocuproine. Both ERD and SGN readily reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) suggesting a prooxidative mechanism of DNA damage. In a cell free system, ERD and SGN did also show comparable radical scavenging activity. SGN was, however, by an order of magnitude more cytotoxic to cancer cells than ERD and this effect was significantly attenuated by GSH suggesting a prooxidative mechanism of cell death. A depletion of intracellular GSH level by SGN in cancer cells is also demonstrated.

Effect of propofol on human fetal placental circulation.

Broiler performance and in vivo viscosity as influenced by a range of xylanases, varying in ability to effect wheat in vitro viscosity. 1. Exogenous enzymes such as xylanase are used in diets for broilers to eliminate anti-nutritive effects caused by the presence of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). It has been proposed that the mechanism by which xylanases exert their effect is through reducing in vivo viscosity within the broiler digestive tract. Previous research has reported that in vitro viscosity was a reasonable predictor of in vivo viscosity and that this method could be used to assess the efficacy of xylanases. 2. The objective of this study was to examine the response of broilers offered a wheat-based diet supplemented with a range of xylanases, varying in ability to reduce in vitro viscosity. 3. A total of 18 xylanases (Syngenta Animal Nutrition) were used to investigate the effect of xylanase on wheat in vitro viscosity. For the in vitro viscosity assay, pepsin was dissolved in either 005 or 01 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). 4. A wheat-based diet was formulated, produced and split into 7 batches; xylanase (500 U/kg) was sprayed onto 6 of the batches and the 7th was the control. This was repeated three times to produce a total of 21 diets, 18 of which contained xylanase. 5. The experiment was conducted in three consecutive trials. Each trial utilised 63 male, Ross broilers from 7 to 28 d of age. Dry matter intake (DMI), liveweight gain (LWG) and gain:feed were determined weekly. Excreta were collected from d 14 to 21 for determination of apparent metabolisable energy (AME). Oil and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility and ileal digestibility of dry matter (DM) and starch were determined. 6. Regression analyses were applied to the mean intestinal viscosity against DMI, LWG, gain:feed and the ratio of metabolisable energy to gross energy (ME:GE). To compare xylanases across the three trials, the data were subjected to REML analysis (Genstat 5). 7. When 01 M HCl was used for dissolution of pepsin, considerable reductions in in vitro viscosity were achieved for the majority of the xylanases-to values less than 12% of the control treatment. When 005 M HCl was used for the dissolution of pepsin, initial viscosity values were lower and the reduction in in vitro viscosity less dramatic than that observed with 01 M HCl. 8. With the exception of diets containing xylanases 9003 and 7162, significant reductions in in vivo viscosity were observed for diets containing xylanase in comparison to the control diet. 9. In terms of gain:feed, ME:GE and AME the xylanases ranked best were 2230 and 9003. Xylanase 2230 also resulted in the highest values for ileal DM and starch digestibility. 10. There were weak but significant relationships between in vitro viscosity and in vivo jenjunal digesta viscosity when in vitro viscosity was determined using either 01 or 005 M HCl (r(2)= 0287 and 0240, respectively). 11. The relationship between jejunal viscosity and DMI was significant (P < 005) but relatively poor (r(2)= 023). There were also significant (P < 005) relationships between jejunal digestal viscosity and gain:feed and ME:GE (r(2)= 034 and 028, respectively). 12. In conclusion, in vitro viscosity may be of some use in predicating xylanase response in vivo.

Functional genomics identifies negative regulatory nodes controlling phagocyte oxidative burst. The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species, confers host defense against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that impair function of the Nox2 complex result in a life-threatening immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of Nox2 subunits have been implicated in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, alterations in the oxidative burst can profoundly impact host defense, yet little is known about regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune this response. Here we report the discovery of regulatory nodes controlling oxidative burst by functional screening of genes within loci linked to human inflammatory disease. Implementing a multi-omics approach, we define transcriptional, metabolic and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled by Rbpj, Pfkl and Rnf145, respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145 in proteostasis of the Nox2 complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Consequently, ablation of Rnf145 in murine macrophages enhances bacterial clearance, and rescues the oxidative burst defects associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency. 


MicroRNAs: predictors and modifiers of chemo- and radiotherapy in different tumour types.

Chronic stress and antidepressant treatment have opposite effects on P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier: an experimental PET study in rats. The multi-drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein is expressed in high concentrations at the blood-brain barrier and has a major function in the transport of drugs. In a recent PET-study evidence was found for an increased function of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier in medicated patients suffering from major depressive disorder. We used small-animal PET and [(11)C]-verapamil to study P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier of rats, either being administered as venlafaxine, an antidepressant, or subjected to chronic stress, a factor contributing to the development of depression. In a first experiment, male Wistar rats underwent a three-week foot shock procedure as a model of human depression. In a second experiment, rats were chronically treated with the antidepressant venlafaxine (25 mg/kg/d via an implanted osmotic minipump). In both experiments, a [(11)C]-verapamil PET scan was performed. In the chronically stressed rats, the distribution volume (V(T)) of [(11)C]-verapamil was significantly increased, whereas treatment with venlafaxine had the opposite effect and caused a significant reduction in V(T). The changes in V(T) could not be attributed to the influx rate constant (K(1)). Our data suggest that P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier is inhibited by chronic stress and increased by chronic administration of venlafaxine.

Evaluation for antioxidant and renoprotective activity of olmesartan using nephrectomy rats. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, which inhibit the rennin-angiotensin system, are used in the treatment of hypertension. In addition to their ability to lower blood pressure, these compounds have also been reported to protect organs, such as kidney and heart. Although the mechanisms of these protective effects are not fully understood, it is generally thought that their antioxidant effects likely play a role. The aim of the present study was to characterize the relationship between the antioxidant activity of olmesartan and its pharmacological actions such as renoprotective or blood pressure lowering effects, using 5/6 nephrectomy rats. In 5/6 nephrectomy rats, the potential antioxidant power, the ratio of oxidized to unoxidized albumin, as a marker of protein oxidation in blood, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma creatinine concentration, and amounts of protein excreted into the urine were significantly higher than the corresponding values for sham operated rats. However, olmesartan significantly suppressed these parameters within 8 weeks after oral administration in 5/6 nephrectomy rats. The oxidized albumin ratio was significantly decreased 4 weeks after the administration of olmesartan and these lower levels were maintained at 8 weeks. Furthermore, olmesartan improved radical scavenging activity of isolated albumin from rat plasma. Interestingly, a good correlation was found between the oxidized albumin ratios and renal function, whereas no correlation was found in the case of blood pressure. Based on those findings, we conclude that the antioxidant properties of olmesartan may be related to its renoprotective action rather than an antihypertensive effect.

[Usefulness of pathological diagnosis for two cases of candidal onychomycosis]. We report two cases of candidal onychomycosis with severe nail deformities. Case 1: The patient was an 81-year-old man who complained of onycholysis and nail deformity of the right forefinger nail which had occurred over a period of a year. He had no obvious previous illness. Case 2: The patient was an 81-year-old woman who complained of nail deformity with periungual erythema which had occurred over a period of several months. She had been treated with oral corticosteroid for bronchial asthma and with Ca blocker for hypertension for a long period. The initial KOH-prepared direct microscopy in each case failed to detect any spores or pseudohyphae. Therefore, an incisional biopsy was performed in both cases. Histopathological findings demonstrated numerous fungal elements with similar appearance of dermatophytes in the middle to lower level of the horny cell layer by PAS and Grocott staining in each case. Candida albicans was isolated and identified by cultivation on ATG agar. In case 1, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) was administered for 14 weeks, which was effective clinically and mycologically. In case 2, however, a coadministered drug (Ca blocker), oral terbinafine (125 mg/day) was not effective mycologically. Therefore, after having changed the antihypertensive agent, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) was administered for 16 weeks, which was effective clinically and mycologically.

An integrated and interactive decision support system for automated melanoma recognition of dermoscopic images. This paper presents an integrated and interactive decision support system for the automated melanoma recognition of the dermoscopic images based on image retrieval by content and multiple expert fusion. In this context, the ultimate aim is to support the decision making by retrieving and displaying the relevant past cases as well as predicting the image categories (e.g., melanoma, benign and dysplastic nevi) by combining outputs from different classifiers. However, the most challenging aspect in this domain is to detect the lesion from the healthy background skin and extract the lesion-specific local image features. A thresholding-based segmentation method is applied on the intensity images generated from two different schemes to detect the lesion. For the fusion-based image retrieval and classification, the lesion-specific local color and texture features are extracted and represented in the form of the mean and variance-covariance of color channels and in a combined feature space. The performance is evaluated by using both the precision-recall and classification accuracies. Experimental results on a dermoscopic image collection demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and show the viability of a real-time clinical application.

Burden of tick-borne infections on American companion animals. This review examines the biology of ticks and tick-borne infections in the United States. The most common tick-borne diseases in dogs and cats are discussed. We demonstrate that there is much interest in tick-borne infections at the level of the lay public (pet owners), describe trends in the distribution and prevalence of tick-borne infections in the United States, summarize some issues in understanding the degree of ill health due to tick-borne infections, and suggest some avenues for research that would clarify these issues.

Initial development of Prochilodus hartii (Pisces: Prochilodontidae) submitted to induced reproduction. The Prochilodontidae prepare for reproduction in captivity, but neither ovulation nor spawning occurs, thus requiring induced reproduction for breeding and restocking. This study analyzed for the first time the embryogenesis and larval ontogeny of P. hartii submitted to induced reproduction by hypophysation with crude common carp pituitary extract. The extrusion of oocytes and sperm was performed manually and fertilization was done using the dry method. After fertilization, the eggs were kept in incubators at 23°C. A stereomicroscope was used to measure egg diameter and to monitor embryo development. Samples of larvae were collected daily for 7 days for histological and biometric analyses. The recently extruded oocytes, non-hydrated, are spherical, grey, and non-adhesive with a diameter of 1480 ± 39 μm and after hydration, have a diameter of 2860 ± 120 μm. The positive response to hypophysation was 100% for females and 80% for males. Spawning occurred 7 h after the third hormonal dosage. The fertilization rate was 77% at 23°C. Blastopore closure occurred at 6 h 45 min and embryonic development was completed 36 h 10 min after fertilization. After 204 h post fertilization (hpf) the larvae reached a standard length of 6.56 ± 0.14 mm with the yolk sac completely resorbed. In P. hartii, the oral cavity opening occurred 132 hpf. The results of this study provide knowledge to better understand induced reproduction, breeding, and management of P. hartii, a species with a high potential for pisciculture, and which is commercially important in the Jequitinhonha River basin. 

In vitro Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitory Studies of Lippia nodiflora and Isolated Flavonoids and Phenylethanoid Glycosides as Potential Uric Acid-lowering Agents. Lippia nodiflora has been traditionally used for treatment of knee joint pain. Hitherto, no studies have been reported on the effective use of L. nodiflora against hyperuricemia, gout or other metabolic disorders. In this present study, L. nodiflora was examined for its ability to lower uric acid levels using an in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory assay. The whole plant methanolic extract was subjected to bioactivity-guided fractionation to yield 4 fractions (F1-F4). F3 displayed the highest potency and was further purified by column chromatography to afford two phenylethanoid glycosides, arenarioside (1) and verbascoside (2), and three flavonoids, 6-hydroxyluteolin (3), 6-hydroxyluteolin-7-O-glycoside (4), and nodifloretin (5). These compounds inhibited xanthine oxidase activity, with IC50 values between 7.52 ± 0.01 and 130.00 ± 2.25 μM, of which 3 was the most potent. In contrast, allopurinol, serving as a positive control, was 0.22 ± 0.00 μM. Thus, L. nodiflora, and its chemical constituents are worthy of further studies as potential anti-hyperuricemic agents.

Validation in the Absence of Observed Events. This article addresses the problem of validating models in the absence of observed events, in the area of weapons of mass destruction terrorism risk assessment. We address that problem with a broadened definition of "validation," based on stepping "up" a level to considering the reason why decisionmakers seek validation, and from that basis redefine validation as testing how well the model can advise decisionmakers in terrorism risk management decisions. We develop that into two conditions: validation must be based on cues available in the observable world; and it must focus on what can be done to affect that observable world, i.e., risk management. That leads to two foci: (1) the real-world risk generating process, and (2) best use of available data. Based on our experience with nine WMD terrorism risk assessment models, we then describe three best use of available data pitfalls: SME confidence bias, lack of SME cross-referencing, and problematic initiation rates. Those two foci and three pitfalls provide a basis from which we define validation in this context in terms of four tests--Does the model: … capture initiation? … capture the sequence of events by which attack scenarios unfold? … consider unanticipated scenarios? … consider alternative causal chains? Finally, we corroborate our approach against three validation tests from the DOD literature: Is the model a correct representation of the process to be simulated? To what degree are the model results comparable to the real world? Over what range of inputs are the model results useful?

Systematic analysis of attenuated Coxsackievirus expressing a foreign gene as a viral vaccine vector. Recombinant viruses expressing foreign antigens may provide a convenient vaccine vector capable of inducing preventative immunity. In this study, we explored the capacity of highly attenuated Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to act as a recombinant vector to deliver foreign genes into experimental animals for the purpose of vaccination. The infectious cDNA of highly attenuated CVB3, YYFF, which has been reported previously (Vaccine 27:1974), was used to construct a recombinant YYFF cDNA (YYFF-HCV) by inserting a truncated form of hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2 as an antigenic marker immediately upstream from the gene encoding the VP4 capsid protein. In YYFF-HCV-infected HeLa cells, HCV E2 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. YYFF-HCV induced the production of antibodies and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to HCV E2 in the inoculated mice. Moreover, YYFF-HCV induced no inflammation in the virus-immunized mice. These results demonstrate that recombinant CVB3 expressing a foreign gene can act as a live vaccine vector capable of inducing humoral and cell-mediated immune responses directed against a foreign protein.

Activation of vasopressin neurons leads to phenotype progression in a mouse model for familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus. Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is a rare disease that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In a previous study, we made a mouse model for FNDI, which showed progressive polyuria accompanied by inclusion bodies in the arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons formed by aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum. The present study was conducted to determine whether the activities of AVP neurons are related to the phenotype progression in the FNDI model. In the first experiment, female heterozygous mice were administered either desmopressin (dDAVP) or a vehicle (control) subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps for 30 days. The dDAVP treatment significantly decreased the urine volume, AVP mRNA expression, and inclusion bodies in the AVP neurons. Urine volume in the dDAVP group remained significantly less than the control for 14 days even after the minipumps were removed. In the second experiment, the males were fed either a 0.2% Na or 2.0% Na diet for 6 mo. Urine AVP excretion was significantly increased in the 2.0% Na group compared with the 0.2% Na group for the first 2 mo but gradually decreased thereafter. Throughout the experiments, urine volume increased progressively in the 2.0% Na group but not in the 0.2% Na group. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that inclusion bodies in the AVP cells had significantly increased in the 2.0% Na compared with the 0.2% Na group. These data demonstrated that activation of AVP neurons could accelerate the aggregate formation as well as the progression of the polyuria in the FNDI model mice.

Adult stem cells: hopes and hypes of regenerative medicine. Stem cells are self-renewing cells that can differentiate into specialized cell type(s). Pluripotent stem cells, i.e. embryonic stem cells (ESC) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiate into cells of all three embryonic lineages. Multipotent stem cells, like hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), can develop into multiple specialized cells in a specific tissue. Unipotent cells differentiate only into one cell type, like e.g. satellite cells of skeletal muscle. There are many examples of successful clinical applications of stem cells. Over million patients worldwide have benefited from bone marrow transplantations performed for treatment of leukemias, anemias or immunodeficiencies. Skin stem cells are used to heal severe burns, while limbal stem cells can regenerate the damaged cornea. Pluripotent stem cells, especially the patient-specific iPSC, have a tremendous therapeutic potential, but their clinical application will require overcoming numerous drawbacks. Therefore, the use of adult stem cells, which are multipotent or unipotent, can be at present a more achievable strategy. Noteworthy, some studies ascribed particular adult stem cells as pluripotent. However, despite efforts, the postulated pluripotency of such events like "spore-like cells", "very small embryonic-like stem cells" or "multipotent adult progenitor cells" have not been confirmed in stringent independent studies. Also plasticity of the bone marrow-derived cells which were suggested to differentiate e.g. into cardiomyocytes, has not been positively verified, and their therapeutic effect, if observed, results rather from the paracrine activity. Here we discuss the examples of recent studies on adult stem cells in the light of current understanding of stem cell biology.

Craniectomy for acute ischemic stroke: how to apply the data to the bedside. Malignant hemispheric infarction is associated with a high mortality rate, approximately 80%, as a result of the development of intracranial pressure gradients, brain tissue shift, and herniation. By allowing the brain to swell outwards and equalizing pressure gradients, decompressive craniectomy appears to significantly reduce the mortality to approximately 20%. This review takes a comprehensive look at the evidence highlighting the benefits and limits of decompressive craniectomy in malignant cerebral infarction. Three recent European randomized trials have provided compelling evidence that decompressive hemicraniectomy for large hemispheric infarction is not only lifesaving, but also leads to improved functional outcome in patients 60 years of age or less when treated within 48 h of stroke onset. Early decompressive hemicraniectomy (<or=48 h) should be strongly considered in any patient 60 years old or less presenting with malignant hemispheric infarction. Further studies are needed to establish objective neuroimaging criteria for aggressive intervention, and to clarify the role of decompressive surgery in older patients (>60 years old) and perhaps, when delayed beyond 48 h.

A study of serial vertical sectioning of scalp biopsies to increase the histological diagnostic yield in alopecias. This study was performed to determine whether serial vertical sectioning of scalp biopsies increases the histological diagnostic yield in alopecias. The study group included 100 consecutively referred patients with scalp alopecias. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of the scalp alopecias were completely serially sectioned in a vertical orientation and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The histological diagnosis rendered in the initial slide harbouring three to six sections was compared with the diagnosis in the following vertical serial sections (30-116 serial sections per specimen, mean 53). A total of 55 scalp biopsies were classified histologically as non-cicatricial alopecia, 35 as cicatricial alopecia and 10 as 'others'. Diagnostic histological findings were present in the initial sections of 50 (50%) cases of alopecia, and only in the following serial sections in 48 (48%) cases. Two cases (2%) lacked differentiating diagnostic histological features in all of the vertical sections. The diagnostic yield of the serial vertical sections compared with the initial sections was higher in the non-cicatricial alopecias (52.7%) than in the cicatricial alopecias (48.5%) and the 'others' category (10%). Serial vertical sectioning of scalp alopecias increases the histological diagnostic yield, substantially.

Colorectal cancer screening in Arkansas: implications for cancer prevention in primary care. Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates in Arkansas exceed national averages and can be reduced through systematic screening that either identifies precursor lesions that can be removed before cancer develops, or diagnoses cancer at an early stage when it is most responsive to treatment. Results of a survey assessing screening status of Arkansas residents and dimensions of health care supporting colorectal screening indicate that primary care providers can play an important role in efforts to decrease the burden of colorectal cancer by informing patients about risk factors and providing advice about the full range of screening options.

Soluble cell wall beta-glucan of Candida induces/enhances apoptosis and oxidative stress in murine lung. The bioactivity of cell wall component(s) of fungi has not been fully investigated, especially in vivo. We have successfully extracted a soluble cell wall beta-glucan from C. albicans (CSBG), and shown that pulmonary exposure to CSBG induces lung inflammation in mice. CSBG-induced lung inflammation was concomitant with the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6 and enhanced lung expression of various cytokines and chemokines. However, the effects of CSBG on the murine respiratory system and their mechanisms have not been fully investigated. In this study, we further explored the effects of pulmonary exposure to CSBG on lung pathophysiology in terms of the induction of apoptosis and enhancement of oxidative stress. ICR mice were intratracheally instilled with vehicle, CSBG, or structurally degraded products of CSBG by formic acid (DEG-CSBG), and 24 h later, the lungs were isolated and evaluated for apoptosis by the TUNEL assay and oxidative stress by immunohistochemistry of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a proper marker of the oxidative DNA damage. In another experiment, the mice were sacrificed and lungs were isolated 4 h after the instillation with vehicle or CSBG for evaluation of transcriptional level of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a stress responsive protein. Pulmonary exposure to CSBG significantly induced apoptosis and enhanced the formation of 8-OHdG in the lung parenchyma as compared to vehicle or DEG-CSBG exposure. CSBG significantly induced HO-1 in the lung. Taken together, CSBG induces/enhances apoptosis and oxidative stress in the lung in association with lung inflammation/injury.

Characterization of the sensitivity of a TCB laplacian sensor for surface EEnG recordings. The improvement of the quality of electroenterogram (EEnG) recordings on abdominal surface could lead to a non-invasive technique to diagnose intestinal motility dysfunctions. In this context, the use of coaxial active electrodes, which permit to record the laplacian potential, can help to achieve such signal enhancement. In this paper, we present a methodology to obtain the maps of sensitivity of this kind of electrodes to pick up the activity of electric dipoles of different orientations. The proposed methodology employs mathematical models, as well as experimental studies (phantoms) to check the theoretical results. The mathematical model of the electrode, and of the human abdomen is developed by means of ANSYS. A simplified physical model is formed by real ring electrodes, a methacrylate tank of size 50 x 50 x 50 cm filled with a saltwater mixture of 2.5 g/l concentration, and moving electric dipoles made by wires of 0.3 mm in diameter. Sensitivity of the sensor is obtained for different depths and different axial distances of vertical and horizontal dipoles. Preliminary results of tripolar ring electrodes in bipolar configuration (TCB) are shown. The obtained results prove the agreement between mathematical and experimental results. The validated model will allow us to study the behavior of laplacian ring electrodes of different dimensions and materials to record the EEnG activity and to analyze the influence of the abdominal layers.

Erectile Dysfunction in the Older Adult Male. Erectile dysfunction (ED) in the older adult male is a significant problem affecting more than 75% of men over 70 years of age in the United States. Older men have an increased likelihood of developing ED due to chronic disease, comorbid conditions, and age-related changes. Research has demonstrated that while the prevalence and severity of ED increases with age, sexual desire often remains unchanged. This article discusses the clinical picture of ED, including relevant pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation and treatment options.

Src tyrosine kinase preactivation is associated with platelet hypersensitivity in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic myeloproliferative disorders characterized by an increased incidence of thrombo-hemorrhagic complications. The acquired somatic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation is present in the majority of PV and ET patients. Because aberrant protein Tyr-phosphorylation has been associated with hematopoietic malignancies, the activity of the tyrosine kinases Src and JAK2 was analyzed in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets from 13 PV and 42 ET patients. JAK2 was found inactive in healthy and pathological resting cells regardless of the V617F mutation. In addition, Src was inactive in all resting platelets, but in the pathological specimens it was present in a preactivated conformation as a consequence of anomalous dephosphorylation of its inhibitory phospho-Tyr527 residue, likely mediated by Src homology-2 domain-containing protein Tyr-phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), whose constitutive activity correlated with its recruitment to Src. Low thrombin concentration triggered a more rapid Src-signaling activation, higher [Ca(2+)](c) increase, and aggregation in pathological platelets compared with controls. Thrombin-induced Src activation preceded JAK2 activation, which occurred simultaneously in normal and pathological platelets. Our results indicate that a constitutive Src kinase preactivation is implicated in platelet hypersensitivity and likely involved, at least partially, in the functional abnormalities of PV and ET platelets.

Unmodified electroconvulsive therapy: the perspective of patients from a developing country. The controversy that exists over the relevance of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in contemporary psychiatric care often excludes the opinion of patients. Optimizing ECT service delivery must include the perspectives and input of service users. In Nigeria, the opinions of patients have not been explored. To evaluate the perspective of patients who have previously received ECT toward the process of delivery and the benefits and adverse effects of unmodified ECT. Ninety consecutive consenting stable outpatients who had received unmodified ECT between 6 and 12 months from the time of study were surveyed in a cross-sectional study design over a 3-month period using a semistructured Likert-type questionnaire at a referral psychiatric hospital in Nigeria. Most (75.5%) of the patients did not find the procedure stressful and reported ECT being beneficial (82.2%). Most complained of deficiency in the process of ECT service delivery and reported not been adequately informed before receiving ECT (88.9%). A third reported experiencing memory impairment after ECT. Headaches and muscle pains were reported in 8.9% and 17.8% of patients, respectively. Patients who experienced headaches after ECT were more likely to perceive ECT as stressful (P < 0.005), whereas those who experienced memory impairment were less likely to receive ECT again if indicated (P < 0.001). Unmodified ECT is fairly well accepted among patients, although a majority complained of deficiencies in information provided about and consent toward the procedure. Improving ECT service delivery and addressing adverse effects may improve treatment acceptability.

Time-varying spectrum estimation of heart rate variability signals with Kalman smoother algorithm. A time-varying parametric spectrum estimation method for analyzing dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) signals is presented. In the method, HRV signal is first modeled with a time-varying autoregressive model and the model parameters are solved recursively with a Kalman smoother algorithm. Time-varying spectrum estimates are then obtained from the estimated model parameters. The obtained spectrum can be further decomposed into separate components, which is especially advantageous in HRV applications where low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components are generally aimed to be distinguished. As case studies, the dynamics of HRV signals recorded during 1) orthostatic test, 2) exercise test and 3) simulated driving task are analyzed.

Vagus nerve stimulation: a proven therapy for treatment of epilepsy strives to improve efficacy and expand applications. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for the treatment of adult patients and adolescents aged 12 years and older who have partial onset seizures refractory to antiepileptic medications. More than 50,000 patients worldwide have been implanted with the VNS system. Work continues to understand the mechanism of action of VNS with the goal of improving the treatment, particularly to identify patients who will be helped by VNS, to develop a closed-loop seizure detection system, and to improve the selection of stimulation parameters. VNS has also been approved for treatment-resistant depression, and it may have utility in the treatment of a variety of other medical disorders.

Characterization of postural stability in a simulated environment of an earthquake using in-shoe plantar pressure measurement. An abled individual is believed to be capable of withstanding and overcoming the severe tremors of an earthquake as has been ascertained in a previous study. However, the event-related physiological mechanisms of human postural stability during an earthquake are subject to further investigation. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to further characterize postural stability in a simulated environment of an earthquake using a pedar-x (novel gmbh, Munich, Germany) in-shoe dynamic plantar pressure measurement system. A foot mask, dividing each of the insoles into seven plantar loading regions, was employed in this study. This paper reports preliminary results obtained from a normal adult female test subject with right side dominance and a normal foot arch. The test trial was comprised of 12 stages, ranging from quiet standing to simulated earthquake magnitude of 6.7 degrees on the Richter's scale, which is considered to be violent. The study metrics included: mean plantar pressure, foot-to-ground contact duration, insole loading area, and the position, displacement, and instantaneous velocity of the center of pressure. The study showed bilateral quantifiable changes in these metrics by foot-mask-region as a result of increasing magnitudes of simulated tremors. The subject was able to defy the overwhelming perturbations and maintain her balance and postural stability throughout the test period. The significance of this study lies in its ability to determine the threshold of falling within different subject populations in the event of an earthquake.


Gastric stromal tumors in Carney triad are different clinically, pathologically, and behaviorally from sporadic gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors: findings in 104 cases.

Silicon on silicon: self-organized nanotip arrays formed in reactive Ar+H2 plasmas. The formation of arrays of vertically aligned nanotips on a moderately heated (up to 500 degrees C) Si surface exposed to reactive low-temperature radio frequency (RF) Ar+H(2) plasmas is studied. It is demonstrated that the nanotip surface density, aspect ratio and height dispersion strongly depend on the substrate temperature, discharge power, and gas composition. It is shown that nanotips with aspect ratios from 2.0 to 4.0 can only be produced at a higher RF power density (41.7 mW cm(-3)) and a hydrogen content of about 60%, and that larger aspect ratios can be achieved at substrate temperatures of about 300 degrees C. The use of higher (up to 500 degrees C) temperatures leads to a decrease of the aspect ratio but promotes the formation of more uniform arrays with the height dispersion decreasing to 1.5. At lower (approximately 20 mW cm(-3)) RF power density, only semispherical nanodots can be produced. Based on these experimental results, a nanotip formation scenario is proposed suggesting that sputtering, etching, hydrogen termination, and atom/radical re-deposition are the main concurrent mechanisms for the nanostructure formation. Numerical calculations of the ion flux distribution and hydrogen termination profiles can be used to predict the nanotip shapes and are in a good agreement with the experimental results. This approach can be applied to describe the kinetics of low-temperature formation of other nanoscale materials by plasma treatment.

Isolation and quantitation of Clostridium difficile in aqueous and fecal matter using two types of selective media. We evaluated the isolation and quantitation of Clostridium difficile from aqueous and fecal samples utilizing ChromID CDIF and cycloserine, cefoxitin, and fructose-containing agar with horse blood and taurocholate media. Growth was similar between the two. ChromID CDIF provided enhanced isolation and required no ethanol pretreatment to inhibit normal flora. ChromID CDIF also improved turn-around time, requiring only 24 hours' incubation. 

Enzymatic Synthesis and Functional Characterization of Bioactive Microcin C-Like Compounds with Altered Peptide Sequence and Length. Escherichia coli microcin C (McC) consists of a ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide attached to a modified adenosine. McC is actively taken up by sensitive Escherichia coli strains through the YejABEF transporter. Inside the cell, McC is processed by aminopeptidases, which release nonhydrolyzable aminoacyl adenylate, an inhibitor of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. McC is synthesized by the MccB enzyme, which terminally adenylates the MccA heptapeptide precursor MRTGNAN. Earlier, McC analogs with shortened peptide lengths were prepared by total chemical synthesis and were shown to have strongly reduced biological activity due to decreased uptake. Variants with longer peptides were difficult to synthesize, however. Here, we used recombinant MccB to prepare and characterize McC-like molecules with altered peptide moieties, including extended peptide lengths. We find that N-terminal extensions of E. coli MccA heptapeptide do not affect MccB-catalyzed adenylation and that some extended-peptide-length McC analogs show improved biological activity. When the peptide length reaches 20 amino acids, both YejABEF and SbmA can perform facilitated transport of toxic peptide adenylates inside the cell. A C-terminal fusion of the carrier maltose-binding protein (MBP) with the MccA peptide is also recognized by MccB in vivo and in vitro, allowing highly specific adenylation and/or radioactive labeling of cellular proteins. Enzymatic adenylation of chemically synthesized peptides allowed us to generate biologically active derivatives of the peptide-nucleotide antibiotic microcin C with improved bioactivity and altered entry routes into target cells, opening the way for development of various McC-based antibacterial compounds not found in nature.

Stability challenges in drug discovery. Stability is one of the most important properties of drug candidates. Instable compounds can lead to false positive high-throughput screening (HTS) hits, incorrect bioassay results, erroneous structure-activity relationships (SAR), low oral bioavailability, drug withdrawal, toxic reactions from degradation products, and difficult formulation development. Screening of stability has been implemented early in drug discovery to identify labile chemotypes and guide structural modification. The most commonly applied stability studies in drug discovery are stability-pH profile, stability in gastrointestinal fluids, stability in bioassay media, excipient compatibility, and prodrug screening. The strategy enhances the quality of drug development candidates and reduces the risks.

A half-field stimulation pattern for SSVEP-based brain-computer interface. A novel stimulation pattern has been designed for brain-computer interface (BCI) using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals. Each target is composed of two flickers placed on right-and-left visual fields. The user is expected to concentrate his or her sight on the fixation point which is located in the middle of the two flickers modulated at specific frequencies respectively. Considering the role of optic chiasm, the two frequency components could be extracted from contralateral occipital regions. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to distinguish the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency components from right-and-left visual cortex. The attractive feature of this method is that it would substantially increase the number of targets by a combination of frequencies. Based on this technique a nine-target SSVEP-based BCI system was designed using only three different frequencies. The test results with 8 subjects showed a classification accuracy between 40.0% and 96.3%.

Gender-dependent oxidative variations in liver of aged rats.

A high dose of IMT504, the PyNTTTTGT prototype immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, does not alter embryonic development in rats. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are currently being evaluated as vaccine adjuvants for inducing protective immunity. As maternal vaccination is becoming increasingly common, the potential risk of vaccine formulation using ODN adjuvants should be warranted. A recent study performed in mice suggests that exposure to CpG motifs during pregnancy could result (although at very high doses as compared to the ones proposed for human vaccination) in fetal loss and morphological defects. PyNTTTTGT ODNs are immunostimulatory ODNs not bearing CpG motifs, which are very efficient vaccine adjuvants. In this report, we analyzed the potential teratogenic effect of its prototype IMT504 in rats. This animal model was chosen because PyNTTTTGT ODNs are barely active in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of IMT504 at a dose of 20 mg/kg (more than 1000 times higher than the one proposed for a vaccine dose in humans) at day 6 of pregnancy did not produce a significant decrease in the mean number of implanted fetuses or in the number of live pups delivered. Neither the fetuses nor the offspring presented malformations.


[Clinical evaluation of the consistency between two diagnostic criteria for diabetic peripheral neuropathy].

Multicolor fluorescent intravital live microscopy (FILM) for surgical tumor resection in a mouse xenograft model. Complete surgical resection of neoplasia remains one of the most efficient tumor therapies. However, malignant cell clusters are often left behind during surgery due to the inability to visualize and differentiate them against host tissue. Here we establish the feasibility of multicolor fluorescent intravital live microscopy (FILM) where multiple cellular and/or unique tissue compartments are stained simultaneously and imaged in real time. Theoretical simulations of imaging probe localization were carried out for three agents with specificity for cancer cells, stromal host response, or vascular perfusion. This transport analysis gave insight into the probe pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution, facilitating the experimental design and allowing predictions to be made about the localization of the probes in other animal models and in the clinic. The imaging probes were administered systemically at optimal time points based on the simulations, and the multicolor FILM images obtained in vivo were then compared to conventional pathological sections. Our data show the feasibility of real time in vivo pathology at cellular resolution and molecular specificity with excellent agreement between intravital and traditional in vitro immunohistochemistry. Multicolor FILM is an accurate method for identifying malignant tissue and cells in vivo. The imaging probes distributed in a manner similar to predictions based on transport principles, and these models can be used to design future probes and experiments. FILM can provide critical real time feedback and should be a useful tool for more effective and complete cancer resection.

Maxillary sinus anatomy variation and nasal cavity width: structural computed tomography imaging. Variability of the bony structures located in the maxillary sinus, and of the lateral nasal wall topography, have practical significance during surgical procedures conducted by maxillofacial surgeons or otolaryngologists. The retrospective analysis of 111 computed tomography examinations of patients (52 male and 59 female) diagnosed in our institution was made to evaluate anatomical variations of the maxillary sinus. In the study the frequency of the Haller cell was 29/222 (13%), and the prevalence of one or more septa per sinus was 49/222 (26%). The infraorbital recess was found in 6/222 (3%) of cases. The mean width of the nasal duct was enlarged at the side where the Haller cell was present (p < 0.01) or where bony septa were absent in the maxillary sinus (p < 0.01). Bony structures of the maxillary sinus and changes in topography of the lateral nasal wall should compel surgeons to carefully analyze the computed tomography scans before operations in this area.

When Frail Individuals or Their Families Request Nonindicated Interventions: Usefulness of the Four-Box Ethical Approach. In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting patient autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making treatment decisions that are aligned with the patient's priorities and values. As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing clinically responsible and person-centered care is illustrated.

[Reliability of immunoturbidimetric urine albumin determination for normal and moderately high values]. The value of albuminuria determination is commonly accepted in the monitoring of renal function, particularly in diabetic patients. This may be achieved in different ways and using different assay kits. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of immunoturbidimetric measurements by comparing the results obtained by two different methods in our laboratory. Therefore we measured albuminuria of 54 patients monitored for their diabetes, with normal to moderately high albuminuria, according to two methods: Microalbumin reagent (Beckman Coulter) on a Unicel DxC 600 (Beckman Coulter) and Albumin Turbiquant reagent (Dade Behring, Siemens) on a Turbitimer system (Dade Behring, Siemens). It was then possible to study the correlation between the two techniques. Our results suggest that although this correlation is excellent, the values differ significantly: the results observed with the Siemens method are higher by about 10%. It seems legitimate to think that a correction should be applied, depending on the used method. In addition, it appears that standardization is necessary, concerning analytical stage but although urine collection, pre-analytical stage or reporting and interpretation of results.


Risk factors of herpes zoster among children immunized with varicella vaccine: results from a nested case-control study.

[Enteral non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young age--difficult diagnosis]. Lately, we have been confronted with an increased number of malignant tumors of the large bowel, appearing at younger patients. Among all histopathologic forms of malignant colonic tumors treated in our Clinic, lymphoma is the fifth as frequency of apparition, respectively the fourth at patients less than 40 years old. We present the case of a 22-years-old patient, having colonic polyposis and multicentric non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the terminal ileum and ascending colon. This pathologic association represented for us an uncommon situation. The rest of malignant colonic tumors developed on patients with rectocolonic polyposis were adenocarcinoma.

The role of expanded coverage of the national vitamin A program in preventing morbidity and mortality among preschool children in India. Higher food prices increase the risk of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children in poor families, because a larger part of the household food budget is spent on grain foods and less on vitamin A-rich foods. Vitamin A supplementation is an important source of vitamin A for children. Our objective was to characterize coverage of the India national vitamin A program for preschool children and identify risk factors for not receiving vitamin A. Anthropometric and demographic data were examined in 23,008 children aged 12-59 mo in the India National Family Health Survey, 2005-2006. Within the last 6 mo, 20.2% of children received vitamin A supplementation. The prevalence of stunting, severe stunting, underweight, and severe underweight was higher among children who did not receive vitamin A compared with those who received vitamin A (P < 0.0001). In families with a child who did and did not receive vitamin A, respectively, the proportion with a history of under-5 child mortality was 8.4 vs. 11.4% (P < 0.0001). By state, vitamin A program coverage was inversely proportional to the under-5 child mortality rate (r = -0.51; P = 0.004). Maternal education of > or =10 y [odds ratio (OR) 2.22; 95% CI 1.69-2.91], 7-9 y (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.57-2.53), or 1-6 y (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.28-2.13) compared with no education was an important factor related to receipt of vitamin A. Poor coverage of the vitamin A supplementation program in India has serious implications in the face of rising food prices. Expanded coverage of the vitamin A program in India will help protect children from morbidity, mortality, and blindness.

Pulmonary function changes after various anterior approaches in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Prospective radiographic and chart review of pulmonary function in patients who underwent 3 different anterior spinal surgery approaches for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). To assess the impact on pulmonary function in patients with AIS after anterior surgical approaches, including open thoracotomy, thoracoscopic with and without thoracoplasty, and thoracoabdominal 2 years after surgery. Potential advantages of anterior surgery in the treatment of AIS include saving of distal motion segments and improving kyphosis restoration in the thoracic spine, possibly at the cost of pulmonary function impairment. Although thoracoscopic spinal instrumentation and fusion has recently been shown to induce less pulmonary impairment compared with open thoracotomy, no study has evaluated the effect of thoracoplasty as an adjunct to thoracoscopic surgery, nor the effects of the thoracoabdominal approach for thoracolumbar curvature. A multicenter spinal deformity database was queried for patients who underwent an anterior approach for either Lenke I or Lenke V idiopathic scoliosis. There were 68 patients in the thoracotomy group, 44 in the thoracoscopic group, and 19 in the thoracoabdominal group. Absolute and percent-predicted values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and total lung capacity (TLC) were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up, and comparisons were made within and between each group. Comparing between groups at 2 years postoperatively, the thoracotomy group demonstrated significantly greater decreases (-10.97% and -12.97%) in both percent-predicted FEV1 and FVC, respectively, when compared with the thoracoscopic group (-4.40% and -4.73%), respectively. Percent-predicted TLC in the thoracoscopic group increased (3.19%), but decreased in the thoracotomy group (-8.00%). Subanalysis of the thoracoscopic group at 2 years revealed that the addition of a thoracoplasty (3 to 5 ribs) significantly reduced percent-predicted FEV1 (-11.6%, P = 0.0013) and percent-predicted FVC (-16.0%, P = 0.017) from baseline. Patients who underwent thoracoscopy alone without a thoracoplasty experienced no significant detrimental changes in these parameters at 2 years, and instead experienced significant increases in absolute TLC (P < 0.001) and percent-predicted TLC (P = 0.035). There were no significant changes demonstrated in the thoracoabdominal group for all 3 parameters. Slight declines in pulmonary function at 2-year follow-up were noted in both the thoracotomy and thoracoscopic groups, but to a significantly greater extent in those with an open thoracotomy. Significantly greater impairment in pulmonary function was seen in thoracoscopic patients who underwent thoracoplasty, whereas those without thoracoplasty either had no significant declines at 2 years or experienced slight but significant improvement. No significant diminishment was noted for the thoracoabdominal approach, despite disruption of the diaphragm.

Visual 3Dx: algorithms for quantitative 3-dimensional analysis of ECG signals. The 12-lead ECG is useful for cardiac diagnosis but has limited sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed the Visual3Dx, a comprehensive method for describing cardiac electrical activity in time and space. The Visual3Dx transforms the ECG input into a time-variable heart vector, and normalizes each lead input to assure equal representation from all cardiac regions. We compared the Visual3Dx to the standard 12-lead ECG for detection of acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) in 2 clinical models. Model 1 was AMI after 90 s of balloon coronary occlusion in 117 cases. Model 2 was 122 consecutive patients who: (1) presented to an urban emergency department with chest pain; (2) were admitted to coronary care and developed elevated cardiac troponin levels; and (3) had coronary arteriography within 6 hrs. In Model 1, the 12 lead ECG developed ST segment deviation diagnostic of AMI in 78/117 occlusions (67%), whereas using the same input ECG data, the Visual3Dx was diagnostic of AMI in 105/117 occlusions (90%; p<0.001). In Model 2, the first 12 lead ECG was diagnostic of AMI in 80/122 (66%), whereas the Visual3Dx was diagnostic in 103/122 (84%). In both Models, the largest sensitivity gains were seen in left circumflex and right coronary artery occlusions. The Visual3Dx is a promising tool for 3D quantitative analysis of cardiac electrical activity that may improve diagnosis of AMI, especially in electrically remote regions of the heart. Additional studies will define diagnostic specificity and further improve 3D biomarkers of AMI.

Editorial: Imaging and the treatment of Crohn's perianal fistulas: to see is to believe. Fistulizing Crohn's disease is associated with significant morbidity. Although treatment has improved over the last decade, there is still considerable room for improvement. One possible method to improve outcomes is to use advanced imaging techniques, such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help guide treatment. In this issue, Ng et al. show again the disconnect between cessation of drainage and the actual deep healing that can be appreciated using these imaging techniques. The authors used MRI to help guide the decision on when to alter medical therapy and were able to identify a subset of patients who could discontinue infliximab. Other authors over the last 5-10 years have also shown the benefit of EUS and MRI in these patients. The time has come for us to not only embrace these imaging modalities as valid end points for clinical trials but more importantly as a means to improve outcomes for our patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease.

A new antimicrobial peptide isolated from Oudneya africana seeds. Oudneya africana R. Br. (Brassicaceae), a wild-growing plant in the arid region of Tunisia, is used in ethno-medicinal treatment of microbial infections. Validation of ethno-therapeutic claims pertaining to the plant was sought by investigating its antimicrobial activity. A proteinaceous extract of the seeds, called AS-3000, showed activity against various organisms including L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. subtilis, E. hirae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. albicans. Extract AS-3000 exhibited a synergistic effect against L. ivanovii when combined with vancomycin or chloramphenicol. The post-antibiotic inhibitory effect of the ampicillin/AS-3000 combination was 2.3-fold greater than for the antibiotic alone. The mode of action of AS-3000 on Listeria and Escherichia was visible using SEM. These results support the use of O. africana for treating microbial infections.

PREDICTING RESPONSE OF EXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION TO BEVACIZUMAB BASED ON SPECTRALIS OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY. To identify baseline optical coherence tomography factors in exudative age-related macular degeneration that predict response to bevacizumab injections. Patients underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography at diagnosis and the width, height, area, and location of the subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detachment, and subretinal tissue were measured. The location and size of photoreceptor and the loss of retinal pigment epithelium were recorded as well as quantitative retinal measurements. Patients received three consecutive monthly injections of bevacizumab after which their best-corrected visual acuity was recorded. Overall 105 eyes of 105 patients aging 88 ± 8.6 years were included. In univariate correlational analyses, only subretinal fluid width demonstrated a significant positive correlation with improved best-corrected visual acuity (R = 0.230, P = 0.018). Eyes with intraretinal fluid (P = 0.020) and retinal pigment epithelial loss (P = 0.009) located in the subfoveal (as opposed to the juxtafoveal area) demonstrating worst visual outcomes. In stepwise backwards regression, the subretinal fluid width and intraretinal fluid location were the only parameters that remained significant explaining 9.23% of the variation in delta best-corrected visual acuity scores. Improvement in best-corrected visual acuity after three injections of bevacizumab can be predicted from optical coherence tomography measurements. Specifically, the authors identified subretinal fluid width and intraretinal fluid location as significant markers.

Effects of tamoxifen on morphological and ultrastructural aspects of developing hippocampus of rat. Tamoxifen treatment induced cell death in the hippocampus formation of the prenatal and postnatal rat. The present study delineates the effect of tamoxifen on developing hippocampus in prenatal, postnatal and full term neonate rats received certain doses of the partial antagonist tamoxifen. After perfusion and fixation, the brains were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. The morphology, ultrastructure and the density of the neurons in different ages (E22, P1, P7 and P21) and in different areas of developing hippocampus including cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3), dentate gyrus and subiculum were studied. These findings showed that in tamoxifen-treated groups, the cell number of pyramidal neurons of CA1 and subiculum significantly decreased comparing to control groups in E22, P1 and P7 but not in third weeks. The mitochondria of the above mentioned groups also showed a dilated feature with less cristae than control group and most of them were greatly enlarged and swollen into spherical shapes rather than the normal ovoid or rod shape. The present study shows that prenatal exposure to tamoxifen alters neurogenesis in developing rat hippocampus. These results demonstrated the non-neuroprotective roles of tamoxifen.

Surface dependence of protein nanocrystal formation. The self-assembly kinetics and nanocrystal formation of the bacterial surface-layer-protein SbpA are studied with a combination of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Silane coupling agents, aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), are used to vary the protein-surface interaction in order to induce new recrystallization pathways. The results show that the final S-layer crystal lattice parameters (a = b = 14 nm, gamma = 90 degrees ), the layer thickness (15 nm), and the adsorbed mass density (1700 ng cm(-2)) are independent of the surface chemistry. Nevertheless, the adsorption rate is five times faster on APTS and OTS than on SiO(2,) strongly affecting protein nucleation and growth. As a consequence, protein crystalline domains of 0.02 microm(2) for APTS and 0.05 microm(2) for OTS are formed, while for silicon dioxide the protein domains have a typical size of about 32 microm(2). In addition, more-rigid crystalline protein layers are formed on hydrophobic substrates. In situ AFM experiments reveal three different kinetic steps: adsorption, self-assembly, and crystalline-domain reorganization. These steps are corroborated by frequency-dissipation curves. Finally, it is shown that protein adsorption is a diffusion-driven process. Experiments at different protein concentrations demonstrate that protein adsorption saturates at 0.05 mg mL(-1) on silane-coated substrates and at 0.07 mg mL(-1) on hydrophilic silicon dioxide.

Systemic candesartan reduces brain angiotensin II via downregulation of brain renin-angiotensin system. The renin-angiotensin system has an important function in the regulation of blood pressure as well as in pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. We examined the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) on brain angiotensin II levels in angiotensin II-infused hypertensive rats. Angiotensin II or vehicle was infused subcutaneously for 14 days in Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin II infusion resulted in increased blood pressure, an effect that was blocked by candesartan treatment. There was no effect of the angiotensin II infusion on Angiotensin II levels in the brain or on blood-brain barrier permeability. Brain tissue angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme mRNA levels were not changed by angiotensin II infusion but were decreased by candesartan treatment. At 2 weeks of treatment, CV11974, an active form of candesartan, was detectable in the plasma but was not detectable in brain tissue. These data suggest that treatment with candesartan decreases brain angiotensin II by decreasing brain angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme gene expression.

[Significance of lipopolysaccharides, toll-like receptor and inducible nitric oxide synthase in hepatopulmonary syndrome]. To investigate the role of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the development of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Seventy-one patients were divided into 3 groups: end-stage liver disease with HPS (HPS group, n = 31), end-stage liver disease without HPS (non-HPS group, n = 30) and healthy volunteers (n = 10). Blood was collected at pre-OLT and Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-OLT to detect the plasma LPS level, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA in peripheral blood monocytes. The LPS, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA at pre-OLT in HPS group were 4.31 +/- 3.267 ng/L, 336,594.10 +/- 366,901.14 and 63,982.24 +/- 74,127.47 copies/microg RNA respectively; 1.62 +/- 1.34 ng/L, 336,321.53 +/- 222,317.17 and 44,169.9 +/- 24,993.00 copies/microg RNA respectively in non-HPS group and 0.94 +/- .69 ng/L, 10,338.28 +/- 3,814.64 and 19,168.49 +/- 2,417.35 copies/microg RNA in normal control group. LPS, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA at pre-OLT in HPS group were higher than those in non-HPS group without significance (P > 0.05), but significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). The TLR2mRNA decreased in all end-stage liver disease patients at post-OLT with the improvement of liver function and oxygenation. The dysfunction of intestinal barrier and intestinal endotoxemia may be the important mechanisms of HPS through the elevation of LPS level and the expressions of TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA.

Preparation and mechanism of ultra-lightweight ceramics produced from sewage sludge. The preparation, characterization, preheating mechanism and bloating mechanism of ultra-lightweight ceramics (ULWC) manufactured by dehydrated sewage sludge (DSS) and clay were studied. Three experiments were designed to investigate the addition of DSS, the effect of preheating treatment and sintering treatment, respectively, and then the optimum conditions for preparing ULWC were determined. Chemical components, especially ratios of carbon content to iron oxide content (C/Fe-ratios), were used to explain the preheating mechanism; physical forces (surface tension and bloating force) combined with C/Fe-ratios were used to explain the bloating mechanism. The characterizations (physical properties, microstructure properties and toxic metal leaching properties) of ULWC that were prepared under the optimum conditions were tested. The results showed that the optimum addition of DSS was 20-30 wt.%, and the pellets which preheated at 400 degrees C for 20 min and sintered at 1150 degrees C for 10 min were beneficial to produce ULWC. Property tests of ULWC showed that ULWC was light (with a bulk density of 330.80 kg m(-3)), waterproof (with a water absorption of 5.30 wt.%), nontoxic (contents of toxic metal leaching test were all below the detection limit) and suitable for practical civil engineering.

Antiallergic herbal composition from Scutellaria baicalensis and Phyllostachys edulis. We aimed to find antiallergic agents from natural sources using mast cells activated during allergic reaction. We screened over 2000 plants for blockade of histamine release and identified two of them, S. baicalenesis and P. edulis. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to two main constituent flavonoids, baicalin from S. baicalenesis roots and isoorientin from P. edulis leaves. Based on these two compounds, two standardized extracts (SSBE and SPEE) and a combined standardized herb composition (SHC) were developed. SSBE, SPEE, and SHC remarkably inhibited histamine and leukotriene release from mast cells activated by anti-OVA/OVA binding, and SHC showed a stronger inhibition than either extract alone. SHC also showed greater inhibition potency than either aspirin or cromolyn, which are known antiallergic agents. Our results suggest that SHC reduce degranulation during mast cell activation and could be a promising candidate for the treatment of immune/allergic diseases related to mast cells.


Pre-adolescent gender differences in associations between temperament, coping, and mood.

Airborne study of grass allergen (Lol p 1) in different-sized particles. The Poaceae family is considered one of the main causes of pollen allergy in industrialized countries. The aim of this study is to establish the dynamics of the Poaceae allergens and determine their distribution in the different-sized particles in the atmosphere. The air of Granada (southern Spain) was sampled during the pollination period of Poaceae using a cascade impactor and a Hirst-type volumetric collector simultaneously. The sampled airborne allergens were analyzed by indirect ELISA and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Airborne pollen was evaluated with the Spanish Aerobiological Network methodology. Poaceae pollen and allergenic activity have parallel dynamics during the period of maximum pollination, which is reflected in the positive correlations between the 2 variables. In addition, the highest Lol p 1 concentrations were recorded in particle sizes lower than 3.3 mum (stage 4-F). The Spearman correlation test showed that airborne allergens are not dependent on meteorological factors, such as humidity, wind direction or sunshine, however, Lol p 1 allergen correlated positively with Poaceae pollen. The results of the present study confirm that the Lol p 1 allergen is detected more frequently with pollutants than with coarse particles with similar dynamics and a positive correlation between airborne pollen and aeroallergens. Moreover, Lol p 1 is released in stable weather conditions without large changes in humidity or temperature.

The acute testosterone, growth hormone, cortisol and interleukin-6 response to 164-km road cycling in a hot environment. This study investigated the acute endocrine responses to a 164-km road cycling event in a hot environment. Thirty-four male experienced cyclists (49.1 ± 8.3 years, 86.8 ± 12.5 kg, 178.1 ± 5.1 cm) participating in a 164-km road cycling event were recruited. Blood samples were collected within 0.3-2.0 h before the start (PRE: ~0500-0700 h) and immediately following the ride (POST). Samples were analysed for testosterone, growth hormone (GH), cortisol and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The temperature and humidity during the event were 35.3 ± 4.9°C and 47.2 ± 14.0%, respectively. Based on the finishing time, results for the fastest (FAST, 305 ± 10 min) and the slowest (SLOW, 467 ± 31 min) quartiles were compared. At POST, testosterone concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) lower (PRE, 20.8 ± 8.6; POST, 18.2 ± 6.7 nmol · L(-1)), while GH (PRE, 0.3 ± 0.1; POST, 2.3 ± 0.3 µg · L(-1)), cortisol (PRE, 661 ± 165; POST, 1073 ± 260 nmol · L(-1)) and IL-6 (PRE, 4.0 ± 3.4; POST, 22.4 ± 15.2 pg · mL(-1)) concentrations were significantly higher than those at PRE. At POST, GH and cortisol were significantly higher for the FAST group than for the SLOW group (GH, 3.6 ± 2.0 and 1.0 ± 0.8 µg · L(-1); cortisol, 1187 ± 209 and 867 ± 215 nmol · L(-1)). Participation in an ultra-endurance road cycling event in a hot environment induced significant acute changes in concentrations of circulating hormones, with a greater augmentation of GH and cortisol in those completing the ride fastest. 

A prospective observational trial on emesis in radiotherapy: analysis of 1020 patients recruited in 45 Italian radiation oncology centres. A prospective observational multicentre trial was carried out to assess the incidence, pattern, and prognostic factors of radiation-induced emesis (RIE), and to evaluate the use of antiemetic drugs in patients treated with radiotherapy or concomitant radio-chemotherapy. The application in clinical practice of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer guidelines was also studied. Forty-five Italian radiation oncology centres took part in this trial. The accrual lasted for 3 consecutive weeks and only patients starting radiotherapy or concomitant radio-chemotherapy in this period were enrolled. Evaluation was based on diary card filled in daily by patients during treatment and one week after stopping it. Diary card recorded the intensity of nausea/vomiting and prophylactic/symptomatic antiemetic drug prescriptions. A total of 1020 patients entered into the trial, and 1004 were evaluable. Vomiting and nausea occurred in 11.0% and 27.1% of patients, respectively, and 27.9% patients had both vomiting and nausea. In multifactorial analysis, the only statistically significant patient-related risk factors were concomitant chemotherapy and previous experience of vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Moreover, two radiotherapy-related factors were significant risk factors for RIE, the irradiated site (upper abdomen) and field size (>400 cm(2)). An antiemetic drug was given only to a minority (17%) of patients receiving RT, and the prescriptions were prophylactic in 12.4% and symptomatic in 4.6%. Different compounds and a wide range of doses and schedules were used. These data were similar to those registered in our previous observational trial, and the radiation oncologists' attitude in underestimating RIE and under prescribing antiemetics was confirmed.

An oral sorbent, AST-120, increases Klotho expression and inhibits cell senescence in the kidney of uremic rats. Klotho, an anti-aging gene, is primarily expressed in the kidney, and its renal expression is decreased in chronic renal failure (CRF). We determined if administration of an oral sorbent, AST-120, increases the expression of Klotho, and inhibits cell senescence in the kidney of CRF rats. CRF rats were produced by 4/5-nephrectomy. AST-120 was administered to the CRF rats at a dose of 4 g/kg with powder chow for 16 weeks, whereas powder chow alone was administered to control CRF rats. The expression of Klotho and cell senescence (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase: SA-beta-gal) was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Klotho was significantly decreased in the kidney of CRF rats as compared with normal rats. AST-120-treated CRF rats showed significantly increased renal expression of Klotho as compared with CRF rats. The expression of SA-beta-gal was significantly increased in the kidney of CRF rats as compared with normal rats. AST-120-treated CRF rats showed significantly decreased expression of SA-beta-gal in the kidney as compared with CRF rats. AST-120 significantly decreased serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate. AST-120 increased Klotho expression, and inhibited cell senescence in the kidney of CRF rats, probably by alleviating indoxyl sulfate overload on the kidney.

Anatomic concepts for brow lift procedures. Brow lifting became a component of the facialplasty procedure 45 years ago, and the original brow-lifting technique incorporating a coronal incision approach is still practiced by many surgeons today. Over the past 15 years, however, the endoscope-assisted procedure and the limited incision, nonendoscopic techniques have evolved as alternate procedures for brow lifting. The level of artistry in performing any brow lift technique is raised when the surgeon acquires knowledge of upper facial anatomy and integrates that knowledge into a working concept of the aging process of the upper face. This article presents one surgeon's concepts of the process that culminate in the typical appearance of the aged upper face. The same understanding of upper facial anatomy that can be called upon to explain the steps in this aging process can also be applied to the technical steps of any foreheadplasty procedure. Those anatomic structures that play a role in this process are examined here. The typical appearance of the aged upper face is the product of muscle action and gravitational forces acting on the unique anatomy of the human face. Interestingly, the appearance of the typical aged upper face exhibits much the same characteristics as one might observe in the face of an individual experiencing the emotions of sadness or grief. It is an inappropriate facial expression of sadness or grief that most often motivates the patient to schedule a consultation with the plastic surgeon. Any of the brow lift procedures used in current clinical practice can provide a successful cosmetic result in selected patients if the procedure incorporates technical steps based on sound anatomic principles.


Ophthalmic artery-resistive index and evidence of overperfusion-related encephalopathy in severe preeclampsia.

A single mutation at the sheet switch region results in conformational changes favoring lambda6 light-chain fibrillogenesis. Systemic amyloid light-chain (LC) amyloidosis is a disease process characterized by the pathological deposition of monoclonal LCs in tissue. All LC subtypes are capable of fibril formation although lambda chains, particularly those belonging to the lambda6 type, are overrepresented. Here, we report the thermodynamic and in vitro fibrillogenic properties of several mutants of the lambda6 protein 6aJL2 in which Pro7 and/or His8 was substituted by Ser or Pro. The H8P and H8S mutants were almost as stable as the wild-type protein and were poorly fibrillogenic. In contrast, the P7S mutation decreased the thermodynamic stability of 6aJL2 and greatly enhanced its capacity to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The crystal structure of the P7S mutant showed that the substitution induced both local and long-distance effects, such as the rearrangement of the V(L) (variable region of the light chain)-V(L) interface. This mutant crystallized in two orthorhombic polymorphs, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and C222(1). In the latter, a monomer that was not arranged in the typical Bence-Jones dimer was observed for the first time. Crystal-packing analysis of the C222(1) lattice showed the establishment of intermolecular beta-beta interactions that involved the N-terminus and beta-strand B and that these could be relevant in the mechanism of LC fibril formation. Our results strongly suggest that Pro7 is a key residue in the conformation of the N-terminal sheet switch motif and, through long-distance interactions, is also critically involved in the contacts that stabilized the V(L) interface in lambda6 LCs.

Effect of metformin treatment on circulating osteoprotegerin in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Growing evidence suggests complex interplay between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and bone health. The present study's aim was to examine the impact of metformin treatment on circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) in patients with NAFLD, a population in which this relationship has not yet been studied. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 received daily metformin; Group 2 received a placebo. Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and OPG levels were examined at baseline and at the end of the study. In the placebo group, liver function and OPG levels did not change during the study. Among metformin-treated patients, significant declines in OPG and alkaline phosphatase were observed. CRP and ALT decreased marginally during the 4-month treatment period. While at baseline circulating OPG levels did not differ significantly between the groups, by the end of the study OPG was significantly lower in patients treated with metformin than in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Delta OPG was significantly greater in the metformin group than the placebo group (p = 0.001). In the general linear model, metformin treatment was the only significant independent predictor of endpoint and delta OPG. Metformin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in OPG levels in patients with NAFLD. The effect on OPG was associated with exposure to metformin per se. NCT01084486.

CONSORT: Different End-Points of Preoperative Nutrition and Outcome of Bowel Resection of Crohn Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Nutritional therapy cannot only improve nutritional status but also reduce bowel inflammation in Crohn disease (CD). The benefits of preoperative nutritional therapy on outcomes of surgery for CD have been demonstrated. However, the ideal end-points of preoperative nutrition in CD remain elusive. We conducted this study to figure out whether improvement of malnutrition or reduction of inflammation is the better end-point of preoperative nutrition for CD. This was a prospective, randomized study. All patients enrolled received preoperative nutrition with different end-points (improvement of malnutrition, IOM, or reduction of inflammation, ROI). The end-points were defined using serum albumin and body weight gain, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence of the disease were compared. A total of 108 patients were randomized and 91 patients (44 in IOM group and 47 in ROI group) completed this study. It took 25.57 ± 11.68 days to achieve ROI and 45.29 ± 18.47 days for IOM (P = 0.0023). After nutritional therapy, serum CRP, CDAI, and serum albumin in both groups improved significantly. But patients in the IOM group had a higher albumin level and body weight gain compared with ROI group (P = 0.0026, P < 0.0001). When comparing postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence, no significant differences were noted. Compared with IOM, ROI as the end-point of preoperative nutrition had the same benefits on operative outcomes in CD patients undergoing resection, but could be achieved in a shorter time (NCT01540942).

Medical treatments: in association or alone, their role and their future perspectives: novel molecular-targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Accumulated understanding of the molecular networks in the state of oncogene addiction, i.e., the "Achilles' heel of cancer," has led to the development of novel targeted therapies. Using genome-wide gene expression and network analysis, we have identified "Aurora kinase B" as a unique molecule to predict the lethal recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even after curative hepatectomy. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-array analysis revealed the genomic instability was closely related to Aurora kinase B expression in HCC. Then, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo effects of a selective inhibitor of Aurora kinase B on human HCC cells. Treatment with Aurora B inhibitor in vitro resulted in polyploidy and apoptotic cell death. The growth of orthotopic liver tumors was significantly suppressed by the Aurora B inhibitor. Our preclinical studies indicate that Aurora kinase B is a promising molecular target "Achilles' heel" for the treatment of aggressive HCC.

Reliability of bond dissociation enthalpy calculated by the PM6 method and experimental TEAC values in antiradical QSAR of flavonoids. The applicability of the newly developed RM1 and PM6 methods implemented in the semiempirical quantum chemistry mopac2009 software package in modeling free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids was examined. Bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of OH groups could be calculated much faster than with DFT method but with similar quality. Despite the known shortcomings of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay, we show that taking into account the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism of free radical scavenging of flavonoids encoded by minimal BDE values (BDE(min)) and the number of OH groups (nOH), as well as experimental data, reasonable QSAR models could be developed. For TEAC values of 38 flavonoids measured by the ABTS free radical, a model based on BDE(min) and nOH was developed, having very good statistical parameters (r=0.983, r(cv)=0.976). The applicability of this model to three different data sets of flavonoids and reliability of TEAC values measured in distinct laboratories were discussed. Finally, a reasonably good model of experimental vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) of 36 flavonoids was obtained (r=0.954, r(cv)=0.947), involving BDE(min) and nOH as descriptors. Additionally, all presented models have comparable fit and cross-validated statistical parameters, as well as significant regression coefficients.

Outwardly rectifying tonically active GABAA receptors in pyramidal cells modulate neuronal offset, not gain. Hippocampal pyramidal cell excitability is regulated both by fast synaptic inhibition and by tonically active high-affinity extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The impact of tonic inhibition on neuronal gain and offset, and thus on information processing, is unclear. Offset is altered by shunting inhibition, and the gain of a neuronal response to an excitatory input can be modified by changing the level of "background" synaptic noise. Therefore, tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors would be expected to modulate offset and, in addition, to alter gain through a shunting effect on synaptic noise. Here we show that tonically active GABA(A) receptors in CA1 pyramidal cells show marked outward rectification, while the peaks of IPSCs exhibit a linear current-voltage relationship. As a result, tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents have a minimal effect upon subthreshold membrane potential variation due to synaptic noise, but predominantly affect neurons at spiking threshold. Consistent with this, tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents in pyramidal cells exclusively affect offset and not gain. Modulation of tonically active GABA(A) receptors by fluctuations in extracellular GABA concentrations or neuromodulators acting on high-affinity receptors potentially provides a powerful mechanism to alter neuronal offset independently of neuronal gain.

A mechanistic review of silica-induced inhalation toxicity. Crystalline forms of silica have been proposed as positive control material for the toxicity test of inhaled particulate/fibrous matter, although mechanism of silica-induced inhalation toxicity has not yet been established. Inhalation exposure of α-quartz to rodents induces severe lung inflammation and fibrosis only after a certain period of latency, despite strong surface reactivity. The delayed occurrence of inhalation toxicity by α-quartz may be largely attributed to the sequestration of α-quartz particles by alternatively activated (M2) macrophages that express abundant levels of scavenger receptors but are relatively insensitive to inflammatory stimuli. When exposure to α-quartz continues, lung dust burden reaches a particle overload level, at which M2 macrophages cannot accommodate further quartz particles. Free quartz particles distributed in the interstitium interact with another subtype of macrophages, classically activated/inflammatory (M1) macrophages, which secrete various inflammatory cytokines, but silica-laden M1 macrophages initiate granuloma formation, which sequesters silica particles, too. Furthermore, the ability of M2 macrophages to clear foreign matter, particularly bacterial endotoxins [lipopolysaccharides (LPS)], may decrease due to α-quartz cytotoxicity. When LPS concentration in the lung reaches a certain level, LPS primes M1 macrophages to prepare for interleukin-1β production in response to α-quartz and also stimulates M1 macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-β, respectively. Besides, IFN-β may enhance TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated M1 macrophages. The elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines produce progressive lung inflammation and fibrosis. 

Congenital cardiac surgery in the less privileged regions of the world. Pediatric cardiac surgery has been available for several decades. With advances in recent years, the majority of children born with congenital heart disease, if repaired in time, are expected to lead normal productive lives. This privilege of early diagnosis and timely management is restricted to children in developed countries only. The majority of children born with congenital heart disease in developing countries do not get the necessary care, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Several reasons exist for this state of affairs. Most centers for congenital cardiac surgery are located in developed countries, whereas most children requiring cardiac surgery do not live in these countries. In less privileged regions of the world, the high cost of cardiac surgery makes it unaffordable for the families of these children. Furthermore, issues such as late presentation of cases, associated comorbid conditions, understaffing of units and limited resources contribute to suboptimal outcome in those who undergo surgery. This review discusses the current status of pediatric cardiac surgery in developing countries and the reasons for it. Some of the strategies for improvement, in the wake of limited resources, are suggested. Often, the resources are not only limited but improperly utilized.

Seasonal variation in hospital admission for road traffic injuries in England: analysis of hospital statistics. To report on seasonal variation in hospital admissions for traffic injuries to car and truck occupants, motorcyclists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Descriptive study of hospital admission statistics in England, 1999-2004. national average monthly admissions for injury; severity of injury, defined as death in hospital or a hospital admission lasting four days or more. Admissions for car occupants were highest in the winter months but seasonal variation was not great (highest and lowest months: December, 16% above monthly average; June, 5% below). There was a summer peak and winter trough in admissions for adult cyclists (June, 34% above average; December, 27% below) and motorcyclists (August, 33% above average; January, 43% below). Admissions for child pedestrians were highest in late spring and lowest in mid-winter (May, 24% above average; December, 28% below). By contrast, admissions for adult pedestrians were higher in winter than summer (December, 33% above average; July, 17% below). From April to September, there were more admissions for pedestrians and cyclists in England (44 875 in the six years of the study) than for car occupants (34 582). For cyclists, proportionally more injuries in the winter months were severe. Severity of injuries to car occupants did not show seasonal variation. The public health "toll" of traffic injuries, measured as total numbers of people injured, varies substantially by season. Although it is important to reduce all injuries, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, as unprotected road users, needs particular attention.

Precision medicine for metastatic breast cancer--limitations and solutions. The development of precision medicine for the management of metastatic breast cancer is an appealing concept; however, major scientific and logistical challenges hinder its implementation in the clinic. The identification of driver mutational events remains the biggest challenge, because, with the few exceptions of ER, HER2, PIK3CA and AKT1, no validated oncogenic drivers of breast cancer exist. The development of bioinformatic tools to help identify driver mutations, together with assessment of pathway activation and dependency should help resolve this issue in the future. The occurrence of secondary resistance, such as ESR1 mutations, following endocrine therapy poses a further challenge. Ultra-deep sequencing and monitoring of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) could permit early detection of the genetic events underlying resistance and inform on combination therapy approaches. Beside these scientific challenges, logistical and operational issues are a major limitation to the development of precision medicine. For example, the low incidence of most candidate genomic alterations hinders randomized trials, as the number of patients to be screened would be too high. We discuss these limitations and the solutions, which include scaling-up the number of patients screened for identifying a genomic alteration, the clustering of genomic alterations into pathways, and the development of personalized medicine trials. 

A cross-sectional analysis of perinatal depressive symptoms among Punjabi-speaking women: are they at risk? Depression is the leading cause of disability for childbearing women. We examined three specific research questions among Punjabi-speaking women residing in the Fraser Health Authority: 1) What are the prevalence rates of prenatal depressive symptoms? 2) Do Punjabi-speaking women have a higher likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms compared to English-speaking women after controlling for age, level of education and financial worries, and 3) Given the same level of exposure to level of education and financial worries, do Punjabi-speaking women have the same likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms? Data originated from the Fraser Health Authority prenatal registration database consisting of pregnant women (n = 9684) who completed a prenatal registration form between June 2009 and August 2010; 9.1 % indicated speaking Punjabi. The Whooley Depression Screen measured depressive symptoms. Chi-square tests and logistic multiple regression were used to examine the rates of reporting depressive symptoms among Punjabi-speaking women compared to English-speaking women. Punjabi-speaking women are at a higher risk for perinatal depressive symptoms. Women needing an interpreter were more likely to report prenatal depressive symptoms compared to English-speaking women. All registrants who reported financial worries had four and a half times the odds of reporting depressive symptoms. The impact of financial worries was significantly greater in the English-speaking women compared to the Punjabi-speaking women needing an interpreter. Using an established screening device, Punjabi-speaking women were found to be at higher risk for prenatal depressive symptoms.

Fate and Transport of Phthalates in Indoor Environments and the Influence of Temperature: A Case Study in a Test House. A case study in a test house was conducted to investigate the fate and transport of benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in residential indoor environments and the influence of temperature. Total airborne concentrations of phthalates were sensitive to indoor temperatures, and their steady-state concentration levels increased by a factor of 3 with an increase in temperature from 21 to 30 °C. Strong sorption of phthalates was observed on interior surfaces, including dust, dish plates, windows, mirrors, fabric cloth, and wood. Equilibrium partitioning coefficients for phthalates adsorbed to these surfaces were determined, and their values decreased with increasing temperature. For impervious surfaces, dimensionless partitioning coefficients were calculated and found to be comparable to reported values of the octanol-air partition coefficients of phthalates, Koa, suggesting that an organic film may develop on these surfaces. In addition, sorption kinetics was studied experimentally, and the equilibration time scale for impervious surfaces was found to be faster than that of fabric cloth. Finally, using an indoor fate model to interpret the measurement results, there was good agreement between model predictions and the observed indoor air concentrations of BBzP in the test house.

At our institution, one-fifth of pediatric patients undergoing hip and spine surgery require prolonged oxygen supplementation, most likely due to postoperative atelectasis. Using quality improvement methodology, we aimed to implement an innovative postoperative respiratory care algorithm for hip and spine surgery patients, with a global aim of improving respiratory outcomes. A multidisciplinary team developed a care algorithm that relied on an activated respiratory therapist (RT) and engagement of patients and families. The algorithm was implemented via multiple rapid tests of change. Process measures representing the beginning and end of the care algorithm were plotted on standard run charts. We evaluated the association of algorithm implementation with a primary outcome of prolonged (>10 hours) oxygen supplementation via a quasi-experimental design using Fisher's exact and t tests. The team successfully implemented the algorithm, with a reliability to process of 80%. Key interventions included education of RTs, a daily huddle, and implementation of automated orders. Among all hip and spine patients, algorithm implementation was associated with a small, non-statistically significant decrease in prolonged oxygen use (21% to 16%). Among patients with underlying chronic conditions, there was a significant decrease in prolonged oxygen use from 22% to 6% after algorithm implementation (P = .04). We implemented an innovative respiratory care algorithm in hip and spine surgery patients by empowering RTs and engaging families to participate in care. We found that this approach was associated with decreased prolonged oxygen use in patients with chronic underlying conditions.

Measuring Sleep Efficiency: What Should the Denominator Be? Inconsistency in operationally defining sleep efficiency (SE) creates confusion with regard to the conceptualization and use of the construct by researchers and clinicians. The source of the inconsistency is the denominator of the widely published operational definition of SE: ratio of total sleep time (TST) to time in bed (TIB) (multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage). When taken literally, TIB includes non-sleep-related activity (e.g., reading, texting, conversing with a partner, watching television) both prior to initiating sleep and after the final awakening. However, the construct of SE refers to TST compared to the amount of time spent attempting to initially fall asleep and sleep discontinuity. Non-sleep related activities in bed do not reflect that construct. Also, time out of bed during nighttime awakenings, a manifestation of sleep discontinuity, should be included in the SE denominator. Using TIB as the denominator can also create a methodological problem when SE is an outcome measure in sleep intervention research. It is proposed that research and practice would benefit by clarifying and adopting a consistent operational definition that more accurately captures the construct of SE. An alternate denominator, duration of the sleep episode (DSE), is suggested, where DSE = sleep onset latency (SOL) + TST + time awake after initial sleep onset but before the final awakening (WASO) + time attempting to sleep after final awakening (TASAFA). The proposed formula for SE would be: SE = TST / DSE (× 100). DSE can be easily calculated using standard sleep diary entries along with one item from the Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary. Implications for insomnia research and practice are discussed.


Expandable metal stents for endoscopic bilateral stent-within-stent placement for malignant hilar biliary obstruction.

Calmodulin inhibition contributes to sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer H1299 cells. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) preferentially triggers apoptosis in tumor cells versus normal cells. However, TRAIL alone is not effective in treating TRAIL-resistant tumors. We evaluated the effect of 180 enzyme inhibitors on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer H1299 cells, and found fluphenazine-N-2-chloroethane (a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist) sensitized TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, in the presence of TRAIL, it increased caspase-8 binding to the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), but decreased binding of FADD-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). Additionally, its combination with TRAIL inhibited Akt phosphorylation. These results were consistently observed in cells treated with CaM siRNA. We suggested the blockade of CaM could sensitize lung cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in at least 2 ways: (i) it can activate death-inducing signaling complex mediated apoptosis by inhibiting TRAIL-induced binding of FLIP and TRAIL-enhanced binding of caspase-8 to FADD; (ii) it can inhibit Akt phosphorylation, consequently leading to decreased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as FLIP and members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. This study suggests the combination of CaM antagonists with TRAIL may have the therapeutic potential to overcome the resistance of lung cancers to apoptosis.

Greater activation in left hemisphere language-related regions during simple judgment tasks among substance-dependent patients in treatment for alcoholism. Alcoholism is often associated with impaired emotional control. Alcoholics have also been found to have deficits in frontal lobe executive functions. Recent functional imaging studies have suggested that alcoholics show greater activation than nonalcoholics in circuits involving frontal lobes, as well as more posterior brain regions, when engaged in executive-type tasks. In this study, we compared brain activations of alcohol-dependent patients and healthy nonalcoholics while they performed 2 simple judgment tasks designed to activate frontal circuits involved in a basic form of decision making. Participants completed 1 judgment task that required an emotional judgment and 1 task that did not, which enabled us to study whether alcoholics had greater brain activation while performing executive tasks, and to determine if emotional tasks elicited even greater activation than nonemotional tasks. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while alcoholic patients and nonalcoholic controls viewed pictures from the International Affective Picture System. In 3 separate runs, participants viewed the images without making a judgment, determined whether the images were indoor or outdoor scenes, or decided if they liked or disliked the images. There was little difference in brain activation between alcoholics and controls when no judgment was required. When participants made judgments about either the location or whether they liked or disliked an image, however, we observed significantly increased activation in frontal, limbic, and temporal regions in the patients relative to the controls. Increases were particularly robust in the frontal lobe and in areas of the brain associated with language. When we compared the emotional to the nonemotional judgment, the alcoholics, but not the controls, showed greater activation in the ventral mesial frontal cortex. Alcoholic patients appear to use brain language areas more than nonalcoholics while making judgments about the setting or liking of emotionally arousing visual images. This increased activation may reflect a compensatory recruitment of brain regions to perform simple decision-making tasks.

Normalized power transmission between ABP and ICP in TBI. A new approach to study the pulse transmission between the cerebrovascular bed and the intracranial space is presented. In the proposed approach, the normalized power transmission between ABP and ICP has got the main attention rather than the actual power transmission. Evaluating the gain of the proposed transfer function at any single frequency can reveal how the percentage of contribution of that specific frequency component has been changed through the cerebrospinal system. The gain of the new transfer function at the fundamental cardiac frequency was utilized to evaluate the state of the brain in three TBI patients. Results were assessed using the reference evaluations achieved by a novel CT scan-based scoring scheme. In all three study cases, the gain of the transfer function showed a good capability to follow the trend of the CT scores and describe the brain state. Comparing the new transfer function with the traditional one and also the index of compensatory reserve, the proposed transfer function was found more informative about the state of the brain in the patients under study.

A systematic review protocol on the use of teaching portfolios for educators in further and higher education. This paper is a review protocol that will be used to identify, critically appraise and synthesize the best current evidence relating to the use of teaching portfolios for educators in further and higher education. While portfolio use as a means to assist students in further and higher education has undergone extensive research and review, their use as a tool to assist educators has yet to receive systematic attention. Reviews conducted on studies related to portfolio use and undergraduate students have suggested that a teaching portfolio may have a benefit for educators in higher education as a means to provide relevancy and focus to their teaching. The objectives of the review are to evaluate how a teaching portfolio assists educators in teaching and learning; to evaluate the effects of maintaining a teaching portfolio for educators in relation to personal development; to explore the type of portfolio used; to determine whether a teaching portfolio is perceived more beneficial for various grades and professional types; and to determine any motivating factors or workplace incentives behind its implementation and completion. A search of the following databases will be made: MEDLINE, CINAHL, BREI, ERIC and AUEI. The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for systematic reviews of quantitative and qualitative research. The review will offer clarity and direction on the use of teaching portfolios for educators, policymakers, supervisory managers and researchers involved in further and higher education.

Zinc catalyzed and mediated propargylations with propargyl boronates. The utility of allenyl and propargyl boronates for the propargylation of aldehydes and ketones mediated by zinc is presented. The reaction is catalytic in zinc with allenyl or propargyl borolanes. The propargylation with crystalline and air-stable propargyl diethanolamine boronates was also achieved. A catalytic cycle is proposed, and preliminary mechanistic studies are discussed.

Hemiparetic stepping to the beat: asymmetric response to metronome phase shift during treadmill gait. Walking in time with a metronome is associated with improved spatiotemporal parameters in hemiparetic gait; however, the mechanism linking auditory and motor systems is poorly understood. Hemiparetic cadence control with metronome synchronization was examined to determine specific influences of metronome timing on treadmill walking. A within-participant experiment examined correction processes used to maintain heel strike synchrony with the beat by applying perturbations to the timing of a metronome. Eight chronic hemiparetic participants (mean age = 70 years; standard deviation = 12) were required to synchronize heel strikes with metronome pulses set according to each individual's comfortable speed (mean 0.4 m/s). During five 100-pulse trials, a fixed-phase baseline was followed by 4 unpredictable metronome phase shifts (20% of the interpulse interval), which amounted to 10 phase shifts on each foot. Infrared cameras recorded the motion of bilateral heel markers at 120 Hz. Relative asynchrony between heel strike responses and metronome pulses was used to index compensation for metronome phase shifts. Participants demonstrated compensation for phase shifts with convergence back to pre-phase shift asynchrony. This was significantly slower when the error occurred on the nonparetic side (requiring initial correction with the paretic limb) compared with when the error occurred on the paretic side (requiring initial nonparetic correction). Although phase correction of gait is slowed when the phase shift is delivered to the nonparetic side compared with the paretic side, phase correction is still present. This may underlie the utility of rhythmic auditory cueing in hemiparetic gait rehabilitation.

The benefits and challenges of multiple health behavior change in research and in practice. The major chronic diseases are caused by multiple risks, yet the science of multiple health behavior change (MHBC) is at an early stage, and factors that facilitate or impede scientists' involvement in MHBC research are unknown. Benefits and challenges of MHBC interventions were investigated to strengthen researchers' commitment and prepare them for challenges. An online anonymous survey was e-mailed to listservs of the Society of Behavioral Medicine between May 2006 and 2007. Respondents (N=69) were 83% female; 94% held a doctoral degree; 64% were psychologists, 24% were in public health; and 83% targeted MHBC in their work. A sample majority rated 23 of the 24 benefits, but only 1 of 31 challenge items, as very to extremely important. Those engaged in MHBC rated the total benefits significantly higher than respondents focused on single behaviors, F(1,69)=4.21, p<.05, and rated the benefits significantly higher than the challenges: paired t(57)=7.50, p<.001. The two groups did not differ in ratings of challenges. It appears that individuals focused solely on single behaviors do not fully appreciate the benefits that impress MHBC researchers; it is not that substantial barriers are holding them back. Benefits of MHBC interventions need emphasizing more broadly to advance this research area.

Short-term outcome of very-low-birthweight infants with arterial hypotension in the first 24 h of life. To evaluate lowest mean arterial blood pressure during the first 24 h of life (minMAP(24)) in very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants and to identify associations between hypotension and short-term outcome. Retrospective cohort analysis of the minMAP(24) of 4907 VLBW infants with a gestational age <32 weeks in correlation with clinical data. Hypotension was defined as minMAP(24) being lower than the median value of all patients of the same gestational age. MinMAP(24) values correlated with gestational age. Median minMAP(24) values of VLBW infants ≤29 weeks' gestation were 1-2 mm Hg lower than gestational age in completed weeks. Hypotensive infants had a higher rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH, 20.3% vs 15.9%, p<0.001), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 19.2% vs 15.1%, p<0.001) and death (5.2% vs 3.0%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses, including potential confounders, confirmed these data. MinMAP(24) was an independent risk factor for IVH (OR 0.97/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, p=0.003), BPD (OR 0.96/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p<0.001) and mortality (OR 0.94/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, p=0.003). Hypotension during the first 24 h of life is associated with adverse outcomes in VLBW infants. This underlines the need for randomised controlled trials on the use of vasoactive drugs in this vulnerable patient cohort.

The learning curve of pedicle screw placement: how many screws are enough? A retrospective study. Assess the learning curve of pedicle screw (PS) placement of a Spinal Surgery Fellow (SSF) with no previous experience with the technique. Recent studies have attempted to identify the learning curve for different surgical procedures to define training requirements. Several authors have described a learning curve for PS placement. However, no one has defined the number of PS necessary to be competent in this skill. All patients who had PS inserted by the SSF under the supervision of an Attending Spinal Consultant (ASC) and had adequate postoperative radiographs and computed tomography scans available, were included in this study. PS position was assessed by 2 blinded independent observers using a grading scale. PS placement by the SSF was evaluated by examining the assessed position in chronological groups of 40 screws. RESULTS.: Ninety-four patients underwent internal fixation of the spine with 582 PS. Eight cases (40 screws) were excluded because of lack of imaging studies. Of the 542 screws under evaluation, 320 (59%) were performed by the SSF, 187 (34.5%) by the ASC, and 35 (6.5%) by advanced orthopedic or neurosurgical trainees.The rate of misplaced PS performed by the SSF for the first 80 PS was 12.5% and dropped to 3.4% for the remaining 240 screws, which is a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01). Evaluation of computed tomography of vertebrae with PS placed by the SSF on one side and by the ASC on the other showed that the ASC achieved better placement during the first 80 PS (P < 0.01). However, this difference disappeared in the last 240 (P = 1.00). The findings demonstrate a learning curve for PS placement. In this series, the asymptote for this technique for an inexperienced SSF, started after about 80 screws (approximately 25 cases).

[Acute thyroiditis and cervical abscesses as manifestations of the pyriform sinus fistulae]. Pyriform sinus fistula is a rare malformation causing recurrent cervical abscesses and acute suppurative thyroiditis, with a low incidence in general, as the thyroid gland is remarkably resistant to infections. The aim of this paper is to describe the clinical data, diagnosis, treatment and evolution of four cases of pyriform sinus fistulas treated at our institution over the last 15-year period. All appeared at the beginning with left laterocervical inflammatory tumours, with radiological signs of acute suppurative thyroiditis in one case and with heterogeneous masses near the isthmus of the thyroid gland in the rest of them. The fistulous tracts were delineated by barium studies and/or fibro-laryngoscopy. The treatment of the acute phase consisted of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with an initial incision and drainage procedures. At the end, a subsequent fistulectomy was made. A left hemithyroidectomy was accomplished at two cases. All the patients remained asymptomatic after the treatment except one girl that suffered recurrence seven years later. For a suitable diagnosis a high index of suspicion are necessary. The best therapeutic option is a good delineation and complete excision of the fistulous tract by cervical approach until disconnecting it of its origin at the hypopharynx. In order to avoid recurrences, the resection of the portion of the involved thyroid gland is recommended.

Use of and attitudes and knowledge about pap smears among women in Kuwait. To estimate the lifetime prevalence of Pap smear among women in Kuwait and to assess their knowledge about and attitude toward Pap smears. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using a multistage cluster sampling method. We interviewed 299 women attending polyclinics in Kuwait using a self-administered questionnaire. Factors related to history of having a Pap smear, knowledge level, and willingness to participate in a screening program were evaluated. The lifetime prevalence of Pap smear was found to be 37% (95% CI 33-43). Forty-four percent of women in our study had a Pap smear only once in their lives. History of having at least one Pap smear was significantly related to such factors as age, total family income, marital status, history of cervical infection, and knowledge. The level of knowledge about cervical cancer varied among the participants. Forty-six percent of women were uncertain about the symptoms of cervical cancer. About half the women recognized cervical infection, smoking, and having multiple sexual partners as risk factors for cervical cancer; however, only 10% recognized early sexual intercourse as a risk factor. Willingness to participate in a future screening program varied significantly according to educational level, employment status, and total family income. Although cervical cancer incidence and mortality are relatively low in Kuwait, they may be underreported in the absence of a screening program. Moreover, lifetime prevalence of having a Pap smear was found to be considerably lower in Kuwait compared with developed countries.

Antiepileptics in brain metastases: safety, efficacy and impact on life expectancy. The aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy, safety and impact on life expectancy of levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC) and topiramate (TPM) monotherapy in patients with seizures related to brain metastases. We conducted a prospective observational study on 70 patients with brain metastases. Thirteen patients were excluded because they were in prophylactic therapy with antiepileptics, nine patients did not return to our Center. A total of 48 patients with epilepsy related to brain metastases were enrolled. Patients were treated with LEV, OXC and TPM in monotherapy and followed until their death. Eighteen patients dropped out. Therefore, we followed 30 patients. Mean duration of follow-up was 6.1 months. Upon visiting the patients prior to their death (i.e. last visit preceding the death of the patients), we observed a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the mean monthly seizure frequency; with 19 patients (63.3%) obtaining complete seizure control in the whole population. A significant improvement of seizure frequency was also observed considering each antiepileptic treatment group separately. Median survival time was similar among the three groups of patients and was similar to Class I of prognostic factors of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Logistic regression showed that systemic treatments did not influence the antiepileptics' efficacy on seizure control (P = 0.614). In conclusion, regarding the use of newer antiepileptics in patients with seizures related to brain metastases, our data indicate that LEV, OXC and TPM significantly reduce seizure frequency (independently of systemic treatment), produce few side effects and appear not to affect life expectancy.

Physical benefits of dancing for healthy older adults: a review. Dancing is a mode of physical activity that may allow older adults to improve their physical function, health, and well-being. However, no reviews on the physical benefits of dancing for healthy older adults have been published in the scientific literature. Using relevant databases and keywords, 15 training and 3 cross-sectional studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Grade B-level evidence indicated that older adults can significantly improve their aerobic power, lower body muscle endurance, strength and flexibility, balance, agility, and gait through dancing. Grade C evidence suggested that dancing might improve older adults' lower body bone-mineral content and muscle power, as well as reduce the prevalence of falls and cardiovascular health risks. Further research is, however, needed to determine the efficacy of different forms of dance, the relative effectiveness of these forms of dance compared with other exercise modes, and how best to engage older adults in dance participation.

Common pathogenic features of atherosclerosis and calcific aortic stenosis: role of transforming growth factor-beta. Calcific aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis have been investigated separately in experimental in vitro and in vivo studies and in clinical studies. The similarities identified in both diseases suggest that similar pathogenic pathways are involved in both conditions. Most current therapeutic studies are focused on statins. The evidence suggests that statin effects on valves may, in large part, be independent of the lipid lowering effects of the drug. There are several molecules that play significant regulatory roles on the development and progression of valve sclerosis and calcification and on growth and complications of atherosclerotic plaques. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathogenic features of the two conditions, highlight the important similarities, and then review the data that suggest that transforming growth factor-beta may play a key regulatory role in both diseases and that this is worthy of study as a potential therapeutic target for both conditions.

Figurational dynamics and parliamentary discourses of living standards in Ireland. While the concept of living standards remains central to political debate, it has become marginal in sociological research compared to the burgeoning attention given to the topic of consumer culture in recent decades. However, they both concern how one does and should consume, and, indeed, behave at particular times. I use the theories of Norbert Elias to explain the unplanned but structured (ordered) changes in expected standards of living over time. This figurational approach is compared to other alternative explanations, particularly those advanced by Bourdieu, Veblen and Baudrillard. Though these offer some parallels with Elias's theories, I argue that consumption standards are produced and transformed through the changing dependencies and power relations between social classes. They cannot be reduced to the intentions, interests or ambitions of particular elites, nor to the needs of social systems. Using qualitative data from parliamentary debates in Ireland to trace changing norms and ideals of consumption, as well as historical data to reconstruct shifts in social interdependencies, I further contend that discourses of living standards and luxury are vital aspects of the growing identification and empathy between classes, which in turn encourages greater global integration in the face of emigration and national decline.

The circumorbital bones of the Gekkota (Reptilia: Squamata). The enormous variation of the orbit in lepidosaurs is better conceptualized in terms of composition and configuration. Broadly, the orbit varies from having totally closed rim to being open posteriorly. Two processes are responsible for changes in the components of the circumorbital series, element loss and fusion. The resulting contacts among elements are the main factors determining orbital configuration. Here, we present a revision of the gekkotan circumorbital bones in the general context of the Lepidosauria. From observations of a sample of 105 species of gekkotans prepared using different techniques, we describe the main changes in the orbit and corroborate the presence or absence of some of the ambiguous elements such as the lacrimal and the jugal. The supraorbital bones of squamates are reviewed and some problems of homology are evaluated using recent phylogenenetic hypothesis.

Discovery of novel serum biomarkers for prenatal Down syndrome screening by integrative data mining. To facilitate the experimental search for novel maternal serum biomarkers in prenatal Down Syndrome screening, we aimed to create a set of candidate biomarkers using a data mining approach. Because current screening markers are derived from either fetal liver or placental trophoblasts, we reasoned that new biomarkers can primarily be found to be derived from these two tissues. By applying a three-stage filtering strategy on publicly available data from different sources, we identified 49 potential blood-detectable protein biomarkers. Our set contains three biomarkers that are currently widely used in either first- or second-trimester screening (AFP, PAPP-A and fbeta-hCG), as well as ten other proteins that are or have been examined as prenatal serum markers. This supports the effectiveness of our strategy and indicates the set contains other markers potentially applicable for screening. We anticipate the set will help support further experimental studies for the identification of new Down Syndrome screening markers in maternal blood.


Pediatric patients hospitalized with myocarditis: a multi-institutional analysis.

Loss of PDZK1 causes coronary artery occlusion and myocardial infarction in Paigen diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficient mice. PDZK1 is a four PDZ-domain containing protein that binds to the carboxy terminus of the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and regulates its expression, localization and function in a tissue-specific manner. PDZK1 knockout (KO) mice are characterized by a marked reduction of SR-BI protein expression ( approximately 95%) in the liver (lesser or no reduction in other organs) with a concomitant 1.7 fold increase in plasma cholesterol. PDZK1 has been shown to be atheroprotective using the high fat/high cholesterol ('Western') diet-fed murine apolipoprotein E (apoE) KO model of atherosclerosis, presumably because of its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport via SR-BI. Here, we have examined the effects of PDZK1 deficiency in apoE KO mice fed with the atherogenic 'Paigen' diet for three months. Relative to apoE KO, PDZK1/apoE double KO (dKO) mice showed increased plasma lipids (33% increase in total cholesterol; 49 % increase in unesterified cholesterol; and 36% increase in phospholipids) and a 26% increase in aortic root lesions. Compared to apoE KO, dKO mice exhibited substantial occlusive coronary artery disease: 375% increase in severe occlusions. Myocardial infarctions, not observed in apoE KO mice (although occasional minimal fibrosis was noted), were seen in 7 of 8 dKO mice, resulting in 12 times greater area of fibrosis in dKO cardiac muscle. These results show that Paigen-diet fed PDZK1/apoE dKO mice represent a new animal model useful for studying coronary heart disease and suggest that PDZK1 may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.

Cost analysis of sirolimus-eluting stents in the Japanese health insurance system. The cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) has been evaluated in the United States and Europe, however, there is little information from Japan. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in Japan. In-hospital and follow-up costs of 25 consecutive patients undergoing SES implantation in a de novo lesion were evaluated. A control group for comparison was composed of 25 consecutive patients undergoing bare metal stent (BMS) implantation in a de novo lesion before the introduction of SES. There was no significant difference in resource use between the SES and BMS groups. Procedural cost (yen1,049,200 +/- 208,793 versus yen896,590 +/- 117,984, P = 0.01) was higher in the SES group than in the BMS group because of the higher reimbursement price of SES (yen378,000 versus yen258,000). In-hospital cost (yen1,202,891 +/- 208,793 versus yen1,050,280 +/- 177,984, P < 0.01) was higher in patients treated with SES. Less target lesion revascularization (4% versus 20%, P = 0.2) in patients with SES reduced the difference; aggregate 1-year cost was not significantly different (yen1,479,481 +/- 284,343 versus yen1,463,640 +/- 495,803, P = 0.9). It is concluded that SES may be cost-effective even in Japan.

Berbamine, a novel nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human myeloma cells. We sought to investigate the effect of berbamine on the growth of human multiple myeloma cell line KM3 and elucidate the mechanism of its action. MTT assay was used to determine the inhibitory effect of berbamine alone or combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. Flow cytometry was performed to characterize cell cycle profile in response to berbamine treatment. Western blot was used to measure the protein levels of p65, IkappaB Kinase alpha (IKKalpha), TNFAIP3 (A20), IkappaBalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, cyclinD1, Bcl-2, BAX, Bcl-x(L), Bid, and survivin. Berbamine inhibits the proliferation of KM3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combination of berbamine with dexamethasone (Dex), doxorubicin (Dox) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) resulted in enhanced inhibition of cell growth. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that KM3 cells were arrested at G(1) phase and apoptotic cells increased from 0.54% to 51.83% for 36 h. Morphological changes of cells undergoing apoptosis were observed under light microscope. Berbamine treatment led to increased expression of A20, down-regulation of IKKalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, and followed by inhibition of p65 nuclear localization. As a result, NF-kappaB downstream targets such as cyclinD1, Bcl-x(L), Bid and survivin were down-regulated. Berbamine inhibits the growth of KM3 cells by inducing G(1) arrest as well as apoptosis. Berbamine blocks NF-kappaB signaling pathway through up-regulating A20, down-regulating IKKalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, and then inhibiting p65 nuclear translocation, and resulting in decreased expression of the downstream targets of NF-kappaB. Our results suggest that berbamine is a novel inhibitor of NF-kappaB activity with remarkable anti-myeloma efficacy.

Trichomoniasis in pregnancy and mental retardation in children. Trichomoniasis is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted infection and is associated with premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth, and low birth weight. This study examines the association between maternal trichomoniasis and intellectual disability (ID) in children. This study utilized linked maternal, infant, and child records for 134,596 Medicaid-insured singleton births in South Carolina from 1996 through 2002. Data were obtained from Medicaid billing records, birth certificates, and administrative data from the South Carolina Department of Education (DOE) and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN). Pregnancies during which women were diagnosed with urinary tract infection, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or vulvovaginal candidiasis were excluded, as were children diagnosed with a known cause of mental retardation. Odds of diagnosed ID in children were modeled using population averaged generalized estimating equation models. Controlling for potential confounders, women with trichomoniasis were significantly more likely to have a child with ID (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.46). The association was stronger for moderate to severe ID documented by the school system or DDSN (HR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35-2.51). Second-trimester trichomoniasis was associated with more than a three-fold increase in the odds a child was identified as trainable mentally handicapped or profoundly mentally handicapped in the public school system, or was receiving ID services from DDSN. There was not a significant difference in the risk of ID in children of women with treated versus untreated trichomoniasis. Maternal trichomoniasis may be a preventable risk factor for ID.


Help-seeking trajectory in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Mutations in the conserved glycine and serine of the MutS ABC signature motif affect nucleotide exchange, kinetics of sliding clamp release of mismatch and mismatch repair. The MutS protein controls genomic stability by coordinating recognition and repair of DNA mismatches with ATP utilization. The nature of this coordination is unclear. This study demonstrates the importance of a highly conserved flexible loop found in Escherichia coli MutS (residues 658-670) in DNA mismatch repair. This loop is speculated to be analogous to the ABC signature motif of drug transporters based on its proximity to the ATP catalytic site in crystal structures. Our studies show that amino acid residues G666 and S668 control MutS functions subsequent to mismatch recognition by MutS, i.e., nucleotide-mediated exchange and ATP-dependent dissociation from mismatch. G666V mutation affects mismatch-provoked ADP-ATP exchange and results in slower dissociation kinetics of MutS from the mismatch while S668A mutation affects stable clamp formation and dissociation kinetics but does not affect nucleotide exchange. Both mutants harbor defects in ATP hydrolysis and cause a significant mutator phenotype in vivo. The mutator effect of S668A is indistinguishable from that of a MutS-deficient background and is similar to that seen with G658A. Neither mutations affect protein stability or cause a dominant mutator effect. Together with our studies on G658, D661 and F670 [1], this study implicates the signature motif as a primary regulator of MutS function and suggests concerted action of the individual amino acid residues within this motif in mediating communication between the Walker and mismatch recognition domains.

[Glaucoma drainage devices]. Glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs) have a fixed place in the treatment of complicated refractory glaucoma. By implantation of an episcleral GDD, a permanent open sclerostomy is formed, through which a silicone tube is placed into the anterior chamber (or pars plana). Thus, aqueous humor is drained out of the eye under the Tenon and conjunctiva, leading the fluid to a base plate made from silicone or polypropylene. Placed near the equator of the eye, this base plate leads to the formation of a cyst that renders resistance to fluid transport, ultimately leading to a final drop in intraocular pressure. GDDs have been mainly used in complicated glaucoma cases that had previous unsatisfactory results from conventional glaucoma surgery. Recent studies suggest that the implants can also be used satisfactorily in early stages of glaucoma. Other devices are positioned and fixed in the chamber angle. Here they either drain aqueous humor into the Schlemm's canal or into the subconjunctival or subchoroidal space. This article gives an overview of the current principles, indications, methods, and possible complications of implantation.

Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields Enhance Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Dependent-Bone Regeneration. The use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) for the purpose of promoting bone regeneration is emerging; however, the high dose of rhBMP-2 required in humans is accompanied by several limitations, including bone resorption and swelling. To reduce the dose of rhBMP-2 required, the applicability of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) was evaluated using a rat calvarial defect model. After creating an 8-mm-diameter calvarial bone defect, a collagen sponge soaked in different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 μg) of rhBMP-2 was implanted at the defect area. One week after surgery, PEMF was applied for 8 h/day over 5 days in an experimental group of animals (n = 28) using a width of 12 μs, a pulse frequency of 60 Hz, and a magnetic intensity of 10 G. Animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery and assessed by microcomputed tomography and histological and immunohistochemical analyses. In the absence of application of PEMF, bone volume, bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation, all showed statistically significant differences, depending on the concentration of rhBMP-2 utilized (p < 0.001). PEMF accelerated bone regeneration in the groups that received 0, 2.5, and 5 μg rhBMP-2 (p < 0.05). In contrast, administration of 10 μg rhBMP-2 resulted in no additive effect on bone regeneration in combination with PEMF. Groups receiving no rhBMP-2 showed distinct bone regeneration in the central zone of the bone defect when treated with PEMF, whereas they failed to bridge the defect space without PEMF. Among the groups without PEMF, soft tissue infiltrations from the outer surface on the skin side were common. Among groups with PEMF, the groups receiving 5 and 10 μg rhBMP-2 displayed denser bone with significantly reduced dead spaces. The application of PEMF did not result in an accelerated effect on bone regeneration in groups treated with 10 μg rhBMP-2. Therefore, our data demonstrate that PEMF can promote bone regeneration in animals treated with a low concentration of rhBMP-2.

Prevalence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in broiler indicator bacteria. This study explored the prevalence and persistence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium from healthy broilers. In 32 broiler farms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, with one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, samples from the carcasses at the slaughterhouse were also collected. For E. coli, high levels of resistance were found for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58% of all the isolates showed resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4.8% were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tested. A remarkably high resistance rate (up to 41%) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and the combination quinopristin/dalfopristin. Over 80% displayed acquired resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents, and 3.9% were fully susceptible for the eight agents tested. Resistance was found to persist over consecutive production rounds. There was a good correlation between results obtained with cloacal samples of the live animals and caecal content samples collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli and E. faecium. For E. coli but not for E. faecium, the resistance profile of neck skin isolates was different from that of cloacal isolates.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of three treatments for age-related macular degeneration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab injections compared with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The analyses were performed using outcomes data from the pivotal trials for each treatment and the medicare reimbursable costs for each treatment and associated medical procedures. A multistate transition model with 3-month cycles was created to compare incremental medical costs associated with pegaptanib or ranibizumab versus PDT for patients with starting vision of 20/40, 20/80, and 20/200 Snellen equivalent. Two-year medical treatment costs ranged from $3,100 to $54,100 depending on treatment and lesion type. Photodynamic therapy was less costly and more effective than pegaptanib for predominantly classic and minimally classic lesions. Ranibizumab was not only more effective but also more costly than PDT for all lesion types. Compared with PDT, pegaptanib is inferior in both cost and effectiveness, whereas ranibizumab has a greater effectiveness. Because ranibizumab does not meet 1 of the common thresholds for being considered cost effective (<$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year), there is rationale to seek other therapies that are more cost effective.

Risk factors for NSF: a literature review. Emerging evidence linking gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has changed medical practice patterns toward forgoing GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or substituting other imaging methods, which are potentially less accurate and often radiation-based. This shift has been based on reports of high NSF incidence at sites where a confluence of risk factors occurred in patients with severe renal dysfunction. This review article explores the factors that affect NSF risk, compares risks of alternative imaging procedures, and demonstrates how risk can be managed by careful selection of GBCA dose, timing of injection with respect to dialysis, and other factors. Nearly half of NSF cases are a milder form that does not cause contractures or reduce mobility. It appears that eliminating even a single risk factor can reduce NSF incidence/risk at least 10-fold. Elimination of multiple risk factors by using single-dose GBCA, dialyzing dialysis patients quickly following GBCA administration, avoiding GBCA in acute renal failure while serum creatinine is rising, and avoiding nonionic linear GBCA in renal failure patients may reduce NSF risk more than a thousand-fold, thereby allowing safe GBCA-enhanced MRI in virtually all patients.

Effect of everolimus on cell viability in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas can cause specific syndromes due to hormone excess and/or determine sellar mass symptoms. Pituitary cell growth can sometimes be influenced by medical therapy, such as for somatotroph adenomas treated with somatostatin analogs or prolactinomas treated with dopaminergic drugs. However, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are still orphans of medical therapy. Everolimus (RAD001), a derivative of rapamycin, is a well-known immunosuppressant drug, which has been recently shown to have antineoplastic activity in several human cancers. The objective of the study was to investigate the possible antiproliferative effects of RAD001 in human NFAs. We collected 40 NFAs that were dispersed in primary cultures, treated without or with 1 nm to 1 microm RAD001, 10 nm cabergoline, 10 nm SOM230 (a somatostatin receptor multiligand), and/or 50 nm IGF-I. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated after 48 h, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion was assessed after an 8-h incubation. Somatostatin and dopamine subtype 2 receptor expression was investigated by quantitative PCR. In 28 cultures (70%), Everolimus significantly reduced cell viability (by approximately 40%; P < 0.05 vs. control), promoted apoptosis (+30%; P < 0.05 vs. control), inhibited p70S6K activity (-20%), and blocked IGF-I proliferative and antiapoptotic effects. In selected tissues cotreatment with SOM230, but not cabergoline, exerted an additive effect. Everolimus did not affect VEGF secretion but blocked the stimulatory effects of IGF-I on this parameter. Everolimus reduced NFA cell viability by inducing apoptosis, with a mechanism likely involving IGF-I signaling but not VEGF secretion, suggesting that it might represent a possible medical treatment of invasive/recurrent NFAs.

Use of bioabsorbable plates for cranial fixation. LactoSorb fixation plates are made of a bioabsorbable polymer (82% poly-L-lactic acid and 18% polyglycolic acid), and the strength is not inferior to titanium plates. LactoSorb has been used in the fields of pediatric neurosurgery and facial plastic surgery. Cranial fixation in craniotomy is mostly performed using titanium plates and clamps, but there are issues with esthetics and artifacts on postoperative radiographic images. Absorbable plates solve these problems, but are slightly thicker and more expensive. Here, we describe a technique to solve these disadvantages by inserting absorbable plates into the diploe. The present method was employed in 46 patients, and esthetically favorable results were obtained without intraoperative and postoperative complications. Absorbable plates may replace titanium plates as the main device for cranial fixation. The present method is particularly useful for cranial fixation in adults with a thin scalp.

Neural mechanisms of acquired phasic dopamine responses in learning. What biological mechanisms underlie the reward-predictive firing properties of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and how do they relate to the complex constellation of empirical findings understood as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning? We previously presented PVLV, a biologically inspired Pavlovian learning algorithm accounting for DA activity in terms of two interrelated systems: a primary value (PV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a US (reward) and; a learned value (LV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a CS. Here, we provide a more extensive review of the biological mechanisms supporting phasic DA firing and their relation to the spate of Pavlovian conditioning phenomena and their sensitivity to focal brain lesions. We further extend the model by incorporating a new NV (novelty value) component reflecting the ability of novel stimuli to trigger phasic DA firing, providing "novelty bonuses" which encourages exploratory working memory updating and in turn speeds learning in trace conditioning and other working memory-dependent paradigms. The evolving PVLV model builds upon insights developed in many earlier computational models, especially reinforcement learning models based on the ideas of Sutton and Barto, biological models, and the psychological model developed by Savastano and Miller. The PVLV framework synthesizes these various approaches, overcoming important shortcomings of each by providing a coherent and specific mapping to much of the relevant empirical data at both the micro- and macro-levels, and examines their relevance for higher order cognitive functions.

Mechanisms of CDDO-imidazolide-mediated cytoprotection against acrolein-induced neurocytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and primary human astrocytes. Acrolein is a ubiquitous unsaturated aldehyde has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. However, limited study has been conducted into potential therapeutic protection and underlying mechanism against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity via upregulation of cellular aldehyde-detoxification defenses. In this study we have utilized RA-differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells and primary human astrocytes to investigate the induction of glutathione (GSH) by the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dixooleana-1,9-dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) and the protective effects CDDO-Im-mediated antioxidant defenses on acrolein toxicity. Acrolein exposure to RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a significant time dependent depletion of cellular GSH preceding a reduction in cell viability and LDH release. Further, we demonstrated the predominance of cellular GSH in protection against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) at 25μM dramatically depleted GSH and significantly potentiated acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the cells with 100nM CDDO-Im afforded a dramatic protection against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of BSO and CDDO was found to prevent the CDDO-Im-mediated GSH induction and partially reversed the cytoprotective effects of CDDO-Im against acrolein cytotoxicity. Overall, this study represents for the first time the CDDO-Im mediated upregulation of GSH is a predominant mechanism against acrolein-induced neurotoxicity.

Recurrent ischemic stroke in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Recurrent cerebral infarctions developed in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). At the time of the first stroke, there were large thrombi in the right proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) and an occlusion of the right terminal ICA. The occlusion was recanalized by intra-arterial infusion of urokinase. After 20 months, he suffered another ischemic attack. The autoantibodies in ITP directed against antigens presented on both platelets and endothelial cells might induce the endothelial damage, thrombus formation, and embolic occlusion of the artery.

Association of whirlin with Cav1.3 (alpha1D) channels in photoreceptors, defining a novel member of the usher protein network. Usher syndrome is the most common form of hereditary deaf-blindness. It is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The USH2D protein whirlin interacts via its PDZ domains with other Usher-associated proteins containing a C-terminal type I PDZ-binding motif. These proteins co-localize with whirlin at the region of the connecting cilium and at the synapse of photoreceptor cells. This study was undertaken to identify novel, Usher syndrome-associated, interacting partners of whirlin and thereby obtain more insights into the function of whirlin. The database of ciliary proteins was searched for proteins that are present in both the retina and inner ear and contain a PDZ-binding motif. Interactions with whirlin were evaluated by yeast two-hybrid analyses and validated by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization in the retina with immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The L-type calcium channel subunit Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) specifically interacts with whirlin. In adult photoreceptors, Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) and whirlin co-localize in the region of the connecting cilium and at the synapse. During murine embryonic development, the expression patterns of the Whrn and Cacna1d genes show significant overlap and include expression in the eye, the inner ear, and the central nervous system. The findings indicate that Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) is connected to the Usher protein network. This conclusion leads to the hypothesis that, in the retina, whirlin scaffolds Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) and therefore contributes to the organization of calcium channels in the photoreceptor cells, where both proteins may be involved in membrane fusions.


What automated vocal analysis reveals about the vocal production and language learning environment of young children with autism.

Limb malformations with associated congenital constriction rings in two unrelated Egyptian males, one with a disorganization-like spectrum and the other with a probable distinct type of septo-optic dysplasia. In this report, we describe two unrelated Egyptian male infants with limb malformations and constriction rings. The first case is developing normally but has severe limb anomalies, congenital constriction rings, scoliosis because of vertebral anomalies, a left accessory nipple, a small tumor-like swelling on his lower back with tiny skin tubular appendages, a hypoplastic scrotum, and an anchored penis. The second case is developmentally delayed with limb malformations, congenital constriction rings, a lumbar myelomeningeocele, hemangioma, and tiny tubular skin appendages on the back. The patient also had bilateral optic atrophy. The constellation of features in our patients cannot be fully explained by the amniotic disruption complex. The first patient may represent an additional case of the human homolog of the mouse disorganization mutant. The presence of bilateral optic atrophy in the second case, although without an absent septum pellucidum nor other brain anomalies resembles the infrequently reported disorder of septo-optic dysplasia with limb anomalies. Both cases were sporadic and could be caused by a new dominant mutation because of the high paternal age of case 1 and the history of paternal occupational exposure to heat for both fathers. We draw attention to the phenotypic overlap between the disorganization-like syndrome and septo-optic dysplasia with limb anomalies.

Potential medical adverse events associated with death: a forensic pathology perspective. To determine the incidence of potential medical adverse events among patients undergoing forensic autopsy, and to present the characteristics of potential medical adverse events. Retrospective review of consecutive autopsy records. Department of Forensic Medicine, the Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. A total of 3355 forensic autopsy cases between 1983 and 2006. Incidence of potential medical adverse events identified in decedents undergoing forensic autopsy, classified by actual occurrence as 'confirmed', 'equivocal' and 'negative' cases; proportion of potential diagnostic, performance and system errors among potential medical adverse events. Of 291 autopsies (8.7%) with potential medical adverse events, 66 cases (22.7%) were confirmed, 42 cases (14.4%) were negative and 183 cases (62.9%) were equivocal. Confirmed cases consisted of potential diagnostic errors in 49 cases (74.2%) and performance errors in 17 cases (25.8%). Equivocal cases included 99 cases associated with potential diagnostic errors (54.1%) and 60 cases associated with potential system errors (32.8%). In 38 of the confirmed cases (57.5%), serious exacerbation of patient condition occurred outside the medical facility. Potential medical adverse events are not uncommon in decedents undergoing forensic autopsy. They are particularly associated with potential diagnostic errors. Forensic autopsy may provide information that could be used to improve care and reduce deaths due to potential medical adverse events.

Cultural differences in ant-dipping tool length between neighbouring chimpanzee communities at Kalinzu, Uganda. Cultural variation has been identified in a growing number of animal species ranging from primates to cetaceans. The principal method used to establish the presence of culture in wild populations is the method of exclusion. This method is problematic, since it cannot rule out the influence of genetics and ecology in geographically distant populations. A new approach to the study of culture compares neighbouring groups belonging to the same population. We applied this new approach by comparing ant-dipping tool length between two neighbouring communities of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Kalinzu Forest, Uganda. Ant-dipping tool length varies across chimpanzee study sites in relation to army ant species (Dorylus spp.) and dipping location (nest vs. trail). We compared the availability of army ant species and dipping tool length between the two communities. M-group tools were significantly longer than S-group tools, despite identical army ant target species availabilities. Moreover, tool length in S-group was shorter than at all other sites where chimpanzees prey on epigaeic ants at nests. Considering the lack of ecological differences between the two communities, the tool length difference appears to be cultural. Our findings highlight how cultural knowledge can generate small-scale cultural diversification in neighbouring chimpanzee communities.

Comparative analysis of muscle architecture in primate arm and forearm. A comparative study of myological morphology, i.e. muscle mass (MM), muscle fascicle length and muscle physiological cross-sectional area (an indicator of the force capacity of muscles), was conducted in nine primate species: human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gibbon (Hylobates spp.), papio (Papio hamadryas), lutong (Trachypithecus francoisi), green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), macaque monkey (Macaca spp.), capuchin monkey (Cebus albifrons) and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The MM distributions and the percentages in terms of functional categories were calculated as the ratios of the muscle masses. Moreover, individual normalized data were compared directly amongst species, independent of size differences. The results show that the different ratios of forearm-rotation muscles between chimpanzee and gibbons may be related to the differences in their main positional behaviour, i.e. knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and brachiation in gibbons, and the different frequencies of arm-raising locomotion between these two species. Moreover, monkeys have larger normalized MM values for the elbow extensor muscles than apes, which may be attributed to the fact that almost all monkeys engage in quadrupedal locomotion. The characteristics of the muscle internal parameters of ape and human are discussed in comparison with those of monkey.


Facial animation in children with Moebius and Moebius-like syndromes.

Trichomonas vaginalis is highly prevalent in adolescent girls, pregnant women, and commercial sex workers in Ndola, Zambia. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of Trichomonas sp. infection among adolescent girls, pregnant women, and commercial sex workers in Ndola, Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 460 girls attending school, 307 pregnant women, and 197 commercial sex workers. Self-collected specimens from the vagina, rectum, and mouth were tested by polymerase chain amplification assays for the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis, Pentatrichomonas hominis, and Trichomonas tenax. Genotyping was performed on specimens that tested positive for T. vaginalis. The prevalence of vaginal infection with T. vaginalis was 24.6% among the adolescents, 32.2% among the pregnant women, and 33.2% among the commercial sex workers. Trichomonads other than T. vaginalis were rarely found in the vagina, rectum, and mouth. The presence of T. vaginalis in the rectum was associated with T. vaginalis in the vagina. T. tenax was also detected in the vagina. A total of 9 actin genotypes of T. vaginalis were identified. The distribution of the actin genotypes of T. vaginalis was similar in the 3 study groups. We detected high prevalence rates of trichomoniasis among women in Ndola, Zambia. Prevalence among adolescent girls was lower than among pregnant women and commercial sex workers but was still high. We were not able to detect differences in T. vaginalis actin genotypes among the 3 study groups.

The sesquiterpene lactone eupatolide sensitizes breast cancer cells to TRAIL through down-regulation of c-FLIP expression. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising candidate for cancer therapeutics due to its ability to induce apoptosis selectively in cancer cells. However, sensitivity of cancer cells for induction of apoptosis by TRAIL varies considerably. Therefore, it is important to develop agents that overcome this resistance. We show, for the first time, that eupatolide, the sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the medicinal plant Inula britannica, sensitizes human breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic concentrations of eupatolide enhanced the TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, whereas each reagent alone slightly induced cell death. The combination induced sub-G1 phase DNA content and annexin V-staining in MCF-7 cells, which are major features of apoptosis. Apoptotic characteristics induced by the combined treatment were significantly inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor. The sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-8 and was concomitant with Bid and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Treatment of eupatolide alone significantly down-regulated the expression of cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, enforced expression of c-FLIP significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by this combination in MCF-7 cells, suggesting a key role for c-FLIP down-regulation in these events. We also observed that euaptolide inhibited AKT phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Akt by LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, down-regulated c-FLIP expression in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that eupatolide could augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by down-regulating c-FLIP expression through the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and be a valuable compound to overcome TRAIL resistance in breast cancer cells.

[Lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative protection enzymes in patients with aplastic anemia]. Aplastic anaemia (AA) in connection with liver damage is characterized by severe course of the disease, significant shift of the myelogram, considerable changes of blood picture, high lethality, taking in this pathological process various organs and digestion systems. Results of ultrasonic and biochemical researches show presence of deep changes in the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. The disbalance of lipid peroxidation and antioxidative protection system have been observed in these patients. It is revealed by decrease in the activity of enzymes of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, in increase in capacity of intermediate and end products of POL. It is especially expressed in combination of AA with liver damage. That's why it is necessary to provide a constant control of these organs.

[Indications and clinical outcomes of half-ICSI in 99 cases]. To determine an optimal insemination technique for patients suspected of high risk of fertilization failure and undergoing assisted reproduction treatment. Ninety-nine couples were treated by conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in one cycle (half-ICSI) by dividing the sibling oocytes in halves. The clinical and laboratory data were analyzed, and the rates of fertilization, cleavage, good embryos and clinical pregnancy were compared between different fertilization methods. In the half-ICSI group, the fertilization rate of ICSI (80.5%) was significantly higher than that of IVF (42.9%) (P < 0.01), and so were the rates of complete fertilization failure (21.2%) and low fertilization (16.2%) of IVF than those of ICSI (0 and 3.0%). No significant differences were observed in the rates of cleavage and good-quality embryos between the two groups (P > 0.05). ICSI can help to avoid complete fertilization failure, achieve more high quality embryos for transfer and improve the rate of pregnancy for patients with high risk of fertilization failure.

Clinical characteristics of radiation oncology in Korea during past 10 years. To understand trends in the clinical characteristics of radiation oncology over the last 10 yr in Korea, annual survey questionnaires were sent to all of Korean radiation oncology facilities since 1990. Questionnaires addressed basic radiation therapy facilities and the clinical information. Responses were obtained from all facilities, and data collected from 1997 to 2006 was analyzed. The numbers of new patients that have undergone radiation therapy and the numbers of hospitals with a department of radiation oncology have steadily increased over the past 10 yr, and totaled 37,215 patients and 60 hospitals, respectively, in 2006. However, the proportion of patients irradiated among total cancer patients has remained below 30% over the last 10 yr. The numbers of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hepatoma have increased by more than 3 fold over the past 10 yr. Moreover, the percentage of irradiated patients treated by brachytherapy was 10.3% in 1997, but this gradually fell to only 4.2% in 2006. The information collected described the role played by radiation oncology in Korea. Continuous surveys are required to enable trends to be detected.

Marfan syndrome. To provide an overview of Marfan syndrome (MFS), including diagnostic criteria, genetic factors involved, emerging theories for treatment, a case study, and an overview of genetic counseling for individuals and families of those with MFS. Selected research, review, and clinical articles. MFS is a connective tissue disorder with distinct physical characteristics. Recent advances in the field of genetics have traced this disease process to certain gene mutations. Affecting the optical, skeletal and cardiovascular systems, MFS can cause significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Close surveillance and early treatment are necessary to ensure a normal life span. It is important for the advanced practice nurse (APN) to be aware of the complications in those with MFS. Attentive surveillance can decrease mortality and morbidity associated with this syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach, utilizing the expertize of the APN, is necessary for comprehensive care.

No evidence for functional selectivity of proxyfan at the human histamine H3 receptor coupled to defined Gi/Go protein heterotrimers. Numerous structurally diverse ligands were developed to target the human histamine H(3) receptor (hH(3)R), a presynaptic G(i)/G(o)-coupled auto- and heteroreceptor. Proxyfan was identified to be functionally selective, with different efficacies toward G(i)/G(o)-dependent hH(3)R signaling pathways. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of functional selectivity of proxyfan is still unclear. In the current study, we investigated the role of different Galpha(i/o) proteins in hH(3)R signaling, using a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. We tested the hypothesis that ligand-specific coupling differences to defined G(i)/G(o)-heterotrimers are responsible for functional selectivity of proxyfan at hH(3)R. In Sf9 membranes, full-length hH(3)R (445 amino acids) was expressed in combination with an excess of different mammalian G proteins (Galpha(i1), Galpha(i2), Galpha(i3), or Galpha(o1) and beta(1)gamma(2) dimers, respectively). In addition, we constructed the fusion proteins hH(3)R-Galpha(i2) and hH(3)R-Galpha(o1) to ensure clearly defined receptor/G protein stoichiometries. Steady-state GTPase experiments were performed to directly measure the impact of each G protein on hH(3)R signal transduction. The hH(3)R coupled similarly to all G proteins. We also observed similar ligand-independent or constitutive activity. Proxyfan and various other imidazole-containing ligands, including full agonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists, showed very similar pharmacological profiles not influenced by the type of G protein coexpressed. Selected ligands, examined in membranes expressing the fusion proteins hH(3)R-Galpha(i2) and hH(3)R-Galpha(o1) (plus beta(1)gamma(2) dimers), yielded very similar results. Collectively, our data indicate that hH(3)R couples similarly to different Galpha(i/o)-subunits and that ligand-specific active receptor conformations, resulting in G protein-coupling preferences, do not exist for proxyfan or other imidazole compounds investigated.

Effects of defendant and victim race on perceptions of juvenile sex offenders. We investigated effects of defendant race, victim race, and juror gender on public perceptions of a juvenile sex offense. We predicted that participants, particularly men, would support registering a juvenile defendant as a sex offender more when he was Black than White and that participants, particularly women, would support registering the defendant more when the female crime victim was portrayed as White than as Black. We also expected that support for registration would be higher when the defendant and victim were different races than when they were the same race. As expected, women (but not men) recommended registration more when the victim was White than Black. Further, participants supported registration more when the defendant and the victim were different races than when they were the same race. These effects were mediated by retributive goals to punish the offender-not by utilitarian goals to protect society. Explanations and implications are discussed.

Effects of dexamethasone on the functional properties of cartilage explants during long-term culture. Intact articular cartilage tissue is used clinically in the form of osteochondral allografts and experimentally as explants in modeling the physiologic behavior of chondrocytes in their native extracellular matrix. Long-term maintenance of allograft tissue is challenging. By carefully modulating the preservation environment, it may be possible to preserve osteochondral allograft tissue over the long term while maintaining its original mechanical and biochemical properties. Controlled laboratory study. In this study, juvenile bovine, mature bovine, and canine cartilage explants were cultured in chemically defined media with or without supplementation of dexamethasone for up to 4 weeks. The mechanical properties and biochemical content of juvenile bovine explants cultured in the presence of dexamethasone were significantly enhanced after 2 weeks in culture and remained stable with sustained cell viability thereafter. In contrast, the mechanical properties and biochemical content of juvenile bovine explants cultured in the absence of the dexamethasone significantly decreased after 2 weeks of culture. The mechanical and biochemical content of mature bovine and canine explants were not significantly affected by the presence of dexamethasone and maintained initial (day 0) mechanical and biochemical properties throughout the entire culture period with or without supplementation of dexamethasone. These results suggest that juvenile and mature cartilage explants respond differently to dexamethasone. The functional properties of juvenile cartilage explants can be maintained in vitro through the addition of dexamethasone to culture media. Functional properties of mature cartilage can be preserved for at least 4 weeks in culture regardless of the presence of dexamethasone. Biochemical and biomechanical properties of osteochondral allograft tissue may be enhanced by the addition of dexamethasone to culture media. These findings may translate to longer shelf life of preserved osteochondral allograft transplantation tissue and increased clinical availability of grafts.

Effects of yoga program on quality of life and affect in early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy: a randomized controlled trial. This study compares the effects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy at a cancer centre. Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n = 44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to their radiotherapy treatment. Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60 min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy once in 10 days. Assessments included European Organization for Research in the Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life (EORTCQoL C30) functional scales and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Assessments were done at baseline and after 6 weeks of radiotherapy treatment. An intention to treat GLM repeated measures ANOVA showed significant difference across groups over time for positive affect, negative affect and emotional function and social function. There was significant improvement in positive affect (ES = 0.59, p = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 to 7.8), emotional function (ES = 0.71, p = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 to 25.33) and cognitive function (ES = 0.48, p = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 to 18.5), and decrease in negative affect (ES = 0.84, p<0.001, 95%CI -13.4 to -4.4) in the yoga group as compared to controls. There was a significant positive correlation between positive affect with role function, social function and global quality of life. There was a significant negative correlation between negative affect with physical function, role function, emotional function and social function. The results suggest a possible role for yoga to improve quality of life and affect in breast cancer outpatients.

Ambrisentan for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a review. To provide an overview of the drug profile of the orally active, selective endothelin A receptor antagonist ambrisentan, and its efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Medical literature on the use of ambrisentan in PAH was identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Additional references were identified from the reference lists of published articles and from the authors' own bibliographies. Significant improvements in exercise capacity were observed with approved dosages of ambrisentan (5 or 10 mg once daily) in the AMB-220 dose-ranging study and the pivotal ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 trials, with sustained effects up to 2 years observed in ARIES-E. Improvements in cardiopulmonary hemodynamic variables were reported in AMB-220 and ARIES-E (subset analysis). Ambrisentan had little or no effect on hepatic transporters in in vitro studies and displayed a low risk of potential drug-drug interactions, including those with other PAH therapies. Results from the VOLT post-marketing program confirmed the safety profile of ambrisentan observed in the ARIES studies, including the low incidence of liver function test abnormalities. Peripheral edema and anemia were common side effects of endothelin receptor antagonist therapies, including ambrisentan. In the recently completed AMBITION study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01178073), upfront initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil significantly reduced the risk of clinical failure (primary endpoint) by 50% compared with the pooled monotherapy groups. The long-term efficacy and safety profile of ambrisentan in patients with PAH is supported by data from a comprehensive clinical trial program and real-life, post-marketing observations.

Effect of rice variety on the physicochemical properties of the modified rice powders and their derived mucoadhesive gels. In the present study; the glutinous Niaw Sanpatong (NSP) and Niaw Koko-6 (NKK), and the non-glutinous Jasmine (JM) and Saohai (SH) were chemically modified. The difference of these rice varieties on the physicochemical characteristics of the modified rice powders and the properties of the derived gels were evaluated. X-ray diffractometer was used for crystalline structure investigation of the rice powders and gels. A parallel plate rheometer was used to measure the rheological property of the gels. It was found that the non-glutinous varieties produced gels with higher mucoadhesive properties than the glutinous rice. Rheological behavior of JM and SH gels was pseudoplastic without yield value whereas that of NSP and NKK gels was plastic with the yield values of 1077.4 ± 185.9 and 536.1 ± 45.8 millipascals-second (mPas), respectively. These different properties are considered to be due to the amylose content in different rice variety. The results suggest that the non-glutinous rice varieties with high amylose content are the most suitable for preparing gels as local delivery systems via the mucosal membrane.

Quantitative analysis of membrane potentials. The changes that occur in electrochemical gradients across biological membranes provide us with invaluable information on physiological responses, pathophysiological processes and drug actions/toxicity. This chapter aims to provide researchers with sufficient information to carry out a quantitative assessment of mitochondrial energetics at a single-cell level thereby providing output on changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) through the utilization of potentiometric fluorescent probes (TMRM, TMRE, Rhodamine 123). As these cationic probes behave in a Nernstian fashion, changes at the plasma membrane potential (Deltapsi(p)) need also to be accounted for in order to validate the responses obtained with Deltapsi(m)-sensitive fluorescent probes. To this end techniques that utilize Deltapsi(p)-sensitive anionic fluorescent probes to monitor changes in the plasma membrane potential will also be discussed. In many biological systems multiple changes occur at both a Deltapsi(m) and Deltapsi(p) level that often makes the interpretation of the cationic fluorescent responses much more difficult. This problem has driven the development of computational modelling techniques that utilize the redistribution properties of the cationic and anionic fluorescent probes within the cell to provide output on changes in Deltapsi(m) and Deltapsi(p).

Treatment of Malassezia species associated seborrheic blepharitis with fluconazole. The AIM of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of fluconazole (FungoIon) in patients with seborrheic blepharitis. Four seborrheic blepharitis patients with Malassezia spp. positive cultures on Dixon's agar were treated with fluconazole (Fungolon) (0.200) weekly for 4 weeks. The therapeutic effect of the treatment was positive in all patients--the clinical symptoms withdrew and cultures became mycologically negative. The results indicate that antifungal agents are efficient in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

Altered neuromuscular control in individuals with exercise-related leg pain. To compare neuromuscular control ofthe lower limb during gait between individuals with and without a history of exercise-related leg pain (ERLP). Fourteen females with a history of ERLP and 14 age-, height-, and weight-matched asymptomatic female controls participated in the study.Electromyographic activity, normalized to maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), from 12 lower limb muscles during walking gait was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were three-dimensional kinematics of the lower limb during gait, measurements of static foot posture (arch height and midfoot width in weight bearing and non-weight bearing), and foot mobility (difference in arch height and midfoot width from non-weight bearing to weight bearing and foot mobility magnitude). Individuals with a history of ERLP demonstrated lower peak activation (13.7% MVC, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.2%-24.3% MVC) and lower average activation of gluteus medius (2.3% MVC, 95% CI = 0.3%-4.3% MVC) when compared with controls (P G 0.05). This reduction in gluteus medius activation was moderately determined (57.1%, P = 0.01) by the duration (beta = 0.555) and severity of pain (beta = -0.516). Peak and average activation of lateral gastrocnemius were also lower than controls (20.5% MVC, 95% CI = 0.6%-40.5% MVC and 1.7% MVC, 95% CI = 0.2%-3.1% MVC, respectively) but were not explained by pain duration or severity. No differences in kinematics at the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis, or differences in static foot posture and mobility were observed between groups (P > 0.05). This study provides evidence of altered neuromuscular control of gait in females with a history of ERLP. Further work is required to discern the clinical relevance of this finding.

Successful antibiotic lock therapy in patients with refractory peritonitis. We describe two patients receiving peritoneal dialysis who experienced refractory peritonitis caused each by Gram-negative bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These patients did not respond to appropriate intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy. We assumed bacterial colonization in the intra-abdominal portion of the catheter with biofilm. Therefore, patients were treated with additional instillation of a ceftazidime-heparin lock into the catheter lumen after each exchange, as an adjunct to systemic antibiotic treatment which was successful. This study suggests that antibiotic lock therapy in the treatment of refractory peritonitis can be an effective method without catheter removal.


Acupuncture and temporomandibular disorders: a 3-month follow-up EMG study.

Sexual partnering and HIV risk among black men who have sex with men: New York City. Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected with HIV in the US. Limited event-specific data have been reported in Black MSM to help understand factors associated with increased risk of infection. Cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Study data from 503 MSM who reported > or =1 male sexual partner in the past year in New York City (NYC) were analyzed. Case-crossover analysis compared last protected and last unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). A total of 503 MSM were enrolled. Among 349 tested for HIV, 18% were positive. Black MSM (N = 117) were more likely to test HIV positive and not know their HIV-positive status than other racial/ethnic groups. Case-crossover analysis of 208 MSM found that men were more likely to engage in protected anal intercourse with a first time partner and with a partner of unknown HIV status. Although Black MSM were more likely to have Black male partners, they were not more likely to have UAI with those partners or to have a partner aged >40 years. In conclusion, HIV prevalence was high among Black MSM in NYC, as was lack of awareness of HIV-positive status. Having a sexual partner of same race/ethnicity or older age was not associated with having UAI among Black MSM.

Inferring protein function by domain context similarities in protein-protein interaction networks. Genome sequencing projects generate massive amounts of sequence data but there are still many proteins whose functions remain unknown. The availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to develop new function prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Although several existing methods combine multiple information resources, there is no study that integrates protein domain information and PPI networks to predict protein functions. The domain context similarity can be a useful index to predict protein function similarity. The prediction accuracy of our method in yeast is between 63%-67%, which outperforms the other methods in terms of ROC curves. This paper presents a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein domain composition information and PPI networks. Performance evaluations show that this method outperforms existing methods.

Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus in Great Britain and The Netherlands. In Europe, rotavirus gastroenteritis peaks in late winter or early spring suggesting a role for weather factors in transmission of the virus. In this study, multivariate regression models adapted for time-series data were used to investigate effects of temperature, humidity and rainfall on reported rotavirus infections and the infection-rate parameter, a derived measure of infection transmission that takes into account population immunity, in England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weather were investigated by introducing lagged weather terms into the model. Meta-regression was used to pool together country-specific estimates. There was a 13 per cent (95% confidence interval (CI), 11-15%) decrease in reported infections per 1 degrees C increase in temperature above a threshold of 5 degrees C and a 4 per cent (95% CI, 3-5%) decrease in the infection-rate parameter per 1 degrees C increase in temperature across the whole temperature range. The effect of temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed by up to four weeks for reported infections. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simple relationship between cold weather and rotavirus transmission in Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more complex and delayed temperature effect on disease incidence is likely to be mediated through the effects of weather on transmission.

Impairment of stimulation ability of very-preterm neonatal monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide.

Kienböck's disease and cerebral palsy case report. Pain is the main problem in patients suffering from cerebral palsy, particularly in adults. The upper limbs are affected in 25% of cases. Here, we report the case of a patient with Kienböck's disease. Clinical case and literature review. A 28-year-old man suffering from dystonic quadriplegia consulted for progressively worsening pain in the right wrist. Kienböck's disease was diagnosed and conservative treatment with botulinum toxin in the flexor carpi radialis recommended. A good result was obtained with a decrease in pain. This result was still present two years later. Although few references are made to it in literature, Kienböck's disease in cerebral palsy is probably underestimated. Maintenance of the wrist in a permanent flexed position and muscular hypertonia may be risk factors. Knowledge of this particular clinical picture will enable it to be detected promptly and thus enable conservative treatment to be organised with a maximum chance of therapeutic success, preventing the need for surgery.

[Effects of mutation in dopachrome tautomerase on melanosome maturation and anti-oxidative potential in cultured melanocytes]. To investigate whether the mutation in dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) affects melanosome maturation and anti-oxidative potential in cultured melanocytes (MCs). Slaty and melan-a MCs were derived from the skins of neonatal Dct(Slt) and C57 BL/6J mice respectively. Their detailed melanosome structures were examined with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and their eumelanin granules characterized by Fontana-Masson staining. Furthermore, the tyrosinase activity and three melanogenic proteins, i. e., tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and Dct, were also measured with a spectrophotometry method or Western blot assay. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was monitored by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) labeling. Mature stage IV melanosomes markedly decreased in slaty MCs under TEM. The brownish granules stained with Fontana-Masson silver method were far less in slaty MCs than in melan-a MCs. The cell pellet of slaty MCs was white in color, but the similarities between slaty and melan-a were found in tyrosinase activity and its protein expression. The relative intensity of DCF fluorescence was 8.9 +/- 0.7 for slaty melanocytes versus 8.9 +/- 2.5 for melan-a melanocytes prior to UVA irradiation, but an abrupt ROS production was merely observed in slaty MCs (18.0 +/- 0.3) other than in melan-a MCs (13.6 +/- 0.3) after UVA exposure. There was statistical difference between these two cell lines in ROS level upon UVA irradiation (P = 0.024). The mutation in Dct causes hypo-pigmented phenotype in cultured slaty MCs, inhibits melanosome maturation and decreases anti-oxidative capacity especially in the presence of UVA-induced oxidative stress.

Discovering hematopoietic mechanisms through genome-wide analysis of GATA factor chromatin occupancy. GATA factors interact with simple DNA motifs (WGATAR) to regulate critical processes, including hematopoiesis, but very few WGATAR motifs are occupied in genomes. Given the rudimentary knowledge of mechanisms underlying this restriction and how GATA factors establish genetic networks, we used ChIP-seq to define GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupancy genome-wide in erythroid cells. Coupled with genetic complementation analysis and transcriptional profiling, these studies revealed a rich collection of targets containing a characteristic binding motif of greater complexity than WGATAR. GATA factors occupied loci encoding multiple components of the Scl/TAL1 complex, a master regulator of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic target. Mechanistic analyses provided evidence for crossregulatory and autoregulatory interactions among components of this complex, including GATA-2 induction of the hematopoietic corepressor ETO-2 and an ETO-2-negative autoregulatory loop. These results establish fundamental principles underlying GATA factor mechanisms in chromatin and illustrate a complex network of considerable importance for the control of hematopoiesis.

Increased micronucleus frequencies in surrogate and target cells from workers exposed to crystalline silica-containing dust. Mining, crushing, grinding, sandblasting and construction are high-risk activities with regard to crystalline silica exposure, especially in developing countries. Respirable crystalline silica (quartz and cristobalite) inhaled from occupational sources has been reclassified as a human carcinogen in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. However, the biological activity of crystalline silica has been found to be variable among different industries, and this has formed the basis for further in vivo/in vitro mechanistic research and epidemiologic studies. This study was conducted for genotoxicity evaluation in a population of workers (e.g. glass industry workers, sandblasters, and stone grinders) mainly exposed to crystalline silica in four different workplaces in Turkey. The micronucleus (MN) assay was applied both in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as a surrogate tissue and in nasal epithelial cells (NEC) as a target tissue of the respiratory tract. Our study revealed significantly higher MN frequencies in the workers (n = 50) versus the control group (n = 29) (P < 0.001) and indicated a significant effect of occupational exposure on MN induction in both of the tissues. For the NEC target tissue, the difference in MN frequencies between the workers and control group was 3-fold, whereas in peripheral tissue, it was 2-fold. Respirable dust and crystalline silica levels exceeding limit values and mineralogical/elemental dust composition of the dust of at least 70% SiO(2) were used as markers of crystalline silica exposure in each of the workplaces. Moreover, 24% of the current workers were found to have early radiographical changes (profusion category of 1). In conclusion, although the PBL are not primary target cells for respiratory particulate toxicants, an evident increase in MN frequencies in this surrogate tissue was observed, alongside with a significant increase in NEC and may be an indicator of the accumulated genetic damage associated with crystalline silica exposure.

Modeling and simulation of ion channels and action potentials in taste receptor cells.

Signatures of recent directional selection under different models of population expansion during colonization of new selective environments. A major problem in population genetics is understanding how the genomic pattern of polymorphism is shaped by natural selection and the demographic history of populations. Complex population dynamics confounds patterns of variation and poses serious challenges for identifying genomic imprints of selection. We examine patterns of polymorphism using computer simulations and provide analytical predictions for hitchhiking effects under two models of adaptive niche expansion. The population split (PS) model assumes the separation of a founding population followed by directional selection in the new environment. Here, the new population undergoes a bottleneck and later expands in size. This model has been used in previous studies to account for demographic effects when testing for signatures of selection under colonization or domestication. The genotype-dependent colonization and introgression (GDCI) model is proposed in this study and assumes that a small number of migrants carrying adaptive genotype found a new population, which then grows logistically. The GDCI model also allows for constant migration between the parental and the new population. Both models predict reduction in variation and excess of high frequency of derived alleles relative to neutral expectations, with and without hitchhiking. Under comparable conditions, the GDCI model results in greater reduction in expected heterozygosity and more skew of the site frequency spectrum than the PS model. We also find that soft selective sweeps (fixation of multiple copies of a beneficial mutation) occurs less often in the GDCI model than in the PS model. This result demonstrates the importance of correctly modeling the ecological process in inferring adaptive evolution using DNA sequence polymorphism.

gamma-Conglutin, the Lupinus albus XEGIP-like protein, whose expression is elicited by chitosan, lacks of the typical inhibitory activity against GH12 endo-glucanases. gamma-Conglutin, a glycoprotein from Lupinus albus seed, has been characterized at molecular level but its physiological function is still unknown. gamma-Conglutin shares a high structural similarity with xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase inhibitor proteins (XEGIPs) and Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI-I), which act specifically against fungal glycosyl hydrolase belonging to families 12 and 11, respectively. To assess the possible involvement of gamma-conglutin in plant defense, germinating lupin seeds were incubated with chitosan. The relative quantification of gamma-conglutin mRNA extracted from cotyledons was then carried out by RT-qPCR and indicated that chitosan strongly elicited the expression of gamma-conglutin. Moreover, biochemical trials aimed to test the inhibitory capacity of the protein have been also carried out. gamma-Conglutin failed to inhibit representative fungal endo-glucanases and other cell wall-degrading enzymes. To explain the lack of inhibitory capacity we investigated the possible structural differences between gamma-conglutin and XEGIPs and TAXI-I, including the construction of a predictive 3D model of the protein. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the lack of inhibitory activity of gamma-conglutin can be attributed to sequence differences in the inhibitor interaction domains, and in particular to a sequence deletion in one of the functional loops.

[Application of FRAX for health check-ups]. WHO's FRAX aims to identify bone-fracture high-risk individuals requiring medical intervention by calculating each individual's 10-year probability (%) of bone fracture based on clinical risk factors or clinical risk factors plus bone mineral density (BMD). The risk factors are age, sex, femoral neck mineral density, or body mass index (BMI) if BMD data are unavailable, history of bone fracture, parental history of femoral neck fracture, smoking, consumption of alcohol, use of steroids, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary osteoporosis. Model with clinical risk factors alone can predict osteoporotic fracture risk as well as the model with BMD and clinical risk factors. FRAX with clinical risk factors alone would be useful to screen those at high risk of fracture in population-based health check-ups.

FLJ23654 encodes a heart protein phosphatase 1-binding protein (Hepp1). In this report, we identified the novel protein heart protein phosphatase 1-binding protein (Hepp1), encoded by FLJ23654. Hepp1 associated with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and far Western blotting assays. Northern blot analysis revealed that Hepp1 mRNA was only expressed in human heart and testis. Recombinant Hepp1 slightly enhanced the enzymatic activity of PP1 and antagonized the ability of phospho-inhibitor-1 or inhibitor-2 to inhibit PP1. Hepp1 protein in human heart tissues was detected by Western blot analysis. Together, our data suggest that Hepp1 can play a role in cardiac functions by working in concert with PP1.

Enhanced photodegradation of pentachlorophenol by single and mixed nonionic and anionic surfactants using graphene-TiO₂ as catalyst. The photodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in a surfactant-containing (single and mixed) complex system using graphene-TiO2 (GT) as catalyst was investigated. The objective was to better understand the behavior of surfactants in a GT catalysis system for its possible use in remediation technology of soil contaminated by hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). In a single-surfactant system, surfactant molecules aggregated on GT via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic force; nonideal mixing between nonionic and anionic surfactants rendered GT surface with mixed admicelles in a mixed surfactant system. Both effects helped incorporating PCP molecules into surfactant aggregates on catalyst surface. Hence, the targeted pollutants were rendered easily available to photo-yielded oxidative radicals, and photodegradation efficiency was significantly enhanced. Finally, real soil washing-photocatalysis trials proved that anionic-nonionic mixed surfactant soil washing coupled with graphene-TiO2 photocatalysis can be one promising technology for HOC-polluted soil remediation. 

Knowledge-based design of reagentless fluorescent biosensors from a designed ankyrin repeat protein. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) can be selected from combinatorial libraries to bind any target antigen. They show high levels of recombinant expression, solubility and stability, and contain no cysteine residue. The possibility of obtaining, from any DARPin and at high yields, fluorescent conjugates which respond to the binding of the antigen by a variation of fluorescence, would have numerous applications in micro- and nano-analytical sciences. This possibility was explored with Off7, a DARPin directed against the maltose binding protein (MalE) from Escherichia coli, with known crystal structure of the complex. Eight residues of Off7, whose solvent accessible surface area varies on association with the antigen but which are not in direct contact with the antigen, were individually mutated into cysteine and then chemically coupled with a fluorophore. The conjugates were ranked according to their relative sensitivities. All of them showed an increase in their fluorescence intensity on antigen binding by >1.7-fold. The best conjugate retained the same affinity as the parental DARPin. Its signal increased linearly and specifically with the concentration of antigen, up to 15-fold in buffer and 3-fold in serum when fully saturated, the difference being mainly due to the absorption of light by serum. Its lower limit of detection was equal to 0.3 nM with a standard spectrofluorometer. Titrations with potassium iodide indicated that the fluorescence variation was due to a shielding of the fluorescent group from the solvent by the antigen. These results suggest rules for the design of reagentless fluorescent biosensors from any DARPin.

A serine cluster mediates BMAL1-dependent CLOCK phosphorylation and degradation. The circadian clock regulates biological processes from gene expression to organism behavior in a precise, sustained rhythm that is generated at the unicellular level by coordinated function of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops and post-translational modifications of core clock proteins. CLOCK phosphorylation regulates transcriptional activity, cellular localization and stability; however little is known about the specific residues and enzymes involved. We have identified a conserved cluster of serines that include, Ser431, which is a prerequisite phosphorylation site for the generation of BMAL dependent phospho-primed CLOCK and for the potential GSK-3 phosphorylation at Ser427. Mutational analysis and protein stability assays indicate that this serine cluster functions as a phospho-degron. Through the use of GSK-3 activators/inhibitors and kinase assays, we demonstrate that GSK-3beta regulates the degron site by increasing CLOCK phosphorylation/degradation, which correlates with an increase in the expression of CLOCK responsive promoters. Stabilization of phospho-deficient CLOCK delays the phase of oscillation in synchronized fibroblasts. This investigation begins the characterization of a complex phospho-regulatory site that controls the activity and degradation of CLOCK, a core transcription factor that is essential for circadian behavior.


Factors Associated with the Development of Drug Resistance Mutations in HIV-1 Infected Children Failing Protease Inhibitor-Based Antiretroviral Therapy in South Africa.

Enhanced visual fields in hammerhead sharks. Several factors that influence the evolution of the unusual head morphology of hammerhead sharks (family Sphyrnidae) are proposed but few are empirically tested. In this study we tested the 'enhanced binocular field' hypothesis (that proposes enhanced frontal binocularity) by comparison of the visual fields of three hammerhead species: the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, and the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii, with that of two carcharhinid species: the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, and the blacknose shark, Carcharhinus acronotus. Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap (48 deg.) and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids. These results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectively) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) sharks, indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the 'enhanced binocular field' hypothesis.

Idiopathic Ophthalmodynia and Idiopathic Rhinalgia: A Prospective Series of 16 New Cases. Idiopathic ophthalmodynia and idiopathic rhinalgia were described a few years ago. These conditions seem specific pain syndromes with a distinctive location in the eye or in the nose. We aimed to present a new prospective series in order to verify the consistency of these syndromes. We performed a descriptive study of all patients referred to our regional neurologic clinics from 2010 to 2014 because of facial pain exclusively felt in the eye or in the nose fulfilling the proposed diagnostic criteria for idiopathic ophthalmodynia and idiopathic rhinalgia. There were 9 patients with idiopathic ophthalmodynia and 7 patients with idiopathic rhinalgia, with a clear female preponderance, and a mean age at onset in the fifth decade. The pain was usually moderate and the temporal pattern was generally chronic. Only one patient reported accompaniments (hypersensitivity to the light and to the flow of air in the symptomatic eye). Preventive treatment with amitriptyline, pregabalin, or gabapentin was partially or totally effective. The clinical features of this new series parallels those of the original description, thus indicating that both idiopathic ophthalmodynia and idiopathic rhinalgia have clear-cut clinical pictures with excellent consistency both inter- and intra-individually.


Symptomatic hypocalcemia in primary hyperaldosteronism: a case report.

Atrial fibrillation and obesity among older Chinese: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia, and its prevalence is increasing. Few studies have examined its association with obesity as defined by different criteria, particularly in developing countries. We investigated the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and obesity indices among older Chinese. We conducted a community-based nested case control study using cross-sectional data of 5882 men and 14,548 women aged 50 or above from Phases I and II (September 2003 to May 2006) of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). AF cases were identified by the 12-lead body surface electrocardiogram. 159 AF cases (65 men and 94 women) were identified from 19,964 participants with ECG records. 9249 participants with other abnormal ECG findings were excluded, resulting in a case control comparison on 159 AF cases and 10,369 controls. After multivariate adjustment, BMI (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.06 per kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.11) and waist circumference (adjusted OR 1.02 per cm (1.00-1.04)) were significant risk factors. The adjusted OR per Z-score [(individual value-mean)/standard deviation] for BMI and waist circumference was 1.21 (1.03-1.41) and 1.18 (1.01-1.38) respectively. This is the first report showing that both general and central obesity are associated with increased risk of AF in an Eastern population with much lower level of obesity than in the West. As both AF and obesity are increasing in developing countries, the results should have important public health implications.

Laterally wedged insoles in knee osteoarthritis: do biomechanical effects decline after one month of wear? This study aimed to determine whether the effect of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction moment in knee osteoarthritis (OA) declined after one month of wear, and whether higher reported use of insoles was associated with a reduced effect on the adduction moment at one month. Twenty people with medial compartment OA underwent gait analysis in their own shoes wearing i) no insoles and; ii) insoles wedged laterally 5 degrees in random order. Testing occurred at baseline and after one month of use of the insoles. Participants recorded daily use of insoles in a log-book. Outcomes were the first and second peak external knee adduction moment and the adduction angular impulse, compared across conditions and time with repeated measures general linear models. Correlations were obtained between total insole use and change in gait parameters with used insoles at one month, and change scores were compared between high and low users of insoles using general linear models. There was a significant main effect for condition, whereby insoles significantly reduced the adduction moment (all p < 0.001). However there was no significant main effect for time, nor was an interaction effect evident. No significant associations were observed between total insole use and change in gait parameters with used insoles at one month, nor was there a difference in effectiveness of insoles between high and low users of the insoles at this time. Effects of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction moment do not appear to decline after one month of continuous use, suggesting that significant wedge degradation does not occur over the short-term.

A prospective study of sex differences in the lifetime risk of posttraumatic stress disorder among abused and neglected children grown up. In the general population, women's lifetime risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is twice that of men's. However, evidence is contradictory as to whether this sex difference is present among child abuse/neglect victims. The authors examined sex differences in PTSD among a sample of 674 individuals with documented child abuse/neglect histories assessed for PTSD in adulthood. Across all types of abuse/neglect, women were more than twice as likely to develop PTSD as men. The sex difference was greatest among sexual abuse victims. Female victims' greater revictimization explained a substantial proportion (39%) of the sex differences in PTSD risk. Future research should identify mechanisms that make female victims particularly vulnerable to revictimization and the development of PTSD.

Change of individual BMI in Switzerland and the USA: a multilevel model for growth. The aim is to analyze and compare individual body mass index (BMI) growth patterns of adults from Switzerland and the US. The analyses are based on data from two population representative longitudinal household surveys, one from Switzerland, the other from the US. Each data set contains up to four data points for each adult individual. We use multilevel models for growth. It can be shown that growth patterns are different in different cohorts in the two countries: there are only small growth differences in the youngest and oldest, but large differences in the middle ages. The individual BMI increase of the middle-aged Swiss amounts to only half of that in the comparable US individuals. Given the much higher BMI level, especially in the youngest cohort, this points to severe obesity problems in the US middle-aged population in the near future. A positive correlation between individual BMI level and growth may emphasize this fact.

Personal exposure, behavior, and work site conditions as determinants of blood lead among bridge painters. Bridge painters are exposed to lead during several job tasks performed during the workday, such as sanding, scraping, and blasting. After the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard was passed in 1993 to control lead exposures among construction workers including bridge painters, this study was conducted among 84 bridge painters in the New England area to determine the significant predictors of blood lead levels. Lead was measured in personal air and hand wipe samples that were collected during the 2-week study period and in blood samples that were collected at the beginning and at the end of the study period. The personal air and hand wipe data as well as personal behaviors (i.e., smoking, washing, wearing a respirator) and work site conditions were analyzed as potential determinants of blood lead levels using linear mixed effects models. Our results show that the mean air lead levels over the 2-week period were the most predictive exposure measure of blood lead levels. Other individual-level significant predictors of blood lead levels included months worked on bridge painting crews, education, and personal hygiene index. Of the site-level variables investigated, having a containment facility on site was a significant predictor of blood lead levels. Our results also indicate that hand wipe lead levels were significantly associated with higher blood lead levels at the end of the study period compared with the beginning of the study period. Similarly, smoking on site and respirator fit testing were significantly associated with higher blood lead levels at the end of the study period. This study shows that several individual-level and site-level factors are associated with blood lead levels among bridge painters, including lead exposure through inhalation and possible hand-to-mouth contact, personal behaviors such as smoking on site, respirator fit testing, and work site conditions such as the use of better containment facilities. Accordingly, reduction in blood lead levels among bridge painters can be achieved by improving these workplace practices.

Paroxetine increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor in postmenopausal women. Menopause is marked by a decline in ovarian function resulting in one or more climacteric symptoms. In the last few years, attention has been focused on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopausal transition. Thanks to the recent findings on the interaction between the serotoninergic system and neurotrophins, it has been suggested that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could contribute to the activity of SSRIs. Moreover, because endogenous gonadal hormones modulate both BDNF expression and serotonin biosynthesis and bioavailability and regulate brain functions like affective and cognitive functions, we proposed to evaluate the effects of a treatment with paroxetine, an SSRI, in a group of postmenopausal women and to clarify the possible relationship between paroxetine, plasma BDNF levels, and climacteric symptoms. A total of 119 postmenopausal women (age, 46-60 y; menopause age, 1-20 y) were included; 89 took paroxetine 10 mg/day for 6 months and 30 took estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT) for 6 months. Blood samples were taken before the beginning of the therapy and at 3 and 6 months. The Green Climacteric Scale questionnaire was used to follow up women's clinical conditions. Plasma BDNF levels significantly increased after 3 and 6 months of therapy (P < 0.001), although a negative correlation between plasma BDNF level and both age and menopause age persisted throughout the treatment. Moreover, a significant reduction in the Greene Climacteric Scale score was observed. In the EPT group, the plasma BDNF level significantly increased after 6 months of therapy. The plasma BDNF levels after 6 months of paroxetine were significantly lower than those after 6 months of EPT. The present data suggest that a low dose of paroxetine is effective in enhancing plasma BDNF levels, and this increase might have a role in improving climacteric symptoms, highlighting the possible role of BDNF in endocrinological and cognitive functions.

Spiritual, religious, and personal beliefs are important and distinctive to assessing quality of life in health: a comparison of theoretical models. The study investigates theoretical debates on the contribution of spiritual, religious, and personal beliefs (SRPB) to quality of life (QoL) in health, by examining contrasting models. The WHOQOL-SRPB assesses QoL relating to SRPB where 33 QoL facets are scored in 6 domains, of which SRPB is one. The measure was completed by a heterogeneous sample of 285 sick and well people representing a cross-section of religious, agnostic, and atheist beliefs in UK, and structured for gender (52% female) and age (mean 47 years). No evidence was found to support the model of spiritual QoL as a concept that overarches every other QoL domain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that SRPB is an integral concept to overall QoL, with a very good fit (comparative fit index=.99). Spiritual QoL made a significant, relatively independent contribution, similar to the other five domains (β=0.68). Spiritual QoL is most closely associated with the psychological domain, particularly hope and optimism and inner peace; two of the nine SRPB facets. Spiritual QoL, but not most other aspects of QoL, is higher for religious people. The results explain theoretical confusion arising from previous research. Spiritual QoL makes a significant and distinctive contribution to QoL assessment in health and should be assessed routinely in health care populations.

Alteration of bacterial surface electrostatic potential and pH upon adhesion to a solid surface and impacts to cellular bioenergetics. In our previous study [Hong Y, Brown DG (2009) Appl Environ Microbiol 75(8):2346-2353], the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level of adhered bacteria was observed to be 2-5 times higher than that of planktonic bacteria. Consequently, the proton motive force (Delta p) of adhered bacteria was approximately 15% greater than that of planktonic bacteria. It was hypothesized that the cell surface pH changes upon adhesion due to the charge-regulated nature of the bacterial cell surface and that this change in surface pH can propagate to the cytoplasmic membrane and alter Delta p. In the current study, we developed and applied a charge regulation model to bacterial adhesion and demonstrated that the charge nature of the adhering surface can have a significant effect on the cell surface pH and ultimately the affect the ATP levels of adhered bacteria. The results indicated that the negatively charged glass surface can result in a two-unit drop in cell surface pH, whereas adhesion to a positively charged amine surface can result in a two-unit rise in pH. The working hypothesis indicates that the negatively charged surface should enhance Delta p and increase cellular ATP, while the positively charged surface should decrease Delta p and decrease ATP, and these results of the hypothesis are directly supported by prior experimental results with both negatively and positively charged surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that the nature of charge on the solid surface can have an impact on the proton motive force and cellular ATP levels.

Generation of parabiotic mice for the study of DC and DC precursor circulation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main regulators of adaptive immune responses and considerable interest currently focuses on the mechanisms of DC homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms and regulation of DC generation may provide cues on how to modulate DC numbers and their longevity, an issue of wide interest in translational research. Surgical joining of the blood circulation of two mice (parabiosis) results in the equal distribution of lymphocytes between the parabiotic partners after a short period of time. In contrast, DCs fail to equalize even after prolonged periods of parabiosis suggesting that self-renewing precursors replenish mature DCs in situ. We have shown that mature DCs are constantly replenished by blood-borne precursors. Furthermore, the low but sustained exchange rate of DCs during parabiosis depends on fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3)-mediated signals, which are important regulators for maintenance of normal DC numbers in the spleen by controlling their division in situ.

Magnetically enhanced high-specificity virus detection using bio-activated magnetic nanoparticles with antibodies as labeling markers. This study describes magnetically driven suppression of cross-reactions among molecules. First, the magnetic nanoparticles are coated with bio-probes and dispersed in liquid. The bio-probes can then bind with homologous or heterologous bio-targets. When alternating-current (ac) magnetic fields are applied, magnetic nanoparticles rotate driven by ac magnetic fields. Thus, the bio-targets bound on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles experience a centrifugal force. The centrifugal force can be manipulated by adjusting the angular frequency of the rotating magnetic nanoparticles. The angular frequency is determined by the applied ac magnetic field frequency. Since the binding force for good binding is much higher than that of poor binding, frequency manipulation is needed for the centrifugal force to be higher than the poor-binding force but lower than the good-binding force. Therefore, poor binding which contributes to cross reactions between molecules can be suppressed efficiently by control of the ac magnetic field frequency.

Blood glucose and prognosis in children with presumed severe malaria: is there a threshold for 'hypoglycaemia'? Hypoglycaemia (glucose <2.2 mmol/l) is a defining feature of severe malaria, but the significance of other levels of blood glucose has not previously been studied in children with severe malaria. A prospective study of 437 consecutive children with presumed severe malaria was conducted in Mali. We defined hypoglycaemia as <2.2 mmol/l, low glycaemia as 2.2-4.4 mmol/l and hyperglycaemia as >8.3 mmol/l. Associations between glycaemia and case fatality were analysed for 418 children using logistic regression models and a receiver operator curve (ROC). There was a significant difference between blood glucose levels in children who died (median 4.6 mmol/l) and survivors (median 7.6 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Case fatality declined from 61.5% of the hypoglycaemic children to 46.2% of those with low glycaemia, 13.4% of those with normal glycaemia and 7.6% of those with hyperglycaemia (P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.75 (0.64-0.88) for case fatality per 1 mmol/l increase in baseline blood glucose. Compared to a normal blood glucose, hypoglycaemia and low glycaemia both significantly increased the odds of death (AOR 11.87, 2.10-67.00; and 5.21, 1.86-14.63, respectively), whereas hyperglycaemia reduced the odds of death (AOR 0.34, 0.13-0.91). The ROC [area under the curve at 0.753 (95% CI 0.684-0.820)] indicated that glycaemia had a moderate predictive value for death and identified an optimal threshold at glycaemia <6.1 mmol/l, (sensitivity 64.5% and specificity 75.1%). If there is a threshold of blood glucose which defines a worse prognosis, it is at a higher level than the current definition of 2.2 mmol/l.

Routine care provided by specialists to children and adolescents in the United States (2002-2006). Specialist physicians provide a large share of outpatient health care for children and adolescents in the United States, but little is known about the nature and content of these services in the ambulatory setting. Our objective was to quantify and characterize routine and co-managed pediatric healthcare as provided by specialists in community settings. Nationally representative data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2002-2006. We included office based physicians (excluding family physicians, general internists and general pediatricians), and a representative sample of their patients aged 18 or less. Visits were classified into mutually exclusive categories based on the major reason for the visit, previous knowledge of the health problem, and whether the visit was the result of a referral. Primary diagnoses were classified using Expanded Diagnostic Clusters. Physician report of sharing care for the patient with another physician and frequency of reappointments were also collected. Overall, 41.3% out of about 174 million visits were for routine follow up and preventive care of patients already known to the specialist. Psychiatry, immunology and allergy, and dermatology accounted for 54.5% of all routine and preventive care visits. Attention deficit disorder, allergic rhinitis and disorders of the sebaceous glands accounted for about a third of these visits. Overall, 73.2% of all visits resulted in a return appointment with the same physician, in half of all cases as a result of a routine or preventive care visit. Ambulatory office-based pediatric care provided by specialists includes a large share of non referred routine and preventive care for common problems for patients already known to the physician. It is likely that many of these services could be managed in primary care settings, lessening demand for specialists and improving coordination of care.

Additional analysis of the secondary end point of biochemical recurrence rate in a phase 3 trial (CS21) comparing degarelix 80 mg versus leuprolide in prostate cancer patients segmented by baseline characteristics.

Association study between a functional polymorphism of tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter and personality traits in healthy subjects. According to the Cloninger's theory, personality consists of temperaments, which are automatic emotional reactions and habits, and characters, which are the self-concepts about goals and values. It has been suggested that temperaments are highly heritable and related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which are deeply involved in human mental functions and behaviors. It has recently been reported that the C-824T single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the TH gene (rs10770141) affects promoter activity of the TH gene and urinary catecholamine levels. In the present study, the association of this polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 740 healthy Japanese subjects. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the TH genotype was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. In total subjects, there were no significant differences in the seven TCI dimension scores between the TH genotype groups. In males, the subjects with the T allele predictive of elevated levels of dopamine and norepinephrine had lower scores of novelty seeking than those without this allele, while in females none of the TCI scores was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the C-824T polymorphism in the TH gene promoter may affect the personality trait of novelty seeking in healthy males. However, taken the effects of multiple comparisons into account, the present result should be interpreted with caution, necessitating a replication in a different sample.

Impact of age at diagnosis on prognosis and treatment in laryngeal cancer. The aims of this study were to analyze how age affects treatment and treatment outcome, and to determine whether tumor characteristics differ between different age groups with laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer during 1978-2004 in the Uppsala-Orebro region in Sweden were retrospectively studied. There were no significant differences in the 945 cases between age groups concerning major patient and tumor characteristics, such as male/female ratio, distribution of glottic/supraglottic tumors, stage, or site of recurrence. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were worse among the oldest, although a significant proportion was cured. Relapse risk was lower among the oldest (12%) compared with the youngest (23%). The risk of never becoming tumor-free was 25% among the oldest and 7% in the youngest. Among the most elderly, only 1 late recurrence occurred. Elderly patients with laryngeal carcinoma cope well with treatment. Undertreatment may determine outcome more than age. The oldest group should be followed for a minimum of 2 years.

Fluvial biofilms: A pertinent tool to assess beta-blockers toxicity. Among increasingly used pharmaceutical products, beta-blockers have been commonly reported at low concentrations in rivers and littoral waters of Europe and North America. Little is known about the toxicity of these chemicals in freshwater ecosystems while their presence may lead to chronic pollution. Hence, in this study the acute toxicity of 3 beta-blockers: metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol on fluvial biofilms was assessed by using several biomarkers. Some were indicative of potential alterations in biofilm algae (photosynthetic efficiency), and others in biofilm bacteria (peptidase activity, bacterial mortality). Propranolol was the most toxic beta-blocker, mostly affecting the algal photosynthetic process. The exposure to 531microg/L of propranolol caused 85% of inhibition of photosynthesis after 24h. Metoprolol was particularly toxic for bacteria. Though estimated No-Effect Concentrations (NEC) were similar to environmental concentrations, higher concentrations of the toxic (503microg/L metoprolol) caused an increase of 50% in bacterial mortality. Atenolol was the least toxic of the three tested beta-blockers. Effects superior to 50% were only observed at very high concentration (707mg/L). Higher toxicity of metoprolol and propranolol might be due to better absorption within biofilms of these two chemicals. Since beta-blockers are mainly found in mixtures in rivers, their differential toxicity could have potential relevant consequences on the interactions between algae and bacteria within river biofilms.


Tetrahedral and polyhedral mesh evaluation for cerebral hemodynamic simulation--a comparison.

Internal proton transfer in the external pyridoxal 5'-phosphate Schiff base in dopa decarboxylase. Combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of dopa decarboxylase have been carried out to elucidate the factors that contribute to the tautomeric equilibrium of the intramolecular proton transfer in the external PLP-L-dopa Schiff base. The presence of a carboxylate anion on the alpha-carbon of the Schiff base stabilizes the zwitterions and shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oxoenamine tautomer (protonated Schiff base). Moreover, protonation of the PLP pyridine nitrogen further drives the equilibrium toward the oxoenamine direction. On the other hand, solvent effects favor the hydroxyimine configuration, although the equilibrium favors the oxoenamine isomer with a methyl group as the substituent on the imino nitrogen. In dopa decarboxylase, the hydroxyimine form of the PLP(H+)-L-dopa Schiff base is predicted to be the major isomer with a relative free energy of -1.3 kcal/mol over that of the oxoenamine isomer. Both Asp271 and Lys303 stabilize the hydroxyimine configuration through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the pyridine nitrogen of the PLP and the imino nitrogen of the Schiff base, respectively. Interestingly, Thr246 plays a double role in the intramolecular proton transfer process, in which it initially donates a hydrogen bond to the phenolate oxygen in the oxoenamine configuration and then switches to a hydrogen bond acceptor from the phenolic hydroxyl group in the hydroxyimine tautomer.

Impact of Age and Primary Disease Site on Outcome in Women With Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma of the Ovary or Peritoneum: Results of a Large Single-Institution Registry of a Rare Tumor. Low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary (LGSOC) or peritoneum (LGSPC) is a rare subtype of ovarian or peritoneal cancer characterized by young age at diagnosis and relative resistance to chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to report our updated experience with women diagnosed with LGSOC or LGSPC to assess the validity of our original observations. Eligibility criteria for patients from our database were: stage I to IV LGSOC or LGSPC, original diagnosis before January 2012, and adequate clinical information. All patients were included in progression-free survival, overall survival, and multivariable Cox regression analyses. A subset analysis was performed among patients with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma treated with primary surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. We identified 350 eligible patients. Median progression-free survival was 28.1 months; median overall survival was 101.7 months. In the multivariable analysis, compared with women age ≤ 35 years, those diagnosed at age > 35 years had a 43% reduction in likelihood of dying (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.74; P < .001). Having disease present at completion of primary therapy was associated with a 1.78 increased hazard of dying compared with being clinically disease free (P < .001). Similar trends were noted in the smaller patient cohort. In this cohort, women with LGSPC had a 41% decreased chance of dying (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.98; P = .04) compared with those with LGSOC. Women age < 35 years with low-grade serous carcinoma and those with persistent disease at completion of primary therapy have the worst outcomes. Patients with LGSPC seem to have a better prognosis than those with LGSOC.

Associations of health behaviours with return to work outcomes after colorectal cancer. Engaging in positive health behaviours can improve quality of life amongst cancer survivors, whether this facilitates return to work is unknown. We examined associations of health behaviours with return to work outcomes following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women (45-64 years). We recruited 239 participants through the Queensland Cancer Registry between January 2010 and September 2011. Data were collected through telephone-administered interviews and postal questionnaires at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis. Logistic regression examined likelihood of ceasing or reducing work, and Cox regression examined factors associated with time to return to work. No significant associations were observed between health behaviours (fruit and vegetables consumption, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity or sitting time) at 6 months and ceasing or reducing work at 12 months post-diagnosis. Participants who reported excessive sleep (≥9 h/day) were 2.69 times more likely to reduce work time or retire (relative to those sleeping the recommended 7 to <9 h/day; 95 % CI 1.06, 6.87, adjusted for cancer treatment). In Cox regression analysis, excessive sleep was associated with a longer work re-entry time (relative to sleeping 7 to <9 h/day; HR = 0.47; 95 % CI 0.22, 1.00, adjusted for education and cancer treatment). Further research into how excessive sleep might be related to return to work amongst colorectal cancer survivors is warranted. Interventions focused on achieving optimal sleep patterns may assist colorectal cancer survivors to return to work and should be tested in future studies.

[Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome]. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is characterised by a significantly increased risk for developing cancer in childhood. It arises when both parents have a mutation in the same mismatch repair gene and pass it on to their child. An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed with CMMR-D syndrome after she developed a brain tumour at the age of 4 and a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 6. She had multiple hyperpigmented skin lesions and died of myelodysplastic syndrome at the age of 11. In children with cancer CMMR-D syndrome can be recognized particularly if there are multiple primary malignancies and skin hyperpigmentations and hypopigmentations. The parents of these children are at high risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer (Lynch syndrome), amongst others.

Drug delivery from ordered mesoporous matrices. Research interest in silica-based ordered mesoporous materials (SMMs) as drug delivery systems has grown drastically in the last few years owing to the great versatility and stability of these mesoporous matrices. This review aims to resume the work carried out in this area so far and the possible applications in biomedical technologies. The different SMMs can be designed and tailored using different chemical strategies according to the drug and clinical necessity. The available channels of SMMs that can be used to store drugs can be opened and closed by different systems, in the so-called stimuli-responsive release devices. These systems could improve the therapeutic efficacy compared with conventional sustained release systems. SMMs offer such a great versatility that can be used both for oral and for local drug delivery, with huge possible applications in different clinical areas.

Who should receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator after myocardial infarction? Despite a decline in overall cardiovascular mortality, the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) continues to rise. Patients who survive a myocardial infarction (MI) with depressed ejection fraction are at particularly high risk for SCD. The development of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has revolutionized SCD prevention; however, despite the current fervor for device implantation, many unresolved questions remain about risk stratification in post-MI patients. This review presents the current indications and timing of ICD implantation for primary and secondary prevention of SCD after MI. Several conventional and investigational methods of risk stratification after MI, as well as current controversies regarding device implantation in specific patient populations, are also reviewed.

Regulation of the chondrogenic phenotype in culture. In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in the development of regenerative approaches to produce hyaline cartilage ex vivo that can be utilized for the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissue. It is clinically imperative that cartilage engineered in vitro mimics the molecular composition and organization of and exhibits biomechanical properties similar to persistent hyaline cartilage in vivo. Experimentally, much of our current knowledge pertaining to the regulation of cartilage formation, or chondrogenesis, has been acquired in vitro utilizing high-density cultures of undifferentiated chondroprogenitor cells stimulated to differentiate into chondrocytes. In this review, we describe the extracellular matrix molecules, nuclear transcription factors, cytoplasmic protein kinases, cytoskeletal components, and plasma membrane receptors that characterize cells undergoing chondrogenesis in vitro and regulate the progression of these cells through the chondrogenic differentiation program. We also provide an extensive list of growth factors and other extracellular signaling molecules, as well as chromatin remodeling proteins such as histone deacetylases, known to regulate chondrogenic differentiation in culture. In addition, we selectively highlight experiments that demonstrate how an understanding of normal hyaline cartilage formation can lead to the development of novel cartilage tissue engineering strategies. Finally, we present directions for future studies that may yield information applicable to the in vitro generation of hyaline cartilage that more closely resembles native tissue.

Evaluation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide P34. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide P34 was evaluated in different eukaryotic cells. The food-grade bacteriocin nisin was also analysed for comparison. Vero cells were treated with different concentrations (0.02-2.5 microg x ml(-1)) of antimicrobial peptide P34 and nisin. Cell viability and plasma membrane integrity were checked by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], NRU (Neutral Red dye uptake) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assays. The EC50 values of the peptide P34 in MTT and NRU assays were 0.60 and 1.25 microg x ml(-1) respectively, while values of nisin found were 0.50 and 1.04 microg x ml(-1). In the LDH assay, the EC50 values were 0.65 and 0.62 microg x ml(-1) for P34 and nisin, respectively. The peptide P34 revealed similar haemolytic activity on human erythrocytes (5.8%) when compared with nisin (4.9%). The effects on viability, motility and acrosomal exocytosis of human sperm were also evaluated. Nisin and P34 showed similar effects on sperm parameters. The evaluation of cytotoxicity of antimicrobial peptides is a critical step to guarantee their safe use.


Cullin neddylation and substrate-adaptors counteract SCF inhibition by the CAND1-like protein Lag2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Identification of human sperm proteins that interact with human zona pellucida3 (ZP3) using yeast two-hybrid system. Sperm proteins that interact with zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) have not been clearly identified in humans. In the present study, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to identify human sperm proteins that interact with human ZP3. Human ZP3 cDNA was cloned into pAS2-1 yeast vector and used as bait to find reactive proteins in the human testis cDNA library. Six specific clones were obtained that were further confirmed for interaction using the mammalian two-hybrid system. These six clones showed homologies with several proteins in the GenBank database. Of these, the strongest ZP3-interacting protein, that shows 97% homology with ubiquitin associated protein-2 like (UBAP2L), was tested in the hemizona assay. UBAP2L antibodies significantly (p<0.001) inhibited human sperm-zona binding in this assay. We conclude that the Y2H system is a useful strategy for identifying novel genes encoding proteins that interact with ZP proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the Y2H system to identify sperm proteins that interact with human oocyte ZP3. Novel proteins identified using this system may find applications in elucidating the fertilization cascade, development of a new generation of non-steroidal contraceptives, and specific diagnosis and treatment of human infertility.

The effect of a single dose of bupivacaine on donor site pain after anterior iliac crest bone harvesting. Transplants from the anterior iliac crest are used for most reconstructive procedures in cranio-maxillofacial surgery. The advantages are easy accessibility, the ability to work in two teams and the amount of corticocancellous bone available; disadvantages are postoperative pain and gait disturbances. To reduce donor-site pain, the effect of a single dose of bupivacaine (10 cc of 2.5mg/cc with 1:80.000 epinephrine) was studied. 200 consecutive patients, who underwent anterior iliac crest bone harvesting for reconstructive procedures, were randomly divided into those receiving bupivacaine and those not. They completed a standardized questionnaire. Patients scored the intensity of the pain and difficulties walking at different times with a visual analogue scale. They recorded analgesics used. 98 questionnaires were eligible for analysis. No differences between the bupivacaine and the control group were detected for postoperative pain and gait disturbance. There is no support for administration of a single dose of bupivacaine to reduce pain in the first postoperative days. The surface area of the removed bone had a significant influence on pain and walking; pain is related to the local osseous damage or periosteal stripping rather than to the length of incision or the operation time.


Increases in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors coincide with increases in interleukin-6 and proteinases after major surgery.

Spontaneous regression of a cervical intraspinal cyst in a dog. We report a cervical intraspinal cyst in a dog that was initially tetraparetic but spontaneously recovered completely. MRI revealed a well-demarcated intraspinal cyst located dorsally to a degenerated intervertebral disc. The location of the cyst and its signal features on MRI resembled those of discal cysts previously reported in humans. It has been reported in dogs that clinical signs of a intraspinal cyst are similar to those of intervertebral disc herniation and both conditions require surgical intervention. Unexpectedly, our case showed rapid spontaneous recovery and the follow-up MRI revealed complete resolution of the intraspinal cyst and spinal cord compression. Spontaneous recovery of degenerative intraspinal cyst may occur in dogs, similar to rare human cases as reported previously.

Nuclear factor of activated T cells regulates osteopontin expression in arterial smooth muscle in response to diabetes-induced hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Recently, we reported that high glucose activates the Ca(2+)/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in arteries ex vivo. Here, we sought to determine whether hyperglycemia activates NFAT in vivo and whether this leads to vascular complications. An intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test in mice increased NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in vascular smooth muscle. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in increased NFATc3 transcriptional activity in arteries of NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice. Two NFAT-responsive sequences in the osteopontin (OPN) promoter were identified. This proinflammatory cytokine has been shown to exacerbate atherosclerosis and restenosis. Activation of NFAT resulted in increased OPN mRNA and protein in native arteries. Glucose-induced OPN expression was prevented by the ectonucleotidase apyrase, suggesting a mechanism involving the release of extracellular nucleotides. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A or the novel NFAT blocker A-285222 prevented glucose-induced OPN expression. Furthermore, diabetes resulted in higher OPN expression, which was significantly decreased by in vivo treatment with A-285222 for 4 weeks or prevented in arteries from NFATc3(-/-) mice. These results identify a glucose-sensitive transcription pathway in vivo, revealing a novel molecular mechanism that may underlie vascular complications of diabetes.

Metal ion physiopathology in neurodegenerative disorders. Metal dyshomeostasis in the brain (BMD) has often been proposed as a possible cause for several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). Nevertheless, the precise nature of the biochemical mechanisms of metal involvement in NDs is still largely unknown. Mounting evidence suggests that normal aging itself is characterized by, among other features, a significant degree of metal ion dysmetabolism in the brain. This is probably the result of a progressive deterioration of the metal regulatory systems and, at least in some cases, of life-long metal exposure and brain accumulation. Although alterations of metal metabolism do occur to some extent in normal aging, they appear to be highly enhanced under various neuropathological conditions, causing increased oxidative stress and favoring abnormal metal-protein interactions. Intriguingly, despite the fact that most common NDs have a distinct etiological basis, they share striking similarities as they are all characterized by a documented brain metal impairment. This review will primarily focus on the alterations of metal homeostasis that are observed in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. We also present a brief survey on BMD in other NDs (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Prion Protein disease) in order to highlight what represents the most reliable evidence supporting a crucial involvement of metals in neurodegeneration. The opportunities for metal-targeted pharmacological strategies in the major NDs are briefly outlined as well.

Statins in influenza: time for a controlled clinical study. Mexico recently experienced the impact of an influenza epidemic. This outbreak, the H1N1 strain, affected a large number of citizens and caused panic, economic instability and increased health care costs to the federal government and public and private institutions. Influenza outbreaks are periodic. They may or may not be seasonal, and severity of the disease is linked to host immunity and to the virus strain. In the event of a pandemic as happened in 1918, it is estimated that approximately 175-350 million people may die, and health systems would face a catastrophic situation due to the insufficiency of antivirals and vaccines, as well as affecting hospital infrastructure.

ADAMTS13 gene deletion aggravates ischemic brain damage: a possible neuroprotective role of ADAMTS13 by ameliorating postischemic hypoperfusion.

Liver elasticity and viscosity quantification using shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (SDUV). Noninvasive quantification of liver elasticity is a promising alternative to liver biopsy to stage liver fibrosis, a condition afflicting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Quantitative measurement of elasticity (in unit of Pascal) is required in this application because liver fibrosis is a diffuse disease where abnormality is not confined to a local region and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. SDUV uses an ultrasound "push" beam to stimulate formation of propagating harmonic shear waves in the studied tissue. The propagation speed of induced shear waves is frequency dependent (dispersive) and relates to the tissue's mechanical properties. Shear wave speeds at multiple frequencies (typically hundreds of Hertz) are measured by a separate ultrasound "detect" beam in pulse echo mode and fit with a theoretical dispersion model to inversely solve for tissue elasticity and viscosity. A special pulse sequence has been developed to facilitate a single ultrasound array transducer for both push and detect function, which makes SDUV compatible with current ultrasound scanners. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDUV measurements in porcine liver using a dual transducer prototype.

p53 independent radio-sensitization of human lymphoblastoid cell lines by Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an attractive modality for cancer therapy. Recent studies presented that an Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin), enhanced tumor radio-sensitivity, while this was not observed in normal cells. One of the studies reported that the effect of this drug was only observed in tumor cells carrying the wild-type p53 gene, thus demonstrating p53-dependent tumor radio-sensitization by 17AAG. We have now tested the effects of 17AAG on two human lymphoblastoid cell lines from the same donor, TK6 cells with the wild-type p53 gene and WTK1 cells with the mutated p53 gene. The effects of 17AAG were tested at concentrations of 10 and 100 nM on various parameters, including growth inhibition of the cells, enhancement of radio-sensitivity by colony formation assay, apoptosis and chromosomal radio-sensitivity and abrogation of radiation induced G2/M checkpoint. When 100 nM 17AAG was applied, all of these parameters were enhanced in a similar fashion in both cell lines, indicating that the drug effect is p53-independent. Our results suggest that 17AAG is likely to be an effective sensitizer for radiotherapy, even on tumors with mutated p53.


Relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of lipophilic N-acyldiamines.

Glycolipid headgroup replacement: a new approach for the analysis of specific functions of glycolipids in vivo. Glycolipids with one or two sugar residues attached to different lipid backbones are found in biomembranes of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals in the form of steryl glycosides, glycosylceramides and diacylglycerol glycosides. They contain different sugar residues, mainly glucose and galactose, in either alpha- or beta-configuration. Many of the isolated compounds have been studied in great detail with regard to their biophysical behavior in artificial membrane systems. With the availability of cloned genes, the methods of reverse genetics were used to study glycolipid functions in living cells. The deletion of a lipid glycosyltransferase gene leads to the loss of the corresponding glycolipid in the transformed pro- and eukaryotic organisms. Often, these glycosyltransferase deletion mutants showed many differences to the wild-type organisms and thus demonstrated the biological importance of the glycolipid. When extensive deletion-induced glycolipid losses were not complemented by higher proportions of other membrane lipids, the mutants could display severe phenotypes due to a serious dysfunction or even collapse of an entire membrane system. On the other hand, by this approach the specific contribution of characteristic head group details cannot be recognized and separated from more general glycolipid functions. Many of these difficulties can be circumvented by a glycolipid headgroup replacement approach. This new approach requires the exchange of a lipid glycosyltransferase in an organism by a heterologous glycosyltransferase having a different headgroup specificity, e.g. the substitution of a galactosyltransferase by a glucosyltransferase. The resulting transgenic organism produces a novel glycolipid which differs from that of the native organism not in proportion, but only in structural details of its headgroup. Therefore, such rescued mutants are comparable to suppressor mutants and show less severe phenotypes than the intermediate deletion mutants. A comparison between the wild type, the simple deletion mutant and the mutant rescued by glycolipid replacement will not only disclose general functions of glycolipids, but also additional roles of headgroup details.

Molecular biological effects of selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition in ovine lung injury. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase is critically involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury resulting from combined burn and smoke inhalation injury. We hypothesized that 7-nitroindazole, a selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, blocks central molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this double-hit insult. Twenty-five adult ewes were surgically prepared and randomly allocated to 1) an uninjured, untreated sham group (n = 7), 2) an injured control group with no treatment (n = 7), 3) an injury group treated with 7-nitroindazole from 1-h postinjury to the remainder of the 24-h study period (n = 7), or 4) a sham-operated group subjected only to 7-nitroindazole to judge the effects in health. The combination injury was associated with twofold increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and oxidative/nitrosative stress, as indicated by significant increases in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, 3-nitrotyrosine (an indicator of peroxynitrite formation), and malondialdehyde lung tissue content. The presence of systemic inflammation was evidenced by twofold, sixfold, and threefold increases in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase lung tissue concentrations, respectively (each P < 0.05 vs. sham). These molecular changes were linked to tissue damage, airway obstruction, and pulmonary shunting with deteriorated gas exchange. 7-Nitroindazole blocked, or at least attenuated, all these pathological changes. Our findings suggest 1) that nitric oxide formation derived from increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity represents a pivotal reactive agent in the patho-physiology of combined burn and smoke inhalation injury and 2) that selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition represents a goal-directed approach to attenuate the degree of injury.

A randomized controlled trial of double versus triple therapy with amantadine for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in Latino patients. With only a third of Latinos achieving sustained virologic response (SVR), there is a need for enhanced HCV treatment. Amantadine has been proposed to improve response rates in addition to standard therapy with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. Our objective is to evaluate whether triple therapy with amantadine improves SVR rates in this special population. Treatment-naïve Latino subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection were randomized to receive peginterferon alpha-2a plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks (double therapy) or the same regimen plus amantadine 200 mg daily (triple therapy). The primary endpoint was SVR. Predictors of liver fibrosis using APRI and Forns indices were also evaluated. We enrolled 124 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Sixty-three received conventional therapy and 61 patients had triple therapy with amantadine. SVR at week 72 was achieved in 25 patients (39.7%) vs. 26 patients (42.6%) in the double and triple regimen, respectively (p=0.561). After multivariate analysis, advanced fibrosis, obesity, and low pretreatment ALT levels were associated with non-response in both groups (p=0.0234, p=0.0012, p=0.0249, respectively). APRI values delimited an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.724 and Forns index with AUROC of 0.733. There was no difference between both indices in predicting significant fibrosis (Knodell index: F3-F4). Our study demonstrates that the addition of amantadine to standard treatment of chronic HCV does not improve SVR rates in Latino patients with genotype 1. Further research to improve response rates in this special population is needed.

A single step purification for autolytic zinc proteinases. We describe a novel single-step method for the purification of stromelysin-1 catalytic domain (SCD) via immobilized metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions that inhibit proteolytic activity followed by on-column refolding and spontaneous autolysis of the fusion peptide to yield pure, active stromelysin-1 catalytic domain. The methodology provides a general approach for the rapid purification of large quantities of zinc proteinases.

HIV-1 protease inhibitors with a transition-state mimic comprising a tertiary alcohol: improved antiviral activity in cells.

Overexpression of a soybean O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase-encoding gene GmOASTL4 in tobacco increases cysteine levels and enhances tolerance to cadmium stress. O-Acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL, EC 2.5.1.47) catalyzes the final step in cysteine biosynthesis. The soybean GmOASTL4 gene was overexpressed in tobacco. Transgenic plants showed markedly increased accumulation of transcripts and higher cysteine content compared with the wild-type. Upon exposure to cadmium stress, OASTL activity and cysteine levels increased significantly in transgenic plants. Cadmium accumulation and the activity of both superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were enhanced in transformants. These results demonstrate that overexpression of GmOASTL4 in tobacco can enhance cysteine levels and increase tolerance to cadmium stress.

Pulse pressure variation estimation using a sequential Monte Carlo method. We describe a novel automatic algorithm to continuously estimate the pulse pressure variation (PPV) index from arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. The algorithm utilizes our recently developed sequential Monte Carlo method (SMCM) based on a maximum A-Posterior adaptive marginalized particle filter (MAM-PF). The PPV index is one of most specific and sensitive dynamic indicators of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. We report the assessment results of the proposed algorithm on real ABP signals.

Semisupervised least squares support vector machine. The least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), like the SVM, is based on the margin-maximization performing structural risk and has excellent power of generalization. In this paper, we consider its use in semisupervised learning. We propose two algorithms to perform this task deduced from the transductive SVM idea. Algorithm 1 is based on combinatorial search guided by certain heuristics while Algorithm 2 iteratively builds the decision function by adding one unlabeled sample at the time. In term of complexity, Algorithm 1 is faster but Algorithm 2 yields a classifier with a better generalization capacity with only a few labeled data available. Our proposed algorithms are tested in several benchmarks and give encouraging results, confirming our approach.

Doppler indices of the middle cerebral artery in fetuses with cardiac defects theoretically associated with impaired cerebral oxygen delivery in utero: is there a brain-sparing effect? To assess changes in the Doppler flow profiles of the middle cerebral artery in fetuses with cardiac defects theoretically associated with impaired cerebral oxygen delivery in utero. Z-scores were calculated for pulsatility and resistance indices (PI and RI, respectively) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) between 19 and 41 weeks' gestation, and for head circumference at birth (HC), in 113 fetuses with the following isolated cardiac defects: transposition of the great arteries (TGA; n = 18), hypoplastic left heart (HLH; n = 46), severe aortic stenosis (n = 17), pulmonary atresia (n = 18) and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF; n = 14). Pregnancies with uteroplacental dysfunction (indicated by increased uterine and/or umbilical Doppler indices), growth restriction, extracardiac malformations, chromosomal anomalies as well as multiple pregnancies were excluded to avoid any additional hypoxemic effect as strictly as possible. The results were compared with 1378 normal controls. Fetuses with pulmonary atresia, severe aortic stenosis and TOF had no significant alterations of Doppler parameters or HC at birth. In fetuses with TGA, mean Z-scores of HC at birth were significantly smaller compared with controls (mean +/- SD, -0.73 +/- 1.25; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the Doppler parameters. Fetuses with HLH had significantly lower MCA-PI (-0.57 +/- 0.74; P < 0.05), MCA-RI (-0.73 +/- 0.85; P < 0.05), CPR (-1.44 +/- 1.05; P < 0.05) and HC (-0.50 +/- 1.24; P < 0.05) Z-scores compared with controls. Fetuses with cardiac defects theoretically associated with markedly impaired cerebral oxygen delivery in utero (TGA and HLH) have smaller HCs at birth. However, only fetuses with HLH have cerebrovascular alterations that are detectable by evaluation of the Doppler indices MCA-PI, MCA-RI and CPR.

Nuclear protein 1 induced by ATF4 in response to various stressors acts as a positive regulator on the transcriptional activation of ATF4. Nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) was originally identified as p8, a member of the family of HMG-I/Y transcription factors induced in response to various cellular stressors. However, the signaling pathway underlying NUPR1 induction by cellular stresses remains to be established. In this study, we found that the expression of NUPR1 by various stresses induced by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Loss of ATF4 using siRNA significantly diminished NUPR1 expression. Overexpression of ATF4 caused NUPR1 levels to rise. NUPR1 expression was associated with enhanced transcriptional activation of genes of ATF4 downstream, suggesting that the protein promoted the transcription of stress-regulated genes via positive feedback on the ATF4 pathway.

Shared decision making models to inform an interprofessional perspective on decision making: a theory analysis. To conduct a theory analysis of shared decision making (SDM) conceptual models and determine the extent to which the models are relevant to interprofessional collaboration in clinical practice. Theory analysis of SDM models identified from three systematic reviews and personal files. Eligible publications: model of SDM; described concepts with relational statements. Two independently appraised models. Of 54 publications, 15 unique models included 18 core concepts. Of two models that included more than one health professional collaborating with the patient, one included 3 of 10 elements of interprofessional collaboration and the other included 1 element. Fourteen were rated as having no logical fallacies, 10 as parsimonious, 7 had been empirically tested, 4 provided testable hypotheses, and 3 described the development process. Most SDM models failed to encompass an interprofessional approach. Those that included at least two professionals met few of the elements of interprofessional collaboration and had limited description of SDM processes. Although models were rated as logically adequate and parsimonious, only half were tested and few were developed using an explicit process. Appraisal of SDM models highlights the need for a model that is more inclusive of an interprofessional approach.

Stimulation threshold potentials of intraoperative cortical motor mapping using monopolar trains of five in pediatric epilepsy surgery. Direct cortical stimulation in commonly used for the accurate localization of the motor cortex but the electrical threshold stimulation parameters with this technique had not been fully established. A retrospective review of 15 cases of pediatric surgical cases were performed. The patients consisted of nine male patients and six female patients with age range from 2 to 18 years (mean: 10.8 years; median: 14 years). The most common pathology was cortical dysplasia (nine cases). Stimulation was performed with a train of five stimulations (range five-seven stimulations; <5% of stimulations required more than five stimulations) applied, each train of 50 micros pulse duration, with an interstimulus interval of 1.1 msec. Stimulation intensity commenced at 25 V and this was increased at 5-10 V increments until motor evoked potentials waveforms of sufficient duration and morphology were consistently generated. Monopolar electrical stimulation threshold for intraoperative motor cortical mapping were found to be more consistent in the upper limb compared to lower limb and facial muscles. Evoked responses from the extensor digitorium communis had the highest recorded rate (83.7%) and required the lowest stimulation voltage (36.0 V). The stimulation voltage was found to be statistically significant compared to threshold values for abductor hallucis, tibialis anterior, deltoid, and orbicularis oris with respective p values of 0.006, 0.021, 0,027, and 0.015. There was also a distinct trend that patients with cortical dysplasia/tuberous sclerosis have higher stimulation thresholds when compared to other pathology (p = 0.067). Monopolar electrical stimulation threshold for intraoperative motor cortical mapping were more consistent in the upper limb compared to lower limb and facial muscles. Evoked responses from the extensor digitorium communis had the highest recorded rate and required the lowest stimulation voltage. There was also a distinct trend that patients with cortical dysplasia/tuberous sclerosis have higher stimulation thresholds.

Patient perspectives of Condition Management Programmes as a route to better health, well-being and employability. Condition Management Programmes (CMPs), delivered through primary care settings, have been identified as possible vehicles to facilitate return to work for individuals with chronic health problems. There is little research, however, which examines how such programmes are received by patients. To explore patients' experiences of CMPs in terms of health, well-being and employability. Four focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to capture patients' (n = 25) perceptions and experiences regarding participation in one of five different CMPs: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Counselling, Lower Back Pain Services, Smoking Cessation and a GP Exercise Referral Programme. Experiences of the CMPs were generally positive. Respondents reported improved health behaviours (specifically better diets and increased exercise), positive psychosocial outcomes (including increased self-esteem, confidence and social support) and in some cases, return to work. However, concerns were expressed about the shortness of interventions and their accessibility. Although condition management appears to have been well received by participants, the findings also illustrate that there is no 'one size fits all' template for CMPs. Rather, interventions should be adapted to take account of the dynamics of specific conditions, the context in which the intervention is based and the characteristics of the individuals involved.

Biomechanics of the ergometric stress tests: regional and local effects on elastic, transitional and muscular human arteries.

Comparison of a Four-Section Spindle and Stomacher for Efficacy of Detaching Microorganisms from Fresh Vegetables. This study was undertaken to compare the effect of the spindle and stomacher for detaching microorganisms from fresh vegetables. The spindle is an apparatus for detaching microorganisms from food surfaces, which was developed in our laboratory. When processed with the spindle, food samples were barely disrupted, the original shape was maintained, and the diluent was clear, facilitating further detection analysis more easily than with stomacher treatment. The four-section spindle consists of four sample bag containers (A, B, C, and D) to economize time and effort by simultaneously processing four samples. The aerobic plate counts (APC) of 50 fresh vegetable samples were measured following spindle and stomacher treatment. Correlations between the two methods for each section of the spindle and stomacher were very high (R(2) = 0.9828 [spindle compartment A; Sp A], 0.9855 [Sp B], 0.9848 [Sp C], and 0.9851 [Sp D]). One-tenth milliliter of foodborne pathogens suspensions was inoculated onto surfaces of food samples, and ratios of spindle-to-stomacher enumerations were close to 1.00 log CFU/g between every section of the spindle and stomacher. One of the greatest features of the spindle is that it can treat large-sized samples that exceed 200 g. Uncut whole apples, green peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes were processed by the spindle and by hand massaging by 2 min. Large-sized samples were also assayed for aerobic plate count and recovery of the three foodborne pathogens, and the difference between each section of the spindle and hand massaging was not significant (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated that the spindle apparatus can be an alternative device for detaching microorganisms from all fresh vegetable samples for microbiological analysis by the food processing industry.

Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the mesocolon transversum. Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a rare and biologically aggressive tumor. Differential diagnosis must include cystic neoplasms of the pancreas (mucinous and serous cystoadenoma or cystocarcinoma), cystic lymphangioma or mesothelioma and retroperitoneal haematoma. Making the right diagnosis preoperatively may be often difficult, but MFH may be suspected when a huge retroperitoneal mass is found at imaging in elderly patients. We report a case of a primary abdominal MFH originating from the mesocolon transversum.


Hepatic steatosis in overweight/obese females: new screening method for those at risk.

Identifying and managing patients with acute coronary conditions. In 2004, the then National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a technology-appraisal guideline on the treatment of patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This article reports the results of a study in which triage and treatment for this patient group in one emergency department (ED) was assessed against this NICE guideline. The study found that patients were triaged by ED staff successfully but that there had been a lack of awareness of prognostic risk groupings and that compliance with guidelines on early antiplatelet therapy had not been ideal. The authors conclude, therefore, that the introduction of an ED pathway for patients with UA or NSTEMI would improve clinicians' compliance with the NICE guideline.

The rat in basic therapeutic research in homeopathy. The Similia Principle, the basis of homeopathy, implies that substances initiating symptoms when applied to healthy biological systems can be utilized as remedies to treat a diseased system with similar symptoms. Depending whether the remedy substance was of the same type as the etiologic agent, treatment is classified as either homologous or heterologous. The intact rat is the biological system most utilized in basic science homeopathic research. The Homeopathy Basic Research experiments (HomBRex) database (about 1300 experiments on model biological systems in homeopathic research) was analyzed for homologous and heterologous treatments of disease states of intact rats. The relationship between the Similia Principle and hormesis is discussed.

On the minimum quantum requirement of photosynthesis. An analysis of the shape of photosynthetic light curves is presented and the existence of the initial non-linear part is shown as a consequence of the operation of the non-cooperative (Kok's) mechanism of oxygen evolution or the effect of dark respiration. The effect of nonlinearity on the quantum efficiency (yield) and quantum requirement is reconsidered. The essential conclusions are: 1) The non-linearity of the light curves cannot be compensated using suspensions of algae or chloroplasts with high (>1.0) optical density or absorbance. 2) The values of the maxima of the quantum efficiency curves or the values of the minima of the quantum requirement curves cannot be used for estimation of the exact value of the maximum quantum efficiency and the minimum quantum requirement. The estimation of the maximum quantum efficiency or the minimum quantum requirement should be performed only after extrapolation of the linear part at higher light intensities of the quantum requirement curves to "0" light intensity.

Jordanian mother's report of their childbirth experience: findings from a questionnaire survey. The main aim of this study is to document women's perceptions of the different aspects their childbirth experience including expectations, satisfaction and self-control. Other aspects of the labour process including length of labour, difficulty of labour, effectiveness of pain control, expectations of pain level, perception of level of involvement in decisions among other variables were also explored. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to achieve the aim of this study. A convenience sample of 177 Jordanian mothers was used. They were recruited from three primary health-care centres located in Irbid, north of Jordan. Findings of the study indicated that women had a more painful labour than they expected, they were scared of the experience of labour, they went through different procedures during labour including induction and episiotomy, and perceived that they had an intense childbirth experience. The majority of participants reported that they were not satisfied with the different aspects of the childbirth experience and perceived that they had little control during childbirth. These findings should be considered by all health-care providers, hospital administrators and policy-makers to plan and implement appropriate strategies that could help women go through the childbirth experience with less fear and anxiety and empowered with coping mechanisms that could reduce their dissatisfaction with their childbirth experience and to help them regain more control during childbirth. Such strategies might include reconsidering staffing in the maternity units and patient nurse or midwife ratio.

Local controlled release of VEGF and PDGF from a combined brushite-chitosan system enhances bone regeneration. The two growth factors VEGF and PDGF are involved in the process of bone regeneration. For this reason, we developed a brushite-chitosan system which controls the release kinetics of incorporated VEGF and PDGF to enhance bone healing. PDGF (250 ng) was incorporated in the liquid phase. Alginate microsphere-encapsulated VEGF (350 ng) was pre-included in small cylindrical chitosan sponges. VEGF and PDGF release kinetics and tissue distribution were determined using iodinated ((125)I) growth factor. In vivo, PDGF was more rapidly delivered from these systems implanted in rabbit femurs than VEGF. 80% of PDGF was released by the end of two weeks while only 70% of VEGF was delivered after a period of three weeks. Both GFs released from the brushite-chitosan constructs remained located around the implantation site (5 cm) with negligible systemic exposure. A PDGF bone peak concentration of approximately 5 ng/g was achieved on the 4th day. Thereafter, PDGF concentrations stayed higher than 2 ng/g during the first week. These scaffolds also provided a local VEGF bone concentration above 3 ng/g during a total of 4weeks, with a peak concentration of 5.5 ng/g on the 7th day. The present work demonstrates that our brushite-chitosan system is capable of controlling the release rate and localization of both GFs within a bone defect. The effect on bone formation was considerably enhanced with PDGF loaded brushite-chitosan scaffolds as well as with the PDGF/VEGF combination.

Rivaroxaban versus high dose nadroparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty. Deep-vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism are major complications in total joint arthroplasty of the lower limbs. New oral anticoagulants are increasingly prescribed as thromboprophylaxis due to their simple administration and encouraging phase III marketing studies. In this observational study, we compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with nadroparin in 1302 unselected patients receiving hip or knee arthroplasty. Venous thrombembolism occurred in 3.3% (2.3%; 4.7%, 95% CI, n = 838) of patients receiving rivaroxaban and in 4.3% (2.7%; 6.7%, 95% CI, n = 464) of patients receiving nadroparin resulting in an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.0% (-1.4%; 3.3%, 95% CI). With an odds ratio of 0.6 (0.4; 1.0, 95% CI), rivaroxaban was associated with a decreased perioperative drop in haemoglobin exhibiting an improved thromboprophylactic profile when compared to high dose nadroparin. Furthermore, transfusion rates were 8.8% (-2.7%; 19.9%, 95% CI) lower in patients receiving rivaroxaban. However, as previous studies have shown, low preoperative haemoglobin remains the most predictive factor for postoperative transfusions (OR: 2.4 [1.3; 4.4, 95% CI]).

Beyond profiling: using ADMET models to guide decisions. ADMET Models, whether in silico or in vitro, are commonly used to 'profile' molecules, to identify potential liabilities or filter out molecules expected to have undesirable properties. While useful, this is the most basic application of such models. Here, we will show how models may be used to go 'beyond profiling' to guide key decisions in drug discovery. For example, selection of chemical series to focus resources with confidence or design of improved molecules targeting structural modifications to improve key properties. To prioritise molecules and chemical series, the success criteria for properties and their relative importance to a project's objective must be defined. Data from models (experimental or predicted) may then be used to assess each molecule's balance of properties against those requirements. However, to make decisions with confidence, the uncertainties in all of the data must also be considered. In silico models encode information regarding the relationship between molecular structure and properties. This is used to predict the property value of a novel molecule. However, further interpretation can yield information on the contributions of different groups in a molecule to the property and the sensitivity of the property to structural changes. Visualising this information can guide the redesign process. In this article, we describe methods to achieve these goals and drive drug-discovery decisions and illustrate the results with practical examples.

Detection of Huanglongbing (citrus greening) disease by nucleic acid spot hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with primers specific to the rDNA region successfully amplified the 1160-bp DNA fragment from a Huanglongbing (HLB)-infected sweet orange sample with mottling symptoms leaves, but not from healthy sweet orange plants. The PCR product of 1160-bp was used as probe labeled with biotin for detection of the HLB pathogen in the nucleic acid spot hybridization (NASH) test. It was found that the HLB pathogen could be detected up to 1:100 dilution in HLB-infected tissue. Total DNA extracted from HLB-infected tissue was diluted 2-fold as 900 ng in TE buffer and spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Strong signals were observed up to 225 ng of DNA dilution, whereas a moderate signal was recorded at 112 ng. No hybridization signal was observed in the healthy samples, while strong signals were observed in the positive control.

[A preliminary study on the preparation of perfusion-decellularized laryngeal scaffold and the feasibility of laryngeal muscle reconstruction]. To prepare a decellularized whole laryngeal scaffold by utilizing a perfusion-decellularized technique, reseed cells on it, and construct decellularized laryngeal muscles. Perfusion decellularized larynxes were obtained by common carotid arterious perfusion with detergents. Then they were performed by macroscopic view, histological examination, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cartilage viability. Decellularized laryngeal scaffold were then reseeded with inducted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Composites were transferred into greater omentums of rabbits after one day's adherence and harvested after eight weeks. Macroscopic view, histological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed. Perfusion larynxes became transparent after two hours. Histology and SEM indicated that perfusion method showed better decullularized effect. More vintages and collagen fibers but no intact cell or nuclei were retained in the decellularized matrix. Porosity measured by Image pro plus 6.0 was 80.4% +/- 3.2% (x +/- s). Chondrocyte vitality assay indicated chondrocyte vitality rate in the perfusion group was 86.9% +/- 1.5%. After eight weeks, vascularization formed and integrated cartilage frameworks still remained. Histological examination could clearly show the presence of muscle bundles and vessels. Immunohistochemical examination indicated that sarcomeric-alpha actin expressed positively in corresponding areas. It is feasible to reseed MSCs into the decellularized laryngeal muscle matrix for constructing tissue-engineered laryngeal muscles. This in vivo maturation into the omentum could be the first step before in situ implantation of the construct.

Experimental and theoretical assessment of maximum productivities for the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in two different geometries of photobioreactors. The validity of a simple, reliable, and useful recently published formula enabling to calculate the maximum volumetric biomass productivities in photobioreactors (PBRs) was investigated through the cultivation of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Experimental maximum kinetic performances accurately obtained in two different, artificially lightened torus-plane and cylindrical reactors having the same specific illuminated area confirmed the availability, power, and robustness of such formula. The predictive kinetic parameters previously proposed and validated with cyanobacteria were then proved general and robust in case of eukaryotic microalgae, as postulated in the founding article. In this case, an additional criterion requiring rigorous control of the working illuminated fraction gamma = 1 +/- (15%) inside the reactor is demonstrated. For this, the usefulness and reliability of a generalized two-flux model accurately describing the radiation field inside turbid culture media of C. reinhardtii were also established in this article. These important results contribute to identify the main engineering factors governing light-limited PBRs functioning and then to clarify some misinterpretations widely reported in the literature. Together with the referenced previous work, this article gives a framework toward optimal conception of PBRs on a strong physical basis.

Visual gate for brain-computer interfaces. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on event related potentials (ERP) have been successfully developed for applications like virtual spellers and navigation systems. This study tests the use of visual stimuli unbalanced in the subject's field of view to simultaneously cue mental imagery tasks (left vs. right hand movement) and detect subject attention. The responses to unbalanced cues were compared with the responses to balanced cues in terms of classification accuracy. Subject specific ERP spatial filters were calculated for optimal group separation. The unbalanced cues appear to enhance early ERPs related to cue visuospatial processing that improved the classification accuracy (as low as 6%) of ERPs in response to left vs. right cues soon (150-200 ms) after the cue presentation. This work suggests that such visual interface may be of interest in BCI applications as a gate mechanism for attention estimation and validation of control decisions.

Comparison between voxelized, volumized and analytical phantoms applied to radiotherapy simulation with Monte Carlo. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparison between the different methods utilized for building up anthropomorphic phantoms in Radiotherapy Treatment Plans. A simplified model of the Snyder Head Phantom was used in order to construct an analytical, voxelized and volumized phantom, throughout a segmentation program and different algorithms programmed in Matlab code. The irradiation of the resulting phantoms was simulated with the MCNP5 (Monte Carlo N-Particle) transport code, version 5, and the calculations presented in particle flux maps inside the phantoms by utilizing the FMESH tool, superimposed mesh tally. The different variables involved in the simulation were analyzed, like particle flux, MCNP standard deviation and real simulation CPU time cost. In the end the volumized model resulted to have the largest computer time cost and bigger discrepancies in the particle flux distribution.

Earworms (stuck song syndrome): towards a natural history of intrusive thoughts. Two studies examine the experience of 'earworms', unwanted catchy tunes that repeat. Survey data show that the experience is widespread but earworms are not generally considered problematic, although those who consider music to be important to them report earworms as longer, and harder to control, than those who consider music as less important. The tunes which produce these experiences vary considerably between individuals but are always familiar to those who experience them. A diary study confirms these findings and also indicates that, although earworm recurrence is relatively uncommon and unlikely to persist for longer than 24 h, the length of both the earworm and the earworm experience frequently exceed standard estimates of auditory memory capacity. Active attempts to block or eliminate the earworm are less successful than passive acceptance, consistent with Wegner's theory of ironic mental control.

Landing Error Scoring System Differences Between Single-Sport and Multi-Sport Female High School-Aged Athletes. Single-sport specialization (SSS) is becoming more prevalent in youth athletes. Deficits in functional movement have been shown to predispose athletes to injury. It is unclear whether a link exists between SSS and the development of functional movement deficits that predispose SSS athletes to an increased risk of knee injury. To determine whether functional movement deficits exist in SSS athletes compared with multi-sport (M-S) athletes. Cross-sectional study. Soccer practice fields. A total of 40 (21 SSS [age = 15.05 ± 1.2 years], 19 M-S [age = 15.32 ± 1.2 years]) female high school athlete volunteers were recruited through local soccer clubs. All SSS athletes played soccer. Participants were grouped into 2 categories: SSS and M-S. All participants completed 3 trials of the standard Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) jump-landing task. They performed a double-legged jump from a 30-cm platform, landing on a rubber mat at a distance of half their body height. Upon landing, participants immediately performed a maximal vertical jump. Values were assigned to each trial using the LESS scoring criteria. We averaged the 3 scored trials and then used a Mann-Whitney U test to test for differences between groups. Participant scores from the jump-landing assessment for each group were also placed into the 4 defined LESS categories for group comparison using a Pearson χ(2) test. The α level was set a priori at .05. Mean scores were 6.84 ± 1.81 for the SSS group and 6.07 ± 1.93 for the M-S group. We observed no differences between groups (z = -1.44, P = .15). A Pearson χ(2) analysis revealed that the proportions of athletes classified as having excellent, good, moderate, or poor LESS scores were not different between the SSS and M-S groups ([Formula: see text] = 1.999, P = .57). Participation in soccer alone compared with multiple sports did not affect LESS scores in adolescent female soccer players. However, the LESS scores indicated that most female adolescent athletes may be at an increased risk for knee injury, regardless of the number of sports played.

Multi centric origin of Hb D-Punjab [beta121(GH4)Glu-->Gln, GAA>CAA]. Hb D-Punjab [beta121(GH4)Glu-->Gln, GAA>CAA], common in the northern Indian province, is often unexpectedly found in other populations. To study the multi centric origin of this variant which is causing sickle cell disease in association with Hb S [beta6(A3)Glu-->Val, GAG>GTG], we have examined the haplotype of the Hb D allele in different populations. We studied 43 alleles from south Iran (Hormozgan and Fars provinces) and 14 from Holland and Belgium using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis, direct sequencing and/or restriction enzyme analysis. In Iranians, four haplotypes were observed at different frequencies: haplotype I [+ - - - -,+ +] at 67.5%, subhaplotype I' [+ - - - -,- +] at 17.5%, haplotype V [- + - - +,+ +] at 10.0% and haplotype III [- + - + +,+ +] at 5.0%. All European cases were on haplotype I. The occurrence of high Hb D frequencies on a single haplotype in specific regions can be expected if we consider founder effect and genetic drift mechanisms. However, considering that haplotype I is the most common haplotype worldwide, that Hb D-Punjab is reported in different populations on different haplotypes, and that codon beta121 is a site on which six different mutations are reported, we may expect to observe Hb D-Punjab in different populations, possibly because of a relatively higher occurrence of de novo mutations, generating unexpected risk from mixtures of allochtonous Hb S and indigenous Hb D-Punjab or vice versa.

Formulation and characterization of echogenic lipid-Pluronic nanobubbles. The advent of microbubble contrast agents has enhanced the capabilities of ultrasound as a medical imaging modality and stimulated innovative strategies for ultrasound-mediated drug and gene delivery. While the utilization of microbubbles as carrier vehicles has shown encouraging results in cancer therapy, their applicability has been limited by a large size which typically confines them to the vasculature. To enhance their multifunctional contrast and delivery capacity, it is critical to reduce bubble size to the nanometer range without reducing echogenicity. In this work, we present a novel strategy for formulation of nanosized, echogenic lipid bubbles by incorporating the surfactant Pluronic, a triblock copolymer of ethylene oxide copropylene oxide coethylene oxide into the formulation. Five Pluronics (L31, L61, L81, L64 and P85) with a range of molecular weights (M(w): 1100 to 4600 Da) were incorporated into the lipid shell either before or after lipid film hydration and before addition of perfluorocarbon gas. Results demonstrate that Pluronic-lipid interactions lead to a significantly reduced bubble size. Among the tested formulations, bubbles made with Pluronic L61 were the smallest with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 207.9 +/- 74.7 nm compared to the 880.9 +/- 127.6 nm control bubbles. Pluronic L81 also significantly reduced bubble size to 406.8 +/- 21.0 nm. We conclude that Pluronic is effective in lipid bubble size control, and Pluronic M(w), hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), and Pluronic/lipid ratio are critical determinants of the bubble size. Most importantly, our results have shown that although the bubbles are nanosized, their stability and in vitro and in vivo echogenicity are not compromised. The resulting nanobubbles may be better suited for contrast enhanced tumor imaging and subsequent therapeutic delivery.

Repeated cocaine administration increases nitric oxide efflux in the rat dorsal striatum. Repeated injections of cocaine alter extracellular nitric oxide (NO) efflux via interactions between dopamine and glutamate receptor-coupled signaling cascades. Putative cellular mechanisms underlying changes in NO efflux following repeated cocaine administration were investigated. Real-time detection of NO efflux using a NO biosensor was mainly performed in the rat dorsal striatum in vivo. Repeated exposure to cocaine (20 mg/kg), once a day for seven consecutive days, increased NO levels. Repeated injections of cocaine also increased the phosphorylation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and inhibition of nNOS decreased the repeated cocaine-evoked increases in NO levels. Inhibition of protein kinase A, but not protein phosphatases, synergistically increased NO levels elevated by repeated cocaine injections. Blockade of dopamine D1 (D1) receptors or stimulation of dopamine D2 (D2) receptors decreased the repeated cocaine-evoked increases in NO levels. Similarly, blockade of N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptors and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) or stimulation of group III mGluRs also decreased the repeated cocaine-evoked increases in NO levels. Stimulation of D1 receptors or group I mGluRs following repeated cocaine administration upregulates NO efflux via an NMDA receptor-evoked Ca2+ influx, while stimulation of D2 receptors or group III mGluRs downregulates NO efflux. Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated nNOS by protein phosphatases is necessary for upregulating NO efflux in the dorsal striatum after repeated cocaine administration.

Overlap of Moebius and oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndrome with gastroschisis and pulmonary hypoplasia. The oromandibular limb hypogenesis syndromes (OLHS) represent a group of rare conditions characterized by congenital malformations involving the tongue, mandible, and limbs. There is considerable overlap between the syndromes gathered under the term OLHS, and a marked variability of face and limb anomalies as well as additional malformations. In this report we describe a girl with gastroschisis and pulmonary hypoplasia in addition to features of Moebius syndrome comprising hypoplasia of the tongue and mandible, brachydactyly of halluces, cranial nerve palsies with bilateral facial paralysis and an inability to execute horizontal eye movements. Karyotyping and array-based comparative genomic hybridization were normal. This observation confirms an overlap between Moebius syndrome and OLHS and widens the spectrum of associated malformations. Intrauterine environmental factors including vascular insufficiency, high maternal fever, and drug abuse are likely to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this condition.

Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor mediates angiogenesis and antiapoptosis in rat aortic endothelial cells. This study explores the angiogenic and antiapoptotic activities of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PDECGF) in rat aortic endothelial cells. The effects of PDECGF on rat aortic endothelial cell (RAEC) proliferation, migration, chemotaxis, and tubule formation were investigated in vitro at various concentrations viz., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 ng x mL(-1) on endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were induced with hypoxic stress and the antiapoptotic effects of PDECGF were analysed by cell survival assay, fluorescence microscopy, cell viability assay, and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated the angiogenic potential of PDECGF on endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDECGF at 16 and 32 ng x mL(-1) increased cell proliferation (>80%), induced cell migration (>4 fold), stimulated chemotaxis (>2 fold), and increased tubule formation (>3 fold) compared with the control. Studies on hypoxic stress revealed the antiapoptotic nature of PDECGF on endothelial cells. PDECGF treatment enhanced cell survival by 14%, as well as cell viability by 13%, and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells by 13% as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter studies (FACS). In conclusion, this study demonstrated the angiogenic and antiapoptotic potentials of PDECGF on RAEC.

6-methoxypodophyllotoxin-7-O-n-hexanoate, a new aryltetralin lignan ester from seeds of Linum flavum. A new aryltetralin-type lignan, 6-methoxypodophyllotoxin-7- O-n-hexanoate, was isolated from the seeds of Linum flavum L. var. compactum (Linaceae) by silica gel column chromatography of the dichloromethane extract. This lignan, previously detected by our group in the aerial parts of several Linum species by HPLC-MS, has now been isolated for the first time, and its structure is now confirmed and fully characterized by assignment of all NMR data as well as the CD spectrum. The occurrence of aryltetralin lignans, which are well known in the case of aerial parts and roots, in the seeds of a Linum species has not been reported before.

Minireview: Estrogenic protection of beta-cell failure in metabolic diseases. The prevalence of diabetes is lower in premenopausal women, especially diabetic syndromes with insulin deficiency, suggesting that the female hormone 17beta-estradiol protects pancreatic beta-cell function. In classical rodent models of beta-cell failure, 17beta-estradiol at physiological concentrations protects pancreatic beta-cells against lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. In this review, we integrate evidence showing that estrogens and their receptors have direct effects on islet biology. The estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER beta, and the G-protein coupled ER are present in beta-cells and enhance islet survival. They also improve islet lipid homeostasis and insulin biosynthesis. We also discuss evidence that ERs modulate insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, which indirectly alter beta-cell biology in diabetic and obese conditions.

Mucosal vaccination by the intranasal route. Nose-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT)-Structure, function and species differences. The advantage of mucosal vaccination in viral and bacterial infections in different age groups is of enormous clinical relevance. The advantages and potential hazards of intranasal vaccination have always to be considered. The intranasal route for vaccination is very successful for some antigens. Specific adjuvants are necessary. In the nose of rodents there is a structured lymphoid tissue (nose-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT)). This abbreviation should not be used for nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, as this includes parts of the tonsils. In children lymphoid tissue is more dispersed in the nose and not concentrated at the bottom of the dorsal nose ducts as in rodents. There are no data on organized lymphoid tissue in the nose of adults. In NALT of rodents there is a unique structure of adhesion molecule expression; the postnatal development and the different composition of T and B lymphocytes in comparison with Peyer's patches document the uniqueness of this lymphoid organ. There is also a mucosa in the nose with antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, it is often unclear whether intranasal vaccination is initiated via NALT or the diffuse nasal mucosa. There are still many open questions e. g., which adjuvant is necessary for a specific virus, bacterium or other allergen, how many doses are critical for an effective nasal vaccination. Species differences are of major importance when extrapolating results from rodents to humans. 

Relationship between A-line Autoregressive Index, Spectral Entropy and steady state predicted site-effect effective concentrations at 05-50-95 of propofol at different clinical endpoints. Target controlled infusion intravenous anesthesia is a growing phenomenon. Nowadays, many anesthesiologists feel the need to monitor depth of anesthesia during total intravenous anesthesia, even though it is not a standard technique worldwide. Spectral Entropy (SE) is a relatively new depth of anesthesia index. The aim of this study was to investigate whether predicted site-effect propofol concentrations, A-line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and SE values are useful for predicting loss of verbal contact (LVC) and loss of consciousness (LOC) during steady-state conditions. Forty-four patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery were recruited. All patients were unpremedicated. A target controlled infusion of propofol was administered using Schnider's pharmacokinetic model. The initial propofol infusion provided a site-effect concentration of 1.0 mcg mL-1, and was increased stepwise by 1.0 mcg mL-1 every 4 minutes until the concentration reached 6.0 mcg mL-1. A 4 minute interval was chosen to assure that steady state site-effect concentrations were obtained. AAI, SE and propofol site-effect concentrations were recorded when LVC occurred and also when LOC occurred. Population values for predicted site-effect concentrations at the clinical endpoints were estimated and correlated with AAI and SE values. In our study for LOC the effect-site concentration to include 90% of patients was 5.85 ?mcg mL-1 (5.70-5.90) and 3.4 mcg mL-1 (3.24-3.60) for LVC. In this study, 90% of patients lost verbal contact at an AAI value of 68 (64.6-71.4) and an SE value of 68.2 (66.2-70.2). LOC occurred in 90% of patients at an AAI value of 39.2 (37.2-41.1) and an SE value of 40.2 (38.1-41.3). LOC and LVC occur within a defined range of predicted site-effect concentrations. More emphasis should be given to site-effect concentrations. SE and AAI have similar values at different endpoints and similar correlation with Ceprop. AAI and SE are both useful tools in predicting both LVC and LOC.

Newborn hearing screening in a developing country: results of a pilot study in Abidjan, Côte d'ivoire. To investigate the feasibility of neonatal hearing impairment in newborn babies in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. It is a cross-sectional study in which all infants aged from 3 to 28 days, attending for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization in primary care centers or hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), between July 2007 and March 2008, were included. Screening followed a two-stage strategy with transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). Infants referred after the second-stage screening were scheduled for diagnostic evaluation by diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR). The variables analyzed were: screening coverage, referral rates; return rates for second-stage screening and diagnostic evaluation, incidence of permanent hearing loss and age at diagnosis. 1306 newborns, of a total of 1495, were successfully screened, giving a screening coverage of 87.4%. The average age was 4.5 days (S.D.: 2.7), with 5.85 days (S.D.: 3.17) for the immunization group and 3.20 days (S.D.: 0.40) for the neonatal unit group. In total, 286 out of the 1306 infants (21.9%) were referred after the first-stage screening; out of which 193 (67.5%) return for the second stage. After the second-stage screening, 48 (16.8%) were scheduled for diagnostic evaluation (45 from NICU and 3 from primary care centers). The overall referral rate for diagnostic evaluation was 3.7% (48/1306). Only 18.75% of those referred (9/48) returned for evaluation, and seven of them (77.8%) were confirmed with hearing loss (2 from immunization group and 5 from neonatal unit group). The prevalence of permanent hearing loss in this screened population was 5.96 per 1000 (7/1174 babies who completed the screening) [95% I.C.: 5.62-6.30 per 1000]. The mean age at diagnosis was 22 weeks (S.D.: 8.3). The reasons for non-completed screening were, according to 62 mothers: no financial means, absence of hearing loss, fear of spouse reactions, lack of information about this test and deafness. The incidence of permanent and early hearing impairment identified by this screening program was about 6 per 1000. Routine hearing screening of infants for the early detection of hearing loss is necessary in Côte d'Ivoire. It is possible to implement such a hearing screening, targeting all newborns, in primary health care centers and neonatal intensive care units.

Rapamycin versus methotrexate in early diffuse systemic sclerosis: results from a randomized, single-blind pilot study. To assess the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in the treatment of diffuse systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). Eighteen patients with diffuse SSc of <or=5 years duration were randomized to receive rapamycin or methotrexate (MTX) in a single-blind, 48-week study. Abnormalities in clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the 2 treatment groups. The potential efficacy of the study drugs was evaluated by comparing results of the baseline and 48-week assessments, including the modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index. The baseline characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups (n=9 in each). One patient in the rapamycin group who never received the study drug was excluded from the analysis. Three patients in each group withdrew from the study; 2 of the withdrawals were treatment-related (severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with rapamycin, and pancytopenia associated with MTX), and 4 were SSc-related. Hypertriglyceridemia was the most notable side effect associated with rapamycin, but it was generally well tolerated and treatable. The incidence and severity of other adverse drug reactions were comparable between the 2 groups. Within each group, the MRSS improved significantly from baseline. In the rapamycin group, the patient's global assessment showed a significant improvement from baseline, while forced vital capacity values declined from baseline. The disease activity scores at 48 weeks and the changes in these scores from baseline were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Rapamycin has a reasonable safety profile in a select group of patients with scleroderma. Larger trials are needed to assess the efficacy of rapamycin in patients with early diffuse SSc.

The effect of salt on renal damage in eNOS-deficient mice. African Americans have an increased incidence of end-stage renal disease and are characterized as having reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide and salt-sensitivity. We propose that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout mice (eNOS(-/-)) are a suitable model of hypertension-associated renal injury as seen in African Americans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether older eNOS(-/-) mice have hypertension-associated renal injury and if dietary salt modulates this injury. Six-month-old eNOS(-/-) mice were placed on 0.12%, 0.45% or 8% NaCl diet for 8 weeks and blood pressure measured weekly; kidneys were collected for pathology evaluation and scoring at the end of the 8-week period. Mice deficient of eNOS were hypertensive at baseline compared with control mice in all three groups (128+/-3 vs. 112+/-3, P<0.05). Blood pressure was significantly elevated from baseline in eNOS(-/-) on 0.45 and 8% salt diets (P<0.02). The composite renal pathology scores for eNOS(-/-) mice were significantly greater than wild-type mice, indicating high salt intake exacerbates the injury (P<0.001 vs. normal salt diet). eNOS(-/-) mice may be used as a model of salt-induced and hypertension-associated renal injury as seen in African Americans.

Radiation therapy for early stage (I/II) non-small cell lung cancer. For patients with early (stage I/II) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgery is considered as the standard treatment of choice, although recent data on additional chemotherapy (CHT) showed that it may be beneficial in this setting. There is, however, a subset of patients that never undergo surgery. These patients are considered technically operable, but medically inoperable, due to existing comorbidities. In addition, frequently elderly patients with early NSCLC are denied surgery due to expected peri- and/or postoperative complications. Finally, in recent years there has been an increase in the incidence of patients refusing surgery. For all these patients, radiation therapy (RT) was traditionally considered as the standard treatment option. Data accumulated over the last 5 decades showed that RT alone can produce median survival times of up to > 30 months and 5-year survival of up to 30%. When cancer-unrelated deaths were taken into account, cause-specific survival rates were usually higher for some 10-15%. Accumulated experience seems to suggest that doses of at least 65 Gy with standard fractionation or its equivalent when altered fractionation is used are necessary for control of the disease. Smaller tumors seem to have favorable prognosis, while the issue of elective nodal RT continues to be controversial. Patterns of failure have clearly identified local failure as the predominant one. Although a number of potential pretreatment patient- and tumor-related prognostic factors have been examined, none has been shown to clearly influenced survival. Toxicity was usually low.

Invasive fungal infections in the ICU. Invasive fungal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Foremost among these is invasive candidiasis. In recent years, invasive aspergillosis (IA) and zygomycosis have emerged as major problems in susceptible, critically ill patients. Risk factors for invasive fungal infections, including disrupted anatomic barriers, suppressed antifungal host responses, and exposure to potentially opportunistic fungi are common in critically ill patients. The expanded antifungal armamentarium and advent of rapid diagnostic techniques are altering the approach to invasive fungal infections in the intensive care unit (ICU). Herein, we review recent developments in the field of antifungal host defenses, the changing epidemiology of fungal infections in the ICU, the pharmacology of antifungal agents of importance to critically ill patients, and the evolving approaches to therapy in this setting.

A recombinant adenovirus type 35 fiber knob protein sensitizes lymphoma cells to rituximab therapy. Many tumors, including lymphomas, up-regulate expression of CD46 to escape destruction by complement. Tumor cells are therefore relatively resistant to therapy by monoclonal antibodies, which act through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). From an Escherichia coli expression library of adenovirus type 35 fiber knob mutants, we selected a variant (Ad35K(++)) that had a higher affinity to CD46 than did the natural Ad35 fiber knob. We demonstrated that incubation of lymphoma cells with recombinant Ad35K(++) protein resulted in transient removal of CD46 from the cell surface. Preincubation of lymphoma cells with Ad35K(++) sensitized cells to CDC, triggered by the CD20-specific monoclonal antibody rituximab. In xenograft models with human lymphoma cells, preinjection of Ad35K(++) dramatically increased the therapeutic effect of rituximab. Blood cell counts and organ histology were normal after intravenous injection of Ad35K(++) into mice that express human CD46. The presence of polyclonal anti-Ad35K(++) antibodies did not affect the ability of Ad35K(++) to enhance rituximab-mediated CDC in in vitro assays. The Ad35K(++)-based approach has potential implications in monoclonal antibody therapy of malignancies beyond the combination with rituximab.


Efficacy of a 6-month versus 9-month intermittent treatment regimen in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis: a randomized clinical trial.

Intergenotypic replacement of lyssavirus matrix proteins demonstrates the role of lyssavirus M proteins in intracellular virus accumulation. Lyssavirus assembly depends on the matrix protein (M). We compared lyssavirus M proteins from different genotypes for their ability to support assembly and egress of genotype 1 rabies virus (RABV). Transcomplementation of M-deficient RABV with M from European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) types 1 and 2 reduced the release of infectious virus. Stable introduction of the heterogenotypic M proteins into RABV led to chimeric viruses with reduced virus release and intracellular accumulation of virus genomes. Although the chimeras indicated genotype-specific evolution of M, rapid selection of a compensatory mutant suggested conserved mechanisms of lyssavirus assembly and the requirement for only few adaptive mutations to fit the heterogenotypic M to a RABV backbone. Whereas the compensatory mutant replicated to similar infectious titers as RABV M-expressing virus, ultrastructural analysis revealed that both nonadapted EBLV M chimeras and the compensatory mutant differed from RABV M expressing viruses in the lack of intracellular viruslike structures that are enveloped and accumulate in cisterna of the degranulated and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Moreover, all viruses were able to bud at the plasma membrane. Since the lack of the intracellular viruslike structures correlated with the type of M protein but not with the efficiency of virus release, we hypothesize that the M proteins of EBLV-1 and RABV differ in their target membranes for virus assembly. Although the biological function of intracellular assembly and accumulation of viruslike structures in the endoplasmic reticulum remain unclear, the observed differences could contribute to diverse host tropism or pathogenicity.

A novel rearrangement in the mitochondrial genome of tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis: control region translocation and a tRNA gene inversion. The organization of fish mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) is quite conserved, usually with the heavy strand encoding 12 of 13 protein-coding genes and 14 of 22 tRNA genes, and the light strand encoding ND6 and the remaining 8 tRNA genes. Currently, there are only a few reports on gene reorganization of fish mitogenomes, with only two types of rearrangements (shuffling and translocation) observed. No gene inversion has been detected in approximately 420 complete fish mitogenomes available so far. Here we report a novel rearrangement in the mitogenome of Cynoglossus semilaevis (Cynoglossinae, Cynoglossidae, Pleuronectiformes). The genome is 16,371 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 2 main noncoding regions, the putative control region and the light-strand replication origin. A striking finding of this study is that the tRNA(Gln) gene is translocated from the light to the heavy strand (Q inversion). This is accompanied by shuffling of the tRNA(Ile) gene and long-range translocation of the putative control region downstream to a site between ND1 and the tRNA(Gln) gene. The remaining gene order is identical to that of typical fish mitogenomes. Additionally, unique characters of this mitogenome, including a high A+T content and length variations of 8 protein-coding genes, were found through comparison of the mitogenome sequence with those from other flatfishes. All the features detected and their relationships with the rearrangements, as well as a possible rearrangement pathway, are discussed. These data provide interesting information for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene reorganization in fish mitogenomes.

Effect of a new liner/base on human dentin permeability. Resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGI) have demonstrated clinical success in their ability to minimize post-operative sensitivity of restorations. RMGIs have been recently introduced as paste-liquid systems for convenience of clinical usage. The objective of this study was to measure the ability of a new paste-liquid RMGI liner/base to reduce fluid flow through human dentin. Dentin permeability was measured on human crown sections on etched dentin, using etched dentin as a model for the exposed tubules typical of root sensitivity, and permitting measurement of the maximum permeability. In the one group, the etched dentin was coated with the RMGI, and pre- and post-treatment permeability was measured on the coated dentin. In the second group, a smear layer was created on the dentin with sandpaper, then the samples were coated with the RMGI; permeability was measured on the smeared and coated dentin. Samples from each group were sectioned and examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The new paste-liquid RMGI liner/base significantly reduced fluid flow through dentin, and exhibited excellent seal on dentin with either a smear layer or open tubules. SEM images show evidence that the RMGI infiltrated the smear layer with resin during placement, penetrated dentin tubules, and formed resin tags in acid-etched dentin. Based on these results, combined with previous research on adhesion and microleakage, it is concluded that the new RMGI liner/base should minimize post-operative sensitivity in restorations.

Dysregulation of platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor expression by DeltaNp73 in neuroblastoma. We have previously characterized how p53 family proteins control the transcriptional regulation of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGFRB) and found that DeltaNp73alpha, acting dominant-negatively to p53 and p73, can upregulate PDGFRB promoter activity. Here, we report that PDGFRB regulation differs between two neuroblastoma cell lines, correlating with the actions of DeltaNp73. We found that PDGFRB was highly expressed in IMR-32 cells, and serum stimulation of IMR-32 cells did not downregulate PDGFRB expression, as seen in SH-SY5Y cells. In IMR-32, DeltaNp73 was found constitutively bound to the PDGFRB promoter, and silencing of DeltaNp73 resulted in repression of PDGFRB promoter activity as well as decreased PDGFRB protein expression. However, the anticancer drug cisplatin, known to stabilize and activate p53 and p73, downregulated PDGFRB expression not only in SH-SY5Y but also in IMR-32. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that cisplatin removed DeltaNp73 from the PDGFRB promoter and recruited p53 and p73, leading to binding of histone deacetylase 4. These results suggest a direct role of DeltaNp73 in the constantly enhanced PDGFRB expression seen in tumors.

[Pyogenic arthritis of sacroiliac joint in children]. Pyogenic infection of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is very rare in children. It is the result of haematogenous spread primarily affecting the joint. The process is usually monoarticular. By rule, sequestra are rarely formed, there are no greater bone destructions, but there is usually early bone sclerosing. Due to the pain in the lumbosacral area spreading down the right leg and positive Lazarevic's sign, a 13-year-old boy was referred to a neuropaediatrician. He was suffering from lumbosciatica. In the first three sick days, laboratory tests were done as well as X-ray examination. High febrility and laboratory results indicated the existence of infection of unknown localisation. Diagnostic examination: radiography of the lungs and heart, computerized tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultrasound (US) of hips and painful sacroiliac area and US of abdomen could not localise the infection. Radiography of SIJ (Barschoni) focused the attention on SIJ). Scintigraphy of the skeleton with 99mTc-DPD pointed to the intensified collection of radiopharmaceuticals in the area around SIJ. Localised changes, erythema and signs of abscess in the projection of SIJ appeared the fifth day since the appearance of the disease. Incision was performed as well as evacuation of purulent content, and bacterial analysis isolated Staphylococcus aureus. Therapy with antibiotics was applied according to the antibiogram three weeks parenterally (intravenously) and two weeks per os. After five weeks, clinical and laboratory results were normal. The patient has been monitored for eight months since the appearance of the disease. Conclusion In children with symptoms and signs of lumbosciatica, among other things, attention should be paid, differentially and diagnostically speaking, to pyogenic infection of SIJ. The skeletal scintigraphy helps early diagnosis of pyogenic infection of SIJ, when localised clinical signs have not been formed yet. In our patient, the infection was caused by localised spreading from a skin abrasion.

Relation of lung function and current inhalant allergen-specific immunoglobulin E concentrations in adolescents (GINIplus cohort). The prevalence of allergen sensitization reaches up to 46.6% in 14- to 17-year-old German adolescents. Polysensitization is strongly associated with a higher risk of allergic rhinitis or asthma. Whether or how sensitization also is related to lung function remains uncertain. To assess whether sensitization to common inhalant allergens is associated with lung function in adolescents after stratification by allergic respiratory disease. In total, 1,719 15-year-old participants of the German Infant Study on the Influence of Nutrition Intervention plus Air Pollution and Genetics on Allergy Development (GINIplus) birth cohort provided valid spirometric indices, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate at 25% to 75% of the FVC, and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) screening test to 8 inhalant allergens (ImmunoCAP). Complete information on allergic rhinitis and asthma status was available for 1,128 subjects. Associations between lung function parameters and sensitization, classified into 4 groups (no sensitization to polysensitization) were analyzed using adjusted linear regression models. Among participants, 21.1% (n = 347) had allergic rhinitis, 10.1% (n = 119) had asthma, and 46.4% (n = 798) had a positive screening test to inhalant allergens. Prevalences were consistently higher in boys. The percentage of subjects with rhinitis or asthma increased from 5.8% in non-sensitized subjects (n = 620) to 69.4% in polysensitized subjects (n = 144). Sensitization was not associated with any spirometric parameter considered in subjects with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or neither disease. Although allergen-specific IgE concentrations can contribute to the identification of subjects at higher risk for allergic rhinitis and asthma, sensitization to inhalant allergens is not related to impaired spirometric lung parameters within the different allergic respiratory disease subgroups.

Adrenergic Repression of the Epigenetic Reader MeCP2 Facilitates Cardiac Adaptation in Chronic Heart Failure. In chronic heart failure, increased adrenergic activation contributes to structural remodeling and altered gene expression. Although adrenergic signaling alters histone modifications, it is unknown, whether it also affects other epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation and its recognition. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism of regulation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and its functional significance during cardiac pressure overload and unloading. MeCP2 was identified as a reversibly repressed gene in mouse hearts after transverse aortic constriction and was normalized after removal of the constriction. Similarly, MeCP2 repression in human failing hearts resolved after unloading by a left ventricular assist device. The cluster miR-212/132 was upregulated after transverse aortic constriction or on activation of α1- and β1-adrenoceptors and miR-212/132 led to repression of MeCP2. Prevention of MeCP2 repression by a cardiomyocyte-specific, doxycycline-regulatable transgenic mouse model aggravated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction after transverse aortic constriction. Ablation of MeCP2 in cardiomyocytes facilitated recovery of failing hearts after reversible transverse aortic constriction. Genome-wide expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and DNA methylation analysis identified mitochondrial genes and their transcriptional regulators as MeCP2 target genes. Coincident with its repression, MeCP2 was removed from its target genes, whereas DNA methylation of MeCP2 target genes remained stable during pressure overload. These data connect adrenergic activation with a microRNA-MeCP2 epigenetic pathway that is important for cardiac adaptation during the development and recovery from heart failure.

Angiogenesis: an update and potential drug approaches (review). The therapeutic potential of targeting tumor endothelium and vascular supply is now widely recognized to treat different diseases. One such disease is cancer; where endothelial cells are actively proliferating to support the tumor growth. Solid tumors cannot grow beyond the size of a few millimeters without inducing the proliferation of endothelium and formation of new blood vessels. Hence it is crucial to search for new agents that selectively block tumor blood supply. These include anti-angiogenic molecules, vascular disrupting agents or endothelial disrupting agents. The anti-angiogenic molecules such as monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors disrupt endothelial cell survival mechanisms and new blood vessel formation, and vascular disrupting agents for instance ligand-directed and small molecules can be used to disrupt the already existing abnormal vasculature that support tumors by targeting their dysmorphic endothelial cells. The recent advances in this area of research have identified a variety of investigational agents which are currently in clinical development at various stages and some of these candidates are already approved in cancer treatment. This report will review some of the recent developments and most significant advances in this field and outline future challenges and directions.

Escherichia coli of sequence type 3835 carrying bla NDM-1, bla CTX-M-15, bla CMY-42 and bla SHV-12. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) represents a serious challenge for treatment and public health. A carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli clinical strain WCHEC13-8 was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, whole genome sequencing and conjugation experiments. It was resistant to imipenem (MIC, >256 μg/ml) and meropenem (MIC, 128 μg/ml) and belonged to ST3835. bla NDM-1 was the only carbapenemase gene detected. Strain WCHEC13-8 also had a plasmid-borne AmpC gene (bla CMY-42) and two extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes (bla CTX-M-15 and bla SHV-12). bla NDM-1 and bla SHV-12 were carried by a 54-kb IncX3 self-transmissible plasmid, which is identical to plasmid pNDM-HF727 from Enterobacter cloacae. bla CMY-42 was carried by a 64-kb IncI1 plasmid and bla CTX-M-15 was located on a 141-kb plasmid with multiple F replicons (replicon type: F36:A4:B1). bla CMY-42 was in a complicated context and the mobilisation of bla CMY-42 was due to the transposition of ISEcp1 by misidentifying its right-end boundary. Genetic context of bla NDM-1 in strain WCHEC13-8 was closely related to those on IncX3 plasmids in various Enterobacteriaceae species in China. In conclusion, a multidrug-resistant ST3835 E. coli clinical strain carrying bla NDM-1, bla CTX-M-15, bla CMY-42 and bla SHV-12 was identified. IncX3 plasmids may be making a significant contribution to the dissemination of bla NDM among Enterobacteriaceae in China.


Effects of pre- and postnatal olfactogustatory experience on early preferences at birth and dietary selection at weaning in kittens.

Low-frequency BOLD fluctuations demonstrate altered thalamocortical connectivity in diabetic neuropathic pain. In this paper we explored thalamocortical functional connectivity in a group of eight patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain (diabetic pain), and compared it with that of a group of healthy subjects. We hypothesized that functional interconnections between the thalamus and cortex can be altered after years of ongoing chronic neuropathic pain. Functional connectivity was studied through a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm: temporal correlations between predefined regions of interest (primary somatosensory cortex, ventral posterior lateral thalamic nucleus, medial dorsal thalamic nucleus) and the rest of the brain were systematically investigated. The patient group showed decreased resting state functional connectivity between the thalamus and the cortex. This supports the idea that chronic pain can alter thalamocortical connections causing a disruption of thalamic feedback, and the view of chronic pain as a thalamocortical dysrhythmia.

Latitudinal differences in the hibernation characteristics of woodchucks (Marmota monax). There is little information on the phenotypic flexibility of hibernation characteristics within species. To address this issue, we observed differences in hibernation characteristics of three free-ranging populations of woodchucks (Marmota monax) distributed along a latitudinal gradient from Maine to South Carolina. Data from free-ranging animals exhibited a direct relationship between latitude and length of the hibernation season. As expected, woodchucks in the northern latitudes hibernated longer than those in the southern latitudes. Also, the length of interbout arousals decreased with increase in latitude, whereas the length of torpor bouts and the number of arousals increased. Thus, we observed phenotypic plasticity in hibernation characteristics based primarily on latitudinal temperature differences in each population. Further analysis revealed a direct relationship between latitude and total time spent in torpor. Maine animals spent 68% more time in torpor than South Carolina animals. However, total time spent euthermic did not differ among the three populations. The "cost-benefit" hypothesis of hibernation may help to explain these results. It assumes that hibernators avoid the physiological stress of torpor by staying euthermic as much as possible. Woodchucks in each population maximized time spent euthermic, utilizing torpor only at the level needed to survive winter hibernation and to commence reproduction in the spring.

[Effect of instrumental blood reinfusion on clinical parameters and morphology of erythrocytes during aortocoronary bypass grafting]. Erythrocytic morphological changes were studied in 48 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) at the stages of coronary artery bypass grafting, in whom intraoperative continuous apparatus (CATS, Fresenius, Germany) reinfusion of lost autoblood was used. The patients with CHD were found to have a significant erythrocytic morphological transformation with the oxygen status compensated by the preserved nonpathological forms of erythrocytes. Intraoperatively stable tissue oxygen delivery and rapid blood loss compensation during coronary artery bypass grafting could be provided by continuous reinfusion of lost autoblood that contained valuable erythrocytes after apparatus elimination of disrupted and degenerative forms.

Active Seattle: achieving walkability in diverse neighborhoods. The Active Living by Design project based in Seattle (Active Seattle) advocated for policies and projects in diverse communities supporting a more walkable city, while using social marketing and education to get more people walking more often. Walking audits were carried out in select diverse neighborhoods, resulting in recommendations for policy change and built-environment improvements. Advocacy for city-scale policies also occurred. Walking maps and other social-marketing products promoted behavior change. Major Safe Routes to School activities occurred and were made possible by separate funding sources. Positive results of Active Seattle included an increase in funding for pedestrian infrastructure, a pedestrian master plan, a Complete Streets policy, substantial increase in Safe Routes to School activity, and institutionalization of active living and active transportation within partner agencies. Challenges included institutional prioritization for improving pedestrian infrastructure, funding inequity, and a community need that was greater than could be fulfilled. Efforts to overcome funding inequities or other resistance to pedestrian-oriented physical projects will benefit from high-visibility campaigns that have a lasting impact on public perception and decision makers' political will. To reach vulnerable populations that have substantial barriers to increasing walking frequency, extensive staff time for outreach is needed. Changing the built environment to encourage walking may be a long-term solution in communities with diverse populations. Influencing and educating local government officials to make active living projects and policies a high budgetary priority is essential for large-scale impact and long-term change.

Demonstration of a congenital urine bladder diverticulum by 99mTc-MDP SPET/CT scan in a female with bone metastases. Urine bladder diverticula are usually asymptomatic, therefore they are incidentally diagnosed during examinations for other purposes. A Chinese patient, with a history of pulmonary adenocarcinoma first underwent a technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate whole-body bone scan. In addition to multiple skeletal metastases, abnormal shape of the urine bladder was also noted, which overlapped the superior ramus of the right pubic bone. In order to: a) better delineate the shape and structure of the urine bladder; b) visualize the pubic bone and c) detect the exact location and structural changes of skeletal lesions in the lumbosacral region, single photon emission tomography/computerized tomography (SPET/CT) scan of this region was performed immediately, and demonstrated: a) a big urine bladder diverticulum in the right hemipelvis; b) structural changes of skeletal metastases while metastases in the pubic bone were ruled out. An overview of the etiology, histopathology, complications, management and imaging of urine bladder diverticulum is also presented. We consider our case the first to be diagnosed by SPET/CT and differentiated from metastases of the overlapping bone in a 69 years old female.

[Successful response of reccurent adult wilms' tumor to multiagent chemotherapy]. We report a case of successful response of lung metastases of reccurent adult Wilms' tumor by multiagent chemotherapy. The patient was a 19-year-old woman who had undergone left radical nephrectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy (actinomycin D, vincristine) for stageadult Wilms' tumor when she was 16 years old. Coputed tomography (CT) revealed multiple lung metastases (right parietal pleura, left S10, right S10). We treated the patient with thoracoscopic partial resection of inferior lobe of lung. Then she received multiagent chemotherapy (vincristine, adriamycin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide). CT scan showed complete response of the lung metastases at 8 months.

Anxious and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease: the French cross-sectionnal DoPaMiP study. Anxiety has been less extensively studied than depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). The DoPaMiP survey allowed assessing simultaneously anxiety and depressive symptoms in PD and comparing correlations of both symptoms with clinical and therapeutic features of the disease. Cross sectional survey conducted prospectively in 450 ambulatory nondemented PD patients and 98 patients with other disorders than PD. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), parkinsonism using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Other clinical factors were measured using a structured standardized examination/questionnaire. The mean HADS-A (anxiety) subscore was higher in PD patients than in the others (8.2 +/- 3.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 3.2, P < 10(-4)) as was the HADS-D (depressive) subscore (6.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 3.9 +/- 3.2, P < 10(-4)). Patients with possible/probable anxious signs (HADS-A >or= 8) were more prevalent in PD (51% vs. 29%, P < 10(-4)) as were those with depressive symptoms (40% vs. 10%, P < 10(-4)). Conversely, anxiolytic and antidepressant medications consumption was not different between the 2 groups. Patients with anxious symptoms were more frequently female and younger than those without such symptoms, while those with depressive symptoms had more severe indices of parkinsonism, more comorbidities and lower cognitive function (Mini Mental State Exam). The logistic regression model revealed that patients with depressive symptoms received more frequently levodopa and less frequently a dopamine agonist. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were more frequent in PD patients than in medical control group. Both symptoms were commonly associated in the same PD patients, but were correlated with different clinical/therapeutic features, suggesting different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

Low muscle mass is associated with chemotherapy-induced haematological toxicity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Recent research suggests a significant relationship between lean body mass (LBM) and toxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. We investigated if higher drug doses per kg LBM were associated with increased toxicity in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a first-line chemotherapy regimen dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Data from patients randomised to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) plus orally vinorelbine 60 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 in a phase III trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were analysed. LBM was estimated from assessment of the cross-sectional muscle area at the third lumbar level (L3) on computed tomography images obtained before chemotherapy commenced. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3-4 haematological toxicity and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment after the first course of chemotherapy were defined as primary and secondary toxicity outcomes. The study sample included 153 patients, mean age was 66 years, 55% were men, 87% had disease stage IV and 75% had performance status (PS) 0-1. Gemcitabine doses per kg LBM varied from 23.2 to 53.1 mg/kg LBM, and vinorelbine doses from 1.5 to 3.3 mg/kg LBM. Higher doses of gemcitabine per kg LBM were significantly associated with grade 3-4 haematological toxicity in bivariate (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23, p=0.008) and multivariate analyses (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.29, p=0.018), as were also higher doses of vinorelbine per kg LBM. No significant association was found between drug doses per kg LBM and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment. The study showed that dose estimates according to BSA lead to a substantial variation in drug dose per kg LBM, and higher doses per kg LBM are a significant predictor for chemotherapy-induced haematological toxicity. The results indicate that taking LBM into account may lead to a better dose individualisation of chemotherapy.

Risk of Sjögren's syndrome in Taiwanese female adults with irregular menstrual cycles: a population-based case-control study. Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a progressive systemic autoimmune disorder with a strong female predominance. Hormonal influences are thought to play a role in the development of pSS. However, no studies have specifically evaluated the association between irregular menstrual cycles and pSS. Therefore, using a health claims database, this study investigated the risk of pSS in women with irregular menstrual cycles. We conducted a case-control study using the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 360 patients diagnosed with pSS (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification, ICD-9-CM code 710.2) between 2001 and 2012 were identified. Controls were frequency-matched at a rate of 5:1 to the cases by five-year age interval and index year. Both cases and controls were retrospectively traced back until 2001 for the diagnosis of irregular menstrual cycles (ICD-9-CM code 626.4). The risk of pSS was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Irregular menstrual cycles were significantly associated with pSS [adjusted odds ratio, (AOR) = 1.38, p = 0.027], after adjusted for insured amount, urbanization level, and thyroid disorder. In addition, when the data were stratified by three age categories, only the patients in the age category of 45-55 years showed significant association between irregular menstrual cycles and pSS (AOR = 1.74, p = 0.005). In this nationwide, population-based case-control study, we found a significant increased risk of pSS in female patients with irregular menstrual cycles, particularly those in their mid-forties to mid-fifties.

L-type calcium channel blockers reverse docetaxel and vincristine-induced multidrug resistance independent of ABCB1 expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs significantly impedes chemotherapeutic treatment. The purpose of this study is to characterize docetaxel (DOC) or vincristine (VCR) selected A549 and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) sublines that exhibit MDR phenotypes and followed by re-sensitization study. Although all drug resistant sublines showed cross-resistance to DOC, VCR, and doxorubicin (DXR), the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter B1 (ABCB1) gene was found to be strongly induced in DOC but not in VCR resistant A549 sublines by quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In DOC and VCR resistant H1299 sublines, moderate expression of ABCB1 was detected. The levels of ABCB1 protein and efflux activities were further examined by immunoblotting and rhodamin-123 staining assay. The results showed that both ABC and non-ABC mediated MDR are existed. Furthermore, verapamil (VER), an inhibitor of ABCB1 and an L-type calcium channel blocker, is capable of reversing the resistance in all drug-resistant sublines independent of ABCB1 expression. Importantly, VER only sensitizes resistant sublines but has no effect on parental cancer cells. Other L-type calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (DIL) and nifedipine (NIF), also sensitize MDR sublines without interfering with ABCB1 activity but with lower efficacy than VER. Our data showed that in addition to ABCB1, calcium channel activity may play a crucial role in DOC- and VCR-acquired MDR. Therefore, inhibition of calcium influx may provide a new target to modulate MDR in chemotherapy.

Lichen metabolites modulate hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in mouse macrophages. The activities of perlatolic acid (1), atranorin (2), and lecanoric acid (3) and their derivatives, such as orsellinates and beta-methyl orsellinates obtained by alcoholysis, were assessed for stimulation of the release of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in cultures of peritoneal macrophage cells from mice. The hydrogen peroxide production was estimated by oxidation of phenol red, while the Griess reagent was used to determine the nitric oxide production. 1 and 4-methoxy-ethyl orsellinate (XVII) were the compounds that induced the greatest release of H2O2, whereas n-pentyl orsellinate (IV), iso-propyl orsellinate (V), sec-butyl orsellinate (VI), and XVII induced a small release of NO. These results indicate that lichen products and their derivatives have potential immune-modulating activities.

Full-Length Recombinant Human Proteoglycan 4 Interacts with Hyaluronan to Provide Cartilage Boundary Lubrication. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a mucin-like glycoprotein present in synovial fluid and at the surface of articular cartilage. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the articular cartilage surface adsorption and in vitro cartilage boundary lubricating ability of full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4), and (2) cartilage boundary lubricating ability of purified rhPRG4, both alone and in combination with hyaluronan (HA). rhPRG4 adsorption onto articular cartilage explants was assessed by immunohistochemistry and dot blot. An in vitro cartilage-cartilage friction test was used to assess rhPRG4's cartilage boundary lubricating ability compared to bovine PRG4, and that of purified rhPRG4 both alone and in combination with HA. rhPRG4 was able to adsorb to the articular surface, as well as the cut surface, of cartilage explants. The kinetic coefficient of friction of rhPRG4 was similar to that of PRG4 (p = 0.16) and lower than phosphate-buffered saline (p < 0.05), while that of purified rhPRG4 + HA was significantly lower than rhPRG4 alone (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that rhPRG4 can adsorb to an intact articular cartilage surface and functions as an effective boundary lubricant, both alone and with HA, and provides the foundation for in vivo evaluation of this clinically relevant full-length rhPRG4 for treatment of osteoarthritis.


A prospective 1-year comparative study of transaxillary total thyroidectomy regarding functional outcomes: Is it really promising?

Study of the time-varying cortical connectivity changes during the attempt of foot movements by spinal cord injured and healthy subjects. In this study we estimated time-varying cortical connectivity patterns from a group of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patients during the attempt to move a paralyzed limb. These data were compared with the time-varying connectivity patterns estimated in a control group during the real execution of the movement by using time-varying Partial Directed Coherence. Connectivity was estimated from high resolution EEG recordings with the use of realistic head modelling and the linear inverse estimation of the cortical activity in a series of Regions of Interest of the cortex (ROIs). The experimental evidences obtained support the conclusion that the SCI population involved a larger cortical network than those generated by the healthy subjects during the task performance. Such network differs for the involvement of the parietal cortices, which increases in strength near to the movement imagination onset for the SCI when compared to the normal population. Such details about the temporal evolution of the connectivity patterns cannot be obtained with the application of the standard estimators of connectivity.

[Treatment and rehabilitation programs for young alcoholics: acquiring the ability through group therapies and cognitive-behavioral therapies to communicate with others to lead a new life]. The number of young alcoholics increased rapidly around Tokyo during these several years has resulted in the emergence of AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) groups consisting mainly of 20- 30-year-olds. It is well known, however, that young alcoholics are difficult to be treated in traditional alcoholic wards where most of the patients are 50- 60-years old and are treated through group therapy, such as AA or Dansyu-kai (Japanese style AA). With their immature brains and limited experience, young people are extremely vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Young alcoholics have missed the opportunities for self-investigation and for acquiring the ability to communicate with others without drinking. Even after successfully giving up alcohol, it is sometimes difficult for them to find employment, or to continue to be employed. They do not feel comfortable when they stop drinking because their thinking and cognition have been distorted by the consequences of their alcohol use. We provide cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for young alcoholics to change their behavior and emotional state, giving opportunities for self-investigation according to the 12-step program of AA for young addicts, in conjunction with an introduction to our program by motivational interviewing. Our treatment program aims to enable the participants to begin new lives without drinking and to find jobs. In treatment and rehabilitation programs of such patients, serious consideration is required for social and emotional development in order to gain the ability to communicate with other members of society. Groups in our therapy programs consist of 8-15 patients who are mostly aged below 40, or who were physically and emotionally abused as children by their alcoholic parents. In such a non-judgmental and intimate atmosphere, addicts feel accepted and encouraged to talk about their real thoughts and feelings. This kind of group involvement helps them to attend community AA group or Dansyukai where sometimes they might feel anxious or frustrated because the members remind them of their frightening parents. In this article we examine the effectiveness of participation in our treatment programs together with AA meetings and the rehabilitation program of the therapeutic community known as MINOWA-MAC. 24- 35-year-old male alcoholics admitted to our acute psychiatric ward from 2000 to 2005. All of the patients had stopped drinking and found employment. A few of the patients were married or in stable relationships. 20 male alcoholics were examined retrospectively after participating in the 5 programs below: (1) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a small group and/or individual counseling to alter their distorted cognition, emotion and behavior; (2) Completing the 12-step workbook for self-investigation; (3) Attending community AA meetings (and/or Dansyukai); (4) Attending MINOWA-MAC day-care program; (5) Joining MINOWA-MAC (or DARC) residential care program. Young alcoholics who participated in both daily AA meeting and MINOWA-MAC have successfully found new full-time employment. All of them have been employed for more than one year. Those who regularly attended mutual support groups became capable of expressing their opinions in public. This seems to help them feel comfortable socially and in the work place. The 12-step workbook for self-investigation helps patients understand that they are loved and gives them confidence so that they feel encouraged to change their attitudes and behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therapies are also effective in changing the emotions, thoughts and behavior of the patients. Only a few of the patients complete CBT group therapy as well as individual counseling of CBT to change their irrational cognition and deteriorated behavior. They made great advances in developing life-management skills and have secured new jobs or have opened new AA meetings. Even joining CBT group therapy for one to two years enables them to realize that their perfectionism and dichotomous thinking disrupted the development of their lives. Protective types of treatment and rehabilitation such as day-care programs in hospitals or Dansyukai are often insufficient for young alcoholics, from the viewpoint of altering their way of life. AA and the therapeutic communities are especially effective for young alcoholics. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also effective, though not all the male alcoholics could complete our program, which aims not only to change the patients' perception of drinking but also to enable them to correct their distorted feelings, thoughts, cognition and behavior. The 12-step workbook for self-investigation is a useful tool in changing attitude and behavior.

Home Telemedicine in Heart Failure: A Pilot Study of Integrated Telemonitoring and Virtual Provider Appointments. Congestive heart failure is a significant cause of hospitalization, rehospitalization, and death. Reducing hospital readmission rates is a national priority. Various telemonitoring devices and programs have been developed to help meet this goal. The Health Connect system incorporates monitoring of physiologic data with regular virtual provider appointments. The Health Connect system integrates traditional telemedicine with virtual provider appointments. Virtual appointments empower patients to advocate for their own health by providing numerous opportunities for education and feedback. In addition to early identification of impending decompensation, virtual appointments allow providers to address noncompliance, which is a major factor driving poor outcomes. Further research is required to confirm the benefit of the Health Connect system.

Subretinal coapplication of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and bevacizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration with submacular haemorrhage. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pars plana vitrectomy (ppV) with subretinal coapplication of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas exchange for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with submacular haemorrhage (SMH). Consecutive interventional case series of 12 patients with neovascular AMD with SMH with a maximum history of 14 days. All patients underwent ppV with subretinal coapplication of rtPA and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas (20% SF6) exchange. Phakic patients underwent concomitant cataract surgery. Additional injections of bevacizumab were applied intravitreally 4 and 8 weeks postop. Complete displacement of SMH from the fovea was achieved in 9 of 12 patients. The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved significantly from preop logMAR 1.9 (range 3.0 to 0.7) to logMAR 1.2 (range 3.0 to 0.3) at 4 weeks postop (p = 0.01) and to logMAR 0.9 (range 1.6 to 0.2) at 12 weeks postop (p = 0.006). The mean improvement of BCVA 4 weeks postop as compared with preop was logMAR 0.7 (range -0.2 to 2.3). The mean improvement of BCVA 12 weeks postop as compared with preop was logMAR 0.96 (range -0.3 to 2.8). Overall, at 12 weeks postop, BCVA had improved in 10 patients, remained unchanged in one patient and worsened in one patient. PpV with subretinal coapplication of rtPA and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas exchange effectively displaces SMH and improves visual acuity in most patients.

Apolipoprotein E and its role in aging and survival.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by the PLP1 'rumpshaker mutation'. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. Mutations in PLP1 on the X chromosome cause spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) or the allelic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD). The PLP1 protein is a major myelin protein involved in stabilisation and maintenance of the myelin sheath. The function of the protein has been studied in the rumpshaker mouse, which is a model of SPG2/PMD. To characterise the phenotype of patients with the 'rumpshaker mutation.' A family with HSP caused by the 'rumpshaker mutation.' The patients showed nystagmus during infancy and had early onset of HSP. They had normal cognition, and cerebral MRI showed relatively unspecific white matter abnormalities on T2 sequences without clear progression. Urinary urgency was reported among the female carriers. MRS of both patients showed increased myo-inositol in the white matter, while decreased N-acetylaspartate was found exclusively in the oldest patient. All evoked potential examinations were compatible with severe central demyelination, while no signs of peripheral demyelination or axonal degeneration were found. (18)F-FDG-PET scans were normal. The phenotypes of the patients reported here are the mildest described to be caused by the rumpshaker mutation and represent the mildest form among the spectrum of PLP1 related disorders. No definite symptoms in the female carriers could be ascribed to the mutation. These data suggest the pathology to be an underlying dysmyelinating disorder in combination with a central axonal degeneration.


Increased plasma-immune cytokines throughout the high-dose melphalan-induced lymphodepletion in patients with multiple myeloma: a window for adoptive immunotherapy.

Volume load paradox while preparing for the Fontan: not too much for the ventricle, not too little for the lungs. Ventricular dysfunction is frequently encountered in Fontan patients. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons have, therefore, mainly focused on preservation of cardiac function, limiting the early volume overload as much as possible both in magnitude and duration. This resulted in improved cardiac function but, in some patients, also in poor pulmonary artery (PA) growth which in turn resulted in a poor final Fontan circuit. The volume requirements for optimal growth and development of the ventricle and the lungs are different and divergent. Avoiding overload of the ventricle is important, but excessive protection from volume overload may not be necessary and may result in PA hypoplasia, which in turn will severely affect the Fontan circuit.

Reference percentiles of hematological and biochemical iron values of blood donors in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. In a setting where there is no functional blood transfusion service, there is a need to establish reference values which will assist in determining the cut-off values of the donor pool and also to evaluate anemia. Three hundred and forty eight blood donors of both sexes, aged 18 to 62 years were studied in a cross-sectional descriptive study. Four biochemical parameters: serum ferritin (SF), serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS) and four hematological parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total white blood cell count (WBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were assessed. The median and percentile ranges (10-90% percentile) of the biochemical and hematological parameters were as follows: SF 46.8 ng/ml (0.0-173.1), SI 85.9 microg/dl (19.7-338.0), TIBC 224.7 microg/dl (60.9-541.4), TS 41.2% (15.3-90.6), Hb 12.9 g/dl (7.74-15.6), PCV 38.0% (22.9-47.0), WBC 4.5 x 10(9)/l (3.0-8.0) and ESR 8.0 mm/h (1.0-24.6). The sex of the blood donor volunteers was found to exert an influence on SF, SI, TIBC and WBC in favor of the female; P<0.001. The age of the blood donors had a significant influence on some of the variables especially the hematological variables such as Hb, PCV and ESR (P<0.001). At a cut-off value of Hb 12.0 g/dl, SF 15.0 ng/ml and TS 16, 10.4 and 6.0% had iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia respectively in this study population. There is a high percentage of iron deficiency anemia in this donor population and this calls for urgent attention.

Toward unmasking the dynamics of visual perception. Fisch et al. report in this issue of Neuron the results of an investigation of the neural correlates of conscious perception.

Pharmacokinetics of once-daily trospium chloride 60 mg extended release and twice-daily trospium chloride 20 mg in healthy adults. The objective of this study is to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics and compare the relative bioavailability of the extended-release capsule formulation of the antimuscarinic trospium chloride, developed for once-daily administration, and trospium chloride immediate-release tablets. This is a single-center, multidose, randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-arm crossover, bioavailability study in healthy adult male and female subjects who are within 20% of their ideal body weight. Subjects receive trospium 60-mg extended-release capsules once daily and trospium 20-mg tablets twice daily for 10 days, each in a crossover manner. Twenty-four subjects are enrolled in the study. With multiple dosing of trospium 60 mg extended-release once daily versus 20 mg twice daily, lower geometric least squares mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (17 360 vs 28 590 pg.h/mL; ratio 61%; 90% confidence interval, 51-72) and maximum plasma concentration (1517 vs 2502 pg/mL; 61%; 90% confidence interval, 49-75) are observed. Furthermore, with trospium 60 mg extended-release versus 20 mg, median time to maximum plasma concentration is later (5.0 vs 4.5 hours) and half-life is longer (35.8 vs 27.2 hours). Trospium exposure is lower with multiple dosing of trospium 60 mg extended-release compared with trospium 20 mg twice daily. Thus, with the extended-release formulation, trospium concentrations are less likely to reach the threshold where adverse events may sometimes occur.

Nationwide survey (incidence, clinical course, prognosis) of Rasmussen's encephalitis. Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a progressive and catastrophic epileptic disorder caused by chronic localized encephalitis. We performed a nationwide survey of RE to assess the clinical picture, treatment effect, and prognosis of Japanese RE patients. The subjects were 27 patients (male:12; female:15) from 13 medical facilities. All of them satisfied the clinical and neuroimaging criteria for RE, including 14 pathologically proven cases. They were divided into the childhood-onset rapidly progressive type (CORP, n=19), and late-onset slowly progressive type (LOSP, n=8). The mean age at epilepsy onset was 4 years and 4 months in CORP, and 16 years in LOSP. The mean period between the onset age of epilepsy and development of frequent seizures was 1 year and 4 months in the former, and 3 years and 4 months in the latter. The immunomodulatory treatment including high-dose steroid (n=14) and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapies (IVIgG, n=12) achieved more than a 50% reduction in the seizure frequency in 5 (36%) and 4 (33%) patients, respectively. Eight and seven patients underwent focal cortical resection and functional hemispherectomy, leading to significant improvement in 5 of the 8 patients and excellent seizure control in all 7 patients, respectively. Although the high-dose steroid and IVIG therapies may have alleviated the exacerbation of seizures in those with RE, they could not halt the disease progression. Functional hemispherectomy is still the only curative therapy for RE, despite the fact that the early introduction of this procedure remains controversial.

Risk factors for human infection with West Nile Virus in Connecticut: a multi-year analysis. The optimal method for early prediction of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection risk remains controversial. We analyzed the predictive utility of risk factor data for human WNV over a six-year period in Connecticut. Using only environmental variables or animal sentinel data was less predictive than a model that considered all variables. In the final parsimonious model, population density, growing degree-days, temperature, WNV positive mosquitoes, dead birds and WNV positive birds were significant predictors of human infection risk, with an ROC value of 0.75. A real-time model using climate, land use, and animal surveillance data to predict WNV risk appears feasible. The dynamic patterns of WNV infection suggest a need to periodically refine such prediction systems. Using multiple logistic regression, the 30-day risk of human WNV infection by town was modeled using environmental variables as well as mosquito and wild bird surveillance.

[Evaluation of the potential organ and tissue donor within the pandemic of influenza H1N1]. The pandemic strain of H1N1 supposes a challenge to the health care system in general and for Intensive Care Units (ICU) in particular. Therefore, it will undoubtedly have repercussions on the organ and tissue donation process. In a possible scenario of bed shortage in the ICU and difficulties in maintaining the surgical activity at a normal pace, a significant effort must be made to assure the maintenance of normal transplant activity, which should not be considered as an elective surgical procedure. Another problem related with the impact of the pandemic on the organ donation process is the possibility that a donor with influenza virus could transmit the disease to recipients. This work aims to clarify this issue, reviewing existing data on the potential transmission of influenza viruses with transplanted organs or tissue, the recommendations published in other countries and those developed in Spain by an ad hoc work group that is made up by representatives from the National Transplant Organization, the Ministry of Health and Social Policy, Regional Offices of Transplant Coordination, and various scientific societies, including SEMICYUC.

Scientific Misconduct in India: Causes and Perpetuation. Along with economic strength, space technology and software expertise, India is also a leading nation in fraudulent scientific research. The problem is worsened by vested interests working in concert for their own benefits. These self-promoting cartels, together with biased evaluation methods and weak penal systems, combine to perpetuate scientific misconduct. Some of these issues are discussed in this commentary, with supporting examples and possible solutions.

Intraoperative tumor localization and tissue distinction during robotic adrenalectomy using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: a feasibility study. To investigate the feasibility of a method for intraoperative tumor localization and tissue distinction during robotic adrenalectomy (RA) via indocyanine green (ICG) imaging under near-infrared light. Ten patients underwent RA. After exposure of the retroperitoneal space, but before adrenal dissection was started, ICG was given intravenously (IV). Fluorescence Firefly™ imaging was performed at 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min time points. The precision with which the borders of the adrenal tissue were distinguished with ICG imaging was compared to that with the conventional robotic view. The number and the total volume of injections for each patient were recorded. There were six male and four female patients. Diagnosis was primary hyperaldosteronism in four patients and myelolipoma, adrenocortical neoplasm, adrenocortical hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and metastasis in one patient each. Procedures were done through a robotic lateral transabdominal approach in nine and through a robotic posterior retroperitoneal approach in one patient. Dose per injection ranged between 2.5 and 6.3 mg and total dose per patient 7.5-18.8 mg. The adrenal gland took up the dye in 1 min, with contrast between adrenal mass and surrounding retroperitoneal fat becoming most distinguished at 5 min. Fluorescence of adrenal tissue lasted up to 20 min after injection. Overall, ICG imaging was felt to help with the conduct of operation in 8 out of 10 procedures. There were no conversions to open or morbidity. There were no immediate or delayed adverse effects attributable to IV ICG administration. In this pilot study, we demonstrated the feasibility and safety of ICG imaging in a small group of patients undergoing RA. We described a method that enabled an effective fluorescence imaging to localize the adrenal glands and guide dissection. Future research is necessary to study how this imaging affects perioperative outcomes.

Independent component analysis applied to pulse oximetry in the estimation of the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2)--a comparative study. We examine various independent component analysis (ICA) digital signal processing algorithms for estimating the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) as measured by a reflective pulse oximeter. The ICA algorithms examined are FastICA, Maximum Likelihood ICA (ICAML), Molgedey and Schuster ICA (ICAMS), and Mean Field ICA (ICAMF). The signal processing includes pre-processing bandpass filtering to eliminate noise, and post-processing by calculating the SpO2. The algorithms are compared to the commercial state-of-the-art algorithm Discrete Saturation Transform (DST) by Masimo Corporation. It is demonstrated that ICAMS and ICAMF perform up to 13% better than DST. PPG recordings are done with a reflective pulse oximetry sensor integrated in an Electronic Patch. This system is intended for patients with chronic heart and lung conditions.

High-density lipoprotein particles and markers of inflammation and thrombotic activity in patients with untreated HIV infection. Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with changes in blood lipids, inflammation, thrombotic activity, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. We studied high-density lipoprotein particle (HDLp) concentrations and inflammatory (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin [IL] 6), endothelial activation (E-selectin and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1]), and thrombotic (fibrinogen and D-dimer) biomarkers in a group of 32 untreated HIV-infected and 29 uninfected persons. Differences in the levels of blood lipids and biomarkers by HIV status were examined before and after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index, and the presence of hepatitis C. HIV-infected participants, compared with uninfected participants, had lower HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels (-26%) and HDLp numbers (-21%), with reductions in large (-50%) and small (-20%) HDLp, specifically (P < or = .01 for all). A trend was present for higher total cholesterol (P = .15 and triglyceride levels (P = .11) among individuals with HIV infection. Levels of IL-6, sICAM-1, and D-dimer were 65%-70% higher in HIV-infected participants (P < or = .02 for all). Covariate adjustment did not diminish these associations. For HIV-infected participants, total and small HDLp (respectively) tended to correlate inversely with levels of IL-6 (P = .08 and P = .02), sICAM-1 (P < .01 for both) and D-dimer (P = .03 and p < .01). Persons with untreated HIV infection have lower HDLp (primarily large and small HDLp) and higher IL-6, sICAM-1, and D-dimer levels, and the relationship of these markers to HIV-mediated atherosclerotic risk requires further study.


Cellular transformation by cigarette smoke extract involves alteration of glycolysis and mitochondrial function in esophageal epithelial cells.

Abdominal pain symptoms are associated with anxiety and depression in young children. Abdominal pain symptoms and incontinence are common in childhood. The aim of this study was to analyse abdominal pain symptoms and their associations with incontinence and symptoms of anxiety and depression in young children. We examined 1130 children during the school entry check-up (mean age 6.2 years) and 951 participated in the study. Parents completed a questionnaire contained 11 items regarding Rome-III functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and incontinence and 14 items from the anxious/depressed scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Of the 951 children (55.6% boys) we recruited, 30.1% had experienced abdominal pain symptoms in the past two months and 14% had complained of them at least once a week. In addition, 2.6% had irritable bowel syndrome, 11.3% had childhood functional abdominal pain, 2.4% were affected by faecal incontinence, 2.1% were affected by daytime urinary incontinence, and 5.5% were affected by nocturnal enuresis. One in ten (10.6%) had symptoms of anxiety and depression, and these were significantly higher in the children with FGIDs, particularly if they were also incontinent. Nearly a third of the children (30.1%) had abdominal pain symptoms, and FGIDs were associated with significantly higher symptoms of anxiety and depression, especially if children were also incontinent.

Fracture, bone mineral density, and the effects of calcitonin receptor gene in postmenopausal Koreans. In a candidate gene association study, we found that the variations of calcitonin receptor (CALCR) gene were related to the risk of vertebral fracture and increased bone mineral density (BMD). Calcitonins through calcitonin receptors inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and modulate calcium ion excretion by the kidney and also prevent vertebral bone loss in early menopause. To identify genetically susceptible factors of osteoporosis, we discovered the variations in CALCR gene, genotyped in Korean postmenopausal women (n = 729), and examined the potential involvement of seven single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and their haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium block (BL_hts). The SNPs, +43147G > C (intron 7), +60644C > T (exon13, 3' untranslated region), and their haplotypes, BL2_ht1 and BL2_ht2, showed a significant association with risk of vertebral fracture (p = 0.048-0.004) and BL2_ht1 showed a highly significant protective effect. Moreover, the polymorphism +60644C > T showed a highly significant association with BMD at both lumbar spine and femoral neck. The subjects carrying CC and CT genotypes with the SNP, +60644C > T, had higher BMD values at the lumbar spine (p = 0.01-0.001) and femoral neck (p = 0.025-0.009). These results indicate that the CALCR gene may regulate bone metabolism, and +60644C > T in the CALCR gene may genetically modulate bone phenotype.

Temporal and spatial control over soluble protein signaling for musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Orthopedic tissue engineering strategies have developed rapidly in response to large and growing clinical needs. However, current clinical methods for replacement of natural tissue function have significant limitations, and pragmatic challenges have hindered clinical use of emerging tissue engineering approaches. In addition, current methods are not yet capable of achieving complex spatial and temporal regulation of soluble signaling (e.g. growth factor signaling), which may be required for complex, functional tissue regeneration. We have begun to develop a series of new medical devices, which are designed to temporally and spatially regulate growth factor and cytokine signaling during tissue regeneration. The initial goal of these studies is to regulate the behavior of multipotent stem cells, and to promote formation of clinically relevant tissue interfaces (e.g. bone-tendon interfaces). The ultimate goal is to further understand and recapitulate the complex processes that lead to functional musculoskeletal development and regeneration.


Combination of novel proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 and lenalidomide trigger in vitro and in vivo synergistic cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma.

A rare de novo nonsense mutation in OTX2 causes early onset retinal dystrophy and pituitary dysfunction. To describe the clinical findings of a patient with an early onset retinal dystrophy and a novel mutation in OTX2, and to compare these findings with previously reported cases. Using direct sequencing, we screened 142 patients, who had either Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) or early onset retinal dystrophy (EORD), for mutations in OTX2. All patients received a detailed ophthalmic examination including electroretinography and retinal imaging. Only one mutation in OTX2 was identified. A novel heterozygous p.S138X stop mutation was identified in a seven-year-old male who had an infantile onset retinal dystrophy. The mutation was not present in either parent or in 181 blood donor samples. There was a history of failure to thrive in infancy, poor feeding, and growth hormone deficiency. Poor vision and nyctalopia was present from the first year. Funduscopy revealed a hyperpigmented peripapillary ring with a fine granular pigmentation of the RPE throughout the fundus. The scotopic bright flash ERG a-wave was subnormal and the waveform electronegative, in keeping with dysfunction both at the level of the photoreceptor and post-phototransduction. Visual function has been stable to date. Mutations in OTX2 have been reported in association with major developmental malformations of the eye, with retinal dystrophies such as LCA, and with pituitary dysfunction and seizure activity in some cases. This case adds further support for a role of OTX2 both in retinal development and pituitary function, and highlights a novel retinal dystrophy phenotype seen in association with mutations in OTX2.

Student performance on levels 1 and 2-CE of COMLEX-USA: do elective upper-level undergraduate science courses matter? The effect of a variety of preadmission variables, including the number of elective preadmission upper-level science courses, on academic achievement is not well established. To investigate the relationship between number of preadmission variables and overall student academic achievement in osteopathic medical school. Academic records of osteopathic medical students in the 2008 and 2009 graduating classes of Western University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific in Pomona, California, were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of academic achievement based on Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) subscores, undergraduate grade point average (GPA), GPA in medical school basic science (preclinical GPA) and clinical clerkship (clinical GPA), and scores on the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination-USA (COMLEX-USA) Level 1 and Level 2-Cognitive Evaluation (CE). Records of 358 osteopathic medical students were evaluated. Analysis of beta coefficients suggested that undergraduate science GPA was the most important predictor of overall student academic achievement (P<.01). Biological sciences MCAT subscore was a more modest but still statistically significant predictor of preclinical GPA and COMLEX-USA Level 1 score (P<.01). Physical sciences MCAT subscore was also a statistically significant predictor of preclinical GPA, and verbal reasoning MCAT subscore was a statistically significant predictor of COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE score (both P<.01). Women had statistically significantly higher preclinical GPA and COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE scores than men (P<.05). Differences in some outcome variables were also associated with racial-ethnic background and age. Number of preadmission elective upper-level science courses taken by students before matriculation was not significantly correlated with any academic achievement variable. Although undergraduate science GPA and MCAT biological sciences subscore were significant predictors of overall academic achievement for osteopathic medical students, the number of elective upper-level science courses taken preadmission had no predictive value.

Infectious complications after gastric cancer surgery accelerate a rapid hepatic recurrence. Rapid hepatic recurrence is sometimes experienced after gastric or pancreatobiliary cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for the timing of hepatic recurrence. The medical records of 20 patients who had hepatic recurrence after either a gastrectomy for gastric cancer (11 patients) or a pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatobiliary cancer (9 patients) between 2002 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The cumulative recurrence rate of liver metastasis was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 14 possible factors affecting the rapid hepatic recurrence were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The median time for the hepatic recurrence after the operation was 4.9 months (range 1 to 20.4 months). Among 14 factors, only postoperative infectious complications significantly accelerated the hepatic recurrence based on a univariate analysis (p = 0.049). Two more factors, gastric cancer and preoperative tumor marker elevation, had a tendency to affect the rapid recurrence, but did not show statistical significance (both p = 0.06). A multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative infectious complications (p = 0.005) and gastric cancer (p = 0.04) were significant and independent factors. Five of 11 patients with gastric cancer suffered from postoperative infectious complications, 4 of which were associated with pancreatic leakage after a pancreatosplenectomy, and all 5 patients had hepatic recurrence within 3 months after the operation. Postoperative infectious complications are thus considered to accelerate a rapid hepatic recurrence after a gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Signal processing system to extract serum bilirubin concentration from diffuse reflectance spectrum of human skin. Neonatal jaundice is a medical condition which occurs in newborns as a result of an imbalance between the production and elimination of bilirubin. Excess bilirubin in the blood stream diffuses into the surrounding tissue leading to a yellowing of the skin. The extra-vascular bilirubin act as interfering signal that limits the estimation of serum bilirubin from reflectance spectrum of human skin. This is particularly an issue for neonates who are being subjected to phototherapy (a common treatment for neonatal jaundice). Unfortunately, analytical models developed to study the light transport in human skin do not consider the effects of extra-vascular bilirubin (and other absorbing chromophores). A biomedical signal processing method that estimates serum bilirubin in presence of confounding signals such as melanin and extra-vascular bilirubin concentrations is presented. The new system model and nonlinear solver have been successful in estimating the serum bilirubin concentration on simulated spectral databases within an average error of 15%.

Separation of astaxanthin from cells of Phaffia rhodozyma using colloidal gas aphrons in a flotation column. The aim of this study is to investigate the separation of astaxanthin from the cells of Phaffia rhodozyma using colloidal gas aphrons (CGA), which are surfactant stabilized microbubbles, in a flotation column. It was reported in previous studies that optimum recoveries are achieved at conditions that favor electrostatic interactions. Therefore, in this study, CGA generated from the cationic surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were applied to suspensions of cells pretreated with NaOH. The different operation modes (batch or continuous) and the effect of volumetric ratio of CGA to feed, initial concentration of feed, operating height, and flow rate of CGA on the separation of astaxanthin were investigated. The volumetric ratio was found to have a significant effect on the separation of astaxanthin for both batch and continuous experiments. Additionally, the effect of homogenization of the cells on the purity of the recovered fractions was investigated, showing that the homogenization resulted in increased purity. Moreover, different concentrations of surfactant were used for the generation of CGA for the recovery of astaxanthin on batch mode; it was found that recoveries up to 98% could be achieved using CGA generated from a CTAB solution 0.8 mM, which is below the CTAB critical micellar concentration (CMC). These results offer important information for the scale-up of the separation of astaxanthin from the cells of P. rhodozyma using CGA.

Joint Consensus Statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society on the Recommended Amount of Sleep for a Healthy Adult: Methodology and Discussion. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society recently released a Consensus Statement regarding the recommended amount of sleep to promote optimal health in adults. This paper describes the methodology, background literature, voting process, and voting results for the consensus statement. In addition, we address important assumptions and challenges encountered during the consensus process. Finally, we outline future directions that will advance our understanding of sleep need and place sleep duration in the broader context of sleep health.

Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer: a systematic review. Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is considered standard treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Recent studies indicate benefit to the addition of bevacizumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings were searched to identify randomized trials in advanced colorectal cancer comparing chemotherapy plus bevacizumab with chemotherapy alone. A meta-analysis of published data was carried out. Five trials comparing chemotherapy plus bevacizumab with chemotherapy alone as first- or second-line treatment were identified. Our meta-analysis indicates an advantage in favor of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.90; P = 0.0005], progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49-0.81, P = 0.0004), and response rate (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.06-2.10, P = 0.02). The most commonly observed adverse effects related to bevacizumab included hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, and thrombosis. Gastrointestinal perforation and poor wound healing were also observed; however, their incidence was rare. For patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving first- or second-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, the addition of bevacizumab improves PFS and OS at the expense of increased incidence of toxicity. The magnitude of benefit may differ based on the chemotherapy regimen with which bevacizumab is partnered.

The effect of education on health among US residents in relation to country of birth. This research explores the impact of education on health in relation to an individual's country of birth using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 2001-2004. We analyze health equations that relate health to education and other variables. Health is measured in terms of self-reported overall health, an index of biological risk factors, and body mass index. The primary hypothesis tested is whether education has a greater impact on immigrants' productive and allocative efficiency, because of their need to learn about how to remain healthy and access appropriate health care in a new environment. The empirical results indicate that for US residents, who were foreign-born, education is associated with a greater beneficial effect on every health outcome compared to those born in the United States. More education is related to an even greater positive effect on health for immigrants from Mexico, the origin of most immigrants, than from other countries. These results provide additional support for the portions of the 2007 Immigration Reform Act rejected by the US Congress, which placed a higher priority on education and job skills than current law. Since increased education and improved health are associated, such policy reform would help reduce the demands on the US health-care system.

A regional system for delivery of primary percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: STEMI-St. Cloud. Strategies of emergency care in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have evolved rapidly over the past two decades to include primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) when possible. Most U.S.-based transfer programs still use complicated protocols that include fibrinolytic therapy often resulting in transfer delays, inappropriately applied therapy (wrong diagnosis) and bleeding and stroke complications. These protocols are often emphasized in low-volume centers. We implemented a program absent fibrinolytic therapy and applied it to a network of 25 participating hospitals over a 100-mile radius in central Minnesota. One-thousand consecutive patients ages 21 to 90 who presented within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms consistent with MI from April, 2004 to January, 2008 were included in this registry. Prior to transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, patients received aspirin and heparin. Clopidogrel was added to the protocol in January, 2007. Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors were typically utilized after diagnostic catheterization and prior to PPCI. Median door-to-balloon time was 56 minutes at the PCI Center and 110 minutes from referral sites (RS). Of the transfer patients, 71% underwent helicopter transfer. The success rate for PPCI was 99.4%. Despite inherent transfer delays, there was no difference in mortality between the PCI Center and RS. Overall mortality rates in-hospital, at 30 days, at 6 months, and 1 year were 2.1%, 2.9%, 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively, with follow up on 998 of 1,000 patients. In-hospital stroke, reinfarction and major bleeding were 0.7%, 2.0% and 2.7%, respectively. Despite increasing trends toward a pharmacoinvasive approach in transfer patients with STEMI, a protocol which stresses rapid transfer and PPCI results in excellent outcomes, with very low complication rates without fibrinolytic therapy.

The effect of oral immunomodulatory therapy on treatment uptake and persistence in multiple sclerosis. We aimed to analyse the effect of the introduction of fingolimod, the first oral disease-modifying therapy, on treatment utilisation and persistence in an international cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MSBASIS, a prospective, observational sub-study of the MSBase registry, collects demographic, clinical and paraclinical data on patients followed from MS onset (n=4718). We conducted a multivariable conditional risk set survival analysis to identify predictors of treatment discontinuation, and to assess if the introduction of fingolimod has altered treatment persistence. A total of 2640 patients commenced immunomodulatory therapy. Following the introduction of fingolimod, patients were more likely to discontinue all other treatments (hazard ratio 1.64, p<0.001) while more patients switched to fingolimod than any other therapy (42.3% of switches). Patients switched to fingolimod due to convenience. Patients treated with fingolimod were less likely to discontinue treatment compared with other therapies (p<0.001). Female sex, country of residence, younger age, a high Expanded Disability Status Scale score and relapse activity were all independently associated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation. Following the availability of fingolimod, patients were more likely to discontinue injectable treatments. Those who switched to fingolimod were more likely to do so for convenience. Persistence was improved on fingolimod compared to other medications.

Novel influenza A (H1N1) outbreak on board a US navy vessel. Fleet Week New York 2009 was the latest installment of an annual celebration to honor US service personnel. It takes place during Memorial Day and this year's celebration coincided with the peak of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) activity in New York City. Four service members from the USS Iwo Jima and USS Roosevelt contracted influenza while in New York City and were hospitalized in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-New York Harbor Healthcare System to minimize the risk of widespread outbreak on board the naval vessels. No additional cases were identified on the USS Roosevelt. However, 135 service personnel on the USS Iwo Jima contracted influenza. Shipwide infection control measures including strict isolation and active case finding were instituted immediately with affected crew members and medical staff receiving oseltamivir. The new case rates remained high for 14 days, but the USS Iwo Jima was able to continue deployment. The secondary infectivity rate was 12.0%. The absolute end of the outbreak correlated with arrival at home port and the ability to move patients off board. This outbreak not only reinforces the risk for rapid spread of novel strains of influenza A in confined populations but also demonstrates useful strategies to mitigate the severity of an outbreak, including isolation, infection control measures, and off board sick leave when feasible.

[New ultra rapid test for detection of bacteria]. Bacteriological testing is aimed to reduce the risk of transmission of infections. However, the detection of Bacteria by culture requires from 18hours to 14 days and may produce erroneous results for fastidious species. The goal of this work was to design and validate a new tool for bacterial testing. The test is based on the fast real-time PCR (frt PCR). The DNA extracted from samples containing internal controls are introduced into four tubes containing primers and probes for the frt PCR. The cycling program consists in 1×at 95°C for 10min and 45×(15s at 95°C, 8s) at 52°C and 10s at 72°C. The frt PCR detects 0,01 CFU/μl of Bacteria and identifies eight Genera without interferences from the environment or from fungi and with no need for melting curve analysis or additional sequencing. The frt PCR detects and quantifies Bacteria identifying and assessing the load of Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteria, Acinetobacter, Propionibacteriacae and Corynebacteria. Cultures require at least 24hours but the new frt PCR reduces the time to 90minutes. Larger series of samples are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this new test for routine bacterial sterility controls.

Posttranslational stability of the heme biosynthetic enzyme ferrochelatase is dependent on iron availability and intact iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery. Mammalian ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, possesses an iron-sulfur [2Fe-2S] cluster that does not participate in catalysis. We investigated ferrochelatase expression in iron-deficient erythropoietic tissues of mice lacking iron regulatory protein 2, in iron-deficient murine erythroleukemia cells, and in human patients with ISCU myopathy. Ferrochelatase activity and protein levels were dramatically decreased in Irp2(-/-) spleens, whereas ferrochelatase mRNA levels were increased, demonstrating posttranscriptional regulation of ferrochelatase in vivo. Translation of ferrochelatase mRNA was unchanged in iron-depleted murine erythroleukemia cells, and the stability of mature ferrochelatase protein was also unaffected. However, the stability of newly formed ferrochelatase protein was dramatically decreased during iron deficiency. Ferrochelatase was also severely depleted in muscle biopsies and cultured myoblasts from patients with ISCU myopathy, a disease caused by deficiency of a scaffold protein required for Fe-S cluster assembly. Together, these data suggest that decreased Fe-S cluster availability because of cellular iron depletion or impaired Fe-S cluster assembly causes reduced maturation and stabilization of apo-ferrochelatase, providing a direct link between Fe-S biogenesis and completion of heme biosynthesis. We propose that decreased heme biosynthesis resulting from impaired Fe-S cluster assembly can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenesis.


Oxidative stress drives disulfide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.

Disclosure outcomes, coping strategies, and life changes among women living with HIV in Uganda. An HIV diagnosis is a life-changing event. Disclosure of HIV test results might be related to developing effective coping strategies. We conducted qualitative, in-depth interviews with 30 HIV-infected women in Uganda to explore links between HIV disclosure and coping strategies. Many women experienced an evolution in their ability to cope from initial shame to eventual acceptance. Factors that facilitated adaptive coping included being healthy, feeling responsible for children, support group participation, forming supportive relationships, and low perceived stigma and discrimination. HIV disclosure was often the first step in this coping process. Overall, 80% of the women had disclosed, with most reporting positive outcomes. Development of adaptive coping strategies and HIV serostatus disclosure are closely related, as they allow women to develop support networks and begin coming to terms with their diagnosis. Strategies are needed to safely support women who want to disclose their HIV test results.


Anti-adipocyte scFv-Fc antibody suppresses subcutaneous adipose tissue development and affects lipid metabolism in minipigs.

Sirolimus and everolimus clearance in maintenance kidney and liver transplant recipients: diagnostic efficiency of the concentration/dose ratio for the prediction of trough steady-state concentrations. Therapeutic monitoring of sirolimus and everolimus is necessary in order to minimize adverse side-effects and to ensure effective immunosuppression. A sirolimus-dosing model using the concentration/dose ratio has been previously proposed for kidney transplant patients, and the aim of our study was the evaluation of this single model for the prediction of trough sirolimus and everolimus concentrations. Trough steady-state sirolimus concentrations were determined in several blood samples from each of 7 kidney and 9 liver maintenance transplant recipients, and everolimus concentrations from 20 kidney, 17 liver, and 3 kidney/liver maintenance transplant recipients. Predicted sirolimus and everolimus concentrations (Css), corresponding to the doses (D), were calculated using the measured concentrations (Css(0)) and corresponding doses (D(0)) on starting the study: Css = (Css(0))(D)/D(0). The diagnostic efficiency of the predicting model for the correct classification as subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic values with respect to the experimentally obtained concentrations was 91.3% for sirolimus and 81.4% for everolimus in the kidney transplant patients. In the liver transplant patients the efficiency was 69.2% for sirolimus and 72.6% for everolimus, and in the kidney/liver transplant recipients the efficiency for everolimus was 67.9%. The model has an acceptable diagnostic efficiency (>80%) for the prediction of sirolimus and everolimus concentrations in kidney transplant recipients, but not in liver transplant recipients. However, considering the wide ranges found for the prediction error of sirolimus and everolimus concentrations, the clinical relevance of this dosing model is weak.

Oral health policy development since the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. This assessment of the nature and impact of oral health policy development since issuance of the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health (SGROH) in 2000 includes the following: an examination of the intent and content of the SGROH with respect to policy development; a general overview of ensuing oral health policy development in 3 principal domains: public policy, organizational policies, and professional policies; an assessment of indicators of the aggregate impact of oral health policy development after the SGROH and possible reasons for the somewhat limited progress; and a summary that includes conclusions and recommendations for advancing future oral health policy development. Evidence suggests that accomplishments in the area of oral health policy development have been modest but positive, but a significant amount of work remains to be done to address oral health disparities. Success is likely to be proportionate to the extent to which factors that have impeded substantial progress to date, including fragmentation of efforts and disparate priorities, can be effectively addressed.

Neuropeptide Y expression and function during osteoblast differentiation--insights from transthyretin knockout mice. To better understand the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in bone homeostasis, as its function in the regulation of bone mass is unclear, we assessed its expression in this tissue. By immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated, both at embryonic stages and in the adult, that NPY is synthesized by osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Moreover, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for NPY activation by amidation, was also expressed in these cell types. Using transthyretin (TTR) KO mice as a model of augmented NPY levels, we showed that this strain has increased NPY content in the bone, further validating the expression of this neuropeptide by bone cells. Moreover, the higher amidated neuropeptide levels in TTR KO mice were related to increased bone mineral density and trabecular volume. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis established that NPY is not only expressed in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but is also detectable by RIA in BMSCs undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. In agreement with our in vivo observations, in vitro, TTR KO BMSCs differentiated in osteoblasts had increased NPY levels and exhibited enhanced competence in undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. In summary, this work contributes to a better understanding of the role of NPY in the regulation of bone formation by showing that this neuropeptide is expressed in bone cells and that increased amidated neuropeptide content is related to increased bone mass.

Physicochemical stability of maize germ oil body emulsions as influenced by oil body surface-xanthan gum interactions. Two types of oil body cream, differing in protein content and composition, were prepared from maize germ. The cream rich in extraneous germ proteins (OB-A) constituted of oil bodies with a significantly lower size compared to the cream (OB-W) which was practically free from the extraneous germ proteins. In addition, the stability of the former cream against oil body coalescence was much higher upon long-term aging. Dilution of both creams to a 5% oil body level produced emulsions that were very unstable against creaming. The creaming stability was greatly improved following addition of 0.1% xanthan, the result being more spectacular in the case of the cream rich in extraneous maize germ proteins. The enhancement of the physical stability of oil droplets upon long-term storage is attributed to electrostatic xanthan gum-oil body surface protein interactions, verified by zeta-potential measurements, that lead to the diminution of depletion flocculation effects and to enhancement of steric stabilization due to the adsorption of the polysaccharide molecules to the oil body surface.


Laboratory and field evidence of the photonitration of 4-chlorophenol to 2-nitro-4-chlorophenol and of the associated bicarbonate effect.

Deletion of lec-10, a galectin-encoding gene, increases susceptibility to oxidative stress in Caenorhabditis elegans. Galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding lectins. They are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological phenomena in mammals. However, little is known about their roles in invertebrates. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-characterized model organism whose complete genome has been sequenced. C. elegans is now being studied extensively in various fields of medical sciences. In this study, we examined the phenotypes of a mutant strain of C. elegans (tm1262) lacking lec-10, a galectin-encoding gene. We observed no difference in the rates of embryonic lethality and larval arrest/slow growth between this mutant strain and the wild-type strain. No apparent morphological defect was observed in the lec-10-deletion mutant (tm1262). Moreover, the life-spans of this mutant and the wild-type strain were equivalent. However, this mutant showed significantly greater susceptibility to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide than the wild type did. The lec-10-deletion mutants (tm1262) were as susceptible as the daf-16-deletion mutants (mu86) to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that the deletion of lec-10 does not have a notable effect on the worm's survival under laboratory conditions. However, this study indicates that lec-10 does confer some protection against oxidative stress.

Preoperative predictors of sternotomy need in mediastinal goiter management. The objective of this study was to identify the preoperative risk factors for patients in need of a sternotomy in the management of mediastinal goiters in order to provide better preoperative planning and patient consent. We analyzed 98 patients who underwent surgery for mediastinal goiters (goiters extending below the thoracic inlet > or =3 cm with the neck in hyperextension) between 1995 and 2008. Twelve (12.2%) of the patients required a sternotomy. The patients' features were analyzed by the surgical approach performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to study which variables were influencing the surgical strategy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were designed when appropriate. The analysis disclosed the following risk factors: radiologic extension of mediastinal goiters below the aortic arch (odds ratio [OR] = 32.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.04-267.12; p < .0001); posterior mediastinum involvement for mediastinal goiters with subaortic extension (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.52-34.14; p = .0244); history of mediastinal goiters before surgery (for mediastinal goiters aged >160 months: OR = 22.8; 95% CI = 5.28-98.53; p < .0001). Sternotomy need for mediastinal goiter removal can be predicted; in such cases surgeons should not hesitate to perform it for minimizing complications.

Meta-analysis of breast cancer outcomes in adjuvant trials of aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen. To conduct meta-analyses of randomized trials of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen either as initial monotherapy (cohort 1) or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen (cohort 2). Data submitted to the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group were used in separate meta-analyses of two cohorts. Primary analyses involve postmenopausal women with tumors reported to be estrogen receptor positive. Log-rank P values are two-sided. Cohort 1 comprised 9,856 patients with a mean of 5.8 years of follow-up. At 5 years, AI therapy was associated with an absolute 2.9% (SE = 0.7%) decrease in recurrence (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P < .00001) and a nonsignificant absolute 1.1% (SE = 0.5%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% for tamoxifen; 2P = .1). Cohort 2 comprised 9,015 patients with a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up. At 3 years from treatment divergence (ie, approximately 5 years after starting hormonal treatment), AI therapy was associated with an absolute 3.1% (SE = 0.6%) decrease in recurrence (5.0% for AI v 8.1% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P < .00001) and an absolute 0.7% (SE = 0.3%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (1.7% for AI v 2.4% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P = .02). There was no convincing heterogeneity in the proportional recurrence reduction with respect to age, nodal status, tumor grade, or progesterone receptor status and no indication of an increase in nonbreast deaths with AIs in either cohort. CONCLUSION AIs produce significantly lower recurrence rates compared with tamoxifen, either as initial monotherapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Additional follow-up will provide clearer information on long-term survival.

Noninvasive prenatal exclusion of haemoglobin Bart's using foetal DNA from maternal plasma. Prenatal diagnosis of alpha-thalassaemia requires invasive testing associated with a risk of miscarriage. Cell-free foetal DNA in maternal plasma presents an alternative source of foetal genetic material for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. We aimed to exclude HbBart's noninvasively by detection of unaffected paternal alleles in maternal plasma using quantitative fluorescence PCR (QF-PCR). Microsatellite markers (16PTEL05, 16PTEL06) within the breakpoint regions of -(SEA), -(FIL) and -(THAI) deletions were analysed using QF-PCR of maternal plasma from 30 families. In this blinded study, genotypes were confirmed using conventional PCR. Maternal plasma from two known cases of HbBart's were also analysed. HbBart's was excluded in 10 out of 30 (33.3%, 95% CI, 17.3-52.8%) mothers by identifying the presence of nondeleted paternally inherited fetal alleles; either only 16PTEL05 (n = 1) or only 16PTEL06 (n = 4), or both (n = 5), and confirmed through direct analysis of fetal DNA. Paternally inherited foetal alleles of 16PTEL05 and 16PTEL06 were not detected in maternal plasma of the two known HbBarts cases. False negatives were excluded with the detection of paternally inherited fetal control marker, D21S1270 in maternal plasma. We show proof-of-principle that such a test can accurately exclude HbBart's in the foetus by identifying the nondeleted paternally inherited fetal alleles in maternal plasma in one out of three pregnancies, avoiding invasive testing in these pregnancies.


Endovascular treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm using physician-modified endografts.

Effects of propyphenazone and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents on the synthetic and endogenous androgenic anabolic steroids urinary excretion and/or instrumental detection. This paper describes the effects of oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the endogenous and synthetic anabolic androgenic steroids urinary excretion as assessed by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. Experiments were carried out on 5 male subjects, with pathologies and/or diseases, treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. To set up the individual baseline variability of testosterone and its main metabolites, urine samples were collected for 3 days, every 2 h prior to the administration of the drug(s); whereas the study of the effects of a single dose of each drug, here considered, on the endogenous androgen steroid urinary concentrations, was assessed by collecting urine samples for 2 days, every 2 h. Data obtained after drugs administration were then evaluated taking into account the individual baseline variability. The results showed that, only in the case of propyphenazone administration, the relative urinary concentrations of some testosterone metabolites were significantly altered. More specifically, the urinary levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, 11keto-etiocholanolone, 11beta-hydroxyandrosterone, 11beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone, androsterone, etiocholanolone and some metabolite ratios decrease significantly, generally between 2 and 10 h after administration of the drug, whereas no effects were observed on urinary calculated concentrations of testosterone, epitestosterone, 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol, 5beta-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol and testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The observed effects do not depend on alterations on pharmacokinetics (excretion/metabolism), but on steroid sample preparation steps (hydrolysis and derivatization) inhibition. More specifically the significant decrease of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone metabolites urinary levels was due to a reduced yield of the steroid derivatization step for the presence in urine of the main metabolites of propyphenazone, namely hydroxyl-propyphenazone metabolites.

Persistent type III cavity-spilling coronary perforation due to covered stent malapposition. Coronary perforations are a rare but potentially catastrophic complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. We report a rare case of a large cavity-spilling perforation from the left anterior descending coronary artery into the left ventricle, which was successfully treated with a covered stent. However, repeating angiography 1 week later demonstrated persistence of the perforation due to stent malapposition.

In-vitro effects of Thymus munbyanus essential oil and thymol on human sperm motility and function.

Using a multidimensional scaling approach to investigate the underlying basis of ease of learning judgments. Before studying a material it is of strategic importance to first assess its difficulty, so called Ease of Learning (EOL) judgments. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedure was used to investigate the underlying basis of EOL judgments for 24 nouns, which to the authors' knowledge has not been done before. In addition, Judgments of Learning (JOL) followed by a free recall test was performed. The MDS analysis indicated that EOL judgments for the nouns are based on multiple cues (dimensions), namely word length, frequency, and concreteness. Moreover, the concreteness values of the nouns, as judged by an independent group, were correlated with both the JOLs and the concreteness dimension from the MDS analysis. This indicates that EOLs and JOLs for single words are based, to some extent, on the same cues.

Deterioration of mental health in bariatric surgery after 10 years despite successful weight loss. The present study evaluated the mental health and psychological functioning of bariatric patients before surgery, and after 1 year and 10 year follow-ups, and compared them with participants in a dietary program. Such long follow-up is rare, but strongly recommended by the American Association of Bariatric Surgeons. Thirty-six bariatric surgery patients and 34 participants of a weight loss program were weighed and assessed at all 3 points in time. Participants were administered the mental health inventory, neuroticism, sense of control and fear of intimacy scales. Along with these mental and psychological measurements, the medical outcome short form (SF-36) was used. The surgery group achieved successful weight loss outcomes (27% reduction of pre-operative weight) after 10 years and better than baseline health-related quality-of-life scores. However, their general mental health, neuroticism, sense of control and fear of intimacy scores showed significant deterioration in comparison to pre-operative levels after 10 years. The dietary group participants remained psychologically stable among all three points in time. This study highlights the importance of identifying a risk group among bariatric patients for which the dietary and psychological follow-up may be of special significance.

Increased bone volume and correction of HYP mouse hypophosphatemia in the Klotho/HYP mouse. Inactivating mutations of PHEX cause X-linked hypophosphatemia and result in increased circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 action is dependent upon Klotho, which converts FGF receptor 1 into an FGF23-specific receptor. Disruption of Klotho results in a complex bone phenotype and hyperphosphatemia, the converse phenotype of X-linked hypophosphatemia. We examined effects of disrupting both Klotho and PHEX by creating a double-knockout (Klotho/HYP) mouse. The combined disruption corrected the hypophosphatemia in HYP mice, indicating that Klotho is epistatic to PHEX. FGF23 levels remained elevated in all groups except wild-type, indicating that Klotho is necessary for FGF23-dependent phosphaturic activity. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels, reduced in HYP mice, were comparably elevated in Klotho and Klotho/HYP mice, demonstrating that Klotho is necessary for FGF23's effect on vitamin D metabolism. Serum PTH levels were reduced in both Klotho and Klotho/HYP mice. Moreover, the Klotho null phenotype persisted in Klotho/HYP, maintaining the runty phenotype and decreased life span of Klotho null mice. Notably, microcomputed tomography analysis demonstrated greater trabecular bone volume fraction in Klotho/HYP mice than that in all other groups (Klotho/HYP, 56.2 +/- 6.3%; Klotho, 32.5 +/- 10.3%; HYP, 8.6 +/- 7.7%; and wild type, 21.4 +/- 3.4%; P < 0.004). Histomorphometric analysis confirmed the markedly increased trabecular bone density in Klotho/HYP mice and the well-established increase in osteoid volume in HYP mice. These observations suggest that with addition of Klotho loss of function, the overabundant osteoid typically produced in HYP mice (but fails to mineralize) is produced and mineralized in the double knockout, resulting in markedly enhanced trabecular bone density.


The effect of oral immunomodulatory therapy on treatment uptake and persistence in multiple sclerosis.

Regulating human Th17 cells via differential expression of IL-1 receptor. In humans, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) has been suggested as an essential cytokine for developing IL-17- or IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T helper 17 (Th17) cells. However, little is known about the relationship of IL-1 receptor expression and Th17 cell differentiation. We report here the presence of 2 distinct CD4(+) T-cell populations with and without expression of IL-1RI that correlates with the capacity to produce IL-17 in naive and memory CD4(+) T cells of human peripheral blood. IL-1RI(+) memory CD4(+) T cells had increased gene expression of IL17, RORC, and IRF4 even before T-cell receptor triggering, indicating that the effect of IL-1beta is programmed in these cells via IL-1RI. Although CD4(+) T cells from umbilical cord blood did not express IL-1RI, the cytokines IL-7, IL-15, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) up-regulated IL-1RI expression on naive CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that IL-1RI(+) naive CD4(+) T cells develop in periphery. Furthermore, IL-17 production from the cytokine-treated naive CD4(+) T cells was induced by IL-1beta and this induction was blocked by IL-1R antagonist. These results indicate that human Th17 cell differentiation is regulated via differential expression of IL-1RI, which is controlled by IL-7 and IL-15.

[Association and interaction between the components of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease]. To explore the association and interaction between the components of metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this cohort study, participants (total 3598, male 1451) were recruited and followed up for five years from the program "prevention of multiple metabolic disorders and MS in Jiangsu province". We used modified Asian criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) to define the presence of MS. COX regression was used to analyze the association between the MS and its components with CVD; both the multiplication of blood pressure (BP) and 2, 3, or 4 other components of MS in the logistic regression model and the estimation of the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and the synergy index (S) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were used to evaluate the interactions between the components of MS. After adjustment for traditional CVD risks, the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of CVD was 2.49 (95%CI: 1.59 - 3.90) in the MS group compared with the non-MS group at baseline. The aRRs of MS components to CVD were as follows: 1.44 (95%CI: 0.88 - 2.37) for waist circumference; 2.84 (95%CI: 1.73 - 4.68) for BP; 1.31 (95%CI: 0.83 - 2.07) for low high density lipoprotein; 1.84 (95%CI: 1.19 - 2.85) for triglyceride; 1.55(95%CI: 0.98 - 2.45) for fasting plasma glucose, respectively. BP was the single component significantly related to CVD (aRR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.55 - 4.29). The risk of CVD was significantly increased (aOR = 4.47, 95%CI: 2.35 - 8.51) when BP was combined with 2, 3 or 4 other components of MS in the participants. Only BP is an independent CVD risk factor in the components of MS, the risk of CVD was significantly increased when BP was combined with other components of MS in this cohort.

Acute myocardial infarction secondary to a spontaneous right coronary artery dissection resulting from a sinus of valsalva aneurysm. We describe a case of a female aged 55 years, presenting with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The coronary ischaemia has resulted from a spontaneous right coronary artery dissection due to a right coronary cusp sinus of valsalva aneurysm (SVA). Sinus of valsalva aneurysm is a rare, often congenital, cardiac condition. The SVA rupture may lead to acute haemodynamic instability; therefore, recognition of the condition is important, generally requiring definitive surgical intervention. Right coronary artery ischaemia may result commonly from osteal compression by the SVA, however has never been previously described to occur from spontaneous coronary dissection.


Expression of MDC/CCL22 and its receptor CCR4 in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.

Sleep staging classification based on HRV: time-variant analysis. An algorithm to evaluate the sleep macrostructure based on heart rate fluctuations from ECG signal is presented. This algorithm is an attempt to evaluate the sleep quality out of sleep centers. The algorithm is made up by a) a time-variant autoregressive model used as feature extractor and b) a hidden Markov model used as classifier. Characteristics coming from the joint probability of HRV features were used to fed the HMM. 17 full polysomnography recordings from healthy subjects were used in the current analysis. When compared to Wake-NREM-REM given by experts, the automatic classifier achieved a total accuracy of 78.21+/-6.44% and a kappa index of 0.41+/-.1085 using two features and a total accuracy of 79.43+/-8.83% and kappa index of 0.42+/-.1493 using three features.

Ischemic perinatal stroke secondary to chorioamnionitis: a histopathological case presentation. Ischemic perinatal stroke is a serious potential complication of delivery. In utero infection may be responsible for an underestimated proportion of perinatal stroke. Limited literature identifies objective evidence of ischemic perinatal stroke as a consequence of uterine infection. The authors report a neonate with ischemic stroke and documented findings of severe chorioamnionitis with umbilical vein thrombosis. A term neonate, after uneventful pregnancy and delivery, presented on the third day of life with seizures. Investigations for metabolic, electrolyte, infectious, and hypercoaguability derangements were normal. Extensive acute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Placental histopathology confirmed the presence of chorioamnionitis. On follow-up assessments, mild residual neurologic deficits have persisted. Chorioamnionitis has been correlated with ischemic perinatal stroke. In addition to the recognized inflammatory cascade of in utero infection, umbilical vein thrombosis with subsequent ''paradoxical'' embolization may represent one mechanism responsible for this association.

Onset of exercise training 14 days after uncomplicated myocardial infarction: a randomized controlled trial. Exercise training is an important part of cardiac rehabilitation to reduce morbidity and mortality. Low-intensity exercise training can start as soon as the myocardial infarction (MI) patient is stable. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of an early start of exercise training in MI patients. A randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine MI patients were randomized to either an early start of exercise training group (EG) or to a delayed start control group (CG). The EG participated in an outpatient low-intensity EG (phase 2a) two times a week for 4 weeks before entering ordinary exercise training of moderate-to-high intensity (phase 2b). CG entered phase 2b directly after 4 weeks of delay. Primary outcome measure was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and after 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measure was health-related quality of life. VO2peak did not change from baseline to 4 weeks, either in EG [30.6+/-6.7 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, not significant (NS)] or CG (29.8+/-6.1 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, NS). After 16 weeks VO2peak increased in both groups to 33.1+/-7.1 ml/kg/min in EG (P<0.005) and 33.0 ml/kg/min+/-8.6 in CG (P<0.005), group differences NSH. Health-related quality of life increased in every domain but physical functioning for both groups (group differences NS). An early start of exercise training did not increase VO2peak compared to 4 weeks of delay. For low-risk patients with high motivation for exercise training, home-based walking is an option as a moderate start of cardiac rehabilitation the first weeks after MI.

The effects of bilastine compared with cetirizine, fexofenadine, and placebo on allergen-induced nasal and ocular symptoms in patients exposed to aeroallergen in the Vienna Challenge Chamber. This double-blind cross-over study compared the potential of bilastine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Seventy-five allergic volunteers were challenged with grass pollen in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) on two consecutive days of allergen provocation; 6 h on day 1 and 4 h day 2. Bilastine 20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, fexofenadine 120 mg, or placebo were taken orally 2 h after the start of provocation on day 1 only. Total nasal symptom scores, the global symptom scores, nasal secretions, and eye symptoms were assessed on both day 1 and day 2. Bilastine had a rapid onset of action, within 1 h, and a long duration of action, greater than 26 h. Cetirizine was similar. Fexofenadine was similar on day 1 but less effective on day 2, indicating a shorter duration of action. Bilastine, like cetirizine and fexofenadine, was safe and well tolerated in this study.

Large two-centre study into the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis in the Netherlands.

Subretinal hemorrhages associated with age-related macular degeneration in patients receiving anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for subretinal hemorrhages in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Retrospective, observational case series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical and photographic records of 71 consecutive patients who sought treatment at our institution with acute subretinal hemorrhages complicating age-related macular degeneration. The size of the subretinal hemorrhage was measured in standardized Macular Photocoagulation Study disc areas. Data on the use of medications and medical indications for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy were obtained. Overall, patients receiving antithrombotic therapy had a significantly larger subretinal hemorrhage size (mean, 9.71 disc areas) than patients not receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (mean, 2.99 disc areas). Subgroup analysis revealed that both antiplatelet (P < .0001) and anticoagulant therapy (P = .003) were associated with a significantly larger bleeding size. Moreover, subgroup analysis among patients with arterial hypertension revealed that individuals receiving antithrombotic therapy had a statistically significantly larger hemorrhage size than hypertensive patients who did not receive anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents (P < .0001). Our results indicate that anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are strongly associated with the development of large subretinal hemorrhages in AMD patients. Moreover, arterial hypertension is a strong risk factor for large subretinal hemorrhages in AMD patients receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Physicians should be aware of an increased risk of extensive subretinal hemorrhage in AMD patients when deciding on the initiation and duration of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.

Effect of a live Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine on the production of eggshell apex abnormalities induced by a M. synoviae infection preceded by an infection with infectious bronchitis virus D1466. An experimental study was conducted to assess the effect of a live Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine (Vaxsafe MS; Bioproperties Pty Ltd, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia) on M. synoviae-induced eggshell apex abnormalities (EAA). Four experimental groups of specified-pathogen-free white laying hens were made. All groups were inoculated with infectious bronchitis virus D1466 at 18 weeks of age. One group did not receive further treatment (non-vaccinated non-challenged (NVNC)). Two groups were vaccinated at 14 weeks of age against M. synoviae, and one of these groups was also challenged with an EAA-inducing M. synoviae strain 5 days after infectious bronchitis virus challenge (vaccinated non-challenged (VNC) and vaccinated challenged group (VC), respectively). The fourth group was not vaccinated but was challenged with M. synoviae (non-vaccinated challenged (NVC)). Eggs with EAA eggs were produced only in the NVC and VC groups. However, the proportion of eggs with EAA and the mean daily production of eggs with EAA per chicken was significantly lower (P<0.05) in the VC group (88/741 (11.9%) and 0.09+/-0.01 eggs per hen) compared with the NVC group (148/646 (22.9%) and 0.14+/-0.01 eggs per hen). The mean daily egg production per chicken was significantly lower in the NVC group (0.48+/-0.03 eggs) compared with that of the NVNC group (0.60+/-0.03 eggs), but not significantly different from other groups. The eggshell strength of eggs with EAA (22.8 N) was significantly lower (P<0.05) than non-affected eggs from the other groups (33.7 to 39.5 N). Furthermore, the eggshell strength of non-affected eggs in the NVC group was significantly lower (P<0.05) compared with that of non-affected eggs from the flock of origin (33.7 versus 41.2 N), but not different from the other groups. It can be concluded from the present study that vaccination with a live M. synoviae vaccine reduces the occurrence of M. synoviae-induced EAA significantly.


Improving the outcome of infants born at <30 weeks' gestation--a randomized controlled trial of preventative care at home.

Time trends in brain tumor incidence rates in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 1974-2003. In Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the use of mobile phones increased sharply in the mid-1990s; thus, time trends in brain tumor incidence after 1998 may provide information about possible tumor risks associated with mobile phone use. We investigated time trends in the incidence of glioma and meningioma in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 1974 to 2003, using data from national cancer registries. We used joinpoint regression models to analyze the annual incidence rates of glioma and meningioma. During this period, 59,984 men and women aged 20-79 years were diagnosed with brain tumors in a population of 16 million adults. All statistical tests were two-sided. From 1974 to 2003, the incidence rate of glioma increased by 0.5% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2% to 0.8%) among men and by 0.2% per year (95% CI = -0.1% to 0.5%) among women and that of meningioma increased by 0.8% per year (95% CI = 0.4% to 1.3%) among men, and after the early 1990s, by 3.8% per year (95% CI = 3.2% to 4.4%) among women. No change in incidence trends were observed from 1998 to 2003, the time when possible associations between mobile phone use and cancer risk would be informative about an induction period of 5-10 years.


Hyperbaric oxygen enhances neutrophil apoptosis and their clearance by monocyte-derived macrophages.

Selection of bead-displayed, PNA-encoded chemicals. The lack of efficient identification and isolation methods for specific molecular binders has fundamentally limited drug discovery. Here, we have developed a method to select peptide nucleic acid (PNA) encoded molecules with specific functional properties from combinatorially generated libraries. This method consists of three essential stages: (1) creation of a Lab-on-Bead library, a one-bead, one-sequence library that, in turn, displays a library of candidate molecules, (2) fluorescence microscopy-aided identification of single target-bound beads and the extraction--wet or dry--of these beads and their attached candidate molecules by a micropipette manipulator, and (3) identification of the target-binding candidate molecules via amplification and sequencing. This novel integration of techniques harnesses the sensitivity of DNA detection methods and the multiplexed and miniaturized nature of molecule screening to efficiently select and identify target-binding molecules from large nucleic acid encoded chemical libraries. Beyond its potential to accelerate assays currently used for the discovery of new drug candidates, its simple bead-based design allows for easy screening over a variety of prepared surfaces that can extend this technique's application to the discovery of diagnostic reagents and disease markers.

Direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture bottles by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. With long delays observed between sampling and availability of results, the usefulness of blood cultures in the context of emergency infectious diseases has recently been questioned. Among methods that allow quicker bacterial identification from growing colonies, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was demonstrated to accurately identify bacteria routinely isolated in a clinical biology laboratory. In order to speed up the identification process, in the present work we attempted bacterial identification directly from blood culture bottles detected positive by the automate. We prospectively analysed routine MALDI-TOF identification of bacteria detected in blood culture by two different protocols involving successive centrifugations and then lysis by trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid. Of the 562 blood culture broths detected as positive by the automate and containing one bacterial species, 370 (66%) were correctly identified. Changing the protocol from trifluoroacetic acid to formic acid improved identification of Staphylococci, and overall correct identification increased from 59% to 76%. Lack of identification was observed mostly with viridans streptococci, and only one false positive was observed. In the 22 positive blood culture broths that contained two or more different species, only one of the species was identified in 18 samples, no species were identified in two samples and false species identifications were obtained in two cases. The positive predictive value of bacterial identification using this procedure was 99.2%. MALDI-TOF MS is an efficient method for direct routine identification of bacterial isolates in blood culture, with the exception of polymicrobial samples and viridans streptococci. It may replace routine identification performed on colonies, provided improvement for the specificity of blood culture broths growing viridans streptococci is obtained in the near future.

The most severe forms of type I autoimmune hepatitis are associated with genetically determined levels of TGF-beta1. We previously reported that paediatric (PAH) and adult (AAH) forms of type I autoimmune hepatitis (AH) have different HLA-associations and clinical outcome. In the present study we investigated the role of TGF-beta1 genetic polymorphisms in the different outcome of PAH and AAH. We found a significant increase of "high producer" 25GG genotype in PAH and 10CC in AAH. Low inflammation and low fibrosis in AAH was associated with the increase of codon 10CC (high producer) and codon 25CC (low producer) genotypes. The analysis in AAH of the two positions-haplotypes revealed that combined presence of 25GG and 10CC seems to neutralize the 10CC effect which remained in AAH having the 10CC(+)-25GG(-) haplotype. Altogether these results may explain, at least partially, the different clinical outcome of AAH and PAH.

Aberrant trafficking of NSCLC-associated EGFR mutants through the endocytic recycling pathway promotes interaction with Src. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) controls a wide range of cellular processes, and altered EGFR signaling contributes to human cancer. EGFR kinase domain mutants found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are constitutively active, a trait critical for cell transformation through activation of downstream pathways. Endocytic trafficking of EGFR is a major regulatory mechanism as ligand-induced lysosomal degradation results in termination of signaling. While numerous studies have examined mutant EGFR signaling, the endocytic traffic of mutant EGFR within the NSCLC milieu remains less clear. This study shows that mutant EGFRs in NSCLC cell lines are constitutively endocytosed as shown by their colocalization with the early/recycling endosomal marker transferrin and the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1. Notably, mutant EGFRs, but not the wild-type EGFR, show a perinuclear accumulation and colocalization with recycling endosomal markers such as Rab11 and EHD1 upon treatment of cells with endocytic recycling inhibitor monensin, suggesting that mutant EGFRs preferentially traffic through the endocytic recycling compartments. Importantly, monensin treatment enhanced the mutant EGFR association and colocalization with Src, indicating that aberrant transit through the endocytic recycling compartment promotes mutant EGFR-Src association. The findings presented in this study show that mutant EGFRs undergo aberrant traffic into the endocytic recycling compartment which allows mutant EGFRs to engage in a preferential interaction with Src, a critical partner for EGFR-mediated oncogenesis.

Nonorthogonal tRNA(cys)(Amber) for protein and nascent chain labeling. In vitro-transcribed suppressor tRNAs are commonly used in site-specific fluorescence labeling for protein and ribosome-bound nascent chains (RNCs) studies. Here, we describe the production of nonorthogonal Bacillus subtilis tRNA(cys)(Amber) from Escherichia coli, a process that is superior to in vitro transcription in terms of yield, ease of manipulation, and tRNA stability. As cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase was previously shown to aminoacylate tRNA(cys)(Amber) with lower efficiency, multiple tRNA synthetase mutants were designed to optimize aminoacylation. Aminoacylated tRNA was conjugated to a fluorophore to produce BODIPY FL-cysteinyl-tRNA(cys)(Amber), which was used to generate ribosome-bound nascent chains of different lengths with the fluorophore incorporated at various predetermined sites. This tRNA tool may be beneficial in the site-specific labeling of full-length proteins as well as RNCs for biophysical and biological research.

Loss of Stromal IMP1 Promotes a Tumorigenic Microenvironment in the Colon. The colon tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly recognized as a complex but central player in the development of many cancers. Previously, we identified an oncogenic role for the mRNA-binding protein IMP1 (IGF2BP1) in the epithelium during colon tumorigenesis. In the current study, we reveal the contribution of stromal IMP1 in the context of colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis. Interestingly, stromal deletion of Imp1 (Dermo1Cre;Imp1(LoxP/LoxP), or Imp1(ΔMes)) in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colitis-associated cancer resulted in increased tumor numbers of larger size and more advanced histologic grade than controls. In addition, Imp1(ΔMes) mice exhibited a global increase in protumorigenic microenvironment factors, including enhanced inflammation and stromal components. Evaluation of purified mesenchyme from AOM/DSS-treated Imp1(ΔMes) mice demonstrated an increase in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which has not been associated with regulation via IMP1. Genetic knockdown of Imp1 in human primary fibroblasts confirmed an increase in HGF with Imp1 loss, demonstrating a specific, cell-autonomous role for Imp1 loss to increase HGF expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel tumor-suppressive role for IMP1 in colon stromal cells and underscore an exquisite, context-specific function for mRNA-binding proteins, such as IMP1, in disease states. The tumor-suppressive role of stromal IMP1 and its ability to modulate protumorigenic factors suggest that IMP1 status is important for the initiation and growth of epithelial tumors.

The oral susceptibility of South African field populations of Culicoides to African horse sickness virus. Twenty-two isolates of African horse sickness virus (AHSV), representing its distinct serotypes, geographical and historical origins, were fed to three populations of South African livestock-associated Culicoides spp. (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae). Infective blood meals included 12 recent isolates, nine historical reference strains and one live attenuated vaccine strain serotype 7 (AHSV-7) of the virus. Field-collected midges were fed through a chicken-skin membrane on sheep blood spiked with one of the viruses, which concentrations ranged from 5.4 to 8.8 log(10)TCID(50)/mL of blood. After 10 days incubation at 23.5 degrees C, AHSV was isolated from 11 Culicoides species. Standard in vitro passaging of AHSV-7, used for the preparation of live attenuated vaccine, did not reduce its ability to infect Culicoides species. Virus recovery rates in orally infected Culicoides midges differed significantly between species and populations, serotypes, isolates and seasons. Significant variations in oral susceptibility recorded in this study emphasize a complex inter-relationship between virus and vector, which is further influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. As it is not possible to standardize all these factors under laboratory conditions, conclusive assessment of the role of field-collected Culicoides midges in the transmission of orbiviruses remains problematic. Nevertheless, results of this study suggest the potential for multi-vector transmission of AHSV virus in South Africa.

APOE-epsilon4 is not associated with cognitive impairment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The objective of this article was to assess the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 and cognitive impairment (CI) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The APOE genotype was assessed in 85 RRMS cases (58 females, mean age 43 +/- 8.4 years, mean disease duration 15.8 +/- 9.6 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 1.7 +/- 1.0). Cognitive functioning was evaluated in the whole sample using Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB). Performance on each test was assessed by applying the normative values for the Italian population. In a subgroup of 50 patients, a brain magnetic resonance (MR) study was performed including measurement of T2 lesion volumes (T2LV), neocortical volume (NCV) and normalized brain volume (NBV). The relationship between APOE genotype, CI and MR variables was assessed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. CI, most commonly involving complex attention and verbal memory tasks, was found in 28 cases (33%). We identified a total of 19 epsilon4carriers (22.4%), who did not differ from non-carriers regarding clinical and demographic characteristics. The presence of the epsilon4 genotype was associated with neither CI (p = 0.28) nor impairment on each neuropsychological test (p > 0.32; corrected for age, gender, disease duration, EDSS, depression and fatigue). The APOE genotype and CI were also not related in the subgroup of younger patients (age < 45 years; p > 0.9). Moreover, CI was related to higher T2LV (p = 0.008) and lower NCV (p = 0.006). In conclusion, in our sample CI was associated with higher subcortical damage and cortical atrophy but not with APOE-epsilon4 genotype. The role of APOE-epsilon4 as a possible biomarker in multiple sclerosis is still questionable.

Preclinical imaging and treatment of cancer: the use of animal models beyond rodents. The development of novel radiopharmaceutical agents for imaging and therapy of neoplastic diseases relies on accurate and reproducible animal models. Rodent models are often used to demonstrate the proof-of-principle tracer and therapeutic agent development, but their small size can make tissue sampling challenging. The dosimetry of decay emissions in the much smaller rodent tumors do not model dosimetry in human tumors well. In addition, rodent models of cancer represent a simplified version of a very complex process. Spontaneous tumors are heterogenous and the response to intervention can be unpredictable; tumor cells can adopt alternate signaling pathways and modify their interaction with the microenvironment. These inconsistencies, while present in humans, are difficult to fully reproduce in a genetically-engineered rodent model. Companion animals, primarily dogs and cats, offer translational models that more accurately reflect the intricate nature of spontaneous neoplasia in humans. Their larger size facilitates tissue and blood sampling when needed, and allows radiopharmaceutical tracers to be studied on human-scale imaging systems to better mimic the clinical application of the agent. This article will review the growing body of literature surrounding the use of radiopharmaceutical agents for both imaging and therapy in companion dogs and cats. Previous investigations have been performed both for the advancement of routine, high-level veterinary care, and in the context of translational research from which the results of imaging and treatment can be readily applied to people. Studies utilizing the spontaneously occurring cancer model in companion animals involving positron emission tomography, radiotracers, dosimetry, theranostics, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, brachytherapy, and boron neutron capture therapy are discussed.

Genetic mapping of social interaction behavior in B6/MSM consomic mouse strains. Genetic studies are indispensable for understanding the mechanisms by which individuals develop differences in social behavior. We report genetic mapping of social interaction behavior using inter-subspecific consomic strains established from MSM/Ms (MSM) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Two animals of the same strain and sex, aged 10 weeks, were introduced into a novel open-field for 10 min. Social contact was detected by an automated system when the distance between the centers of the two animals became less than approximately 12 cm. In addition, detailed behavioral observations were made of the males. The wild-derived mouse strain MSM showed significantly longer social contact as compared to B6. Analysis of the consomic panel identified two chromosomes (Chr 6 and Chr 17) with quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for lengthened social contact in MSM mice and two chromosomes (Chr 9 and Chr X) with QTL that inhibited social contact. Detailed behavioral analysis of males identified four additional chromosomes associated with social interaction behavior. B6 mice that contained Chr 13 from MSM showed more genital grooming and following than the parental B6 strain, whereas the presence of Chr 8 and Chr 12 from MSM resulted in a reduction of those behaviors. Longer social sniffing was observed in Chr 4 consomic strain than in B6 mice. Although the frequency was low, aggressive behavior was observed in a few pairs from consomic strains for Chrs 4, 13, 15 and 17, as well as from MSM. The social interaction test has been used as a model to measure anxiety, but genetic correlation analysis suggested that social interaction involves different aspects of anxiety than are measured by open-field test.

[Airway neutrophils apoptosis in children with severe asthma]. To investigate the changes of neutrophils in airway inflammation in children with severe asthma. Children with mild to moderate asthma (n=23), severe asthma (n=16) and healthy control subjects (n=16) underwent lung function tests and sputum induction. The sputum specimens were assayed for cellular differential count, the supernatant and peripheral blood were assayed for the concentrations of IL-8 by "sandwich" enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sputum supernatant, IL-8 and mifepristone were assessed for their abilities to prolong the in vitro survival of blood-derived neutrophils. The percentage of sputum neutrophils was significantly higher in severe asthmatics [59.54 (41.99-74.65)%] than mild-moderate asthmatics [30.03 (15.94-47.71)%] and healthy control subjects [29.72(16.53-45.74)%] (P < 0. 01); the level of IL-8 in sputum was significantly higher in severe asthmatics [2907.78 (331.67 - 3457.93) ng/L] than mild-moderate asthmatics [287.58 (130.75-656.84) ng/L] and healthy control subjects [179.2 (58.55-346.59) ng/L] (P < 0.01); the percentages of neutrophilic apoptosis respectively cultured with LPS [(10.57 +/- 1.97)%], severe asthmatics supernatant [(11.82 +/- 2.96)%], IL-8 [(10.47 +/- 1.93)%], dexamethasone [(9.93 +/- 1.95)%], severe asthma supernatant + mifepristone [(12.15 +/- 2.86)%] in vitro were lower than that cultured with PBS [(17.98 +/- 2.27)%], healthy control supernatant [(17.37 +/- 2.50)%], mild-moderate asthmatics supernatant [(16.35 +/- 3.26)%], mifepristone [(17.89 +/- 2.38)%], and dexamethasone + mifepristone [(17.06 +/- 2.59)%] (P < 0.01). Suppression of neutrophilic apoptosis seems to play a potential role in airway neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthmatics, and the level of IL-8 in sputum was significantly higher in patients with severe asthmatics.

Relationship between body mass index and insulin resistance in patients treated with second generation antipsychotic agents. Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) can increase weight gain and weight-induced insulin resistance. Recent studies have suggested weight-independent effects of certain SGAs on insulin resistance; however the magnitude of these effects and the relationship between BMI and insulin resistance in patients on SGAs are not established. To evaluate, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance in 54 patients being stably treated with olanzapine (n=19), risperidone (n=16), or aripiprazole (n=19) was compared with data from a large reference population (n=201) not on SGAs. Insulin resistance was directly quantified by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration during the insulin suppression test. The relationship between BMI and SSPG was similar between the SGA (r=0.58) and the reference population (r=0.50). When SSPG was standardized based on expected values for the reference population, patients on olanzapine had a higher degree of insulin resistance (mean z-score+/-SD, 0.68+/-0.9) than expected for level of BMI compared with those on aripiprazole (-0.25+/-1) and risperidone (-0.3+/-0.9), F(2,51)=6.28 (p=0.004). Thus, olanzapine group was 0.76 SD above the reference population or in the 78 percentile for insulin resistance. SSPG was correlated with fasting plasma insulin concentration (0.78 (0.64-0.87), p<0.001) but not fasting glucose concentration (0.15 (-0.13-0.40), p=0.29). In conclusion, BMI contributes a quarter to a third of the variance in insulin resistance in the SGA population similar to the reference population. Olanzapine also appears to have an independent effect on insulin resistance that is above and beyond obesity.

Spring 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in King County, Washington. In April 2009, King County, Washington, experienced a sustained outbreak of 2009 H1N1 influenza A. This report describes the epidemiology of that outbreak in King County, home to a diverse population of 1.9 million people. The 2 primary sources of data are case investigations of reported laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza A and a population-based syndromic surveillance system that captures data from emergency departments (EDs). A syndromic category for influenza-like illness was defined based on chief complaint and diagnosis. ED visits for influenza-like illness peaked quickly in the first week of the outbreak and remained high for approximately 6 weeks, with school-age children accounting for the greater number of ED visits, followed by young adults. Children ages 0 to 4 years had the highest rate of hospitalization. Among reported cases, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics were more likely to be hospitalized. Predisposing factors associated with admission were immune compromise, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, pregnancy, diabetes, and asthma. Of people receiving antiviral treatment, 34% started their medication more than 2 calendar days after the onset of illness. Mean days between illness onset and antiviral treatment were greater for blacks, Hispanics, and foreign language speakers. The spring 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak disproportionately affected children, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities. Opportunities exist to improve the timeliness of antiviral treatment. Potential barriers to care for racial and ethnic minorities should be proactively addressed to ensure prompt evaluation and treatment.

[Protective effect of GnRH analogues on the reproductive capacity of women with neoplasia or autoimmune disease who require chemotherapy. Final results of a phase ii clinical trial]. In order to avoid the toxic effect of chemotherapy, it has been proposed to use GnRH agonist analogues (GnRHa) to inhibit the depletion of ovarian follicles. Nevertheless, there is controversy about its effectiveness. This clinical trial has been conducted with the aim to assess the protective effect of GnRH analogues on the reproductive capacity of women with malignancies or autoimmune diseases, which require chemotherapy. Open phase ii single-center clinical trial. During chemotherapy, a total of 5 doses of GnRH antagonist analogue at a dose interval of 3 days and/or a monthly dose of GnRHa were administered. Hormonal determinations prior to the start of the CT treatment were conducted during treatment and at the end of it. The inclusion of patients was prematurely concluded when incorporating the determination of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as a parameter for assessing the ovarian reserve. Out of 38 patients, 23 (60.5%, 95%CI 43.4-76.0) had AMH values below normal following completion of treatment. An intermediate analysis was carried out observing that while most patients were recovering the menstrual cycle (86.6% 95%CI 71.9-95.6), they had reduced levels of AMH. Although most patients recovered their menstrual cycles, the ovarian reserve, assessed by the concentration of AMH, decreased in many patients. Therefore, we can conclude that the concomitant treatment of chemotherapy and GnRH analogues does not preserve the loss of follicular ovarian reserve.

Distribution of traction forces associated with shape changes during amoeboid cell migration. Amoeboid motility results from the cyclic repetition of shape changes leading to periodic oscillations of the cell length (motility cycle). We analyze the dominant modes of shape change and their association to the traction forces exerted on the substrate using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of time-lapse measurements of cell shape and traction forces in migrating Dictyostelium cells. Using wild-type cells (wt) as reference, we investigated Myosin II activity by studying Myosin II heavy chain null cells (mhcA-) and Myosin II essential light chain null cells (mlcE-). We found that wt, mlcE-and mhcA- cells utilize similar modes of shape changes during their motility cycle, although these shape changes are implemented at a slower pace in Myosin II null mutants. The number of dominant modes of shape changes is surprisingly few with only four modes accounting for 75% of the variance in all cases. The three principal shape modes are dilation/elongation, bending, and bulging of the front/back. The second mode, resulting from sideways protrusion/retraction, is associated to lateral asymmetries in the cell traction forces, and is significantly less important in mhcA- cells. These results indicate that the mechanical cycle of traction stresses and cell shape changes remains remarkably similar for all cell lines but is slowed down when myosin function is lost, probably due to a reduced control on the spatial organization of the traction stresses.

Selenoprotein T deficiency alters cell adhesion and elevates selenoprotein W expression in murine fibroblast cells. Mammalian selenoproteins have diverse functions, cellular locations, and evolutionary histories, but all use the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), often present in the enzyme's active site. Only about half of mammalian selenoproteins have been functionally characterized, with most being oxidoreductases. The cellular role of selenoprotein T (SelT), manifesting a CxxU motif in a thioredoxin-like fold and localized to Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, is not known. To examine its biological function, we knocked down SelT expression in mouse fibroblast cells and found that SelT deficiency alters cell adhesion and enhances the expression of several oxidoreductase genes, while decreasing the expression of genes involved in cell structure organization, suggesting the involvement of SelT in redox regulation and cell anchorage. Furthermore, we found that the loss of SelT elevates expression of another selenoprotein, selenoprotein W (SepW1). SelT and SepW1 belong to the same protein family, suggesting that SepW1 may functionally compensate for SelT.

Making evidence-based medicine (EBM) doable in developing countries: a locally-tailored workshop for EBM in a Pakistani institution. To demonstrate that evidence-based medicine (EBM) training can be imparted in developing countries using minimal resources. Development of a minimal cost workshop with validation of gain in EBM skills using the Berlin questionnaire. Teaching hospital in Pakistan. Multidisciplinary faculty from The Shifa College of Medicine and Nursing, Pakistan. A 14-hour locally-tailored McMaster-style workshop, using a problem-based, learner-focused small group format, with pre- and post-workshop evaluation of EBM skills. Analysis of the pre- and post-Berlin questionnaires of the participants revealed that the pre-workshop Berlin questionnaire score for the group was 4.7+/-2.3, with a post-workshop Berlin score of 7.6+/-1.0 (p<0.001). EBM workshops can be locally-tailored in developing countries, where access to such workshops is generally not available. Workshops can serve to promote EBM skills in faculty, who can then help to disseminate and model concepts. The process increases awareness and interest in EBM, which in this case resulted in formation of a national platform for EBM.

Modeling limbic influences on habituation deficits in chronic tinnitus aurium. About 93% of healthy subjects suffer from tinnituslike symptoms when deprived of auditory stimuli, e.g., in a sound-proof chamber. This suggests an underlying physiological mechanism causing auditory sensations during absence of an external sound source. Grossberg suggested a mechanism by which hallucinations arise from mechanisms of learning, attention and volition. According to this mechanism notch-like hearing deficits are sufficient for experiencing auditory hallucinations, while their chronification is attributed to reorganization processes. In tinnitus sufferers the auditory sensation is accompanied by the inability to habituate to this endogenous sound. This disability might originate from a coactivation of brain areas that are only indirectly involved in cognitive processing such as areas belonging to the limbic system. Moreover subjective loudness of the tinnitus sensation is likely to depend on the amount of selective attention assigned to the tinnitus stream. Here we propose a functional model of pure-tone tinnitus in which exogenous and endogenous input into processing modules is represented as streams. We model the selection of the tinnitus stream at the subthalamic level according to its weighting. Then we propose a mechanism for the inability to habituate to this stream due to limbic coactivation and amplification by mechanisms of attentional guidance, and by the influence corticofugal projections on lower auditory processing stages. The model is able to replicate the phase stability of auditory evoked potentials as seen in tinnitus sufferers and controls.

The Prevalence and Spectrum of α-Thalassemia in Guizhou Province of South China. α-Thalassemia (α-thal) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases in the world and is especially frequent in tropical and subtropical regions, including South China. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of α-thal in Guizhou Province as this information was unknown. A total of 40 α-thal carriers were determined in 1219 newborn umbilical cord blood samples by hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis combined with DNA analysis, which revealed that the carrier rate of α-thal in Guizhou Province was 3.28%. One thousand and forty-five individuals referred to our hospital were tested for α-thal mutations. Two hundred and twenty-four cases were determined as α-thal carriers or patients. A total of 11 genotypes and five different α-thal mutations were identified in these 224 cases. Of these mutations, more than 96.0% were deletions, including - -(SEA) (65.89%), -α(3.7) (rightward) (22.87%) and -α(4.2) (leftward) (7.74%). The other two nondeletional mutations, Hb Constant Spring (Hb CS, α(CS)α, HBA2: c.427T > C) and Hb Quong Sze [Hb QS, α(QS)α, HBA2: c.377T > C (or HBA1)] account for 2.71% and 0.78%, respectively. The results of this study will be useful in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (PND) of α-thal in Guizhou Province. 

Robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. A case report. Distal pancreatectomy (DP) is the removal of the pancreatic tissue at the left side of the superior mesenteric vein and it is traditionally approached by an open or laparoscopic exposure. Preservation of the spleen is optional but appears to have a better immunological outcome. We present the case of a 53-year old patient with a 2.4/2.2 tumor located in the tail of the pancreas, with high tumour marker values for whom we decided to perform a robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP). The postoperative outcome was satisfactory. In conclusion, we recommend this type of approach for small pancreatic tail lesions.

[Screening of differentially expressed genes from patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome by gene chip analysis]. To investigate the differential gene expression profile from patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) by oligonucleotide microarray technique. Total RNA of 3 probands with BBS and 4 healthy siblings were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. Then the cDNAs were subjected for microarray screening with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. Genechip scanner was applied to screen the hybridization signals. Genes differentially expressed between the BBS probands and controls were identified by using GCOS1.4 software with the standard of two-fold change (P<0.05) of expression. Fifteen genes were up-regulated 2 or more fold and another 15 genes were down-regulated 2 or more fold in the BBS patients, among them 12 genes were related to signaling pathway and cell cycle by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The differentially expressed genes identified may correlate with the function or structure of cilia. Their roles in the BBS genesis need to be further studied.

Together they stand: A life-threatening event reduces individual behavioral variability in groups of voles. In the present study, voles were exposed to owl attack as a group, with their cage mates and in their familiar cages. The anxiety level of each vole was assessed using two parameters: time spent in the open arm of an elevated plus maze; and time spent away from the walls of an open field. Each parameter was measured 24h before and after the group exposure to the owls. We found that the large individual differences in the voles' behavior measured before exposure to the owls were significantly reduced following exposure. In other words, after exposure all individual voles began to behave the same both in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. This response, as measured 24h after the exposure to the owls, differs from past studies, where individual voles diverge in their immediate response in order to confuse the attacking owl. We suggest that the present finding on reduction in individual differences is a group effect reminiscent of the social response seen in humans following a disaster, when a uniform behavioral code dominates and trims down behavioral variability.

Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid accumulation, and inflammatory gene expression in hepatic cells. There is increasing evidence that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to the development of atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of increased hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) flux on ER stress levels and the complications of ER stress associated with diabetes and atherosclerosis in hepatic cells. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, was overexpressed in HepG2 cells by use of an adenoviral expression system. The ER stress response and downstream effects, including activation of lipid and inflammatory pathways, were determined using real-time PCR, immunoblot analysis, and cell staining techniques. GFAT overexpression resulted in increased expression of ER stress markers, including Grp78, Grp94, calreticulin, and GADD153, relative to cells infected with an empty adenoviral vector. In addition, GFAT overexpression promoted lipid, but not cholesterol, accumulation in hepatic cells as well as inflammatory pathway activation. Treatment with 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine, a GFAT antagonist, blocked the effects of GFAT overexpression. Consistent with our in vitro data, hyperglycemic mice presented with elevated markers of hepatic ER stress, glucosamine and lipid accumulation. Together, these data suggest that HBP flux-induced ER stress plays a role in the development of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis under conditions of hyperglycemia.

Combination therapy in the prevention of PONV after strabismus surgery in children: granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam with dexamethasone. Pediatric strabismus surgery is commonly associated with higher incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Mixtures of different classes of antiemetics have been used successfully to decrease the incidence of PONV but there was no agreement on the optimal combination. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam combination with dexamethasone in the prevention of PONV following strabismus repair in pediatric population. Healthy 100 children ASA class I and II aged 4-12 years, scheduled for elective strabismus surgery, were enrolled in this study. No premedications were given anesthesia was induced by inhalational technique using sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture. After induction, fentanyl and atracurium were given and an endotracheal tube was inserted. Patients were randomly divided into four groups which received intravenously either: Placebo, or a combination of granisetron 10 microg/kg(-1), ondansetron 50 microg/kg(-1), midazolam 50 microg/kg(-1), plus dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg(-1) after induction of anesthesia and before start of surgery. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia were recorded. The incidence ofpostoperative nausea was 48%, 8%, 12% and 0% while the incidence of vomiting was 52%, 12%, 4% and 0% in placebo, granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam and dexamethasone combination groups respectively. No difference was detected between combination groups (P value > 0.05). Prophylactic administration of either of either granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam combined with dexamethasone markedly decreases the incidence of PONV following strabismus surgery in pediatrics. All combinations are equally effective.

ERK signaling mediates CaSR-promoted axon growth. The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein coupled receptor that monitors the systemic extracellular free ionized calcium level ([Ca(2+)]o) in organs involved in systemic [Ca(2+)]o homeostasis. CaSR is widely expressed in the nervous system and its activation promotes axon and dendrite growth during development, but the mechanism by which it does this is not known. Here we show that enhanced axon growth and branching from cultured embryonic sympathetic neurons by activation of the endogenous CaSR depends on the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). Our observation that activation of overexpressed CaSR promotes axon growth in NGF-free medium has enabled us to investigate CaSR downstream signaling contributing to axon growth in the absence of NGF signaling. We show that activation of overexpressed CaSR leads to activation of ERK1 and ERK2, and pharmacological inhibition of CaSR-dependent ERK1/ERK2 activation prevents CaSR-dependent axon growth. Analysis of axon growth from cultured neurons expressing deletion mutants of the CaSR cytoplasmic tail revealed that the region between alanine 877 and glycine 907 is required for promoting axon growth that is distinct from the high-affinity filamin-A binding site that has previously been implicated in ERK1/ERK2 activation.

Anti-inflammatory Effects of Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Administered as an Adjunct to General Anesthesia: A Meta-analysis. The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the effects of dexmedetomidine on serum inflammatory markers when administered perioperatively. We searched multiple electronic databases for relevant research papers, and carried out meta-analyses of weighted mean differences and interpreted in the light of statistical heterogeneity (I(2)). Fifteen RCTs recruiting 641 patients were included. Dexmedetomidine treatment significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels with mean differences [95% CI] in the changes from baseline between dexmedetomidine treated and controls of -25.14 [-35.29, -15.00]; P < 0.00001 (for IL-6), -5.69 [-10.77, -0.60]; P < 0.04 (for IL-8), and -20.30 [-30.93, -9.67]; P < 0.0002 (for TNF-α) immediately after surgery; and -41.55 [-57.41, -25.70]; P < 0.00001 (IL-6), -6.46 [-10.83, -2.08]; P < 0.005 (IL-8), and -14.67 [-22.61, -6.73]; P < 0.0003 (TNF-α) on postoperative day 1 (random effects). IL-10 levels were found to increase significantly a day after surgery (8.33 [3.31, 13.36]; P = 0.001). Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences. In conclusion, perioperative adjunctive use of dexmedetomidine substantially decreases serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels. 

Nitric oxide contributes to the augmented vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise. We tested the hypotheses that (1) nitric oxide (NO) contributes to augmented skeletal muscle vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise and (2) the combined inhibition of NO production and adenosine receptor activation would attenuate the augmented vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise more than NO inhibition alone. In separate protocols subjects performed forearm exercise (10% and 20% of maximum) during normoxia and normocapnic hypoxia (80% arterial O(2) saturation). In protocol 1 (n = 12), subjects received intra-arterial administration of saline (control) and the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). In protocol 2 (n = 10), subjects received intra-arterial saline (control) and combined L-NMMA-aminophylline (adenosine receptor antagonist) administration. Forearm vascular conductance (FVC; ml min(-1) (100 mmHg)(-1)) was calculated from forearm blood flow (ml min(-1)) and blood pressure (mmHg). In protocol 1, the change in FVC (Delta from normoxic baseline) due to hypoxia under resting conditions and during hypoxic exercise was substantially lower with L-NMMA administration compared to saline (control; P < 0.01). In protocol 2, administration of combined L-NMMA-aminophylline reduced the DeltaFVC due to hypoxic exercise compared to saline (control; P < 0.01). However, the relative reduction in DeltaFVC compared to the respective control (saline) conditions was similar between L-NMMA only (protocol 1) and combined L-NMMA-aminophylline (protocol 2) at 10% (-17.5 +/- 3.7 vs. -21.4 +/- 5.2%; P = 0.28) and 20% (-13.4 +/- 3.5 vs. -18.8 +/- 4.5%; P = 0.18) hypoxic exercise. These findings suggest that NO contributes to the augmented vasodilatation observed during hypoxic exercise independent of adenosine.

[Epigenetics and pseudohypoparathyroidism]. Parental imprinting and the type of the genetic alteration play a determinant role in the phenotype expression of GNAS locus associated to pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). This imprint is tissue-specific, mainly localized in the kidney and the thyroid. Only the maternal allele is expressed at this level. An alteration in the coding sequence of the gene leads to an haplo-insufficiency and a dysmorphic phenotype (Albright's syndrome). If the alteration is on the maternal allele, there is a hormonal resistance to the PTH at the kidney level and to the TSH at the thyroid level. The phenotype is known as a PHP1a. If the alteration is on the paternal allele, there are few clinical signs with no hormonal resistance and the phenotype is known as pseudo-pseudo-hypoparathyroidism (PPHP). Methylation anomalies of GNAS locus, in particular of exon 1A, are responsible for a lack of expression of Gαs at kidney and thyroid levels only. If these anomalies concern the maternal allele (the only one expressed) with a paternal pattern, there is no haplo-insufficiency and no dysmorphic syndrome. The hormonal resistance is yet again limited to PTH and TSH. The phenotype is known as PHP1b. In the familial forms, these methylation anomalies are associated with a deletion of the syntaxine 16 gene in the maternal allele. This gene contains probably the imprinting center of the locus.

Manganese exposure among smelting workers: relationship between blood manganese-iron ratio and early onset neurobehavioral alterations. A biomarker for detection of early onset neurobehavioral alterations in manganism remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to use a neurobehavioral test battery to identify subtle changes in Mn-induced motor and memory dysfunction and to relate the quantifiable neurological dysfunction to an established Mn-exposure index such as blood manganese-iron ratio (MIR). A total of 323 subjects were recruited to control (n=106), low-exposure (122), and high-exposure (95) groups. The test battery consisted of standard testing procedures including the nine-hole and groove-type steadiness tester, Benton visual retention test, and Purdue pegboard coordination test. No significant health problems or clinically diagnosed neurological dysfunctions were observed. Benton test did not reveal any abnormal memory deficits among Mn-exposed smelters, nor did the groove and nine-hole tests detect any abnormality in dynamic and static steadiness in tested subjects. Purdue pegboard test showed a remarkable age-related decline in fine movement coordination among all study participants regardless of the Mn-exposure condition. Mn exposure significantly exacerbated this age-related deterioration. Statistical modeling revealed that the plasma and erythrocyte MIR (i.e., pMIR and eMIR, respectively) were associated with Purdue pegboard scores. Among all subjects whose MIR were above the cut-off value (COV), pMIR was significantly correlated with pegboard scores (r=-0.261, p=0.002), whereas for those subjects over the age of 40, the eMIR, but not pMIR, was associated with declined pegboard performance (r=-0.219, p=0.069). When both factors were taken into account (i.e., age>40 and MIR>the COV), only pMIR was inversely associated with pegboard scores. Combining their usefulness in Mn-exposure assessment, we recommend that the blood Mn-Fe ratio may serve as a reasonable biomarker not only for assessment of Mn exposure but also for health risk assessment.

Global trends in infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface. The role and significance of wildlife-livestock interfaces in disease ecology has largely been neglected, despite recent interest in animals as origins of emerging diseases in humans. Scoping review methods were applied to objectively assess the relative interest by the scientific community in infectious diseases at interfaces between wildlife and livestock, to characterize animal species and regions involved, as well as to identify trends over time. An extensive literature search combining wildlife, livestock, disease, and geographical search terms yielded 78,861 publications, of which 15,998 were included in the analysis. Publications dated from 1912 to 2013 and showed a continuous increasing trend, including a shift from parasitic to viral diseases over time. In particular there was a significant increase in publications on the artiodactyls-cattle and bird-poultry interface after 2002 and 2003, respectively. These trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. Among the top 10 diseases identified by this review, the majority were zoonoses. Prominent wildlife-livestock interfaces resulted largely from interaction between phylogenetically closely related and/or sympatric species. The bird-poultry interface was the most frequently cited wildlife-livestock interface worldwide with other interfaces reflecting regional circumstances. This review provides the most comprehensive overview of research on infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface to date. 

Statistical analysis and modeling of variance in the SA-I mechanoreceptor response to sustained indentation. The slowly-adapting type I mechanoreceptor (SA-I) exhibits variability in its steady-state firing rate both within an afferent upon repeated stimulation and between afferents. Additionally, inter-spike intervals of the SA-I are extremely variable during this steady-state firing. While variability of the SA-I response has been noted previously, the work presented herein provides a finer analysis of the impact of force and fiber on the SA-I response. Specifically, we test two hypotheses, that 1) fiber-to-fiber variation will significantly impact firing rate over the range of applied forces, and that 2) fiber-to-fiber variation will significantly impact the coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-spike intervals over the range of applied forces. Utilizing an ex vivo skin nerve preparation in the mouse, experiments were conducted with six SA-I fibers from five mice, and with compressive stimuli with force magnitudes up to 9.59 mN. We found fiber to significantly impact both firing rate and CV. These findings motivated the construction of a generalized input (force)-output (firing rate) model composed of a baseline response profile and a multiplicative fiber sensitivity factor. This work will inform future efforts to attribute variability to differences in skin, neuron, and receptor properties, and will contribute to the understanding of how much variability is acceptable in systems designed to provide tactile feedback to the nervous system.

Evaluation of ceftriaxone utilization at multicenter study. As bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has grown due to the increasing use of antimicrobial agents, we sought to evaluate the suitability of ceftriaxone usage (representative of third generation cephalosporins) at 10 university hospitals in Korea. We prospectively evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotic usage in 400 adult patients who received ceftriaxone between February 1, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Drug utilization evaluation (DUE) methods were based on standards set forth by the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists. The DUE criteria used in this study were modified to be more suitable in our hospital setting: justification of drug use, critical and process indications, complications, and outcome measures. The average patient age was 64.4 years. The utilization of ceftriaxone was appropriate in 262 cases (65.5%) for the justification of use, while inappropriate use was observed in 138 cases (34.5%). Common reasons for inappropriate use of ceftriaxone included continued empiric use for presumed infections, prophylactic perioperative injection, and empiric therapy for fever. Most of the critical indications showed a high rate of suitability (66.5-98.5%). Complications occurred in 37 cases (9.3%). With respect to outcome measures, clinical responses were observed in 60.7% of cases, while only 15.7% of cases showed evidence of infection eradication via negative cultures. Appropriate use (65.5%) of ceftriaxone was higher than inappropriate use (34.5%) at university hospitals in Korea. Inappropriate utilization, however, including continued empiric use for presumed infections and prophylactic perioperative injection remained high. Intensification of educational programs and antibiotic control systems for ceftriaxone is needed to improve the suitability of antimicrobial use.

The effects of human recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment during in vitro maturation of porcine oocyte on subsequent embryonic development. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is required for proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells. It is also a biomarker of human oocyte developmental competence for embryo implantation. In humans, the G-CSF concentration peaks during the ovulatory phase of the ovarian cycle. In this study, the expressions of G-CSF and its receptor were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction in granulosa cells (GCs), CL, cumulus cells (CCs), and oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were aspirated from antral follicles of 1 to 3 mm (small follicles) and 4 to 6 mm (medium follicles). Cumulus-oocyte complexes from two kinds of follicles were matured in protein-free maturation medium supplemented with various concentrations of G-CSF (0, 10, and 100 ng/mL). By real-time polymerase chain reaction, the expressions of G-CSF and its receptor were detected in GCs, CL, CCs, and oocytes. Interestingly, the G-CSF transcript levels were significantly lower in oocytes than in the other cell types, whereas the G-CSF receptor transcript levels in oocytes were similar to those in GCs. After 44 hours of IVM, no differences in the rate of nuclear maturation were detected; however, the intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in oocytes from both groups of follicles matured with 10 ng/mL of human recombinant G-CSF (hrG-CSF) groups were significantly lower (P < 0.05). After parthenogenetic activation, the cleavage rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (63.3%) follicles than in 0, 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (38.6% and 49.0%, respectively) follicles and 0 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (52.1%) follicles, and the cleavage rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (76.3%) follicles than in all other groups. The blastocyst formation rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (31.2%) follicles than in 0 and 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF small (10.4% and 15.6%, respectively) follicles, and the 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF medium (45.7%) follicle was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in all other groups. The total cell number in blastocysts from the 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF medium (106.5) follicles was significantly (P < 0.05) increased compared to 0, 10, 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF small (55.0, 73.7 and 59.5, respectively) follicles and 0, 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (82.5 and 93.5, respectively) follicles. After IVF, the blastocysts stage was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (36.4%) follicles. Fertilization efficiency was significantly high in 100 ng/mL of small (29.1%) and 10 ng/mL of medium (44.0%) follicles. We also examined the Bcl2 and ERK2 transcript levels and found that they were significantly higher in the small and medium follicle treatment groups. In conclusion, these results indicate that hrG-CSF improve the viability of porcine embryos.

Hispidin and related herbal compounds from Alpinia zerumbet inhibit both PAK1-dependent melanogenesis in melanocytes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in adipocytes. Recently several compounds from Okinawa plants including Alpinia zerumbet (alpinia) were shown to inhibit directly the oncogenic/ageing kinase PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1). Furthermore, it was recently revealed that both PAK1 and PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) are equally essential for the melanogenesis in melanoma cells. Thus, in this study, we tested if several alpinia compounds inhibit the melanogenesis in melanoma (B16F10) cells, as well as the PAK1-dependent up-regulation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in cultured adipocytes (3T3-L1) without any cytotoxicity. The effect of alpinia compounds on the melanogenesis was measured by both the melanin content and intracellular tyrosinase activity in melanoma cells treated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a melanogenesis stimulating hormone. We found that (1E,3E,5E)-6-methoxyhexa-1,3,5-trien-1-yl)-2,5-dihydrofuran (MTD), 5,6-dehydrokawain (DK), labdadiene, hispidin and dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain (DDK) at 50 μg/mL reduced the melanin content by 63-79%. The MTD, DK and hispidin, at 50 μg/mL, inhibited tyrosinase activity by 70-83% in melanoma cells. Among these compounds, labdadiene, MTD, (E)-2,2,3,3-Tetramethyl8-methylene-7-(oct-6-en-1-yl)octahydro-1H-quinolizine (TMOQ) and hispidin strongly inhibited the ROS production. Hispidin, labdadiene and MTD at 20 μg/mL inhibited NO production by over 70%. These findings altogether suggest that some of these alpinia compounds could be potentially useful for the prevention or treatment of hyperpigmentation and obesity. 


Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient.

Intraoperative minimal acute normovolemic hemodilution in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Efficacy of minimal acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) in avoiding homologous blood transfusion during cardiovascular surgery remains controversial. Postoperative bleeding and transfusion remain a source of morbidity and cost after open heart operations. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of minimal ANH on blood transfusion requirements during open cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study was a randomized controlled trial. One hundred one patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) under cardiopulmonary bypass in October 2007 through March 2008 in Imam Khomeini hospital were randomly assigned to a control group (standard care, no = 47) or an ANH or study group (no = 54). We used minimal ANH (representing 10% of patients' blood volume). Mean 490 +/- 50 mL of fresh autologous blood was removed after induction of anesthesia and reinfused at the end of CPB. The blood transfusion guidelines were uniformly applied to all patients. Significant decrease in the number of red blood cell units transfused per patient per group (1.39 +/- 1.0 and 2.551.9 +/- units; p < 0.0001) in the ANH group versus the control group was observed. Conversely, chest tube output, postoperative hematocrits, and platelet count did not differ between two groups. Percentage of patients in whom allogeneic red blood cells were transfused was 44% in study group versus 76% in control group; (p < 0.01). No patient was transfused with platelet concentrates or fresh frozen plasma. Minimal ANH is safe and cost effective and its routine use in eligible patients is therefore justified. Intraoperative autologous blood donation in CABG surgery decreased perioperative allogeneic blood requirement. However, the removal and reinfusion of about one unit autologous blood had no effect on postoperative bleeding or platelet count.


BILATERAL LAMELLAR MACULAR HOLE SURGERY IN RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA.

Correspondences between continuous and intermittent exercises intensities in healthy prepubescent children. The aim of this article is to determine correspondences between three levels of continuous and intermittent exercise (CE and IE, respectively) in terms of steady-state oxygen uptake (VO(2SS)) and heart rate (HR) in children. Fourteen healthy children performed seven exercises on a treadmill: one graded test for the determination of maximal aerobic speed (MAS), three CE at 60, 70 and 80% of MAS (CE60, CE70 and CE80) and three IE (alternating 15 s of exercise intercepted with 15 s of passive recovery) at 90, 100 and 110% of MAS (IE90, IE100 and IE110). Mean VO(2SS) and mean HR were determined for both continuous and intermittent exercises. For comparison, three associations were designed: CE60 versus IE90, CE70 versus IE100 and CE80 versus IE110. No VO(2SS) difference was observed for CE60 versus IE90 and CE70 versus IE100 whereas a significant difference (P < 0.01) was found for CE80 versus IE110 (1.36 +/- 0.45 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.38 L min(-1), respectively). Significant linear regressions were found for the three CE versus IE associations for VO(2SS) (0.60 < r (2) < 0.99, P < 0.05). For the three associations, mean HR presented no significant difference. Only one significant relation was found for CE80 versus IE110 association (r(2) = 0.49, P < 0.05). Correspondences between CE and IE intensities are possible in terms of VO(2SS) whatever the level of exercise; even if for high intensities, VO(2SS) was higher during CE. These results demonstrated that it is possible to diversify the exercise modality while conserving exercise individualization.

Effect of short-term ozone treatments on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit quality and cell wall degradation. We evaluated the effect of short-term gaseous ozone treatment (10 microL/L; 10 min) on tomato fruit quality and cell wall degradation. The treatments did not modify fruit color, sugar content, acidity, or antioxidant capacity but reduced fruit damage and weight loss and induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds. In addition, softening was delayed in ozone-treated fruit. Cell wall analysis showed that exposure to ozone decreased pectin but not hemicellulose solubilization. Polyuronide depolymerization was also reduced in ozone-treated fruit. While the treatments did not alter the activity of the pectin-degrading enzymes polygalacturonase (PG) and beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal), a clear decrease in pectin methyl esterase (PME) was found. Results show that short-term ozone treatments might be useful to reduce fruit damage and excessive softening, two of the main factors limiting tomato postharvest life, without negatively affecting other quality attributes. The impact of the treatments on fruit softening might be associated with reduced disassembly (solubilization and depolymerization) of pectic polysaccharides.


Real-time estimation of the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal using a new algorithm for baseline wander noise removal.

X chromosome inactivation: when dosage counts. How do mammals count their X chromosomes and keep only one X active per cell? In this issue, Jonkers et al. (2009) show that Rnf12/RLIM, encoded by the X-linked gene Rnf12, induces X chromosome inactivation only when present above a certain threshold, a condition fulfilled when at least two Xs are active.


Unpredictability of intravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for advanced beta thalassemia: limited toxicity with a dose-adjustment policy.

Comparative study of protein-protein interaction observed in PolyGalacturonase-Inhibiting Proteins from Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max and PolyGalacturonase from Fusarium moniliforme. The PolyGalacturonase-Inhibiting Proteins (PGIP) of plant cell wall limit the invasion of phytopathogenic organisms by interacting with the enzyme PolyGalacturonase (PG) they secrete to degrade pectin present in the cell walls. PGIPs from different or same plant differ in their inhibitory activity towards the same PG. PGIP2 from Phaseolus vulgaris (Pv) inhibits the PG from Fusarium moniliforme (Fm) although PGIP1, another member of the multigene family from the same plant sharing 99% sequence similarity, cannot. Interestingly, PGIP3 from Glycine max (Gm) which is a homologue of PGIP2 is capable of inhibiting the same PG although the extent of similarity is lower and is 88%. It therefore appears that subtle changes in the sequence of plant PGIPs give rise to different specificity for inhibiting pathogenic PGs and there exists no direct dependence of function on the extent of sequence similarity. Structural information for any PGIP-PG complex being absent, we resorted to molecular modelling to gain insight into the mechanism of recognition and discrimination of PGs by PGIPs. We have built homology models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 using the crystal structure of PvPGIP2 (1OGQ) as template. These PGIPs were then docked individually to FmPG to elucidate the characteristics of their interactions. The mode of binding for PvPGIP1 to FmPG considerably differs from the mode observed for PvPGIP2-FmPG complex, regardless of the high sequence similarity the two PGIPs share. Both PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 despite being relatively less similar, interact with residues of FmPG that are known from mutational studies to constitute the active site of the enzyme. PvPGIP1 tends to interact with residues not located at the active site of FmPG. Looking into the electrostatic potential surface for individual PGIPs, it was evident that a portion of the interacting surface for PvPGIP1 differs from the corresponding region of PvPGIP2 or GmPGIP3. van der Waals and electrostatic interactions play an active role in PGIPs for proper recognition and discrimination of PGs. Docking studies reveal that PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 interact with the residues constituting the active site of FmPG with implications that the proteins bind/block FmPG at its active site and thereby inhibit the enzyme.

Agent Orange Exposure and 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) in Human Milk. Agent Orange was sprayed in parts of southern Vietnam during the U.S.-Vietnam war and was a mixture of two chlorophenoxy herbicides. The mixture was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD and other dioxins and furans are measurable in the milk of Vietnamese women. We explored whether the TCDD in milk from these women was from Agent Orange and whether lactational exposure can be a mode of transgenerational effects of TCDD from Agent Orange. A review of the world's literature on milk concentrations of polychlorinated compounds showed the presence of TCDD and other dioxins and furans in all countries that have been assessed. The congener profile of these chemicals, that is, the proportion of different congeners in the sample, can be used to assess the source of milk contamination. Measurements in most countries, including contemporary measurements in Vietnam, are consistent with non-Agent Orange exposure sources, including industrial activities and incineration of waste. Models and supporting human data suggest that TCDD from breastfeeding does not persist in a child past adolescence and that the adult body burden of TCDD is independent of whether the individual was breast- or bottle-fed as a child. These findings suggest that exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam did not result in persistent transgenerational exposure through human milk. 

Is physical functioning influenced by activity-related pain prediction and fear of movement in patients with subacute low back pain? In patients with low back pain (LBP), physical functioning may be negatively influenced by both expectations on pain and pain-related fear. It is unclear whether these factors influence both physical functioning in the laboratory as well as in daily life. The aim of this study was to test if a combination of persistent overprediction of pain and fear of movement predicts lab-based performance and whether these factors are relevant for predicting daily-life functioning. One hundred and twenty four patients with subacute LBP performed a laboratory-based performance test twice. Maximum voluntary contraction, pre-test pain expectations, perceived pain during testing and fear of movement were measured. Patients were classified as correct or incorrect predictors, based on differences between expected and perceived pain on the second attempt. Next, physical activity in daily life was measured with an accelerometer. In explaining physical functioning in the laboratory and in daily life an interaction effect between fear and pain prediction was observed. In overpredictors, fear was negatively associated with lab-based performance (beta=-0.48, p<0.01), and positively associated with daily-life functioning (beta=0.50, p<0.05). No significant association between fear and performance or daily-life functioning were found in correct predictors. In contrast to correct predictors, in overpredictors lab-based performance and daily-life functioning was additionally explained by fear of movement. Thus it appears that fear of movement is only predictive of performance in patients with LBP who simultaneously overpredict the consequences of movements in terms of painfulness.


Effects of feeding diets containing increasing content of corn distillers dried grains with solubles to grower-finisher pigs on growth performance, carcass composition, and pork fat quality.

Biochemical, biometrical and behavioral changes in male offspring of sleep-deprived mice. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep deprivation during the pre-implantation stage of development alters the physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, behavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessed. The dams' plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, they were not the main cause. The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development.

[Clinical outcomes of sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder]. To assess the penile erectile function, urinary continence and voiding, and cancer recurrence in 18 bladder cancer patients after sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder reconstruction. Eighteen male patients with bladder cancer underwent sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder reconstruction, and were followed up for cancer recurrence and such clinical outcomes as erectile function and urinary continence and voiding. The patients were followed up for an average of 41 months, of whom, all achieved day- and night-time urinary continence, but 2 with positive lymph nodes died of extensive metastasis at 10 and 15 months, respectively, after surgery. Among the total number, potency was maintained in 11 patients (61.1%), impaired in 2 and lost in 5, and the post-operative IIEF-5 score was (10.83 +/- 8.25) as compared with (13.72 +/- 6.39) before the operation, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Erectile function and urinary continence are fairly good in bladder cancer patients after sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder reconstruction, and the oncological results are fairly acceptable, but still need to be confirmed by longer follow-ups and larger trials.

Regulation of Yin Yang 1 by Tyrosine Phosphorylation. Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a member of the GLI-Krüppel class of DNA and RNA binding transcription factors that can either activate or repress gene expression during cell growth, differentiation, and embryogenesis. Although much is known about YY1 interacting proteins and the target promoters regulated by YY1, much less is known about YY1 regulation through post-translational modifications. In this study we show that YY1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in multiple cell types. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition, kinase overexpression, and kinase knock-out studies, we demonstrate that YY1 is a target of multiple Src family kinases in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we have identified multiple sites of YY1 phosphorylation and analyzed the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of YY1-responsive retroviral and cellular promoters. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 383 interferes with DNA and RNA binding, leading to the down-regulation of YY1 activity. Finally, we provide the first evidence that YY1 is a downstream target of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in vivo. Taken together, the identification of YY1 as a target of Src family kinases provide key insights into the inhibitory role of tyrosine kinases in modulating YY1 activity. 

Season of birth and not vitamin D receptor promoter polymorphisms is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to multiple sclerosis, the most common neurodegenerative disorder with onset in young adults. The objective of the current study is, based on the hypothesis that environmentally predisposed individuals are at risk for multiple sclerosis, to investigate whether they also carry genetic variants within the vitamin D machinery. Using medical files and DNA samples from 583 trios (a patient and both parents) of the French Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Group as well as data from the French Statistics Bureau, we aimed to assess whether: (1) a seasonality of birth was observed in French multiple sclerosis patients; (2) three single nucleotide polymorphisms within the promoter region of the vitamin D receptor were associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility; and (3) the combination of a high risk month of birth and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms were correlated to multiple sclerosis incidence. We observed a significantly reduced number of individuals born in November who were later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis patients. However, we found no association between the three studied vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and multiple sclerosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that high levels of vitamin D during the third trimester of pregnancy could be a protective factor for multiple sclerosis.


Bacteria can form interconnected microcolonies when a self-excreted product reduces their surface motility: evidence from individual-based model simulations.

[Switch of methoxy-polyethylene-glycol-epoetin beta to darbepoetin alfa in 263 dialysis patients]. In early 2012, due to national supply disruption, the methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (CERA) was no longer available and has been replaced by darbepoetin alfa (DA) in all dialysis patients. Official recommendations for the replacement of one by the other is missing or unclear. On this occasion, we wanted to examine how the shift from CERA to DA was done in terms of dose conversion factor and the other factors that could have influenced the dose of DA prescribed (hemoglobin, patient weight, dose of CERA). This retrospective multicenter open conducted in six dialysis centers in Alsace is the first large study (n=263) that evaluated the switch from CERA to DA in all chronic hemodialysis patients. We found that the instantaneous ratio of dose adjustment is close to 1 and that nephrologists are mainly based on the dose of CERA for determining the DA dose, before hemoglobin and weight. However, establishing a true dose-response ratio between the two molecules requires a long term prospective study.

Effect of edaravone on plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome. We have recently demonstrated that the administration of edaravone before reperfusion attenuated reperfusion injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Plasma MCP-1 levels were measured in 45 consecutive patients with AMI (edaravone group, n=25; control group, n=20). In the edaravone group, 30 mg edaravone was intravenously infused just before reperfusion. Plasma samples were obtained before and at 24h, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after reperfusion. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac death, subacute thrombosis, or fatal arrhythmia. Heart failure requiring rehospitalization was evaluated at 12 months after reperfusion. Plasma MCP-1 levels were not different between the two groups before reperfusion. Compared with the placebo group, the edaravone group had statistically lower maximum creatine kinase-MB levels (218±31 IU/l versus 145±21 IU/l, p<0.05) and plasma MCP-1 levels on day 3 after reperfusion (873±118 pg/ml versus 516±66 pg/ml, p<0.05). Heart failure requiring rehospitalization occurred in four patients in the control group, but did not occur in the edaravone group (p<0.05). At 12 months after reperfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction was statistically higher in the edaravone group than in the control group (62±2% versus 54±3%, p<0.05). Edaravone suppressed plasma MCP-1, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced rehospitalization due to heart failure. Suppression of plasma MCP-1 level by edaravone might induce better prognosis for AMI patients.

Eosinophilic esophagitis and allergies in the pediatric population of Puerto Rico. Several studies have been done trying to describe the clinical manifestation, histopathological appearance, and natural history of eosinophilic esophagitis, but no studies have been done in the pediatric population of Puerto Rico. Our objective is to describe the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and the atopic characteristics of pediatric patients diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. We conducted a cross sectional study in which the 24 medical records of the patients with eosinophilic esophagitis were revised and the following data was collected: age, sex, hometown and presenting symptoms. In a 24 pediatric patients with EE, the female sex was prevalent with a 54.2% and the median age was seven years old. The most common presenting symptom was epigastric pain. Allergies to environmental allergens were more prevalent in pediatric patients with EE. In conclusion, our sample proves that EE is indeed present among the pediatric population in Puerto Rico.


Assessment and management of pain in children and adolescents with bleeding disorders: a cross-sectional study from three haemophilia centres.

Assessment of phylogenetic structure of Berber-speaking population of Azrou using 15 STRs of Identifiler kit. Allele frequencies for 15 STR autosomal loci of Identifiler kit (D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSF1PO, D3S1358, TH01, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D19S433, vWA, TPOX, D18S51, D5S818 and FGA) in the Moroccan population of Berber-speaking of Azrou, were assessed from a sample of 201 unrelated individuals. Markers D18S51, D2S1338, FGA and D21S11 present the highest power of discrimination (PD) values while D21S11 was the most polymorphic locus in the studied population. The phylogenetic tree established among worldwide populations, shows that Berber-speaking population of Azrou was so close to the Berber-speaking population of Asni but also to the Arab-speaking population of southern Morocco. Nevertheless, a significant distance was observed between populations of Azrou and Bouhria even they share the same dialect (Amazigh) and belong to the same geographical area (Morocco). The 15 STR loci studied appear to be highly discriminating, thus providing a powerful tool for forensic applications, paternity investigation, individual identification and anthropological studies.

Human skeletal muscle drug transporters determine local exposure and toxicity of statins.

Study on the interaction of cationic lipids with bovine serum albumin. There are several lipid binding sites on serum albumins. The aim of this study was to examine the binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to cholesterol (Chol), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(trimethylammonium)propane (DOTAP), (dioctadecyldimethyl)ammonium bromide (DDAB), and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), at physiological conditions, using constant protein concentration and various lipid contents. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the lipid binding mode, the binding constant, and the effects of lipid complexation on BSA stability and conformation. Structural analysis showed that lipids bind BSA via both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts with overall binding constants of K(Chol) = (1.12 +/- 0.40) x 10(3) M(-1), K(DDAB) = (1.50 +/- 0.50) x 10(3) M(-1), K(DOTAP) = (2.45 +/- 0.80) x 10(3) M(-1), and K(DOPE) = (1.35 +/- 0.60) x 10(3) M(-1). The numbers of bound lipid (n) were 1.1 (cholesterol), 1.28 (DDAB), 1.02 (DOPE), and 1.21 (DOTAP) in these lipid-BSA complexes. DDAB and DOTAP induced major alterations of BSA conformation, causing a partial protein unfolding, while cholesterol and DOPE stabilized protein secondary structure.

Endotoxin exposure and inflammation markers among agricultural workers in Colorado and Nebraska. The adverse respiratory effects of agricultural dust inhalation are mediated in part by endotoxin, a constituent of gram-negative bacterial cell walls. This study quantified personal work-shift exposures to inhalable dust, endotoxin, and its reactive 3-hydroxy fatty acid (3-OHFA) constituents among workers in grain elevators, cattle feedlots, dairies, and on corn farms. Exposures were compared with post-work-shift nasal lavage fluid inflammation markers and respiratory symptoms. Breathing-zone personal air monitoring was performed over one work shift to quantify inhalable dust (Institute of Medicine samplers), endotoxin (recombinant factor C [rFC] assay), and 3-OHFA (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Post-shift nasal lavage fluids were assayed for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin 8 (IL-8), albumin, and eosinophilic cation protein (ECP) concentrations. The geometric mean (GSD) of endotoxin exposure (rFC assay) among the 125 male participants was 888 +/- (6.5) EU/m(3), and 93% exceeded the proposed exposure limit (50 EU/m(3)). Mean PMN, MPO, albumin, and ECP levels were two- to threefold higher among workers in the upper quartile of 3-OHFA exposure compared to the lowest exposure quartile. Even numbered 3-OHFA were most strongly associated with nasal inflammation. Symptom prevalence was not elevated among exposed workers, possibly due to endotoxin tolerance or a healthy worker effect in this population. This is the first study to evaluate the relationship between endotoxin's 3-OHFA constituents in agricultural dust and nasal airway inflammation. More research is needed to characterize the extent to which these agents contribute to respiratory disease among agricultural workers.


Development and evaluation of the anxiety disorder diagnostic questionnaire.

Sexing of postimplantation rat embryos in stored two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of an Sry sequence. Proteomic analysis of developmental toxicity by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) may detect gender-related toxic effects in embryos without visible gender characteristics. In the present study, we explored sexing of rat embryo stored in frozen 2-DE samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a male-specific gene sequence, sex determining region Y (Sry). The embryo proper and yolk sac membrane at gestation day 11 from Wistar rats were used for stored embryonic 2-DE samples. The embryonic 2-DE samples were desalted and their total DNA was extracted. The Sry sequence in the extracted DNA was amplified by PCR and the product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The embryos with the PCR product of Sry were determined as male, and those without the product were determined as female. It was concluded that stored embryonic 2-DE samples could be used for retrospective examination of gender-related effects in proteomic analysis of developmental toxicity.


[Persisting pain after open articulosynovectomy--gossypiboma].

Anatomy-based surgery to remove thyroglossal duct cyst: two anomalous cases. To review previous reports and to discuss the management of branching polycystic and giant thyroglossal duct cysts. We present two cases of thyroglossal duct cyst: one a branching, polycystic thyroglossal duct cyst in an 11-year-old boy, and the other a giant thyroglossal cyst in a 41-year-old man. Such cysts are rare. Both patients were operated upon according to the methods of Sistrunk and Horisawa, and both had a satisfactory post-operative course. We discuss the most important aspects of such cyst removal procedures. Our experience suggests that surgery to remove an anomalous thyroglossal duct cyst should be performed using a technique based on the anatomy of the hyoid bone region.

An evaluation of the interaction between quality of attention and negative reinforcement with children who display escape-maintained problem behavior.

Confinement-induced quorum sensing of individual Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. It is postulated that in addition to cell density, other factors such as the dimensions and diffusional characteristics of the environment could influence quorum sensing (QS) and induction of genetic reprogramming. Modeling studies predict that QS may operate at the level of a single cell, but, owing to experimental challenges, the potential benefits of QS by individual cells remain virtually unexplored. Here we report a physical system that mimics isolation of a bacterium, such as within an endosome or phagosome during infection, and maintains cell viability under conditions of complete chemical and physical isolation. For Staphylococcus aureus, we show that quorum sensing and genetic reprogramming can occur in a single isolated organism. Quorum sensing allows S. aureus to sense confinement and to activate virulence and metabolic pathways needed for survival. To demonstrate the benefit of confinement-induced quorum sensing to individuals, we showed that quorum-sensing bacteria have significantly greater viability over non-QS bacteria.

Stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer in patients aged > or =75 years: outcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy. The number of patients aged > or =75 years who present with a stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increasing. Elderly patients often have significant comorbidity and may be unfit for surgery. Furthermore, surgery in the elderly is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in elderly patients. Since 2003, 203 tumors in 193 patients aged > or =75 years were treated using SRT (118 T1 tumors, 85 T2 tumors). The median patient age was 79 years, 80% of patients were considered medically inoperable, and 20% of patients declined surgery. The median Charlson comorbidity score was 4, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Class III or greater) was present in 25% of patients. Risk-adapted SRT schemes were used with the same total dose of 60 grays in 3 fractions (33%), 5 fractions (50%), or 8 fractions (17% of patients), depending on the patient's risk for toxicity. SRT was well tolerated, and all but 1 patient completed treatment. Survival rates at 1 year and 3 years were 86% and 45%, respectively. Survival was correlated with performance score (P = .001) and pre-SRT lung function (P = .04). The actuarial local control rate at 3 years was 89%. Acute toxicity was uncommon, and late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade > or =3 toxicity was observed in <10% of patients. SRT achieved high local control rates with minimal toxicity in patients aged > or =75 years despite their significant medical comorbidities. These results indicated that more active diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are justified in elderly patients and that SRT should be considered and discussed as a curative treatment alternative.

Neonatal thrombo-embolism: risk factors, clinical features and outcome. There are few data with respect to prothrombotic risk factors in neonates. To determine the associated risk factors, clinical features and outcome in newborn infants diagnosed with thrombo-embolism. Case records of 25 infants (17 full-term and eight preterm) diagnosed with thrombo-embolism between January 2005 and April 2008 in a neonatal intensive care unit were reviewed. Of the 25 infants, 18 cases of venous (72%) and seven of arterial (28%) thrombo-embolism were recorded; in 18 it was associated with central catheterisation. The sites of thrombosis were portal vein (15), right renal vein (one), right femoral vein (one), multiple veins (one), right femoral artery (3), right iliac artery (2), bilateral iliac and renal arteries (one) and left renal artery (one). Hereditary thrombotic mutations were detected in three patients and anticardiolipin antibody was detected in one, none of whom had been catheterised. The remaining three non-catheterised patients had perinatal risk factors. Venous catheter placement was undertaken in 12 patients (48%), eleven of whom had: umbilical venous catheterisation for exchange transfusion (9), partial exchange transfusion (one) and venous access (one), and one had femoral venous catheterisation for an angiographic study. Arterial catheterisation was undertaken in seven patients (28%) (one infant had both umbilical venous and arterial catheters) for angiographic studies (5) and blood sampling (2). Of the 18 catheterised patients (72%), thrombophilic studies were undertaken in 13 and none had abnormal results. Additional perinatal risk factors were present in 18 patients (72%) and included prematurity (8), congenital heart disease (8), septicaemia (5), dehydration (3), respiratory distress syndrome (3), polycythemia (2), meconium aspiration syndrome (one), pneumonia (one), maternal diabetes (one), necrotising enterocolitis (one) and perinatal asphyxia (one). Although most of the patients recovered after anticoagulant or fibrinolytic therapy, the five (20%) deaths were associated mainly with underlying diseases. The most important risk factor for thrombo-embolic events in neonates is placement of central catheters and some perinatal prothrombotic conditions. Nevertheless, hereditary or acquired thrombophilic risk factors may also be a cause of thrombo-embolism.


[The development tendencies of infusion pumps/syringe pumps].

An exploration of physical activity and wellbeing in university employees. The aim was to explore levels of physical activity (PA) and mental wellbeing in university employees, as well as barriers to and incentives for workplace PA. An electronic survey was distributed to all staff at one UK university. The survey consisted of a PA stages of change questionnaire, an international PA questionnaire (short-form), the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), questions on perceived barriers to and incentives for workplace PA, questions on methods of enhancing employee wellbeing and demographics. A self-selected sample participated in two focus groups to explore key themes arising from the survey. Descriptive statistics were reported for survey data; associations between PA and wellbeing were tested for using Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Mann-Whitney. Descriptive, thematic analysis was performed on focus group transcripts. A total of 502 surveys were completed (34% response rate); 13 staff participated in focus groups. In all, 42% of the sample reported PA below the recommended guideline amount. Females were less active than males (p < 0.005). The mean WEMWBS was 49.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 48.3-49.9). Low PA levels were related to lower WEMWBS scores, with statistically significant differences in WEMWBS demonstrated between low and moderate PA (p = 0.05) and low and high PA (p = 0.001). Lack of time and perceived expense of facilities were common barriers to workplace PA. The main focus group finding was the impact of university culture on workplace PA and wellbeing. University staff demonstrate PA levels and a relationship between PA and wellbeing similar to the general population. Carefully designed strategies aimed at enhancing PA and wellbeing in university staff are required. The specific cultural and other barriers to workplace PA that exist in this setting should be considered. These results are being used to inform PA and wellbeing interventions whose effectiveness will be evaluated in future research.

Liver resection and cryotherapy for metastatic melanoma.

Dynamic hyperinflation during daily activities: does COPD global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stage matter? One of the contributors to exercise limitation in COPD is dynamic hyperinflation. Although dynamic hyperinflation appears to occur during several exercise protocols in COPD and seems to increase with increasing disease severity, it is unknown whether dynamic hyperinflation occurs at different severity stages according to the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) in daily life. The present study, therefore, aimed to compare dynamic hyperinflation between COPD GOLD stages II-IV during daily activities. Thirty-two clinically stable patients with COPD GOLD II (n = 10), III (n = 12), and IV (n = 10) participated in this study. Respiratory physiology during a daily activity was measured at patients' homes with Oxycon Mobile. Inspiratory capacity maneuvers were performed at rest, at 2-min intervals during the activity, and at the end of the activity. Change in inspiratory capacity is commonly used to reflect change in end-expiratory lung volume (DeltaEELV) and, therefore, dynamic hyperinflation. The combination of static and dynamic hyperinflation was reflected by inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) during the activity. Overall, increase in EELV occurred in GOLD II-IV without significant difference between the groups. There was a tendency for a smaller DeltaEELV in GOLD IV. DeltaEELV was inversely related to static hyperinflation. IRV during the daily activity was related to the level of airflow obstruction. Dynamic hyperinflation occurs independent of GOLD stage during real-life daily activities. The combination of static and dynamic hyperinflation, however, increases with increasing airflow obstruction.


Late Post-Conditioning with Sevoflurane after Cardiac Surgery--Are Surrogate Markers Associated with Clinical Outcome?

Coughing precipitated by Bordetella pertussis infection. Infections with the gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) have long been recognized as a significant threat to children and are increasingly recognized as a cause of cough in adolescents and adults. Antibiotic therapy, when administered during the virulent stages of the disease, can reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for the persistent coughing that accompanies and follows the infection. The pathogenesis of B. pertussis infection is briefly reviewed. Also discussed is the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the inflammatory peptide bradykinin may be responsible for the persistent, paroxysmal coughing associated with B. pertussis-initiated illness.

Safety and Efficacy of an Oral Inhibitor of the Purinergic Receptor P2X7 in Adult Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease: A Randomized Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Phase IIa Study. AZD9056 is a selective orally active inhibitor of the purinergic receptor P2X7, which is a key player in the generation and secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this phase IIa study was to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD9056 for the treatment of moderately to severely active CD. We conducted a placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind phase IIa study in patients with moderately to severely active CD as defined by a CD Activity Index (CDAI) of at least 220. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 mode either to 200 mg of AZD9056 administered orally as a tablet once daily for 28 days or matching placebo. Primary endpoint was the change in CDAI from baseline at day 28, and secondary endpoints included clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and CDAI 70 response and improvement in the quality of life measures Short Form 36 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Changes in serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin were assessed. In total, 34 patients were enrolled, 24 to AZD9056 and 10 to placebo. The CDAI dropped in AZD9056-treated subjects from a baseline mean of 311 to 242 and from 262 to 239 in placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.049). Remission and response rates were numerically higher with AZD9056 versus placebo, (n = 5, 24% versus n = 1, 11%, P = 0.43 and n = 11, 52% versus n = 2, 22%, P = 0.13, respectively). Marked decrease in disease activity was observed for the CDAI subcomponents, pain and general well-being. Apart from a statistically significant improvement in the Mental Component Score of Short Form 36 for AZD9056 versus placebo (P = 0.017), no other differences in measurements of quality of life could be observed. There was no decrease in concentrations of serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin during treatment. AZD9056 was well-tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. Our data suggest that the purinergic receptor P2X7 antagonist AZD9056 has the potential to improve symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe CD combined with a beneficial risk profile. Although the lack in change of inflammatory biomarkers questions its anti-inflammatory potential, the results obtained in this study rather suggest P2X7 antagonism for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain.


Taking the brakes off telomerase.

Reconstruction of hepatic veins by anastomosis with suprahepatic IVC in the posterior mediastinum in living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome. In living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome, it is necessary to eliminate interference with outflow from the liver without the replacement of the involved retrohepatic segment of the inferior vena cava. A 34-year-old female patient underwent living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome. During surgery, the fibrous tissue surrounding the recipient inferior vena cava was dissected after removal of the recipient liver. The diaphragm was dissected and mobilized from the inferior vena cava on the cranial side to expose the intact inferior vena cava in the posterior mediastinum. The left and middle hepatic veins in the graft liver were anastomosed to a horizontal anastomotic orifice prepared in the anterior wall of the intact inferior vena cava in the posterior mediastinum. Anticoagulant therapy was begun after liver transplantation. Dynamic computed tomography after living donor liver transplantation demonstrated patent hepatic veins. The patient has been doing well, without any episode of thrombosis or occlusion of the graft hepatic veins at 1 year and 6 months after liver transplantation.

Incidence and persistence of carcinogenic genital human papillomavirus infections in young women with or without Chlamydia trachomatis co-infection. We assessed whether infection with chlamydia increases the incidence of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and if HPV persistence is affected by chlamydia co-infection. For 1982 women (16-29 years-old) participating in two consecutive rounds of a chlamydia screening implementation trial, swabs were polymerase chain reaction tested to detect chlamydia and 14 carcinogenic HPV genotypes. HPV type-specific incidence and persistence rates were stratified for chlamydia positivity at follow-up. Associations were assessed by multilevel logistic regression analyses with correction for sexual risk factors. HPV type-specific incidence ranged from 1.4% to 8.9% and persistence from 22.7% to 59.4% after a median follow-up of 11 months (interquartile range: 11-12). Differences in 1-year HPV persistence rates between chlamydia -infected and noninfected women were less distinct than differences in HPV incidence rates (pooled adjusted odds ratios of 1.17 [95% CI: 0.69-1.96] and 1.84 [95% CI: 1.36-2.47], respectively). The effect of chlamydia co-infection on HPV-infection risk did not significantly differ by HPV genotype. In conclusion, infection with chlamydia increases the risk of infection by carcinogenic HPV types and may enhance persistence of some HPV types. Although these findings could reflect residual confounding through unobserved risk factors, our results do give reason to explore more fully the association between chlamydia and HPV type-specific acquisition and persistence.

[Report of the first case of influenza A (H1N1) in mainland China]. To investigate the clinical characteristics and management of the first confirmed imported case of influenza A (H1N1) infection in mainland China. The description of the clinical manifestations, clinical management, infection preventing and controlling strategies were reviewed. The 30-years old male patient came back from U.S.A. and with mild influenza-like symptoms developed. He had had a close contact history with a patient with "common cold" 4 d before onset of illness. Influenza A (H1N1) virus newly confirmed in North American was detected in the throat swab samples taken from this patient by real-time PCR and sequencing comparison. His symptoms ameliorated soon after administration of oseltamivir. The temperature was back to normal on the second day with oseltamivir. Nucleic acid of Influenza A (H1N1) virus was undetectable after 3 d with oseltamivir management. The patient was discharged on the 7 d after hospitalization. The clinical presentations of this imported case with Influenza A(H1N1) infection suggest that A(H1N1) infection manifests as flu-like symptoms in the healthy young people with a mild clinical course and a good prognosis. Early identification, early diagnosis and intervention with oseltamivir might be an effective clinical strategies for management of this emerging infectious disease.

Cranial volume, mild cognitive deficits, and functional limitations associated with diabetes in a community sample. Diabetes is associated with dementia in older adults, but it remains unclear whether nondemented adults with type 2 diabetes show subtle abnormalities across cognition, neuroanatomy, and everyday functioning. Using the Aging, Brain Imaging, and Cognition study sample of 301 community-dwelling, middle-aged and older adults, we conducted a secondary analysis on 28 participants with and 150 participants without diabetes. We analyzed brain magnetic resonance imaging data, cognitive test performance, and informant ratings of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (PADL/IADL). Relative to controls, participants with diabetes had lower brain-to-intracranial volume ratios (69.3 +/- 4.5% vs. 71.7 +/- 4.6%; p < .02), and performed more poorly on measures of working memory, processing speed, fluency, and crystallized intelligence (all p <.05). Decrements in working memory and processing speed were associated with IADL limitations (p < .01). Nondemented adults with diabetes exhibit neuroanatomic and cognitive abnormalities. Their cognitive deficits correlate with everyday functional limitations.

Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to noninvasively assess coronary vasoconstrictor and dilator responses in humans. Human studies of coronary circulation are limited because of methodological issues. Recently, a noninvasive transthoracic duplex ultrasound (TTD) technique has emerged as an important tool to measure coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) in conscious humans. We employed two protocols to determine whether noninvasive "native" coronary artery velocity responses to constrictor or dilator stimuli assessed by TTD provide reliable data. In the first protocol, coronary vascular resistance (CVR = diastolic blood pressure/CBV) responses to static handgrip were examined in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and native left anterior descending artery (LAD) into which the graft was inserted (patient age 63 +/- 3 years). Our prior report documented increased CVR in the LIMA graft during static handgrip (Momen et al., J Appl Physiol 102: 735-739, 2007). We hypothesized that the magnitude of increases in CVR during handgrip would be similar in the LIMA graft and LAD in the same individual. Percent increases in CVR were similar in the LIMA and distal native LAD (27 +/- 4% vs. 28 +/- 6%). In the second protocol, we studied six patients (age 61 +/- 3 years) who underwent cardiac catheterization of the LAD. We compared coronary vasodilator responses to intravenous adenosine infusion (0.14 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire technique and TTD on separate studies. The relative increases in CBV with adenosine obtained by intracoronary Doppler guidewire and TTD were similar (62 +/- 10% vs. 65 +/- 12%). Noninvasive TTD provides reliable human coronary circulatory constrictor and dilator data.

Laparoscopic single-port colectomy for sigmoid cancer. Single-port laparoscopic surgery can be performed via one incision hidden in the umbilicus. Herein, we report a patient with a sigmoid colon cancer undergoing single-port laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. Laparoscopic single-port sigmoid colectomy through a 3-cm umbilical incision was performed on a patient with a diagnosis of sigmoid cancer. Patient was 54-year-old female with a body mass index of 25.8 kg/m(2). Preoperatively, a CAT scan in the metastasis evaluation did not show any lesion. The total operative time was 198 min. Estimated blood loss was 300 ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 days. Patient had no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Examination of pathological specimen showed a specimen containing a circumferential lesion measuring 5 cm x 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm with adequate surgical margins (10 and 5.5 cm), and no regional lymph node metastases in 14 lymph nodes collected. Patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Colonoscopy performed 1 year after surgery showed no neoplasm or polyp identified. Abdomen and pelvis CT also found no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. Single-port laparoscopic surgery may allow common benign procedures via an incision in the umbilicus. It can also be performed with good surgical and oncologic results in selected patients with a colorectal cancer.

Fatigue as a determinant of health in patients with celiac disease. Symptoms of uncontrolled celiac disease impair patients' health-related quality of life, which improves with the exclusion of gluten from the diet. A symptom frequently reported, but difficult to make objective, is fatigue. The Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS) questionnaire consisting of 8 items, each scored on a 0 to 4 point scale, with lower scores reflecting greater fatigue, was employed to measure fatigue in celiac patients. To assess the influence of fatigue on perception of health in celiac disease patients determined as their quality of life. Prospective, cross-sectional study in celiac disease patients diagnosed by serology and histology. Instruments used were the D-FIS to measure fatigue and the generic EuroQol5D to measure quality of life. An additional question on the frequency of problems due to fatigue, scored on a 7-point Likert scale, was used to evaluate the importance of fatigue. RESULTS (IN MEDIANS): In all, 51 patients were included (13 untreated and 38 treated with a gluten-free diet). D-FIS score was significantly worse in untreated celiacs (16.0 vs. 3.0, P<0.001). Scores on the frequency scale of fatigue-related problems were also worse in untreated celiacs (2.0 vs. 6.0, P<0.001). Fatigue and quality-of-life scores were inversely correlated (r=-0.6, P<0.001). Fatigue severity was also greater in patients with worse quality of life (13.0 vs. 2.0, P<0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed fatigue to be an independent determinant of quality of life. Fatigue is a major concern in untreated celiac disease patients, which impacts their quality of life.

Benefits of Sleep Extension on Sustained Attention and Sleep Pressure Before and During Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery. To investigate the effects of 6 nights of sleep extension on sustained attention and sleep pressure before and during total sleep deprivation and after a subsequent recovery sleep. Subjects participated in two experimental conditions (randomized cross-over design): extended sleep (EXT, 9.8 ± 0.1 h (mean ± SE) time in bed) and habitual sleep (HAB, 8.2 ± 0.1 h time in bed). In each condition, subjects performed two consecutive phases: (1) 6 nights of either EXT or HAB (2) three days in-laboratory: baseline, total sleep deprivation and after 10 h of recovery sleep. Residential sleep extension and sleep performance laboratory (continuous polysomnographic recording). 14 healthy men (age range: 26-37 years). EXT vs. HAB sleep durations prior to total sleep deprivation. Total sleep time and duration of all sleep stages during the 6 nights were significantly higher in EXT than HAB. EXT improved psychomotor vigilance task performance (PVT, both fewer lapses and faster speed) and reduced sleep pressure as evidenced by longer multiple sleep latencies (MSLT) at baseline compared to HAB. EXT limited PVT lapses and the number of involuntary microsleeps during total sleep deprivation. Differences in PVT lapses and speed and MSLT at baseline were maintained after one night of recovery sleep. Six nights of extended sleep improve sustained attention and reduce sleep pressure. Sleep extension also protects against psychomotor vigilance task lapses and microsleep degradation during total sleep deprivation. These beneficial effects persist after one night of recovery sleep.

[Concentration of serum leptin and age in Chinese women and comparison with other races]. To determine the relationship between concentration of serum leptin and age in females, and to establish the reference value and compare it with other races. Serum leptin concentration of 690 adult healthy women (aged 20 approximately 81 years) was measured with ELISA. The serum leptin concentration increased with age (r=0.224, P<0.001), and cubic regression was the best-fitting model. Leptin concentration had significant positive correlation with weight (r=0.574) and body mass index (r=0.618). The geometric mean of leptin concentration in normal weight, overweight and obesity was (8.94+/-1.82), (17.6+/-1.89), and (34.7+/-1.69) microg/L, respectively, with significant difference among the 3 groups (P<0.001). Leptin in pre-menopause, peri-menopause and post-menopause women was (9.68+/-1.81), (11.7+/-1.89), and (11.4+/-2.21) microg/L, respectively. The reference value of serum leptin in normal weight females was 5.30 approximately 12.6 microg/L. The curve-fitting of leptin with age in this group was significantly lower than American non Hispanic White (NHW), non Hispanic Black (NHB), and American Mexican (AM) females. This study provides reliable reference value of serum leptin in adult women and discovers ethnic difference with American NHW, NHB, and AM females.

Staged reduction of gastroschisis using preformed silos: practicalities and problems. Previous single-center studies have reported favorable outcomes when preformed silos (PFS) are used for the staged reduction of gastroschisis. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and nature of complications associated with PFS in a large population and provide an insight into the practicalities of their routine use. A retrospective review was carried out of all cases of gastroschisis managed with PFS in 4 UK neonatal surgical units for a 6-year period. One hundred fifty infants were included, and 139 (92.7%) silos were applied at cot side (no sedation, n = 93). Median silo size was 4 cm, and time of application was 2.5 hours. Enlarging the defect by incision of fascia was required in 17 (11%). Defect closure was performed at a median of 4 days (0-47) with 93 (62%) being at cot side. Methods of closure were adhesive strips/dressings (n = 94), sutures (n = 48), and patch (n = 8). Discoloration of the viscera occurred in 16 (11%), managed successfully by simple methods (change of PFS, aspirating the stomach, or incision of the defect fascia) (n = 8), conversion to operative silo (n = 3), and operative reduction (n = 1). Four required bowel resection. Other complications included missed atresia (n = 5; 3.3%) and nectrotizing enterocolitis (n = 11; 7%). There were 5 deaths in the series (3.3%). Staged reduction of gastroschisis with PFS is simple, convenient, and safe. The low rates of associated complications and mortality appear favorable when compared to infants managed with more traditional techniques. We recommend that PFS should be used for the routine management of gastroschisis.


Immunohistochemical localization of inhibin and activin subunits, activin receptors and Smads in ovarian endometriosis.

Thyroidal radioactive iodide uptake in the lactating rhesus monkey. Although radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) is one of the reliable diagnostic methods for thyroid function in adult humans, especially in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, there are limited data for RAIU during pregnancy and lactation in humans and animals. Therefore, we proposed to validate RAIU for the lactating rhesus monkey to further human model studies in thyroid disease. RAIU was performed at 6 and 24 h using 100 microCi of (123)I orally in four lactating monkeys. The thyroid and thigh were counted using a scintillation probe and multichannel analyser. A dose/standard ratio of counts/minute was calculated to compensate for background, utilizing differences in the activity between the dose administered and a standard. Thyroidal RAIU varied significantly among monkeys: 6.71 +/- 2.40% for the 6 h uptake and 15.44 +/- 7.71% for the 24 h uptake. These data showed that the RAIU test may allow a rational clinical approach to thyroid function testing for lactating rhesus monkeys. Additional studies are needed for assessing thyroid function in rhesus monkeys of varying ages and gender with clinical abnormalities.

First record of Nippotaenia mogurndae Yamaguti and Miyata, 1940 (Cestoda, Nippotaeniidae), a parasite introduced with Chinese sleeper to Poland. A parasitological survey of an Asian fish, Chinese sleeper Perccottus glenii, inhabiting the Włocławek Reservoir on the lower Vistula River (central Poland) revealed the occurrence of an exotic cestode Nippotaenia mogurndae Yamaguti and Miyata, 1940, which spreads spontaneously with a host to European waters. This paper documented the first record of the parasite in Poland. Specimens were described, and the effect of fish size and season on the infection level was analyzed. Within the 3 years, 112 fish were examined. Samples were collected by electrofishing in the upper part of the Włocławek Reservoir three times (seasonally) in 2006 and 2007 and once in autumn 2008. Parasitological indices (prevalence, intensity of infection, and abundance) in particular samples as well as in two size groups of fish were calculated. Statistical tests were applied to analyze the results (Spearman's correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney's U test). The infection level of Chinese sleeper with N. mogurndae in the Włocławek Reservoir (prevalence 54.7%, mean intensity of infection 7.2, maximum 29) was comparable to infection noted in the area of the natural range of the host. The infection of smaller fish (less than 80 mm, TL) increased gradually with increasing body size. The infection of bigger specimens was in general higher, but the parasite recruitment was of a more incidental character. The spreading of N. mogurndae with Chinese sleeper is still in progress. The Włocławek Reservoir provides suitable conditions for parasite development.


Systolic function of patients with myocardial infarction undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation.

The morphology of the sella turcica in monozygotic twins. The purpose was to compare the sella turcica morphology of individuals within pairs of monozygotic twins with normal karyotype and to analyze the similarity between the observed morphology and the morphology of non-twins at the same age with normal karyotype. Profile radiographs from 84 individuals of 42 twin pairs (18 male and 24 female pairs, aged 18-23 years) comprised the material. Sella turcica measurements from non-twins aged 6-21 years were used as normal reference. Length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica were measured and controlled by re-measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for comparison of individuals within twin pairs. For comparison of twins and non-twins, normal standard values for length, depth and diameter were subtracted from the twin values. For the mean values of these differences, confidence limits p values and t values were calculated. The study showed that the size of the sella turcica may be partly similar and partly dissimilar within the pair of monozygotic twins. Statistical evaluation of the data showed correlations between length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica between the two twin individuals in the same twin pair. Differences in sizes are observed between individuals in the twin material and individuals in the non-twin material. As a conclusion, the twin males were more similar within the twin pair, but deviated more from the non-twin material than the females. Female twins had more discrepancy within the twin pair, but deviated less from the non-twin material than the males.

Lower respiratory tract infections. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. ALRIs are important indicators of the health disparities that persist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in developed countries. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia account for the majority of the ALRI burden. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of these diseases in Indigenous children are discussed. In comparison with non-Indigenous children in developing countries they have higher rates of disease, more complications, and their management is influenced by several unique factors including the epidemiology of disease and, in some remote regions, constraints on hospital referral and access to highly trained staff. The prevention of repeat infections and the early detection and management of chronic lung disease is critical to the long-term respiratory and overall health of these children.

[The obstetric history of preeclampsia as a further maternal cardiovascular risk factor]. The paper considers the late sequels of preeclampsia that is one of the main causes of poor perinatal outcomes. The idea that this gestational complication shows no noticeable impact on the female health status in the late postpartum periods has long been prevalent. At the same time, recent studies suggest that this cohort of women will have a high cardiovascular risk in future life, which requires the formulation of their management strategy. Epidemiological data are given on late female morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease, stroke, and renal failure.


Re-orienting a remote acute care model towards a primary health care approach: key enablers.

Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma improves survival in Asian-American patients with hepatitis B: results from a community-based clinic. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy in Asians with hepatitis B virus infection. HCC patients often present with poor liver function and large tumors resulting in rapid mortality. The impact of HCC surveillance and subsequent therapy on patient survival remain controversial. We sought to determine if surveillance for HCC in a community-based clinic improve survival and, if so, identify factors that contribute to the benefit of early tumor detection. From 1991 to 2008, alpha-fetoprotein and abdominal ultrasound examination were used as surveillance tests for HCC. The survival of HCC patients detected by surveillance was compared to patients who presented to the clinic with HCC (no surveillance). An adjusted lead-time bias interval was added to the survival time of patients who presented with HCC. During this period, 26 patients with surveillance developed HCC while 52 patients presented with HCC. More surveillance patients had normal levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase (p < 0.05-0.0001) and had tumors that were within Milan and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (p = 0.02-0.0001). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were higher in surveillance patients and in those who received surgical or loco-regional therapies (p = 0.007-0.0001). On multivariate analysis, baseline independent factors predicting survival were single tumors (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.25, p = 0.0005), UCSF criteria (HR 0.29, p = 0.006), Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A (HR 0.45, p = 0.03), platelet counts per log(10) increase (HR 0.315, p = 0.04) and aspartate aminotransferase per log(10) increase (HR 5.7, p = 0.01). Surveillance for HCC identified patients with smaller tumor burdens and more adequate liver function who were able to receive more definitive therapies. HCC surveillance improves survival and should be included as standard of care for patients with hepatitis B.

Inclusion detection with haptic-palpation system for medical telediagnosis. Detection of abnormalities in subcutaneous tissue is an important issue in medical diagnosis. Surgeons palpate this type of tissue to perceive pathologies through haptic sensation. This paper presents the framework of a real-time haptic-palpation system with inclusion detection to manipulate biological soft tissues and perceive their structures and material properties non-invasively. A user with a haptic device guides a robotic manipulator to perform palpation tasks and can detect the location of inclusions inside a soft medium (silicone-molded tissue phantom). For the objective measurement of the depth of the inclusion, a finite element (FE) model was developed to predict the reaction forces for various inclusion depths. The methods presented in this paper can be applied to the early detection of prostate cancer or breast cancer in telediagnosis.

[Drowning in a head-down position--report on an unusual accident]. A 22-year-old man was found in a head-down position in a roadside gully filled with water. Circumstances and autopsy findings are discussed. A prolonged head-down position may lead to death by impairing respiration and causing circulatory dysregulation. In the presented case, the victim drowned in a tight shaft in which he had no chance to free himself.

Allergenic proteins in enology: a review on technological applications and safety aspects. Proteinaceous products are widely used as fining agents during winemaking to remove unwanted insoluble particles and undissolved microscopic particles (colloidal material) from the must or wine to improve stability. Some of them (egg white, caseinates, and fish gelatine) have allergenic potential and the presence of their residues in the final product could represent a risk for allergic individuals. Moreover, lysozyme (an egg allergen) is included among wine additives to control the fermentation processes and avoid spoiling during winemaking. The aim of this paper is to review the experimental/clinical data on the use of allergenic products in enology and the measurement of relative risk for sensitized subjects. In addition, methods developed specifically for the quantification of allergenic residues in must and wine are described. 

Parathyroid cancer as rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Case report and review of the literature. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) due to parathyroid carcinoma is rare, and affects more frequently women in their 4th-5th decades of life. Parathyroid cancer (PC) accounts for 0.5% up to 5% of the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Diagnosis of PC is not easy, and a lot of patients with PHPT receive no pre-operative or intra-operative diagnosis of malignancy. Most of PC are hyperfunctioning, with marked serum PTH levels, and symptoms occurs more frequently than in benign disease. We report the case of a 52 years old woman that underwent a single parathyroidectomy for hyperfunctioning gland. Histological examination revealed carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma is rare and surgery represent the only curative approach, although there can be a local recurrence of the disease. A pre-operative diagnosis is not easy, and many features that suggest the diagnosis of malignancy are controversial. According to the literature, we think that the cure of the parathyroid cancer is difficult to achieve. After two years of follow- up, our patient is in good conditions and has no evidence of disease. A careful follow up is of primary importance to diagnose the local recurrence of disease and perform a second surgical treatment, to achieve the control of hypercalcemia, which causes severe metabolic alterations and visceral lesions until the death.

Predictors of health worker performance after Integrated Management of Childhood Illness training in Benin: a cohort study.

A unified diabatic description for electron transfer reactions, isomerization reactions, proton transfer reactions, and aromaticity. While diabatic approaches are ubiquitous for the understanding of electron-transfer reactions and have been mooted as being of general relevance, alternate applications have not been able to unify the same wide range of observed spectroscopic and kinetic properties. The cause of this is identified as the fundamentally different orbital configurations involved: charge-transfer phenomena involve typically either 1 or 3 electrons in two orbitals whereas most reactions are typically closed shell. As a result, two vibrationally coupled electronic states depict charge-transfer scenarios whereas three coupled states arise for closed-shell reactions of non-degenerate molecules and seven states for the reactions implicated in the aromaticity of benzene. Previous diabatic treatments of closed-shell processes have considered only two arbitrarily chosen states as being critical, mapping these states to those for electron transfer. We show that such effective two-state diabatic models are feasible but involve renormalized electronic coupling and vibrational coupling parameters, with this renormalization being property dependent. With this caveat, diabatic models are shown to provide excellent descriptions of the spectroscopy and kinetics of the ammonia inversion reaction, proton transfer in N2H7(+), and aromaticity in benzene. This allows for the development of a single simple theory that can semi-quantitatively describe all of these chemical phenomena, as well as of course electron-transfer reactions. It forms a basis for understanding many technologically relevant aspects of chemical reactions, condensed-matter physics, chemical quantum entanglement, nanotechnology, and natural or artificial solar energy capture and conversion. 


Synergistic antitumor effects of 131I-LC-1 IgM and IL-12 vaccine on Lewis lung carcinoma.

Pulmonary targeting microparticulate camptothecin delivery system: anticancer evaluation in a rat orthotopic lung cancer model. Large (>6 microm) rigid microparticles (MPs) become passively entrapped within the lungs after intravenous (i.v.) injection making them an attractive and highly efficient alternative to inhalation for pulmonary delivery. In this study, PEGylated 6 microm polystyrene MPs with multiple copies of the norvaline (Nva) alpha-amino acid prodrug of camptothecin (CPT) were prepared. Surface morphology was characterized using a scanning electron microscope. CPT was released from the CPT-Nva-MPs over 24 h in rat plasma at 37 degrees C. In-vivo CPT plasma concentrations were low (approximately 1 ng/ml or less) and constant over a period of 4 days after a single i.v. injection of CPT-Nva-MPs as compared with high but short-lived systemic exposures after an i.v. injection of free CPT. This suggests that sustained local CPT concentrations were achieved in the lung after administration of the MP delivery system. Anticancer efficacy was evaluated in an orthotopic lung cancer animal model and compared with a bolus injection of CPT. Animals receiving free CPT (2 mg/kg) and CPT-Nva-MPs (0.22 mg/kg CPT and 100 mg/kg MPs) were found to have statistically significant smaller areas of lung cancer (P<0.05 and 0.01, respectively) than untreated animals. In addition, 40% of the animals receiving CPT-Nva-MPs were found to be free of cancer. The CPT dose using targeted MPs was 10 times lower than after i.v. injection of free CPT, but was more effective in reducing the amount of cancerous areas. In conclusion, CPT-Nva-MPs were able to achieve effective local lung and low systemic CPT concentrations at a dose that was 10 times lower than systemically administered CPT resulting in a significant improvement in anticancer efficacy in an orthotopic rat model of lung cancer.


Prevalence and associated factors of restless legs in a 57-year-old urban population in northern Finland.

Genomic Assays for Identification of Chikungunya Virus in Blood Donors, Puerto Rico, 2014. A newly developed transcription-mediated amplification assay was used to detect chikungunya virus infection in 3 of 557 asymptomatic donors (0.54%) from Puerto Rico during the 2014-2015 Caribbean epidemic. Viral detection was confirmed by using PCR, microarray, and next-generation sequencing. Molecular clock analysis dated the emergence of the Puerto Rico strains to early 2013. 

Phototransformation of imidacloprid on isolated tomato fruit cuticles and on tomato fruits. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is widely used in plant protection to prevent crop losses. The objective of this study was to show the photochemical fate of imidacloprid on plant surfaces by irradiation experiments on isolated tomato fruit cuticles and tomato fruits (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Imidacloprid spiked samples were irradiated both under sunlight simulator and natural sunlight conditions for 24h, which resulted in recoveries of 23% and 24%, respectively, if isolated cuticles were studied. On whole tomato fruits, recoveries were 33% and 71%, respectively. Similar results were obtained on cuticles spiked with the formulation Confidor and irradiated under natural sunlight. However, on tomato fruits the application of Confidor resulted in a higher loss (56%) of imidacloprid. During all irradiation experiments both on cuticles and whole fruits, 1-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]imidazolidin-2-imine was generally formed at 10-14 mol%, but different other photoproducts were also detected in low amounts, whereas N-nitrosoimidacloprid was only detected under natural sunlight conditions. Rapid photodegradation of imidacloprid could be demonstrated in all experiments. The identified photoproducts, 1-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]imidazolidin-2-imine and N-nitrosoimidacloprid, are possible reaction partners for plant cuticle constituents to form cuticle bound residues.

Plasmodium chabaudi limits early Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-induced pulmonary immune activation and Th2 polarization in co-infected mice. Larvae of several common species of parasitic nematodes obligately migrate through, and often damage, host lungs. The larvae induce strong pulmonary Type 2 immune responses, including T-helper (Th)2 cells as well as alternatively activated macrophages (AAMphi) and associated chitinase and Fizz/resistin family members (ChaFFs), which are thought to promote tissue repair processes. Given the prevalence of systemic or lung-resident Type 1-inducing pathogens in geographical areas in which nematodes are endemic, we wished to investigate the impact of concurrent Type 1 responses on the development of these Type 2 responses to nematode larval migration. We therefore infected BALB/c mice with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, in the presence or absence of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi malaria parasites. Co-infected animals received both infections on the same day, and disease was assessed daily before immunological measurements were taken at 3, 5, 7 or 20 days post-infection. We observed that the nematodes themselves caused transient loss of body mass and red blood cell density, but co-infection then slightly ameliorated the severity of malarial anaemia. We also tracked the development of immune responses in the lung and thoracic lymph node. By the time of onset of the adaptive immune response around 7 days post-infection, malaria co-infection had reduced pulmonary expression of ChaFFs. Assessment of the T cell response demonstrated that the Th2 response to the nematode was also significantly impaired by malaria co-infection. P. c. chabaudi co-infection altered both local and lymph node Type 2 immune activation due to migration of N. brasiliensis larvae. Given recent work from other laboratories showing that N. brasiliensis-induced ChaFFs correlate to the extent of long-term lung damage, our results raise the possibility that co-infection with malaria might alter pulmonary repair processes following nematode migration. Further experimentation in the co-infection model developed here will reveal the longer-term consequences of the presence of both malaria and helminths in the lung.


Direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture bottles by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Dynamin 2 orchestrates the global actomyosin cytoskeleton for epithelial maintenance and apical constriction. The mechanisms controlling cell shape changes within epithelial monolayers for tissue formation and reorganization remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of dynamin, a large GTPase, in epithelial morphogenesis. Depletion of dynamin 2 (Dyn2), the only dynamin in epithelial cells, prevents establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity, with no junctional formation and abnormal actin organization. Expression of Dyn2 mutants shifted to a non-GTP state, by contrast, causes dramatic apical constriction without disrupting polarity. This is due to Dyn2's interactions with deacetylated cortactin and downstream effectors, which cause enhanced actomyosin contraction. Neither inhibitors of endocytosis nor GTP-shifted Dyn2 mutants induce apical constriction. This suggests that GTPase-dependent changes in Dyn2 lead to interactions with different effectors that may differentially modulate endocytosis and/or actomyosin dynamics in polarized cells. We propose this enables Dyn2 to coordinate, in a GTPase-dependent manner, membrane recycling and actomyosin contractility during epithelial morphogenesis.

Carbohydrates and activity of natural and recombinant tissue factor. The effect of glycosylation on tissue factor (TF) activity was evaluated, and site-specific glycosylation of full-length recombinant TF (rTF) and that of natural TF from human placenta (pTF) were studied by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The amidolytic activity of the TF.factor VIIa (FVIIa) complex toward a fluorogenic substrate showed that the catalytic efficiency (V(max)) of the complex increased in the order rTF(1-243) (Escherichia coli) < rTF(1-263) (Sf9 insect cells) < pTF for the glycosylated and deglycosylated forms. Substrate hydrolysis was unaltered by deglycosylation. In FXase, the K(m) of FX for rTF(1-263)-FVIIa remained unchanged after deglycosylation, whereas the k(cat) decreased slightly. A pronounced decrease, 4-fold, in k(cat) was observed for pTF.FVIIa upon deglycosylation, whereas the K(m) was minimally altered. The parameters of FX activation by both rTF(1-263D)-FVIIa and pTF(D)-FVIIa were identical and similar to those for rTF(1-243)-FVIIa. In conclusion, carbohydrates significantly influence the activity of TF proteins. Carbohydrate analysis revealed glycosylation on asparagines 11, 124, and 137 in both rTF(1-263) and pTF. The carbohydrates of rTF(1-263) contain high mannose, hybrid, and fucosylated glycans. Natural pTF contains no high mannose glycans but is modified with hybrid, highly fucosylated, and sialylated sugars.

Combining peripheral nerve grafting and matrix modulation to repair the injured rat spinal cord. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord (SCI) causes death of neurons, disruption of motor and sensory nerve fiber (axon) pathways and disruption of communication with the brain. One of the goals of our research is to promote axon regeneration to restore connectivity across the lesion site. To accomplish this we developed a peripheral nerve (PN) grafting technique where segments of sciatic nerve are either placed directly between the damaged ends of the spinal cord or are used to form a bridge across the lesion. There are several advantages to this approach compared to transplantation of other neural tissues; regenerating axons can be directed towards a specific target area, the number and source of regenerating axons is easily determined by tracing techniques, the graft can be used for electrophysiological experiments to measure functional recovery associated with axons in the graft, and it is possible to use an autologous nerve to reduce the possibility of graft rejection. In our lab we have performed both autologous (donor and recipient are the same animal) and heterologous (donor and recipient are different animals) grafts with comparable results. This approach has been used successfully in both acute and chronic injury situations. Regenerated axons that reach the distal end of the PN graft often fail to extend back into the spinal cord, so we use microinjections of chondroitinase to degrade inhibitory molecules associated with the scar tissue surrounding the area of SCI. At the same time we have found that providing exogenous growth and trophic molecules encourages longer distance axonal regrowth into the spinal cord. Several months after transplantation we perform a variety of anatomical, behavioral and electrophysiological tests to evaluate the recovery of function in our spinal cord injured animals. This experimental approach has been used successfully in several spinal cord injury models, at different levels of injury and in different species (mouse, rat and cat). Importantly, the peripheral nerve grafting approach is effective in promoting regeneration by acute and chronically injured neurons.

Surgical treatment of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws with the use of buccal fat pad: case report. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BROJ) has been described since 2003 as an adverse effect of bisphosphonate medications. These drugs act on the vasculature and bone remodeling, mainly on osteoclastic activity and can cause areas of necrotic bone exposure. Treatment for the BROJ is not yet defined, but surgical treatment is one of the forms proposed, which may cause oral deformities like sinus communication in some cases. In situations like this the buccal fat pad is an important alternative for coating nasal-oral communications, due its large blood supply, elasticity, absence of restriction by age and safety. This paper presents the case of a 58-year-old woman with BROJ in the left maxilla caused by the use of zoledronic acid for metastatic breast cancer. The extensive necrotic bone area was surgically removed resulting in oral sinus communication. A buccal fat pad was used to cover the defect. More studies should be performed regarding the treatment of BROJ but, if necessary, a buccal fat pad flap could be an alternative to solve nasal-oral communications related to BROJ. 

Genome-wide linkage scan of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting in 91 families of central European origin. Orofacial clefts are among the most common of all congenital disorders. Nonsyndromic cases of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) and cleft palate only (NSCPO) are considered to have a multifactorial etiology which involves both genetic and environmental factors. We present the results of a genome-wide linkage scan in 91 families of central European descent with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (NSC). The sample included 74 NSCL/P families, 15 NSCPO families, and 2 mixed families (a total of 217 affected and 230 unaffected individuals were genotyped). We genotyped 542 microsatellite markers (average intermarker distance = 6.9 cM). Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis was performed using Allegro 2.0f. In addition to the factors investigated in previous genome-wide linkage analyses, we searched for sex-specific susceptibility loci, loci demonstrating parental imprinting and loci that are shared by NSCL/P and NSCPO. Several genomic regions likely to contain susceptibility loci for NSC were identified at the level of nominal significance. Some of these overlap with regions identified in previous studies. Suggestive evidence of linkage was obtained for the loci 4q21-q26 and 1p31-p21, with the chromosome 1 locus showing a male-specific genetic effect. Our study has identified promising chromosomal regions for the identification of NSC-associated genes, and demonstrates the importance of performing detailed statistical analyses which take into account complex genetic mechanisms such as sex-specific effects and genomic imprinting. Further research in large patient samples is necessary to identify factors common to NSCL/P and NSCPO.


Customizing deep brain stimulation to the patient using computational models.

Transplantation of human thioredoxin gene-modified hepatocytes for treatment of acute liver failure in rat model. Mostly because of the limited number and proliferative ability of the transplanted hepatocytes, hepatocyte transplantation offers only temporary support to the hepatic function with rather poor functional replacement of the damaged liver parenchyma. This study aimed to observe the therapeutic effect of human thioredoxin (hTrx) gene-modified hepatocytes on experimental acute liver failure in rats. hTrx cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human osteosarcoma 143 (TK-) cells to construct the recombinant retrovirus vector pLEGFP/hTrx, which was packaged into PA317 cells to collect the recombinant retrovirus containing hTrx gene. After titration and characterization, the recombinant retrovirus was applied to primary cultured rat hepatocyte for infection to generate hTrx gene-modified rat hepatocytes, whose viability and antioxidative capacity were examined by immunohistochemistry and MTT assay, respectively. In a Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model of acute liver failure, the modified hepatocytes were injected into the spleen, and the hepatic function and survival rate of the recipient rats were evaluated at different time points after the transplantation. NIH3T3 cells infected by the recombinant retrovirus were capable of expressing bioactive hTrx in the form of fusion proteins. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated normal function of the hTrx gene-modified hepatocytes, which possessed strong antioxidative capacity as shown by MTT assay. Transplantation of the modified hepatocytes in rats with acute liver failure resulted in significantly lowered serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TBIL) levels (P < 0.05). The hepatocytes exhibited long-term survival and efficient proliferation after transplantation. Fourteen days after the operation, the rat models receiving hTrx gene-modified hepatocytes had significantly higher survival rate than those without the transplantation. hTrx gene-modified hepatocyte transplantation can effectively alleviate acute liver failure in rats.


[Evaluation of the safety of aluminium adjuvant in the preparation of allergic rhinitis animal model].

Biochemical and histochemical comparison of cholinesterases in normal and Alzheimer brain tissues. Cholinesterase activity associated with neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibit altered histochemical properties, such as requiring lower pH (6.8) for optimal cholinesterase staining compared to the pH (8.0) for best visualization of cholinesterases in neurons. Furthermore, visualization of NPs and NFTs can be prevented by agents like the peptidase inhibitor/metalloantibiotic bacitracin. The anomalous behavior of cholinesterases associated with pathological lesions needs to be elucidated because of the putative links between these enzymes and the disease process in AD. In this study, cholinesterases were extracted from AD and normal brain tissue to determine whether the differences observed in histochemical analyses in the two sources were reflected in kinetic properties measured in solubilized enzymes. Isolated brain enzymes from both these sources exhibited comparable kinetic parameters with respect to pH dependence, substrate affinity and inhibitor sensitivity and were not significantly affected by other agents that blocked cholinesterase histochemical visualization, such as the structurally diverse metal-chelating antibiotics bacitracin, doxycycline, minocycline and rifampicin. Although the cholinesterases from AD brain tissue examined here represented a total pool of these enzymes from AD brain, rather than enzymes specifically from NPs and NFTs, their kinetic behavior being comparable to cholinesterases isolated from normal brain tissues implies that these enzymes do not undergo disease-related modification in their primary structures. This suggests that the atypical histochemical behavior of cholinesterases in NPs and NFTs may result from interaction of cholinesterases with other molecules within these lesions, mediated by transition metal ions known to be present in AD pathology lesions.


Viral pathogens including human metapneumovirus are the primary cause of febrile respiratory illness in HIV-infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Heterogeneous prevalence of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Spain according to the geographical area: implications for genetic testing. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a high allelic heterogeneity. The knowledge of the most prevalent mutations and their geographical distribution can be useful in designing efficient mutational screening. In the present work we reviewed the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 recurrent mutations in seven geographic areas of Spain to evaluate the effects of their heterogeneous prevalence in genetic testing. We observed that prevalence of recurrent mutations vary according to the geographical origin of the studied families, and accounted for a variable number of positive families depending on the series. Therefore, more upcoming data of larger Spanish population cohorts collected from different areas in the country will allow to design a wider comprehensive panel of recurrent mutations that may be applicable worldwide to families with Hispanic origin.

Heat shock proteins and superantigenic properties of bacteria from  the gastrointestinal tract of patients with Kawasaki disease. We previously suggested that gut bacteria may be involved in the onset of Kawasaki disease (KD). In this study, we evaluated the production of heat shock proteins (hsps) and superantigens (sAgs) by microorganisms isolated from the jejunal mucosa of 19 children with KD in the acute phase and from 15 age-matched control children. We identified 13 strains of Gram-negative microbes from patients with KD; these microbes produced large amounts of hsp60 and induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The Gram-negative microbes also elicited endogenous hsp60 production, leading to the secretion of anti-inflammatory intereukin-10 (IL-10). We also identified 18 strains of Gram-positive cocci that had superantigenic properties and which induced the expansion of Vbeta2 T cells in vitro. All bacteria identified in this study were antibiotic resistant. These data suggest that sAg and hsps produced by gut bacteria might be involved in KD.

Pivotal Advance: Phospholipids determine  net membrane surface charge resulting in  differential localization of active Rac1  and Rac2. In this investigation, we used primary murine neutrophils to demonstrate that local changes in membrane phospholipid composition alter the net cytoplasmic membrane surface charge, which results in selective recruitment of Rac1 or Rac2 based on the net charge of their respective C-terminal domains. Murine neutrophils undergoing chemotaxis or carrying out phagocytosis were transfected with K-ras4B-derived membrane charge biosensors and lipid markers, which allowed us to simultaneously monitor the levels of PIP(2), PIP(3), and PS and net membrane charge of the newly developing phagosome membrane and plasma membrane. Our results indicate that the combination of PIP(2), PIP(3), and PS generates a high negative charge (-8) at the plasma membrane of actin-rich pseudopods, where active Rac1 preferentially localizes during phagosome formation. The lipid metabolism that occurs during phagosome maturation results in the localized depletion of PIP(2), PIP(3), and partial decrease in PS. This creates a moderately negative net charge that correlates with the localization of active Rac2. Conversely, the accumulation of PIP(3) at the leading-edge membrane during chemotaxis generates a polarized accumulation of negative charges that recruits Rac1. These results provide evidence that alterations in membrane lipid composition and inner-membrane surface charge are important elements for the recruitment of differentially charged proteins and localization of signaling pathways during phagocytosis and chemotaxis in neutrophils.

The enhancement of transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes by didodecyldimethylammonium bromide coated gold nanoparticles. The development of transfection enhancement of liposomes with attributes of high stability and easy handling in gene therapy is challenging. In this study, we report didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB, a cationic lipid) coated gold nanoparticles (DDAB-AuNPs), which can enhance the transfection efficiency generated by two kinds of commercially available cationic liposomes: Lipotap and DOTAP. It showed that DDAB-AuNPs at the optimal concentrations could produce more than 2 times increase when measuring the number of cells expressed green fluorescent protein and 48-fold increase for luciferase levels after transfection, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) experiments showed that more DNA molecules binding to the lipoplexes after adding DDAB-AuNPs. In addition, the flow cytometry (FCM) results indicated that DDAB-AuNPs increased cellular uptake efficiency of DNA molecules, which might account for the enhancement of transfection efficiency. It has also been found that the DDAB-AuNPs could decrease the cytotoxicity of liposomes to the cells.

Co-localization of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid and Glutamate in Neurons of the Spider Central Nervous System. Spider sensory neurons with cell bodies close to various sensory organs are innervated by putative efferent axons from the central nervous system (CNS). Light and electronmicroscopic imaging of immunolabeled neurons has demonstrated that neurotransmitters present at peripheral synapses include γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and octopamine. Moreover, electrophysiological studies show that these neurotransmitters modulate the sensitivity of peripheral sensory neurons. Here, we undertook immunocytochemical investigations to characterize GABA and glutamate-immunoreactive neurons in three-dimensional reconstructions of the spider CNS. We document that both neurotransmitters are abundant in morphologically distinct neurons throughout the CNS. Labeling for the vesicular transporters, VGAT for GABA and VGLUT for glutamate, showed corresponding patterns, supporting the specificity of antibody binding. Whereas some neurons displayed strong immunolabeling, others were only weakly labeled. Double labeling showed that a subpopulation of weakly labeled neurons present in all ganglia expresses both GABA and glutamate. Double labeled, strongly and weakly labeled GABA and glutamate immunoreactive axons were also observed in the periphery along muscle fibers and peripheral sensory neurons. Electron microscopic investigations showed presynaptic profiles of various diameters with mixed vesicle populations innervating muscle tissue as well as sensory neurons. Our findings provide evidence that: (1) sensory neurons and muscle fibers are innervated by morphologically distinct, centrally located GABA- and glutamate immunoreactive neurons; (2) a subpopulation of these neurons may co-release both neurotransmitters; and (3) sensory neurons and muscles are innervated by all of these neurochemically and morphologically distinct types of neurons. The biochemical diversity of presynaptic innervation may contribute to how spiders filter natural stimuli and coordinate appropriate response patterns.

Femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy in naturally occurring high astigmatism.

Catheter ablation of arrhythmic storm triggered by monomorphic ectopic beats in patients with coronary artery disease. Frequent episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardias/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in patients with coronary artery disease can be triggered by monomorphic ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and thus, amenable to catheter ablation. The goal of this study was to review single-center experience in catheter ablation of electrical storm caused by focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF. Catheter ablation of electrical storm due to focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF was performed in nine patients (mean age, 62+/-7 years; two females). All patients had previous myocardial infarction (interval of 3 days to 171 months). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 27+/-6 percent. All patients presented with repeated runs of polymorphic VT/VF triggered by monomorphic VPBs. Based on mapping data, the ectopic beats originated from scar border zone on interventricular septum (n=5), inferior wall (n=3), and lateral wall (n=1). Catheter ablation was performed to abolish the triggering ectopy and to modify the arrhythmogenic substrate by linear lesions within the infarct border zone. The ablation procedure was acutely successful in eight out of nine patients. During the follow-up of 13+/-7 months, two patients died due to progressive heart failure. One patient had late recurrence of electrical storm due to ectopic beats of different morphology and was successfully reablated. Electrical storm due to focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF may occur either in subacute phase of myocardial infarction or substantially later after index event. Catheter ablation of ectopic beats triggering these arrhythmias can successfully abolish electrical storm and become a life-saving procedure.

Multicentre experience with MGuard net protective stent in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: safety, feasibility, and impact on myocardial reperfusion. To report, for the first time, angiographic and ECG results as well as in-hospital and 1-month clinical follow-up, after MGuard net protective stent (Inspire-MD, Tel-Aviv, Israel-MGS) implantation in consecutive, not randomized, STEMI patients undergoing primary or rescue PCI. Distal embolization may decrease coronary and myocardial reperfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) setting. One-hundred consecutive patients underwent PCI, with MGS deployment for STEMI, in five different high-volume PCI centres. Sixteen patients presented cardiogenic shock at admission. All patients underwent successful procedures: mean TIMI flow grade and mean corrected TIMI frame count-cTFC(n)-improved from baseline values to 2.85 +/- 0.40 and to 17.20 +/- 10.51, respectively, with a mean difference in cTFC(n) between baseline and postprocedure of 46.88 +/- 31.86. High-myocardial blush grade (90% MBG 3; 10% MBG 2) was also achieved in all patients. Sixty minutes post-PCI, a high rate (90%) of complete (>or=70%) ST-segment resolution was achieved. At in-hospital follow-up, seven deaths occurred: noteworthy, 5 of 16 patients with cardiogenic shock at admission died. After hospital discharge, no Major Adverse Cardiac Events have been reported up to 30-day follow-up. MGS might represent a safe and feasible option for PCI in STEMI patients, providing high perfusional and ECG improvement. Further randomized trials comparing this strategy with the conventional one are needed in the near future to assess the impact on clinical practice of this strategy.

Localization of cerebral functional deficits in treatment-naive, first-episode schizophrenia using resting-state fMRI. Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural activity, and the present study attempts to explore the functional changes in the regional brain in patients with schizophrenia using the amplitude of the BOLD signals. A total of 66 treatment-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients and 66 normal age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Resting-state fMRIs were obtained using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. Voxel-based analysis of the ALFF maps between control and patient groups was performed with twos-sample t-tests using SPM2. Compared to the controls, the FES group showed significantly decreased ALFF in the medial prefrontal lobe (MPFC) and significant increases in the ALFF in the left and right putamen. Significant positive correlations were observed between ALFF values in the bilateral putamen in both the patient and control groups. Alterations of the ALFF in the MPFC and putamen in FES observed in the present study suggest that the functional abnormalities of those areas are at an early stage of the disease.

Abdomino-peritoneal tuberculosis masquerading as ovarian cancer: a retrospective study of 26 cases. Evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and operative findings in women of abdomino-pelvic tuberculosis undergoing laparotomy for suspected ovarian cancer. A retrospective analysis of 26 women who underwent laparotomy for ovarian cancer and found to have abdomino-pelvic tuberculosis in three hospitals of Delhi. The mean age was 34.65 years. Symptoms were menstrual dysfunction in 12 (46.2%), abdominal distension (8 women, 30.7%), abdominal pain (26 women, 100%), abdominal mass (5 women, 19.2%). Mean and standard deviation (SD) of Ca-125 levels were 594.22 ± 770.07. The mean ± SD of right and left tubovarian mass being 5.82 ± 3.94 cm and 5.81 ± 3.21 cm, respectively. Abdominal hysterectomy was done in 4 (15.4%) cases, right ovariotomy in 5 (19.2%), left Ovariotomy in 6 (23.1%), biopsies from right ovary 11 (42.3%), left ovary 7 (26.9%), omentum 10 (38.5%), peritoneum in 15 (57.7%). Tuberculous granuloma and AFB stain on histopathology were observed in all cases. Peritoneal tuberculosis with abdomino-pelvic masses was difficult to differentiate from ovarian cancer. Antitubercular drugs are the treatment of choice and complete surgery being difficult and hazardous should be avoided.

Molecular characterization of five Sarcocystis species in red deer ( Cervus elaphus), including Sarcocystis hjorti n. sp., reveals that these species are not intermediate host specific. Muscle tissue from 37 red deer from Norway was examined for sarcocysts. Sarcocysts from 2 reindeer were obtained for comparative studies. Cysts were excised and morphologically classified by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and DNA sequence analysis. Five Sarcocystis species, Sarcocystis hjorti n. sp., Sarcocystis hardangeri, Sarcocystis ovalis, Sarcocystis rangiferi, and Sarcocystis tarandi, were found. All 5 species have previously been identified from either reindeer or moose by their sarcocyst morphology and/or ssu rRNA gene sequence. S. hjorti was the most prevalent species. Multiple variants of the ssu rRNA gene and the first internal transcribed spacer were found in S. rangiferi and S. tarandi from both red deer and reindeer. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that S. tarandi occurs in both red deer and reindeer, but it could not be clearly demonstrated whether the sequence variation within S. rangiferi between hosts was due to different paralogues or/and different species. DNA sequencing was necessary for definitive species identification, since the hair-like protrusions on the cysts of S. hjorti were not always recognizable by light microscopy and since different cervids harbour Sarcocystis species with highly similar cyst morphology of which at least some are not intermediate host specific.


Evaluation of the respiratory muscular function by means of diaphragmatic mechanomyographic signals in COPD patients.

[Genetics of mental retardation]. Mental retardation affects nearly 3 % of the population. The causes of these disorders are various and are often not identified. Recent advances focused on the molecular basis of mental retardation. Nearly half of mental retardation syndromes have a genetic origin and the description of molecular, cytogenetic and metabolic alterations in these disorders led to the development of diagnostic tools. Indeed, identifying the precise origin of the mental retardation allows to improve patient care and to refine the prognosis. Moreover, these molecular tools will help the geneticist to evaluate the recurrence risk in the family in the genetic counseling step. On a fundamental point of view, the knowledge of molecular basis of mental retardation will help to understand the biological pathway which constitutes the first step before therapeutic strategies. Every patient with mental retardation should be investigated for causal origin of the disease. We will detail the diagnostic methods necessary to investigate a patient presenting with mental retardation. Then different examples of syndromes including a mental retardation will be chosen to illustrate different clinical situations.

Risk factors related to omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are recognized as congenital malformations with a high mortality. Only 60% of children with such malformations survive until the end of the first year of age. It has been suggested that omphalocele and gastroschisis are associated with other congenital malformations, concerning the bones, the heart and the kidney. The aim of the present study is to determine the risk factors in 12 omphalocele and four gastroschisis cases diagnosed and surveyed in the last four years (November 2003-November 2007) at the Emergency County Hospital of Constanta. In 10 of the 16 cases of the studied group, the subjects resulted from spontaneous premature births. None of the cases in the studied group received the maximum APGAR score, values varying between 6 and 9. The average birth weight in the studied group is 2100 g, with values between 950 g and 2900 g. Maternal age is between 15-21-year-old. Average maternal age in cases of second-degree gastroschisis is 6.5 years younger than the witness population and in case of first degree is 5.8 years younger. 87.5% of children's mothers in studied group are first time pregnant, first time gestant. The mother's socio-economic status may be a risk factor on the occurrence of omphalocele and gastroschisis. 81.25% of children's mother in the studied group have no own income and half are single (mono-parental families). None of the studied cases had a history of congenitally malformed siblings, but half of the cases in the studied group associate congenital malformations of gastro-intestinal tract, locomotor system, kidneys and/or heart. The abdominal wall defect existing in gastroschisis is accompanied by the delay of the intestinal loops differentiation. In all cases of gastroschisis in the studied group, the thin intestine caliber is higher or equal to the one of the thick intestine, the intestinal loops remained outside the abdominal cavity have an aspect characteristic to the fifth month of fetal life.

Hemostasis during low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation for continuous venovenous hemofiltration: a randomized cross-over trial comparing two hemofiltration rates. Renal insufficiency increases the half-life of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Whether continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) removes LMWHs is unsettled. We studied hemostasis during nadroparin anticoagulation for CVVH, and explored the implication of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). This cross-over study, performed in a 20-bed teaching hospital ICU, randomized non-surgical patients with acute kidney injury requiring nadroparin for CVVH to compare hemostasis between two doses of CVVH: filtrate flow was initiated at 4 L/h and converted to 2 L/h after 60 min in group 1, and vice versa in group 2. Patients received nadroparin 2850 IU i.v., followed by 380 IU/h continuously in the extracorporeal circuit. After baseline sampling, ultrafiltrate, arterial (art) and postfilter (PF) blood was taken for hemostatic markers after 1 h, and 15 min, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after converting filtrate flow. We compared randomized groups, and 'early circuit clotting' to 'normal circuit life' groups. Fourteen patients were randomized, seven to each group. Despite randomization, group 1 had higher SOFA scores (median 14 (IQR 11-15) versus 9 (IQR 5-9), p = 0.004). Anti-Xa art activity peaked upon nadroparin bolus and declined thereafter (p = 0.05). Anti-Xa PF did not change in time. Anti-Xa activity was not detected in ultrafiltrate. Medians of all anti-Xa samples were lower in group 1 (anti-Xa art 0.19 (0.12-0.37) vs. 0.31 (0.23-0.52), p = 0.02; anti-Xa PF 0.34 (0.25-0.44) vs. 0.51 (0.41-0.76), p = 0.005). After a steep decline, arterial ETPAUC tended to increase (p = 0.06), opposite to anti-Xa, while postfilter ETPAUC increased (p = 0.001). Median circuit life was 24.5 h (IQR 12-37 h). Patients with 'short circuit life' had longer baseline prothrombin time (PTT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), lower ETP, higher thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and higher SOFA scores; during CVVH, anti-Xa, and platelets were lower; PTT, aPTT, TAT and D-dimers were longer/higher and ETP was slower and depressed. We found no accumulation and no removal of LMWH activity during CVVH. However, we found that early circuit clotting was associated with more severe organ failure, prior systemic thrombin generation with consumptive coagulopathy, heparin resistance and elevated extracorporeal thrombin generation. ETP integrates these complex effects on the capacity to form thrombin. Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT00965328.

Hamartomas, papillomas and adenocarcinomas of the sinonasal tract and nasopharynx. Lesions of the sinonasal tract are uncommon, with most of the specimens seen by surgical pathologists consisting primarily of fragments of inflamed sinonasal mucosa or inflammatory polyps from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and the occasional squamous cell carcinoma. Other lesions such as hamartomas, various types of Schneiderian papillomas and adenocarcinomas are seen only rarely by most histopathologists; therefore a biopsy or surgical resection specimen from a patient with one of these processes may represent a diagnostic challenge. The aim of this review is to present the pathological features of a group of infrequent epithelial surface and glandular lesions of the sinonasal tract which includes respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma, glandular (seromucinous) hamartoma, exophytic papilloma, inverted papilloma, cylindrical cell (oncocytic) papilloma, low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma and intestinal-type sinonasal adenocarcinoma.

Does pituitary stalk function improve with age? Ectopic posterior pituitary hyperintensity on MRI is a common feature associated with growth hormone deficiency. The presence of at least some residual components of the pituitary stalk is necessary for adequate anterior pituitary function. Little is known about long-term change in pituitary function or MRI findings in patients with ectopic posterior pituitary and interrupted pituitary stalk. We describe a case of childhood growth hormone deficiency and hyperprolactinemia associated with absent pituitary stalk. As an adult, prolactin levels normalized and GH secretion improved associated with changes in MRI findings.

Circulating smooth muscle progenitor cells in atherosclerosis and plaque rupture: current perspective and methods of analysis. Smooth muscle cells play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis and its clinical complications. They were long thought to derive entirely from preexisting smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall, but this understanding has been challenged by the claim that circulating bone marrow-derived smooth muscle progenitor cells are an important source of plaque smooth muscle cells in human and experimental atherosclerosis. This theory is today accepted by many cardiovascular researchers and authors of contemporary review articles. Recently, however, we and others have refuted the existence of bone marrow-derived smooth muscle cells in animal models of atherosclerosis and other arterial diseases based on new experiments with high-resolution microscopy and improved techniques for smooth muscle cell identification and tracking. These studies have also pointed to a number of methodological deficiencies in some of the seminal papers in the field. For those unaccustomed with the methods used in this research area, it must be difficult to decide what to believe and why to do so. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the origin of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis and direct the reader's attention to the methodological challenges that have contributed to the confusion in the field.

Follicular hyperandrogenism downregulates aromatase in luteinized granulosa cells in polycystic ovary syndrome women. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing IVF-embryo transfer based-assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment show variable ovarian responses to exogenous FSH administration. For better understanding and control of PCOS ovarian responses in ART, the present study was carried out to compare the follicular hormones and the expression of granulosa cell genes between PCOS and non-PCOS women during ART treatment as well as their IVF outcomes. Overall, 138 PCOS and 78 non-PCOS women were recruited for the present study. Follicular fluid collected from PCOS women showed high levels of testosterone. The expression of aromatase was found significantly reduced in luteinized granulosa cells from PCOS women. In cultured luteinized granulosa cells isolated from non-PCOS women, their exposure to testosterone at a level that was observed in PCOS follicles could decrease both mRNA and protein levels of aromatase in vitro. The inhibitory effect of testosterone was abolished by androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. These results suggest that the hyperandrogenic follicular environment may be a key hazardous factor leading to the down-regulation of aromatase in PCOS.

Dimensional error of three-dimensional images generated by different software. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions generated by different software, computed tomography (CT) scanners and slice thicknesses. Ten human dry mandibles were scanned by CT and cone beam CT (CBCT). Digital files were processed in different software systems and 3D reconstructions were performed. Linear measures were made and compared. The results showed significant differences in linear distances between the human dry mandibles and their 3D reconstructions. The relative error from CBCT images ranged from 3.10 to 4.82% and from 3.40 to 5.92% in CT images. It is important to consider that the performance of the software is not just related to the algorithm used, but mostly with its handling, that can facilitate or not the measurement by the operator. In conclusion, the discrepancies were not greater than 0.58 mm, so they should not affect the image quality.

Nephrin-signature molecule of the glomerular podocyte? In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the glomerular podocyte, which plays a central role in control of glomerular filtration. A host of new molecules have been identified as playing essential roles in the maintenance of podocyte integrity in both humans and mouse models. Of all of these, arguably the most pivotal is nephrin, a transmembrane receptor molecule located at the specialized podocyte cell-cell junction, termed the slit diaphragm. Mutations in this gene cause the most severe form of congenital nephrotic syndrome, and many interacting proteins have now been described to form a large multiprotein complex with complex dynamics. There is little evidence of functional nephrin expression outside the glomerulus, and there are accumulating data that nephrin is essential for the unique properties of podocyte biology. Utilizing a powerful human cell culture model, comparing wild-type with nephrin-null podocytes, we can show that several crucial functional properties of podocytes depend on nephrin, including insulin responsiveness and cytoskeletal reorganization. Thus, it is reasoned that nephrin is a signature molecule required to define distinct podocyte characteristics.

Head movements produced during linear translations in unexpected directions. Passive translation of the body in space elicits a complex combination of directionally-specific torques that are exerted on the neck. The inertial torques that are produced by linear translation are counteracted by linear vestibular and proprioceptive reflexes that maintain head stability. A novel experimental apparatus was used in this study to translate human subjects in a random and unpredictable direction in order to quantify the head's 3-D movement with respect to the direction of translation. Head movements were found to be produced in systematic patterns as a function of stimulus direction. Roll and yaw head movements were produced in proportion to the magnitude of the lateral component of the translation. Pitch head movements were proportionate to the magnitude of the fore-aft component of the translation. One surprising observation was that head movements produced during lateral translations were, on average, 17% smaller than those produced during fore-aft translations. This suggests that linear vestibular reflexes that stabilize the head may be directionally-specific and more active during lateral whole body translations.

Detection and quantification of the opioid tramadol in urine using surface enhanced Raman scattering. There is an on going requirement for the detection and quantification of illicit substances. This is in particular the case for law enforcement where portable screening methods are needed and there has been recent interest in breath tests for a range of narcotics. In this study we first developed surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of tramadol in water and establish robust and reproducible methods based on silver hydroxylamine colloid. We used 0.5 M NaCl as the aggregating agent, with the pH ∼ 7.0 and SERS data were collected immediately (i.e., the analyte association and colloid aggregation times were zero). The limit of detection was rather high and calculated to be 5 × 10(-4) M which would not be practical in the field. Undeterred we continued with spiking tramadol in artificial urine and found that no aggregating agent or modification of pH was necessary. Indeed aggregation occurred spontaneously due to the complexity of the medium which is rich in multiple salts, which are commonly used for SERS. We estimated the limit of detection in artificial urine to be 2.5 × 10(-6) M which is equivalent to 657.5 ng mL(-1) and very close to the levels typically found in individuals who use tramadol for pain relief. We believe this opens up opportunities for testing SERS in real world samples and this will be an area of future study.

Dasatinib and chronic myeloid leukemia: two-year follow-up in eight clinical trials. Imatinib is currently regarded as the best initial treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, a significant proportion of patients who relapse, fail to respond, or develop intolerance might benefit from the use of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this review, we report the 2-year results in 8 clinical trials involving more than 2000 patients treated with dasatinib (phases I-III). Patients with CML who had failed to respond or were intolerant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase I trial. The positive results emanating from this study led to a series of 5 phase II trials known as START (SRC/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition activity: research trials of dasatinib). In addition, 2 phase III dose-optimization trials have now been completed. These trials demonstrate that dasatinib offers clinical benefit to patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib, with a well-described and manageable adverse event profile.

Application of GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling in studying the lipid-regulating effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats. To evaluate the lipid-regulating effects of extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGB) using pharmacological methods and metabonomic profiling in a rat model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia. EGB was orally administered at a dose level of 40 mg/kg in both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups. All rat samples obtained were examined for known and potential biomarkers and enzyme activity using commercial assay kits and GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling coupled with principal component analysis (PCA). The data obtained from the assay kits indicated that EGB reduced total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in rat plasma obtained from both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups compared with those of the diet-induced hyperlipidemia group. EGB also increased the activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase and excretion of fecal bile acid in rats from the EGB-prevention and-treatment groups. Using GC/MS-based metabonomic analysis, more than 40 endogenous metabolites were identified in rat plasma. PCA of rat plasma samples obtained using GC/MS produced a distinctive separation of the four treatment groups and sampling points within each group. Metabolic changes during hyperlipidemia formation and improvement resulting from EGB treatment were definitively monitored with PCA score plots. Furthermore, elevated levels of sorbitol, tyrosine, glutamine and glucose, and decreased levels of citric acid, galactose, palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, acetic acid, cholesterol, butyrate, creatinine, linoleate, ornithine and proline, were observed in the plasma of rats treated with EGB. EGB exerts multi-directional lipid-lowering effects on the rat metabonome, including limitation of the absorption of cholesterol, inactivation of HMGCoA and favorable regulation of profiles of essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (EFA). Further experiments are warranted to explore the mechanisms of action underlying the lipid-regulating effects of EGB against hyperlipidemia.

Clinical validated Computer-Aided Decision System to the clubfeet deformities. A Computer-Aided Decision System (CADS) was developed in order to assess the abnormalities of the clubfeet deformities. Our system consists of four components: 1) a diagnosis-based ontology of the musculoskeletal system of the lower limbs 2) a database for collecting clinical observations of the clubfeet deformities, e.g. the birth classification 3) the decision tree method and a diagnosis algorithm in order to predict new issues 4) an interactive module for managing the interaction between patients, experts and the due CADS. The pathological decision tree of the relationships between different parameters concerning clubfoot (equinus, varus, medial derotation of the Calcaneo-MidForefoot Unit, supination, muscle function, and joint flexibility) was computed. Rule knowledge was deduced to classify the 3 grades of the clubfoot deformities (Moderate, Severe, Rigid). Our system was validated clinically with the real patient data obtained from the Infant Surgery Service in Robert Debre Hospital in Paris. The remote access into our system has been guaranteed through a dynamic Web-based interface. Our system was developed in order to allow a better assessment for improving the knowledge and thus the evaluation and treatment of clubfeet.

Incidence of non-B subtypes of HIV-1 in Galicia, Spain: high frequency and diversity of HIV-1 among men who have sex with men. An increase in HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been reported in eight regions of Spain from 2003 to 2007. In order to study the incidence of HIV-1 genetic forms in Galicia, northwest of Spain, in particular the spread of HIV-1 variants among MSM, 93 newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients, including those with acute and recently acquired infections, were studied for a year from August 2008 to August 2009. Thirty eight (41%) were MSM. Of them, nine (24%) were infected by non-B viruses, including seven different genetic forms. The analysis of transmission clusters showed that 23 (60%) MSM grouped in different clusters and mostly in large clusters. Resistance mutations were detected in six (16%) MSM.

Cognitive outcome following traumatic brain injury. To determine whether an association exists between traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained in adulthood and cognitive impairment 6 months or longer after injury. Systematic review of the published, peer-reviewed literature. From 430 articles, we identified 11 primary and 22 secondary studies that examined cognitive impairment by using performance measures for adults who were at least 6 months post-TBI. There was clear evidence of an association between penetrating brain injury and impaired cognitive function. Factors that modified this association included preinjury intelligence, volume of brain tissue lost, and brain region injured. There was also suggestive evidence that penetrating brain injury may exacerbate the cognitive effects of normal aging. We found clear evidence for long-term cognitive deficits associated with severe TBI. There was suggestive evidence that moderately severe brain injuries are associated with cognitive impairments. There was inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists between a single, mild TBI and cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. In adults, penetrating, moderate, and severe TBIs are associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether mild TBI is associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury.

Performance of integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of recurrent pancreatic cancer: comparison with integrated FDG-PET/non-contrast-enhanced CT and enhanced CT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast for depiction of recurrent pancreatic cancer, compared with PET/non-enhanced CT and CT. Forty-five patients previously treated for pancreatic cancer underwent PET/CT for suspected recurrence. Lesion status was determined on the basis of histopathology and radiological imaging follow-up. Patient-based analysis showed that sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 91.7%, 95.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, whereas those of PET/non-enhanced CT were 83.3%, 90.5%, and 86.7%, respectively, and those of enhanced CT were 66.7%, 85.7%, and 75.6%, respectively. In 21 patients whom the final diagnosis was obtained from the histopathologic examination, those figures of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 94.7%, 50.0%, and 90.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of PET/contrast-enhanced CT in detecting local recurrence, abdominal lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination were 83.3%, 87.5%, and 83.3%, respectively. PET/contrast-enhanced CT is an accurate modality for assessing recurrence of pancreatic cancer.

Establishment and characterization of two cell lines derived  from primary cultures of Gekko japonicus cerebral cortex. Adult Gekko japonicus is one of those vertebrates that are able to regenerate their missing or amputated tail. The most interesting feature of this animal lies in the ability of its spinal cord to regrow a functional tail. A fundamental question is whether the neuroglial cells play a different role compared with high vertebrates. Since in vitro studies using primary neuroglial cells are hampered by the limited lifespan and miscellaneous genetic background of these cells, we generated neuroglial cell lines from primary cell cultures of cerebral cortex of G. japonicus. The SV40 (simian-virus-40) T antigen gene was introduced into primary cell cultures. Cell cycle analysis, cell growth and proliferation, cell colony formation and contact inhibition, as well as karyotype assays were investigated. Two cell colonies, Gsn-1 and Gsn-3, were immunochemically characterized as glial fibrillary acidic protein and galactocerebroside-positive respectively. Compared with parental primary cells, the Gsn cells displayed shorter population doubling time, decreased percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, higher cell proliferation index, and increased cell activity. In assays of colony characteristics, Gsn cells showed increased cell activity at the lower cell densities or FBS (fetal bovine serum) supplement. The karyotype of immortalized Gsn cells exhibited transformational characteristics with hyperdiploid and polyploid chromosomes. The cell lines will provide a useful in vitro model for gecko neuroglial cells and facilitate systematic studies investigating the biological functions of specific gene products related to regeneration of the central nervous system.

Potential therapeutic strategy for oral squamous cell carcinoma by ErbB3-binding protein 1 gene transfer. An ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1), was shown to be a potent tumor suppressor in breast and prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that the inhibitory properties of the Ebp1 gene could be beneficial if ectopically expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. One OSCC cell line Tca8113 was stably transfected with the complete Ebp1 cDNA or the vector control pcDNA3.1. The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vitro proliferation assay, cell cycle distribution and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as in vivo tumorigenicity. Stable gene transfer was verified by Western Blot analysis and reverse transcription RT-PCR. Following transfection of Ebp1, a significant reduction in cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar were observed. Ectopic expression of Ebp1 led to a change in cell cycle profile and most importantly, a strong decrease in tumorigenicity of human OSCC cell line in a xenograft mouse model. Ectopic expression of Ebp1 mediates multiple antitumor activities against OSCC, suggesting a potential of Ebp1-based novel therapy for clinical OSCC treatment.

A comparison of auditory brainstem responses and behavioral estimates of hearing sensitivity in Lemur catta and Nycticebus coucang. Primates depend on acoustic signals and cues to avoid predators, locate food, and share information. Accordingly, the structure and function of acoustic stimuli have long been emphasized in studies of primate behavioral and cognitive ecology. Yet, few studies have addressed how well primates hear such stimuli; indeed, the auditory thresholds of most primate species are unknown. This empirical void is due in part to the logistic and economic challenges attendant on traditional behavioral testing methods. Technological advances have produced a safe and cost-effective alternative-the auditory brainstem response (ABR) method, which can be utilized in field conditions, on virtually any animal species, and without subject training. Here we used the ABR and four methods of threshold determination to construct audiograms for two strepsirrhine primates: the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) and slow loris (Nycticebus coucang). Next, to verify the general efficacy of the ABR method, we compared our results to published behaviorally-derived audiograms. We found that the four ABR threshold detection methods produced similar results, including relatively elevated thresholds but similarly shaped audiograms compared to those derived behaviorally. The ABR and behavioral absolute thresholds were significantly correlated, and the frequencies of best sensitivity and high-frequency limits were comparable. However, at frequencies < or =2 kHz, ABR thresholds were especially elevated, resulting in decreased agreement with behavioral thresholds and, in Lemur, the ABR 10-dB range starting points were more than 2 octaves higher than the behavioral points. Finally, a comparison of ABR- and behaviorally-derived audiograms from various animal taxa demonstrates the widespread efficacy of the ABR for estimating frequency of best sensitivity, but otherwise suggests caution; factors such as stimulus properties and threshold definition affect results. We conclude that the ABR method is a promising technique for estimating primate hearing sensitivity, but that additional data are required to explore its efficacy for estimating low-frequency thresholds.

[Present and future options for the surgical treatment of patients with advanced heart failure]. Despite considerable improvement in the medical treatment of heart failure, cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard for the treatment of end-stage patients. However, organ shortage forces to look for alternative therapies. A number of innovative approaches are being investigated in terms of improved survival and quality of life in patients refractory to medical therapy. The main cause of heart failure is represented by ischemic cardiomyopathy, responsible for up to 65% of its prevalence in the population. Long-term survival of patients affected by advanced heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is still unsatisfactory, in spite of improved medical therapy. Besides heart transplantation and the implantation of ventricular assist devices, a surgical option is represented by conventional heart surgery, consisting of myocardial revascularization associated with surgical ventricular restoration, correction of mitral valve regurgitation, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure), an international multicenter trial sponsored by the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, will provide important information regarding the effectiveness of such surgical treatment. A new therapeutic option could be represented in the next future by the clinical use of intracardiac elastic devices, currently under investigation, which can be implanted at the mitral annulus and at the level of the left ventricular equator.

Flexible pediatric and adolescent pes planovalgus: conservative and surgical treatment options. Pediatric and adolescent flexible flatfoot is a pathomechanically complex deformity. Conservative and surgical treatment is directed at realigning the foot and alleviating symptoms. When surgical intervention is considered, there are various methods and techniques that may be performed to realign the foot. The treatment goals are directed first at resolution of pain, and second at the realignment of the foot. A specific treatment algorithm does not exist, although planal dominance influences direct the surgeons when considering surgical intervention. Open physis often dictates the direction of the reconstruction. Attempts at essential joint preservation should be strongly considered in this young patient population. This article provides an overview of the common treatment pathways that highlight methods to structurally realign the pediatric and adolescent flatfoot.

Evaluation of applied forces and EMG of the young, aged & stroke population in a 3D arm workspace. The objectives of this study were to evaluate 11 muscle electromyograms (EMGs) while performing force application tasks in a 3D workspace, and to identify challenging regions within the workspace in which subjects had difficultly generating forces in desired directions. Each subject (4 young healthy adults, 4 older with stroke-induced disability, 4 age-matched older) applied forces (8 lbs desired) in 6 directions at 19 locations spatially distributed in the workspace. The normals could meet the force threshold levels except for the 2 female aged participants for the Right force direction. The stroke group had common difficult directions of Up and Right. The muscle activations were dependent upon the applied force direction, with Up force being associated with maximum EMGs. Maximum variation in the EMGs was in the right and far region for the young adults and in far and low region for the older adults. The stroke subjects' shoulder-arm EMGs showed less directional variability in the regions of workspace, and considerable compensatory trunk movement, unlike the normals.

Selenium affects the expression of GPx4 and catalase in the liver of chicken. A total of 128 chickens (Gallus gallus, broilers) were used to investigate the effect of organic selenium (Se) in expression of catalase (CAT) and phospholipid hydroperoxidase 4 (GPx4) genes. There were 4 replicates of 4 dietary treatments: T1 (basal diet with no added Se), T2 (T1 with 0.15 ppm Se added), T3 (T1 with 0.3 ppm Se) and T4 (T1 with 3.0 ppm Se). At 4th and 6th week, 2 chickens per replicate pen were sacrificed for whole blood and liver sample collections. Samples were analyzed for total Se by ICP-MS and gene expression by RT-PCR. Dietary supplementation with organic Se (Se-yeast) readily elevated its concentration in the tissues. GPx4 mRNA levels, pooled for both ages, of chickens fed T3 and T4 diets were significantly reduced compared to those fed diet T1 by 47% and 77% respectively, while that of T2 did not differ. Liver CAT mRNA levels at 4th week were significantly decreased as Se supplementation increased, while at 6th week, were not significantly affected by Se. The study showed that liver GPx4 mRNA levels could be down-regulated by excess of Se. It is possible that reserves built by excess of Se meet antioxidant requirements and no additional GPx4 transcription is necessary.

Coronary flow reserve evaluation: basics, techniques and clinical applications. Coronary flow reserve is a useful physiologic parameter providing information on coronary stenoses severity. To date, the gold standard to evaluate coronary flow reserve consists of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, assessed with a pressure-wire. The FFR has a high lesion specificity, due to insensitivity to patient hemodynamic status and to coronary microvascular resistance; it shows low inter- and intraindividual variability and a well-defined, bound cut-off range values (0.75-0.80). Several reports confirmed that FFR has high reproducibility and feasibility in patients with either single- or multi-vessel coronary artery disease, or with both stable and instable coronary artery disease and that is significantly associated with patient outcome. More recently, the FFR has been used as a sensitive marker of successful percutaneous coronary intervention, since postprocedural FFR value strongly predicts patients event-free survival rate after angioplasty. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that abnormal FFR ratios can be also associated with diffused atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in the absence of unique angiographically detectable stenoses requiring revascularization. There are strong evidences supporting that the FFR provides crucial functional information that could be related with morphological endovascular ultrasound findings, with the possibility to achieve same information in a cheaper, easier and more available manner. This review will focus on the current available literature regarding coronary flow reserve quantification and its clinical validation, suggesting and highlighting its current and future clinical applications.

Investigation of factors affecting hypothermic pelvic tissue cooling using bio-heat simulation based on MRI-segmented anatomic models. This study applied a simulation method to map the temperature distribution based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individual patients, and investigated the influence of different pelvic tissue types as well as the choice of thermal property parameters on the efficiency of endorectal cooling balloon (ECB). MR images of four subjects with different prostate sizes and pelvic tissue compositions, including fatty tissue and venous plexus, were analyzed. The MR images acquired using endorectal coil provided a realistic geometry of deformed prostate that resembled the anatomy in the presence of ECB. A single slice with the largest two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional area of the prostate gland was selected for analysis. The rectal wall, prostate gland, peri-rectal fatty tissue, peri-prostatic fatty tissue, peri-prostatic venous plexus, and urinary bladder were manually segmented. Pennes' bioheat thermal model was used to simulate the temperature distribution dynamics, by using an in-house finite element mesh based solver written in MATLAB. The results showed that prostate size and periprostatic venous plexus were two major factors affecting ECB cooling efficiency. For cases with negligible amount of venous plexus and small prostate, the average temperature in the prostate and neurovascular bundles could be cooled down to 25 °C within 30 min. For cases with abundant venous plexus and large prostate, the temperature could not reach 25 °C at the end of 3 h cooling. Large prostate made the cooling difficult to propagate through. The impact of fatty tissue on cooling effect was small. The filling of bladder with warm urine during the ECB cooling procedure did not affect the temperature in the prostate or NVB. In addition to the 2D simulation, in one case a 3D pelvic model was constructed for volumetric simulation. It was found that the 2D slice with the largest cross-sectional area of prostate had the most abundant venous plexus, and was the most difficult slice to cool, thus it may provide a conservative prediction of the cooling effect. This feasibility study demonstrated that the simulation tool could potentially be used for adjusting the setting of ECB for individual patients during hypothermic radical prostatectomy. Further studies using MR thermometry are required to validate the in silico results obtained using simulation.

Preprocedural inflammation does not affect neointimal hyperplasia following everolimus-eluting stent implantation. Preprocedual C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported to correlate with in-stent restenosis following bare-metal stent implantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preprocedural inflammation on neointimal hyperplasia assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) following everolimus-eluting stent (EES) implantation. We identified 134 patients meeting the following criteria: 1) patients treated with EES; 2) those with stable or unstable angina; and 3) patients available for high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP before the procedure and volumetric IVUS analysis at follow up. We divided the patients into two groups on the basis of hs-CRP levels (< 3 or > or = 3 mg/L) before the procedure and compared IVUS parameters. Volume index (volume/length) was calculated for vessel (VVI), plaque (PVI), neointima (NIV), stent (SVI), and lumen (LVI). Percent neointimal volume (%NIV) was calculated as (NIV/SVI) x 100. Cross-sectional narrowing (CSN) was defined as neointimal area divided by stent area (%). There was no significant difference in VVI, PVI, or LVI at either baseline or 8-month follow up between the two groups. At 8-month follow up, there was also no significant difference in %NIV (4.93 +/- 5.66% vs. 4.98 +/- 5.25% p = 0.959) and maximum %CSN (16.81 +/- 13.62% vs. 18.14 +/- 13.91%; p = 0.608) as well as VVI, PVI, and LVI between the two groups. Furthermore, hs-CRP did not correlate with %NIV (r = 0.044; p = 0.610) and maximum %CSN (r = 0.086, p = 0.321) at follow up. There was no significant difference in incidence of late-acquired incomplete stent apposition between the two groups (1.2% vs. 0%; p = 0.512). Our results suggest that preprocedural inflammation does not affect neointimal hyperplasia following EES implantation.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis: a clinicopathologic study with respect to immunoglobulin G4. The possible involvement of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic sclerosing lesions has been suggested. In this study, a clinicopathologic analysis was performed to reveal characteristics of retroperitoneal fibrosis relating to IgG4. The study involved 17 patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed numerous IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates in 10 cases (IgG4-related), but only a few positive cells in 7 cases (non-IgG4-related). All patients with IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis were male, whereas all except 1 with unrelated lesions were female. Histologically, eosinophilic infiltration (>5 cells per high-power field) and obliterative phlebitis were commonly observed in IgG4-related lesions. Serologically, serum IgG and IgG4 concentrations were significantly higher in the IgG4-related cases, with the IgG4 concentrations all over 135 mg/dL (the upper limit of the normal range). Steroid therapy was performed in 13 cases, and was effective irrespective of IgG4. Three patients had recurrence during the follow up. Five of 10 IgG4-related cases had sclerosing lesions at other sites. The only tests that reliably distinguish the 2 groups were serum IgG4 levels or IgG4/IgG ratio in the plasma cells in a tissue biopsy. The only major clinical difference was the striking male predominance in IgG4-related cases. In conclusion, this study revealed that retroperitoneal fibrosis could be classified as IgG4-related or not. This distinction seems important to help better characterize the biology/pathogenesis of both groups and better predict the possibility of other IgG4-related processes at other anatomic sites.

Association Between Awareness of Hypertension and Health-Related Quality of Life in a Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study in Rural Area of Northwest China. Hypertensive patients have more complex health care needs and are more likely to have poorer health-related quality of life than normotensive people. The awareness of hypertension could be related to reduce health-related quality of life. We propose the use of quantile regression to explore more detailed relationships between awareness of hypertension and health-related quality of life. In a cross-sectional, population-based study, 2737 participants (including 1035 hypertensive patients and 1702 normotensive participants) completed the Short-Form Health Survey. A quantile regression model was employed to investigate the association of physical component summary scores and mental component summary scores with awareness of hypertension and to evaluate the associated factors. Patients who were aware of hypertension (N = 554) had lower scores than patients who were unaware of hypertension (N = 481). The median (IQR) of physical component summary scores: 48.20 (13.88) versus 53.27 (10.79), P < 0.01; the mental component summary scores: 50.68 (15.09) versus 51.70 (10.65), P = 0.03. adjusting for covariates, the quantile regression results suggest awareness of hypertension was associated with most physical component summary scores quantiles (P < 0.05 except 10th and 20th quantiles) in which the β-estimates from -2.14 (95% CI: -3.80 to -0.48) to -1.45 (95% CI: -2.42 to -0.47), as the same significant trend with some poorer mental component summary scores quantiles in which the β-estimates from -3.47 (95% CI: -6.65 to -0.39) to -2.18 (95% CI: -4.30 to -0.06). The awareness of hypertension has a greater effect on those with intermediate physical component summary status: the β-estimates were equal to -2.04 (95% CI: -3.51 to -0.57, P < 0.05) at the 40th and decreased further to -1.45 (95% CI: -2.42 to -0.47, P < 0.01) at the 90th quantile. Awareness of hypertension was negatively related to health-related quality of life in hypertensive patients in rural western China, which has a greater effect on mental component summary scores with the poorer status and on physical component summary scores with the intermediate status.

Rehabilitation in the intensive care unit. Critical illness has many devastating sequelae, including profound neuromuscular weakness and psychological and cognitive disturbances that frequently result in long-term functional impairments. Early rehabilitation begun in the intensive care unit (ICU) is emerging as an important strategy both to prevent and to treat ICU-acquired weakness, in an effort to facilitate and improve long-term recovery. Rehabilitation may begin with range of motion and bed mobility exercise, then may progress when the patient is fully alert and able to participate actively to include sitting and posture-based exercise, bed to chair transfers, strength and endurance exercises, and ambulation. Electrical muscle stimulation and inspiratory muscle training are additional techniques that may be employed. Studies conducted to date suggest that such ICU-based rehabilitation is feasible, safe, and effective for carefully selected patients. Further research is needed to identify the optimal patient candidates and procedures and for providing rehabilitation in the ICU.

Evaluation of Safety and Cost-Effectiveness of the Low Risk Ankle Rule in One of Europe's Busiest Pediatric Emergency Departments. Low Risk Ankle Rule (LRAR) has 100% sensitivity for identifying clinically important pediatric ankle fractures (high-risk injuries) and has the potential to safely reduce imaging by approximately 60%. This study investigates the safety and cost-effectiveness of this rule in our institution. All patients triaged during July and August 2013 with an "ankle injury" had a retrospective clinical notes and radiology report review. Data were recorded using Excel and tests of significance, χ test. One hundred twenty-one patients were included. Of these, 65 were female and 56 were male (no significant difference in sex, P = 0.41). Mean age was 9.95 years. Seventy-eight (64%) had LRAR positive examinations. Of these, 77 (98.7%) had an x-ray and 12 (15%) had fractures. Of those with fractures, none had high-risk injuries.Eighteen (100%) of the doctors in our ED felt that a clinical decision rule would be of use within the department. Only 8 (44%) had heard of the LRAR, and of these, only 4 (50%) would be confident to implement the LRAR. Forty-four (88%) of parents felt that an x-ray is required in the diagnosis of ankle injuries in children, and 41 (82%) would want to know whether their child had an ankle sprain or a low-risk fracture even if the management was not different. By implementing the LRAR in our institution, we could reduce ankle x-rays by 64%. This would offer a significant reduction in radiation exposure to a radiosensitive population. Estimated costs of an ankle x-ray and interpretation are Euro 47 ($65), thus with more than 800 carried out per year in The Children's University Hospital, a potential annual saving is Euro 25,000 ($34,500).

Effects of melatonin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidative enzyme activities in the liver, kidneys and brain of rats administered with benzo(a)pyrene. Benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] is a widespread pollutant with a mutagenic, carcinogenic and strong prooxidative properties. The present study evaluated the melatonin effects on lipid peroxidation products levels and on activity of antioxidative enzymes in the course of B(a)P intoxication. Control rats were treated with 0.9% NaCl; another group was given 10mg melatonin/kg bw; a third group was injected twice a week with B(a)P at the dose of 10mg/kg bw; the fourth group received both B(a)P and melatonin at the dose as mentioned above. The experiment continued for 3 months. In homogenates of brain, liver and kidneys lipid peroxidation was appraised by evaluation of malonyldialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenal (MDA+4HDA) levels. Activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dysmutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) were also estimated. In animals receiving both B(a)P and melatonin, lower levels of MDA+4HDA were observed in all organs as compared to the group treated with B(a)P only. Following administration of B(a)P, GSH level decreased in brain and kidney. Melatonin in combination with B(a)P induced rises in the GSH level in liver and brain, as compared to the receiving B(a)P alone. The activity of SOD increased in the rats treated with melatonin alone but the highest activity was observed in rats treated with B(a)P plus melatonin. CAT activity in the melatonin-treated group increased in brain and liver. Similar to SOD, activity of the enzyme significantly increased in the group treated in combination with B(a)P and melatonin, as compared to the remaining groups in all tested tissues. The results suggest that melatonin protects cells from the damaging action of B(a)P. According to our knowledge, there are no studies describing the effects of melatonin on lipid peroxidation markers and antioxidative enzymes during intoxication of B(a)P in the brain, liver and kidneys. The results of present study give a perspective for further studies of its free radical scavenger properties in prevention of oxidative stress dependent diseases, among others cancers caused by carcinogens such as B(a)P.

Hepatitis C virus in Pakistan: a systematic review of prevalence, genotypes and risk factors. In Pakistan more than 10 million people are living with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), with high morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the prevalence, genotypes and factors associated with HCV infection in the Pakistani population. A literature search was performed by using the keywords; HCV prevalence, genotypes and risk factors in a Pakistani population, in Pubmed, PakMediNet and Google scholar. Ninety-one different studies dating from 1994 to May 2009 were included in this study, and weighted mean and standard error of each population group was calculated. Percentage prevalence of HCV was 4.95% +/- 0.53% in the general adult population, 1.72% +/- 0.24% in the pediatric population and 3.64% +/- 0.31% in a young population applying for recruitment, whereas a very high 57% +/- 17.7% prevalence was observed in injecting drug users and 48.67% +/- 1.75% in a multi-transfused population. Most prevalent genotype of HCV was 3a. HCV prevalence was moderate in the general population but very high in injecting drug users and multi-transfused populations. This data suggests that the major contributing factors towards increased HCV prevalence include unchecked blood transfusions and reuse of injection syringes. Awareness programs are required to decrease the future burden of HCV in the Pakistani population.

Intermittent fasting modulates IgA levels in the small intestine under intense stress: a mouse model. Intermittent fasting prolongs the lifespan and unlike intense stress provides health benefits. Given the role of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the intestinal homeostasis, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of intermittent fasting plus intense stress on secretory IgA (SIgA) production and other mucosal parameters in the duodenum and ileum. Two groups of six mice, with intermittent fasting or fed ad libitum for 12weeks, were submitted to a session of intense stress by a bout of forced swimming. Unstressed ad libitum fed or intermittently fasted groups were included as controls. After sacrifice, we evaluated intestinal SIgA and plasma adrenal hormones, lamina propria IgA+ plasma-cells, mRNA expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, α- and J-chains in the liver and intestinal mucosa, as well as pro- (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and Interferon-γ) and anti- (interleukin-2, -4, -10 and transforming growth factor-β) inflammatory cytokines in mucosal samples. Under intense stress, intermittent fasting down- or up-modulated the levels of most parameters in the duodenum and ileum, respectively while up-regulated corticosterone levels without affecting epinephrine. Our data suggest intermittent fasting plus intense stress elicited neuroendocrine pathways that differentially controlled IgA and pIgR expression in duodenum and ileum. These findings provide experimental foundations for a presumable impact of intermittent fasting under intense stress on the intestinal homeostasis or inflammation by triggering or reducing the IgA production in ileum or duodenum respectively.

DNA binding and photocleavage properties and apoptosis-inducing activities of a ruthenium porphyrin complex [(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)2Cl]Cl and its heterometallic derivatives. The interactions of a ruthenium porphyrin complex [(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl]Cl (phen=1,10-phenanthroline, (Py-3')TPP=5-(3'-pyridyl-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin) (1) and its heterometallic derivatives, [Ni(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl][PF(6)] (2) and [Cu(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl][PF(6)] (3), with calf thymus DNA have been investigated by spectroscopic and viscosity measurements in this study. The results showed that these synthetic complexes can bind to double strand helix DNA in groove binding mode, and the intrinsic binding constants of complexes 1, 2 and 3, as calculated according to the decay of the Soret absorption, are (1.35+/-0.5) x10(5)M(-1) (s=4.2), (1.29+/-0.5)x10(5)M(-1) (s=5.6) and (1.22+/-0.5)x10(5)M(-1) (s=6.2) (s is the binding-site size), respectively, which are consistent with those obtained from ethidium bromide-quenching experiments. Further investigations on the photocleavage properties of these complexes on plasmid pBR 322 DNA showed that complexes 1, 2 and 3 could cleave single chain DNA and convert DNA molecules from supercoiled form to the nicked form. As determined by MTT assay, the complexes were also identified as potent antiproliferative agents against A375 human melanoma cells, MCF-7 human breast adrenocarcinoma cells, Colo201 human colon adenocarcinoma cells and HepG2 human liver cancer cells. Complex 1 inhibits the growth of A375 cells through induction of apoptotic cell death and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Further investigation on intracellular mechanisms indicated that Complex 1 induced depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in A375 cells through regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Our results suggest that ruthenium porphyrin complexes could be candidates for further evaluation as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents for human cancers.

Tobacco smoking and level of education in Brazil, 2006. To analyze smoking prevalence and cumulative cigarette consumption and factors associated. Data from 54,369 respondents aged > or = 18 years were analyzed. Data was collected through interviews using the Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para Doenças Crônicas por Inquérito Telefônico (VIGITEL--Telephone-Based Surveillance of Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases) conducted in Brazilian state capitals and Federal District in 2006. Smoking prevalence rates were estimated stratified by level of education and gender in all cities studied and prevalence ratios, crude and adjusted for number of adults living in the same household and number of rooms per household, were also calculated. Lifetime cigarette consumption (pack-years) was analyzed by level of education and gender in all macroregions studied. In Brazil, overall smoking prevalence was significantly higher among men and women with lower education (eight years of schooling = 24.2%; nine years and more = 15.5%). This difference tended to decrease with age and an inverse proportion was seen among the elderly. Reduced risk of smoking was found associated to higher education regardless of the number of adults living in the same household and the number of rooms per household. The prevalence of heavy smokers was higher among those with lower education, especially among women in the Northern region, except for the Southern region, where it was higher among men with higher education. The study results confirmed higher smoking prevalence among those with lower education, especially among younger males. Further studies are needed to better understand the dynamics of tobacco epidemic for developing specific prevention actions targeting different age and social groups.

Intratympanic methylprednisolone in refractory sudden hearing loss: a 27-patient case series with univariate and multivariate analysis. Treatment of sudden hearing loss is a significant matter of discussion. Lack of knowledge of the natural history of the disease and the use of different success criteria are 2 of the main reasons why it is difficult to critically evaluate the data available in the literature. To date, no therapy has proved effective according to the evidence criteria. However, there has been a trend toward the use of steroids in recent years. The management of patients who fail to respond to standard therapy is even more complex; in these cases, intratympanic steroids have been proposed as a valuable solution. Twenty-seven patients unresponsive to traditional systemic therapy were treated with intratympanic steroids. The mean pure-tone average before intratympanic treatment was 79.9 +/- 21.4 SD dB; at Day 30, after local steroid administration, the mean pure-tone average was 60.6 +/- 24.9 SD dB. According to our criteria, 15 (55%) of 27 patients presented a "useful" improvement in the hearing status. No serious complications have been observed. Local application is confirmed as easy to perform and is associated with negligible complications. Our experience, although retrospective, seems to confirm the usefulness (at least in 50% of patients) of local steroids administration in cases of refractory sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Our encouraging data strongly call for further and serious evaluation through randomized studies.

Acquired resistance to 6-thioguanine in melanoma cells involves the repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), is a DNA repair enzyme that recognizes O(6)-alkylated guanine, a base analog resulting from treatment with alkylating agents. O(6)-6-thioguanine (6-TG) is used clinically to treat malignant as well as inflammatory diseases. Although MGMT participates in resistance to alkylating agents, it has not been shown to be involved in resistance of tumors to 6-TG. In this study we used a human melanoma cell line (GA) and its selected 6-TG drug resistant variant (GA-6-TG) to investigate whether MGMT plays a role in determining the drug resistant phenotype of GA-6-TG cells. We showed that GA-6-TG resistant cells express about three fold more MGMT protein and mRNA than GA cells. Treatment with 6-TG diminishes significantly MGMT amounts in both cell lines. Increased amounts of MGMT in resistant cells, are consistent with hypermethylation of the MGMT gene coding-region. Pretreatment of cells with the MGMT inhibitor O6 benzyl guanine, resulted in sensitization of GA-6-TG cells to 6-TG. Taken together, our data suggests that MGMT is associated with 6-TG drug resistance. In analogy to patients treated with alkylating agents, patients with tumors containing increased MGMT amounts, may be more resistant to 6-TG and therefore may benefit from treatment with MGMT inhibitors.

Lactate damages primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. In the present study, rat primary cultures were used to study the effect of lactate on the survival of hippocampal neurons in the presence or absence of glucose. Our results showed no extensive cell damage under glucose-free conditions compared with glucose-rich conditions. Addition of 10 and 50 mM lactate to glucose-free and glucose-rich media increased the cell damage significantly, as observed by morphology and lactate dehydrogenase activity. The results of the present study suggest that primary neurons in vitro are not sensitive to glucose deficiency and the presence of lactate damages the neurons in a concentration-dependent manner.

Synthetic modeling chemistry of iron-sulfur clusters in nitric oxide signaling. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is involved in many physiological and pathological functions. Iron-sulfur proteins are one of the main reaction targets for NO, and the [Fe-S] clusters within these proteins are converted to various iron nitrosyl species upon reaction with NO, of which dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) are the most prevalent. Much progress has been made in identifying the origin of cellular DNIC generation. However, it is not well-understood which other products besides DNICs may form during [Fe-S] cluster degradation nor what effects DNICs and other degradation products can have once they are generated in cells. Even more elusive is an understanding of the manner by which cells cope with unwanted [Fe-S] modifications by NO. This Account describes our synthetic modeling efforts to identify cluster degradation products derived from the [2Fe-2S]/NO reaction in order to establish their chemical reactivity and repair chemistry. Our intent is to use the chemical knowledge that we generate to provide insight into the unknown biological consequences of cluster modification. Our recent advances in three different areas are described. First, new reaction conditions that lead to the formation of previously unrecognized products during the reaction of [Fe-S] clusters with NO are identified. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule, can be generated from the reaction between [2Fe-2S] clusters and NO in the presence of acid or formal H• (e(-)/H(+)) donors. In the presence of acid, a mononitrosyl iron complex (MNIC) can be produced as the major iron-containing product. Second, cysteine analogues can efficiently convert MNICs back to [2Fe-2S] clusters without the need for any other reagents. This reaction is possible for cysteine analogues because of their ability to labilize NO from MNICs and their capacity to undergo C-S bond cleavage, providing the necessary sulfide for [2Fe-2S] cluster formation. Lastly, unique dioxygen reactivity of various types of DNICs has been established. N-bound neutral {Fe(NO)2}(10) DNICs react with O2 to generate low-temperature stable peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) species, which then carry out nitration chemistry in the presence of phenolic substrates, relevant to tyrosine nitration chemistry. The reaction between S-bound anionic {Fe(NO)2}(9) DNICs and O2 results in the formation of Roussin's red esters (RREs) and thiol oxidation products, chemistry that may be important in biological cysteine oxidation. The N-bound cationic {Fe(NO)2}(9) DNICs can spontaneously release NO, and this property can be utilized in developing a new class of NO-donating agents with anti-inflammatory activity. 

Treatment of relapsed Wilms tumors: lessons learned. Treatment regimens for recurrent Wilms tumor (WT) are currently designed to include drugs that are not used during primary chemotherapy, using a risk-stratified approach. Therapy of recurrent disease depends on the nature of initial treatment, and of recognized prognostic indicators inherent in the primary tumor. Several highly effective chemotherapy regimens, including ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide, cyclophosphamide-etoposide and carboplatin-etoposide, are considered first treatment choice for recurrent disease. While intense-dose chemotherapy is uniformly accepted to treat high-risk recurrent WTs, the optimal therapy for standard-risk children has yet to be defined, owing to the small number of such patients and their relatively better prognosis compared with high-risk recurrences. Recurrent tumors among those defined as very-high risk are likely to develop chemoresistant disease, and novel therapeutic strategies will be necessary to cure these patients. Evidence on how to properly administer surgery and radiotherapy at relapse is more fragmentary. The authors have reviewed the available experiences concerning the treatment of recurrent WT, and have attempted to provide the most up-to-date recommendations regarding the optimal risk-based treatment for these patients.

Human security in the Asia Pacific: perspective of food and health security. As combined new factors could further complicate the food supply and health security for regional countries, new perspective on human security should be prioritized on securing health security in the region. In recent years, food production and supply has been affected by unpredictable climate change and unaccountable manmade factors in the region. With increased pressure from food security issues, personal health and human security is badly affected. It poses a threat to human security and becomes a concern of all states. In the new era, the pressing reality for all countries is that there is no exception for anyone before a pandemic. Threats to human security become not only a national security issue but also a transnational challenge.

Clinical physiology: a successful academic and clinical discipline is threatened in Sweden. Clinical physiologists in Sweden are physicians (the majority with a PhD degree) with thorough training in system physiology and pathophysiology. They investigate patients in a functional approach and are engaged in basic and applied physiology teaching and research. In 1954, clinical physiology was founded as an independent academic and clinical discipline by the Swedish government to ensure "contact between routine clinical work and the scientific progression." Up until 2008, clinical physiology was an independent clinical discipline but was then made a subdiscipline to radiology, a fundamentally different discipline. Individuals wishing to become clinical physiologists are required to be trained and certified as European radiologists, after which training and certification as clinical physiologists may be pursued. This means that radiologists without training in clinical physiology have become gatekeepers for future clinical physiologists. Unfortunately, this development takes place at a time when research and education in preclinical integrative physiology have diminished in favor of other organizational levels, such as cellular and molecular biology. The responsibilities for education and research in integrative human physiology have therefore mainly been transferred to clinical physiologists. Clinical physiology has been a successful independent clinical discipline in Sweden for the past 55 years and could serve as a model for other countries. Unless clinical physiologists regain control over their own discipline, systems physiology as a knowledge base and resource for patient care, education, and research will be severely impaired.

Motivations for Reducing Other HIV Risk-Reduction Practices if Taking Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: Findings from a Qualitative Study Among Women in Kenya and South Africa. Findings from a survey conducted among women at high risk for HIV in Bondo, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa, demonstrated that a substantial proportion would be inclined to reduce their use of other HIV risk-reduction practices if they were taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). To explore the motivations for their anticipated behavior change, we conducted qualitative interviews with 60 women whose survey responses suggested they would be more likely to reduce condom use or have sex with a new partner if they were taking PrEP compared to if they were not taking PrEP. Three interrelated themes were identified: (1) "PrEP protects"--PrEP was perceived as an effective HIV prevention method that replaced the need for condoms; (2) condoms were a source of conflict in relationships, and PrEP would provide an opportunity to resolve or avoid this conflict; and (3) having sex without a condom or having sex with a new partner was necessary for receiving material goods and financial assistance--PrEP would provide reassurance in these situations. Many believed that PrEP alone would be a sufficient HIV risk-reduction strategy. These findings suggest that participants' HIV risk-reduction intentions, if they were to use PrEP, were based predominately on their understanding of the high efficacy of PrEP and their experiences with the limitations of condoms. Enhanced counseling is needed to promote informed decision making and to ensure overall sexual health for women using PrEP for HIV prevention, particularly with respect to the prevention of pregnancy and other sexually transmitted infections when PrEP is used alone.

Hypothetical versus real preferences: results from an opportunistic field experiment. Over recent years there has been renewed interest in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in health care but the 'hypothetical bias' concern (i.e. the belief that WTP values overstate real preferences) is a remaining anxiety. This paper reports new empirical data comparing hypothetical and real preferences in a health care context, using the clinical setting of patient self-management (PSM) of anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy. The data offer considerable support for the use of WTP and CBAs in a self-management health care context; the hypothetical bias hypothesis is not supported by our data. The generalisability of these results to other health care settings needs to be explored.

Jejunal granuloma associated with an argyrophilic gram-negative non-segmented filamentous bacterium in a Holstein cow. A length of intussuscepted jejunum, associated with a granuloma, was removed surgically from a 35-month-old Holstein cow. Microscopically, the granuloma consisted of multifocal aggregates of macrophages, epithelioid cells and occasional multinucleated giant cells within the lamina propria. Numerous argyrophilic, gram-negative, periodic acid Schiff-negative, non-segmented, long filamentous bacteria (2-17 microm in length, 0.1-0.3 microm in diameter) were detected in the cytoplasm of the epithelioid cells. The bacteria were localized to the granulomatous lesions. Comparative 16S rDNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that the organism was an unpublished species (accession number AB472332). This argyrophilic non-segmented filamentous bacterium appears to have been the cause of multifocal granulomatous jejunitis accompanied by intestinal intussusception in this cow.

Metabolic and testicular effects of the long-term administration of different high-fat diets in adult rats. To evaluate the effects of different high-fat diets on body mass, carbohydrate metabolism and testicular morphology in rats seven months old. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: SC (standard chow), HF-S (high fat diet rich in saturated fatty acids), HF-P (high fat diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids), HF-SP (high fat diet rich in saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids). The rats were fed for 16 weeks. Blood samples, testes and genital fat deposits were collected for analysis. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test, considering p<0.05 as statistically significant. Different high-fat diets promoted an increase in the body mass (p<0.0001). The genital fat deposits were higher in the high-fat groups (HF-S, HF-P, HF-SP) (p=0.0004). Regarding serum parameters, the animals in the HF-S and HF-SP groups presented hyperglycemia (p=0.0060), hyperinsulinemia (p=0.0030) and hypercholesterolemia (p=0.0021). All of the hyperlipidemic groups showed hyperleptinemia (p=0.0019). Concerning the testis, the HF-S group showed a reduction on the seminiferous epithelium height (p=0.0003) and cell proliferation (p=0.0450). Seminiferous tubule diameter was lower in the HF-SP than in the SC group (p=0.0010). The high fat diet administration, independent of the lipid quality, promotes overweight. Diet rich in saturated fatty acids (lard) alters the carbohydrate metabolism and the testicular morphology with reductions of seminiferous epithelium height, seminiferous tubule diameter and cell proliferation which could be related to a disturbance of spermatogenesis.

Incidence of palatal fistula after palatoplasty with levator veli palatini retropositioning according to Sommerlad. The purpose of this study was to find out the incidence of palatal fistula and study the factors that influence its development after palatoplasty with repositioning of the levator veli palatini. We retrospectively reviewed 176 consecutive repairs of cleft palates during a 2-year period (2004-2006). The age of the patients at the time of repair ranged from 12 to 30 months (mode 17 months). All the palatoplasties were done either by a senior surgeon or a resident surgeon. The chi square test was used to assess whether the development of postoperative fistulas was influenced by sex, extent of cleft (as estimated by the Veau classification), age at repair, and operating surgeon. There were 12 palatal fistulas (7%), 8 of which were at the junction of the hard and soft palate, 3 in the hard palate, and 1 in the soft palate. There was no evidence to suggest that sex or age were associated with their development. Patients whose clefts had been treated by the senior surgeon had fewer fistulas (2/82, 2%) than those by the resident surgeon (10/94, 11%) (p=0.04). The incidences of palatal fistulas in patients with clefts of the hard and soft cleft palate (7/44, 21%), and bilateral cleft lip or palate (2/21,10%), were significantly higher than those in patients with cleft soft palate (1/37, 3%), and unilateral cleft lip or palate (2/74, 3%) (p=0.03). Our results show that palatal fistula after repair is related mainly to the extent of the cleft and the experience of the operating surgeon.

[Prospects for using hydroxyethyl starch in the complex of intensive care during interhospital transportation of critically ill patients with polytrauma]. The paper analyzes the results of a comparative study of different infusion therapy modalities in victims with polytrauma during transportation to a specialized traumatological center. A combination of crystalloids and dextrans was applied to a control group and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 was used in a study group. The evaluation criteria were the maintenance of stable hemodynamic parameters during transportation; a negative effect on hemostatic parameters and a preventive effect against the development of multiple organ dysfunction during transportation. Infusion therapy using HES has an advantage by all the parameters estimated.

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage rate and associated risk factors in individuals in the community. The increasing prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains together with their disease impact on hospital patients and individuals in the community has posed a major challenge to healthcare workers. This study examined the prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and possible risk factors in the community. Of 500 studied subjects (aged from 6 to 65 years) in Lebanon, the overall S. aureus nasal carriage rate was 38.4%, the highest (57.1%) being in children aged 6-10 years. Only eight individuals (1.6%) were carriers of MRSA. Risk factors for S. aureus nasal colonization were male gender, young age, contact with healthcare workers, use of needle injections, and having asthma. A significant decrease in colonization rate was associated with nasal wash with water, use of nasal sprays, and the presence of acne. These findings may assist in better understanding of control measures to decrease nasal colonization with S. aureus in Lebanon and elsewhere.

Twenty years of patient satisfaction research applied to the emergency department: a qualitative review. This clinical review article examines the patient satisfaction literature for the past 20 years. This literature is summarized for qualitative themes and general trends. Intended for the practicing clinician, these themes are then applied to the emergency department (ED) milieu. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the ED is the point of entry for more than half of all patients admitted to the hospital in the United States. Indeed, the ED is the "front door" to the hospital. According to Press Ganey, satisfaction with ED care is at an all-time low. A review of the literature revealed 5 major elements of the ED experience that correlate with patient satisfaction: timeliness of care, empathy, technical competence, information dispensation, and pain management. The literature supporting these 5 elements is summarized and applications to the ED setting are suggested. Other minor correlates with patient satisfaction are also presented.


Synthesis of porous acrylonitrile/methyl acrylate copolymer beads by suspended emulsion polymerization and their adsorption properties after amidoximation.

Mechanistic basis of Rho GTPase-induced extracellular matrix synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells. Elevated intraocular pressure arising from impaired aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular pathway is a major risk factor for glaucoma. To understand the molecular basis for Rho GTPase-mediated resistance to aqueous humor drainage, we investigated the possible interrelationship between actomyosin contractile properties and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells expressing a constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoAV14). TM cells expressing RhoAV14 exhibited significant increases in fibronectin, tenascin C, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) levels, and matrix assembly in association with increased actin stress fibers and myosin light-chain phosphorylation. RhoAV14-induced changes in ECM synthesis and actin cytoskeletal reorganization were mimicked by lysophosphatidic acid and TGF-beta(2), known to increase resistance to aqueous humor outflow and activate Rho/Rho kinase signaling. RhoAV14, lysophosphatidic acid, and TGF-beta(2) stimulated significant increases in Erk1/2 phosphorylation, paralleled by profound increases in fibronectin, serum response factor (SRF), and alpha-SMA expression. Treatment of RhoA-activated TM cells with inhibitors of Rho kinase or Erk, on the other hand, decreased fibronectin and alpha-SMA levels. Although suppression of SRF expression (both endogenous and RhoA, TGF-beta(2)-stimulated) via the use of short hairpin RNA decreased alpha-SMA levels, fibronectin was unaffected. Conversely, fibronectin induced alpha-SMA expression in an SRF-dependent manner. Collectively, data on RhoA-induced changes in actomyosin contractile activity, ECM synthesis/assembly, and Erk activation, along with fibronectin-induced alpha-SMA expression in TM cells, reveal a potential molecular interplay between actomyosin cytoskeletal tension and ECM synthesis/assembly. This interaction could be significant for the homeostasis of aqueous humor drainage through the pressure-sensitive trabecular pathway.

Helicobacter pylori Infection in Rural and Urban Dyspeptic Patients from Venezuela. The goal of this work was to assess the Helicobacter pylori prevalence in a rural mestizo population and compare it to an urban population from Venezuela. The study was performed in gastric juice samples of 71 dyspeptic patients from Caracas (urban) and 39 from Tucupita (rural), in the Orinoco Delta region. Helicobacter pylori was detected by amplification of 16S rRNA, glmM, and ureA genes in 55.0% patients from urban and 87.2% from rural populations. cagA was found positive in 51% and 62% urban and rural patients, respectively. Non-H. pylori Helicobacter species were not detected in the urban population, but was found in 7.7% of patients in the rural study site. Frequency values of the 16S rRNA, glmM, and ureA genes were higher in the rural population. The odds ratio for each gene was 15.18 for 16S rRNA, 2.34 for glmM, 2.89 for ureA, and 1.53 cagA, showing significant differences except for cagA when gene frequency was compared in both populations. These results demonstrate a higher frequency of H. pylori and gastric non-H. pylori Helicobacter infection in a rural mestizo population with low hygienic standards as compared with city dwellers, representing a potential risk for the development of gastroduodenal diseases. 

Temporal compounding of cardiac ultrasound data: Improving image quality and clinical measurement repeatability. Echocardiography provides a powerful and versatile tool for assessing cardiac morphology and function. However, cardiac ultrasound suffers from speckle as well as static and dynamic noise. Over the last three decades, a number of studies have attempted to address the challenging problem of speckle/noise suppression in cardiac ultrasound data. No single method has managed to provide a widely accepted solution. Temporal Compounding is a noise suppression method that utilises spatial averaging of temporally aligned cardiac B-Mode data. Reliable temporal alignment is vital for effective Temporal Compounding. In this study we introduce a novel, accurate and robust technique for the temporal alignment of cardiac cycles with variable temporal characteristics and examine the effect of Temporal Compounding in four clinical measurements performed on routine echocardiographic examinations. Results from 32 patients demonstrate speckle/noise suppression, shadowing reduction, anatomical structure enhancement and improvement in measurement repeatability with no significant or systematic bias introduced. Temporally compound data may be able to provide a good alternative to B-Mode data in clinical measurements as well as a first step to further post-processing of cardiac ultrasound data.


Do adolescents who are night owls have a higher risk of dental caries? - a case-control study.

Administration of caffeic acid worsened bone mechanical properties in female rats. Natural phenolic acids, commonly present in plants that are normally consumed in the diet, have been reported to exert antiresorptive and/or bone formation increasing activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ferulic, caffeic, P-coumaric, and chlorogenic acids on the skeletal system of normal, mature female rats. The phenolic acids (10 mg/kg p. o. daily for 4 weeks) were administered to 3-month-old female Wistar Cmd:(WI)WU rats. Bone mass, mineral and calcium content, macrometric and histomorphometric parameters, and mechanical properties were examined. Phenolic acids had differential effects on the rat skeletal system. Although none of them affected bone macrometric parameters, mass and mineralization, all of them increased the width of femoral trabeculae. Administration of caffeic acid worsened bone mechanical properties (decreasing ultimate load sustained by the femur in three-point bending test). In conclusion, high intake of caffeic acid may unfavorably affect the skeletal system.

Photophysical properties of a new DyLight 594 dye. We describe spectral properties of novel fluorescence probe DyLight 594. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of this dye are in the region of Alexa 594 fluor spectra. The quantum yield of DyLight 594 in conjugated form to IgG is higher than corresponding quantum yield of Alexa 594 by about 50%. The new DyLight dye also shows slightly longer lifetime and photostability. These favorable properties and high anisotropy value, as well as a high cross-section for two-photon excitation, make this fluorophore attractive as a fluorescence probe in biochemical/biological studies involving fluorescence methods.

Profile of children with new-born brachial plexus palsy managed in a tertiary hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria. New-born Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP) is birth injury resulting from traction to the brachial plexus at birth. It is an injury to two or more cervical or thoracic nerve roots. It has been reported to be one of the most common birth injuries of the new-born. Persistent presentation of children with NBPP in Nigeria paediatric practice necessitates the need to examine prevalence, patterns and possible predisposing factors. This study therefore investigated retrospectively, profiles of children who presented with NBPP over a ten year period and were managed at the Physiotherapy department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan Nigeria. A retrospective cross-sectional survey, in which files of children with NBPP located from the database of the Physiotherapy department were retrieved in order to assess infant and maternal information. One hundred and seventy children, 93 (54.7%) males and 77 (45.3%) females were studied. Their mean birth weight was 4.21±0.54 kg, 99 (58.2%) were delivered in private (non-government) hospitals, majority 163 (95.9%) presented with Erb's Palsy. Mothers, 54 (31.8%) were mostly primiparous and a seemingly persistent elevation in two-yearly incidence of NBPP was observed. Improved healthcare policy in child delivery is encouraged in non-government hospitals in Nigeria to provide preventive measures toward incidence of NBPP. Documentation of physiotherapy management of children with NBPP should include outcomes from admission through to discharge. 

Palmitate attenuates insulin signaling and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons: rescue of resistance and apoptosis through adenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation. Hypothalamic insulin signaling is essential to the maintenance of glucose and energy homeostasis. During pathological states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin signaling is impaired. One key mechanism involved in the development of insulin resistance is lipotoxicity, through increased circulating saturated fatty acids. Although many studies have begun to determine the underlying mechanisms of lipotoxicity in peripheral tissues, little is known about the effects of excess lipids in the brain. We used a hypothalamic, neuronal cell model, mHypoE-44, to understand how the highly prevalent nonesterified fatty acid, palmitate, affects neuronal insulin signaling. Through Western blot analysis, we discerned that prolonged exposure to palmitate impairs insulin activation, as assessed by phosphorylation of Akt. We investigated the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is known to promote cellular insulin resistance and apoptosis in peripheral tissues. Palmitate treatment induced ER stress through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent pathway because a selective JNK inhibitor blocked palmitate activation of the ER stress pathways eIF2 alpha and X-box binding protein-1. Interestingly, JNK inhibition did not prevent the palmitate-mediated cleaved caspase-3 increase, an apoptotic marker, or insulin signaling attenuation. However, pretreatment with the AMP kinase activator, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide, blocked JNK phosphorylation and importantly prevented caspase-3 cleavage and restored insulin signaling during short-term exposure to palmitate. Thus, activation of AMP kinase prevents the deleterious effects of palmitate on hypothalamic neurons by inhibiting the onset of insulin resistance and apoptosis.

[Structural-biological characteristics of tubulin interaction with dinitroanilines]. The interaction of dinitroaniline compounds with tubulin molecules is characterized by extraordinary selectivity--these matters effectively associate with plant as well as protozoan tubulin and practically don't interact with fungal and animal tubulin in spite of extraordinarily high level of similarity of their sequences. Structural features and mechanisms of this interaction are generalized and in detail analysed in this research. In particular, the regularities of dinitroaniline binding sites' structure and localization on surfaces of tubulin different subunits and tubulins of different origin are characterized. Dinitroaniline binding sites are disposed on the surfaces of longitudinal contacts between tubulin subunits, contain residues of diamine amino acids (lysine or arginine) coupling al nitrile group (s) of dinitroanilines. Binding site location on the surfaces of the same subunit of different origin (for example, plant and protozoan alpha-tubulins) is coincided, however site localisation on surface of alpha- and beta-subunits is distinct. The described sites potentially can be the binding areas for another antimicrotubular compounds, in particular, cyanoacrilates.


Decline and compensation in aging brain and cognition: promises and constraints. Preface.

Vaccines using dendritic cells, differentiated with propofol, enhance antitumor immunity in mice. Dendritic cell-based vaccines are useful for enhancing antitumor immunity. It has been suggested that propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, can enhance antitumor immunity in mice. We tested vaccine efficacy for eliciting antitumor immunity, using dendritic cells differentiated from bone marrow cells in the presence of propofol. Propofol-differentiated (but not control vehicle-differentiated) dendritic cells significantly delayed the growth of B16 melanoma in vivo. In vitro cytotoxic T cell activity was not affected by propofol. However, natural killer cell activity in mice vaccinated with dendritic cells differentiated in propofol was significantly upregulated, compared to unvaccinated mice.

Detection of cardiac activity using a 5.8 GHz radio frequency sensor. A 5.8-GHz ISM-Band radio-frequency sensor has been developed for non-contact measurement of respiration and heart rate from stationary and semi-stationary subjects at a distance of 0.5 to 1.5 meters. We report on the accuracy of the heart rate measurements obtained using two algorithmic approaches, as compared to a reference heart rate obtained using a pulse oximeter. Simultaneous Photoplethysmograph (PPG) and non-contact sensor recordings were recorded over fifteen minute periods for ten healthy subjects (8M/2F, ages 29.6 + or - 5.6 yrs) One algorithm is based on automated detection of individual peaks associated with each cardiac cycle; a second algorithm extracts a heart rate over a 60-second period using spectral analysis. Peaks were also extracted manually for comparison with the automated method. The peak-detection methods were less accurate than the spectral methods, but suggest the possibility of acquiring beat by beat data; the spectral algorithms measured heart rate to within + or -10% for the ten subjects chosen. Non-contact measurement of heart rate will be useful in chronic disease monitoring for conditions such as heart failure and cardiovascular disease.

Ischemic tolerance: the mechanisms of neuroprotective strategy. The phenomenon of ischemic tolerance perfectly describes this quote "What does not kill you makes you stronger." Ischemic pre- or postconditioning is actually the strongest known procedure to prevent or reverse neurodegeneration. It works specifically in sensitive vulnerable neuronal populations, which are represented by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, tolerance is effective in other brain cell populations as well. Although, its nomenclature is "ischemic" tolerance, the tolerant phenotype can also be induced by other stimuli that lead to delayed neuronal death (intoxication). Moreover, the recent data have proven that this phenomenon is not limited to application of sublethal stimuli before the lethal stress but reversed arrangement of events, sublethal stress after lethal insult, is rather equally effective. A very important term is called "cross conditioning." Cross conditioning is the capability of one stressor to induce tolerance against another. So, since pre- or post-conditioners can be used plenty of harmful stimuli, hypo- or hyperthermia and some physiological compounds, such as norepinephrine, bradykinin. Delayed neuronal death is the slow development of postischemic neurodegeneration. This allows an opportunity for a great therapeutic window of 2-3 days to reverse the cellular death process. Moreover, it seems that the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance-delayed postconditioning could be used not only after ischemia but also in some other processes leading to apoptosis.

Effects of altered transport paths and intermediate movement goals on human grasp kinematics. It has been observed that grip opening is delayed when participants are asked to execute complex grasping movements, such as passing over an obstacle or a via-position (Haggard and Wing 1998; Alberts et al. 2002). This finding was proposed to indicate a shift toward sequential performance, meaning that complex movements are carried out in independent motor steps. In our experiments we investigated which aspects of a grasping task determine whether a movement is executed holistically or sequentially. Therefore, participants had to perform different types of curved movements in order to reach and grasp a target object. When only the complexity of the transport paths was varied, no indication of sequential movement execution was found. However, when participants additionally had to either stop at, or pass over a certain via-position the pre-shaping pattern changed considerably indicating a movement segmentation effect. This effect became stronger with increasing difficulty of the sub-task, suggesting that attentional factors are involved.

A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion. From a terror management theory (TMT) perspective, religion serves to manage the potential terror engendered by the uniquely human awareness of death by affording a sense of psychological security and hope of immortality. Although secular beliefs can also serve a terror management function, religious beliefs are particularly well suited to mitigate death anxiety because they are all encompassing, rely on concepts that are not easily disconfirmed, and promise literal immortality. Research is reviewed demonstrating that mortality salience produces increased belief in afterlife, supernatural agency, human ascension from nature, and spiritual distinctions between mind and body. The social costs and benefits of religious beliefs are considered and compared to those of secular worldviews. The terror management functions of, and benefits and costs associated with, different types of religious orientation, such as intrinsic religiosity, quest, and religious fundamentalism, are then examined. Finally, the TMT analysis is compared to other accounts of religion.


Radical scavenging reactivity of catecholamine neurotransmitters and the inhibition effect for DNA cleavage.

Bactofilins, a ubiquitous class of cytoskeletal proteins mediating polar localization of a cell wall synthase in Caulobacter crescentus. The cytoskeleton has a key function in the temporal and spatial organization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the identification of a new class of polymer-forming proteins, termed bactofilins, that are widely conserved among bacteria. In Caulobacter crescentus, two bactofilin paralogues cooperate to form a sheet-like structure lining the cytoplasmic membrane in proximity of the stalked cell pole. These assemblies mediate polar localization of a peptidoglycan synthase involved in stalk morphogenesis, thus complementing the function of the actin-like cytoskeleton and the cell division machinery in the regulation of cell wall biogenesis. In other bacteria, bactofilins can establish rod-shaped filaments or associate with the cell division apparatus, indicating considerable structural and functional flexibility. Bactofilins polymerize spontaneously in the absence of additional cofactors in vitro, forming stable ribbon- or rod-like filament bundles. Our results suggest that these structures have evolved as an alternative to intermediate filaments, serving as versatile molecular scaffolds in a variety of cellular pathways.

[Fluorescence analysis of trace glucose using glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase]. In acetate buffer solution and in the presence of glucose oxidase (GOD), glucose reduced the dissolved oxygen to form H2O2 that oxidized catalytically the excess KI to from I3- by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The I3- combines respectively with rhodamine S (RhS), rhodamine 6G(Rh6G), butyl-rhodamine B(b-RhB) and rhodamine B(RhB) to form RhS-I3, Rh6G-I3, b-RhB-I3 and RhB-I3 associated particles that result in fluorescence quenching at 556, 556, 584 and 584 nm, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the concentration of glucose in the range of 0.083-9.99, 0.17-8.33, 0.33-8.33 and 0.33-9.99 micromol x L(-1) is linear with their fluorescence quenching at 556, 556, 584 and 584 nm, with detection limits of 0.059, 0.17, 0.21 and 0.16 micromol x L(-1) glucose. And the regression equation was deltaF = 40.0c + 3.0, deltaF = 23.9c + 8.1, deltaF = 25.6c + 4.2, and deltaAF = 18.4c + 0.8, respectively. The RhS system was the most sensitive and stable, and was chosen for use. Influence of some foreign substances on the RhS fluorescence quenching determination of 6.67 micromol x L(-1) glucose was examined, with a relative error of +/- 10%. Results showed that 1000-fold Mg2+ and Cu2+, 300-fold Mn2+, 100-fold Zn2+, Al3+ and Co2+, 60-fold L-tyrosine, urea and nicotinic acid, 50-fold Fe3+, HSA and BSA, 10-fold sucrose, vitamin B2, L-lysine, L-glutamic acid and L-cystine did not interfere with the determination. This RhS fluorescence quenching assay was applied to the determination of glucose in the serum samples with satisfactory results.

Modeling the temperature dependence of thermophysical properties: Study on the effect of temperature dependence for RFA. Radio frequency ablation (RFA) has increasingly been used over the past few years and RFA treatment is minimally invasive for patients. However, it is difficult for operators to control the precise formation of coagulation zones due to inadequate imaging modalities. With this in mind, an ablation system using numerical simulation to analyze the temperature distribution of the organ is needed to overcome this deficiency. The objective of our work is to develop a temperature dependent thermophysical liver model. First, an overview is given of the development of the thermophysical liver model. Second, a simulation to evaluate the effect of temperature dependence of the thermophysical properties of the liver is explained. Finally, the result of the simulation, which indicated that the temperature dependence of thermophysical properties accounts for temperature differences influencing the accuracy of RFA treatment is described.

Does the presence of sucrose in pediatric antibiotics influence the enamel mineral loss and the Streptococcus mutans counts in dental biofilm? The role of antibiotics containing sucrose on the formation of dental caries is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effect of two antibiotics (amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate suspension), with and without sucrose, on human dental hardness and Streptococcus mutans counts in dental biofilm. Primary tooth fragments (n=72) were coated with nail varnish leaving a window of 2.25 mm diameter. Specimens were fixed in 24-well polystyrene plates, containing BHI medium. S. mutans (clinical strains) represented the inoculum to form biofilm on the fragments for 24 h. Twelve fragments were separated for the initial count of microorganisms (baseline). The other fragments were divided into 4 groups (n=12) of treatment: G1 (Clavulin(r)), G2 (Betamox(r)), G3 (chlorhexidine 0.12%), G4 (sucrose 10%). All specimens had their self-control area (covered area). The cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) was evaluated for each specimen. All the treated groups had a loss of hardness compared to their self-controls (p<0.05). Both drugs inhibited the S. mutans growth and promoted no CSMH difference among them. Both antibiotics eliminated all formed biofilm and did not cause mineral loss from the enamel, regardless the presence of sucrose in its formulation.

The anorectic and obese adolescent. In view of the menstrual disturbances involved, gynaecologists frequently come into contact with girls suffering from eating disorders that can rapidly evolve into anorexia nervosa. The ability to make a precocious diagnosis of the severity of both physical and psychopathological involvement, to offer clear explanations of the links between reproductive function and energy availability and to motivate psychotherapy can be of paramount importance for the prognosis. Similarly, obese adolescents might require counselling for menstrual disorders or alleged endocrine dysfunction. Knowledge of the markers of metabolic impairment and of the possible therapeutic approaches to essential obesity is a necessary complement to the management of the more usual conditions related to overweight, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Presented here is an overview of recent evidence on the pathogenesis, endocrine profile, short- and long-term health repercussions, therapeutic strategies and clinical trials regarding these two opposing pathologies, both related to unhealthy eating behaviour and also to psycho-relational problems.

Fibrinogen Yecheon: congenital dysfibrinogenemia with gamma methionine-310 to threonine substitution. This case study reports a rare fibrinogen variant, gamma Met310Thr mutation, for the first time in Korea. The case shows a point mutation from T to C in the 1,007th nucleotide of the FGG gene. This report describes a variant fibrinogen, hereinafter called "fibrinogen Yecheon", using the name after the town where the patient was living at the time of diagnosis. Fibrinogen Yecheon has a de novo heterozygous point mutation of FGG resulting in gamma Met310Thr and subsequent extra N-glycosylation at gamma Asn308. Extra N-glycosylated fibrinogen is considered a main inhibitor of normal fibrinogen activity.

Iodine-125-fibrinogen kinetics in the rabbit arterial wall. Elevated fibrinogen has been claimed as an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Incorporation of fibrinogen into human atherosclerotic lesions has been demonstrated. We assessed in a rabbit model of experimental atherosclerosis, biodistribution as well as kinetics and vascular uptake of (125)I-fibrinogen. Rabbits aged 6 months were fed a 1% cholesterol supplemented diet. After experimental de-endothelialization of rabbit aorta using a Fogarthy catheter, (125)I-fibrinogen uptake was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude as compared to intact segments covered by endothelium. Six rabbits per group were examined. Even re-endothelialized segments showed a significantly higher uptake of the radiolabeled protein. Maximum arterial uptake varied between 12 (de- and re-endothelialized segments) and 24h (intact areas) after injection of (125)I-fibrinogen. In conclusion, these experiments for the first time suggest the increased uptake of radiolabeled fibrinogen in the aortic de-endothelized wall in rabbits.

[Mechanisms of nongenomic effect of 17beta-estradiol on human spermatozoa]. To study the mechanisms of nongenomic effect of 17beta-estradiol on human spermatozoa. The intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in the spermatozoa was measured by flow cytometry after the spermatozoa was treated with the inhibitors of trans-membrane signaling transduction pathways and impermeable 17beta-estradiol (E2-BSA). Western blot was used to detect the activation of the signal proteins after the spermatozoa was treated with 1 x 10(-6) mol/L E2-BSA and tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor inhibitor. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ22536, phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 and protein tyrosine kinase (TPK) inhibitor Genistein all deterred the increase of [Ca2+]i caused by E2-BSA. E2-BSA also increased the PLC protein and PKC protein significantly. Tamoxifen, an antagonist of estrogen receptor, did not inhibit the activation of PLC caused by E2-BSA. The E2-BSA has an effect on human spermatozoa in a nongenomic pathway, possibly through the transmembrane signal transduction in relation to AC, PLC and TPK.

Toward a sustainable biomedical research enterprise: Finding consensus and implementing recommendations. The US research enterprise is under significant strain due to stagnant funding, an expanding workforce, and complex regulations that increase costs and slow the pace of research. In response, a number of groups have analyzed the problems and offered recommendations for resolving these issues. However, many of these recommendations lacked follow-up implementation, allowing the damage of stagnant funding and outdated policies to persist. Here, we analyze nine reports published since the beginning of 2012 and consolidate over 250 suggestions into eight consensus recommendations made by the majority of the reports. We then propose how to implement these consensus recommendations, and we identify critical issues, such as improving workforce diversity and stakeholder interactions, on which the community has yet to achieve consensus. 

Analysis of revision procedures for failed unicondylar knee replacement. Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is argued to be a conservative procedure which permits a later total knee arthroplasty (TKA) should it be required. The aims of the study were to assess the modes of early failure of UKA and see whether the conversion to TKA improved the functional scores, range of motion, pain and patient satisfaction. Fourteen revision procedures performed after failed unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) were evaluated. Patient demographics, modes of failure and technical issues relating to revision were noted. Post-operative functional outcome was assessed using WOMAC osteoarthritis index and SF-36 scores. Thirteen percent of primary UKA performed were revised to TKA. Eighty-six percent of the revisions were required within the first 12 months. Revision procedure was complex in nearly half of the cases. There was no significant improvement in post-operative functional scores. Results of conversion of UKA to TKA are less satisfactory than primary TKA.

[Adhesive properties of Pragia fontium lipopolysaccharides]. Effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and their structure components (lipid A, oligosaccharide core, and O-specific polysaccharides) from 8 strains of P. fontium on the adhesion process have been investigated for the first time. It was demonstrated, that LPS and their structural components may compete with E. coli adhesins and phytohemagglutinin under binding with receptors on the surface of the rabbit erythrocytes. An analysis of different structural components influence indicated, that in comparison with O-specific polysaccharides and core oligosaccharide lipids A of all investigated strains of P. fontium displayed the highest inhibitory action on the adhesion process. It was shown that there existed certain dependence between LPS composition and their effects on the adhesion process. LPS, obtained from P. fontium strains grown at different temperatures (36, 25, 4 degrees C) and characterized by various quantitative and qualitative monosaccharide and fatty acid composition, demonstrated different adhesion properties.

Exogenous NAD blocks cardiac hypertrophic response via activation of the SIRT3-LKB1-AMP-activated kinase pathway. Since the discovery of NAD-dependent deacetylases, sirtuins, it has been recognized that maintaining intracellular levels of NAD is crucial for the management of stress response of cells. Here we show that agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with loss of intracellular levels of NAD, but not exercise-induced physiologic hypertrophy. Exogenous addition of NAD was capable of maintaining intracellular levels of NAD and blocking the agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophic response in vitro as well as in vivo. NAD treatment blocked the activation of pro-hypertrophic Akt1 signaling, and augmented the activity of anti-hypertrophic LKB1-AMPK signaling in the heart, which prevented subsequent induction of mTOR-mediated protein synthesis. By using gene knock-out and transgenic mouse models of SIRT3 and SIRT1, we showed that the anti-hypertrophic effects of exogenous NAD are mediated through activation of SIRT3, but not SIRT1. SIRT3 deacetylates and activates LKB1, thus augmenting the activity of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. These results reveal a novel role of NAD as an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophic signaling, and suggest that prevention of NAD depletion may be critical in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Prevalence of double pituitary adenomas in a surgical series: Clinical, histological and genetic features. The term double pituitary adenomas (DPA) is usually referred to those rare lesions showing two distinct cellular components. Genetic background may sustain the proliferation of more than one cell at the same time but no information is available on the presence of aip mutations in these patients. We report the prevalence and the endocrinological, neuroradiological, histopathological and genetic features of DPA detected in a large surgical series. The contribution of pituitary transcription factor immunostains in DPA was also evaluated. One-hundred-forty-four patients undergoing surgery for tumors of the sellar region were evaluated. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry and the mutational analysis for the entire coding region of the AIP and MEN1 genes were performed. One-hundred-seventeen patients out of 144 had a pituitary adenoma. DPA was found in 3 (2.6%) out of 117 patients with pituitary adenoma. Immunohistochemistry and transcription factors analysis demonstrated two not yet described histotype associations in DPA. The coexistence of somatotroph-lactotroph and silent mammosomatotroph histotype in 1 case and the coexistence of sparsely granulated lactotroph and null cell adenomas in the remaining two cases were first identified. Sequencing data for the coding region of the aip and the menin gene resulted in wild type sequences in all patients with DPA. The prevalence of DPA observed in our unselected surgical series is not negligible (2.6%). Furthermore, the evaluation of the treatment outcome would suggest that the clinical management of DPAs requires a careful diagnostic approach and follow- up.

Treatment of retrocaval ureter by pure laparoscopic pyelopyelostomy: experience on 4 patients.

Detecting electroporation by assessing the time constants in the exponential response of human skin to voltage controlled impulse electrical stimulation. We propose a new method for extracting the electrical properties of human skin based on the time constant analysis of its exponential response to impulse stimulation. As a result of this analysis an adjacent finding has arisen. We have found that stratum corneum electroporation can be detected using this analysis method. We have observed that a one time-constant model is appropriate for describing the electrical properties of human skin at low amplitude applied voltages (<30V), and a two time-constant model best describes skin electrical properties at higher amplitude applied voltages (>30V). Higher voltage amplitudes (>30V) have been proven to create pores in the skin's stratum corneum which offer a new, lower resistance, pathway for the passage of current through the skin. Our data shows that when pores are formed in the stratum corneum they can be detected, in-vivo, due to the fact that a second time constant describes current flow through them.


Risk factors related to omphalocele and gastroschisis.

Administration of copper oxide wire particles in a capsule or feed for gastrointestinal nematode control in goats. Widespread anthelmintic resistance in small ruminants has necessitated alternative means of gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) control. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of copper oxide wire particles (COWP) administered as a gelatin capsule or in a feed supplement to control GIN in goats. In four separate experiments, peri-parturient does (n=36), yearling does (n=25), weaned kids (n=72), and yearling bucks (n=16) were randomly assigned to remain untreated or administered 2g COWP in a capsule (in Experiments 1, 2, and 3) or feed supplement (all experiments). Feces and blood were collected every 7 days between Days 0 and 21 (older goats) or Day 42 (kids) for fecal egg counts (FEC) and blood packed cell volume (PCV) analyses. A peri-parturient rise in FEC was evident in the untreated does, but not the COWP-treated does (COWP x date, P<0.02). In yearling does, FEC of the COWP-treated does tended to be lower than the untreated (COWP, P<0.02). FEC of COWP-treated kids were reduced compared with untreated kids (COWP x date, P<0.001). FEC of treated and untreated bucks were similar, but Haemonchus contortus was not the predominant nematode in these goats. However, total worms were reduced in COWP-fed bucks (P<0.03). In summary, it appeared that COWP in the feed was as effective as COWP in a gelatin capsule to reduce FEC in goats. COWP administration may have a limited effect where H. contortus is not the predominant nematode.

Anti-CD3 antibody decreases inflammation and improves outcome in a murine model of Pneumocystis pneumonia. The T cell-mediated immune response elicited by Pneumocystis plays a key role in pulmonary damage and dysfunction during Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PcP). Mice depleted of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells prior to infection are markedly protected from PcP-related respiratory deficit and death, despite progressive lung infection. However, the therapeutic effectiveness of Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function in mice already displaying clinical symptoms of disease has not been determined. Therefore, a murine model of PcP-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was used to assess whether Ab to the pan-T cell molecule CD3 is effective for reducing the severity of PcP when administered after the onset of disease. Mice that received anti-CD3 Ab exhibited a rapid and dramatic halt in the PcP-associated pulmonary function decline within 1 week after treatment, and a striking enhancement of survival rate compared with mice receiving the control Ab. Physiologic improvement in anti-CD3 treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells recovered in lung lavage fluid. This effectiveness of anti-CD3 was noted whether the mice also received antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These data suggest that monoclonal Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function may represent a specific and effective adjunctive therapy to rapidly reverse the ongoing pathologic immune response occurring during active PcP. Thus, the anti-human CD3 monoclonal Ab OKT3, which is already in clinical use, has the potential to be developed as an adjunctive therapy for PcP.

VNTR typing of Mycobacterium leprae in South Indian leprosy patients. To study the suitability, stability and diversity of short tandem repeat (STR) genomic markers to elicit strain variation in the Mycobacterium leprae isolates within leprosy patients from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states in South India. Slit skin smear (SSS) samples were collected from lesions and various body sites of newly diagnosed leprosy patients. The SSSs from each patient were pooled, except in the case of five patients. Total DNA was extracted from SSS samples. M. leprae STRs were amplified from the DNA either by multiplex PCR (MP) or single PCR methods. The number of repeats for each STR locus (the STR allele) was obtained either by fragment length analysis (FLA) or by DNA sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Multiplex PCR minimised the use of DNA and reagents, and together with FLA, was time and cost effective for STR strain typing. After examination of the isolates of South Indian origin at 13 STR loci, it was determined that the alleles for (AC)8b, (GGT)5, 6-3a (rpoT), 21-3, 27-5, and 23-3 were conserved in two study populations. In a family from Andhra Pradesh, the M. leprae STR patterns in two patients were identical in 16 of 18 loci which indicate a common source of infection. Fourteen of 15 STR loci showed no intra-patient variation in the five patients tested in Tamil Nadu. Altogether, these studies indicate the suitability of STR strain typing for assessing short-range transmission chains.

[Studies on the chemical constituents of the fruit of Xylocarpus granatum]. To study the chemical constituents of the fruit of Xylocarpus granatum. The chemical constituents were isolated by chromatographic methods and their structures were elucidated by NMR spectra and physicochemical properties. Ten compounds were isolated from the fruit of Xylocarpus granatum and the structures of them were identified as spicatin (1), xyloccensin K(2), 6-acetoxycedrodorin (3), aurantiamide acetate (4), (+)-catechin (5), alpha-tocopherol (6), abscisic acid (7), daucosterol (8), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (9) and ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (10). Compound 4 -10 are isolated from this plant for the first time.


Cancer survival in England and the influence of early diagnosis: what can we learn from recent EUROCARE results?

Multiple primary cilia modulate the fluid transcytosis in choroid plexus epithelium. Functional defects in cilia are associated with various human diseases including congenital hydrocephalus. Previous studies suggested that defects in cilia not only disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generated by motile cilia in ependyma lining the brain ventricles, but also cause increased CSF production at the choroid plexus. However, the molecular mechanisms of CSF overproduction by ciliary dysfunction remain elusive. To dissect the molecular mechanisms, choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) were isolated from porcine brain. These cells expressed clusters of primary cilia on the apical surface. Deciliation of CPECs elevated the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and stimulated basolateral-to-apical fluid transcytosis, without detrimental effects on other morphological and physiological features. The primary cilia possessed neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor 2. In deciliated cells, the responsiveness to NPFF was reduced at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, CPECs expressed NPFF precursor along with NPFFR2. An NPFFR antagonist, BIBP3226, increased the fluid transcytosis, suggesting the presence of autocrine NPFF signaling in CPECs for a tonic inhibition of fluid transcytosis. These results suggest that the clusters of primary cilia in CPECs act as a sensitive chemosensor to regulate CSF production.

Wound healing of nasal mucosa in a rat. Postoperative wound healing of the nasal mucosa is a highly organized process. However, this process still has not been fully understood. The present study aimed to establish a wound healing model in a rat and describe histomorphological changes of the nasal mucosa after mechanical injury. Unilateral wound in the nasal cavity was induced using the brushing technique in 4-week-old, Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental rats were divided into five groups (n = 7 for each group). Animals were killed 1 hour and 2, 5, 14, and 28 days after injury. The histological sections were examined for inflammatory cell infiltration, goblet, and ciliated cell formation in hematoxylin and eosin staining. The subepithelial and epithelial thicknesses were measured and expressed as the subepithelial thickness index (STI) and epithelial thickness index (ETI). Fibrosis was evaluated by subepithelial fibrosis index (SFI) in Masson's trichrome-stained sections. Respiratory epithelial discontinuity and hemorrhage were observed 1 hour after injury. On day 2, edematous subepithelium and infiltration of neutrophils could be found on the injured site. Day 5 was characterized by the infiltration of monocytes and granulation tissue. SFI and ETI values increased significantly at day 14. Goblet cells and ciliated cells began to regenerate from day 14 and restored to near normal at day 28. Using mechanical injury, the wound healing model of the nasal mucosa was established in a rat. The regeneration of respiratory mucosa was completed on day 28 after injury.

Polymorphic competence peptides do not restrict recombination in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Understanding the factors that limit recombination in bacteria is critical in order to better understand and assess its effects on genetic variation and bacterial population genetic structure. Transformation in the naturally competent bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is regulated by a polymorphic competence (com) apparatus. It has been suggested that polymorphic types, called pherotypes, generate and maintain subpopulation genetic structure within this species. We test predictions stemming from this hypothesis using a cosmopolitan sample of clinical pneumococcal isolates. We sequenced the locus encoding the peptide that induces competence (comC) to assign clones to each known pherotype class and then used multilocus sequence typing to determine whether there is significant genetic differentiation between pherotypes subgroups. We find two dominant pherotypes within our sample, and both are maintained at high frequencies (CSP1 74%, CSP2 26%). Our analyses fail to detect significant genetic differentiation between pherotype groups and find strong evidence, from a coalescent analysis, for interpherotype recombination. In addition, our analyses indicate that positive selection may account for the maintenance of the fixed polymorphism in this locus (comC). Altogether, these results fail to support the prediction that the polymorphism in the competence system acts to limit recombination within S. pneumoniae populations. We discuss why this result is expected given the mechanism underlying transformation and outline a scenario to explain the evolution of polymorphism in the competence system.

Snakebite envenoming from a global perspective: Towards an integrated approach. Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health challenge of compelling importance in many regions of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and Papua-New Guinea. Addressing the problem of snakebite effectively demands an integrated multifocal approach, targeting complex problems and involving many participants. It must comprise: (a) Acquisition of reliable information on the incidence and mortality attributable to snakebite envenoming, and the number of people left with permanent sequelae. (b) Improvements in production of effective and safe antivenoms, through strategies aimed at strengthening the technological capacity of antivenom manufacturing laboratories. (c) Increasing the capacity of low-income countries to produce specific immunogens(snake venoms) locally, and to perform their own quality control of antivenoms. (d) Commitments from regional producers to manufacture antivenoms for countries where antivenom production is not currently feasible. (e) Implementation of financial initiatives guaranteeing the acquisition of adequate volumes of antivenom at affordable prices in low-income countries. (f) Performance of collaborative studies on the safety and effectiveness of antivenoms assessed preclinically and by properly designed clinical trials. (g) Development of antivenom distribution programmes tailored to the real needs and epidemiological situations of rural areas in each country. (h) Permanent training programmes for health staff, particularly in rural areas where snakebites are frequent.(i) Implementation of programmes to support those people whose snakebites resulted in chronic disabilities. (j) Preventive and educational programmes at the community level, with the active involvement of local organizations and employing modern methods of health promotion. Such an integrated approach, currently being fostered by the Global Snake Bite Initiative of the International Society on Toxinology and by the World Health Organization, will help to alleviate the enormous burden of human suffering inflicted by snakebite envenoming.

Surveillance of the Activity of Aminoglycosides and Fluoroquinolones Against Ophthalmic Pathogens from Europe in 2010-2011. Bacterial infections of the ocular surface are commonly treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics. Due to concerns over increasing antibiotic resistance, we evaluated current susceptibility patterns of the ocular bacterial pathogens in Europe. Non-consecutive ocular isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected in 2011 from centers in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Centers were asked to provide similar numbers of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcal isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for fluoroquinolones (besifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin), aminoglycosides (tobramycin, gentamicin, netilmicin), oxacillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Isolates were categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. A total of 741 ocular isolates were obtained. Antibiotic resistance rates depended not only on the antibiotic and species, but also varied greatly by the country of origin. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, erythromycin, and to a lesser extent, chloramphenicol, was a concern for all staphylococci. Multidrug resistance was common among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and MRCoNS and isolates of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and P. aeruginosa were frequently non-susceptible to erythromycin, beta-lactams, and ciprofloxacin/tobramycin, respectively. Resistance rates showed substantial differences among the seven countries tested. Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides showed differences in antibacterial potency and resilience toward the antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were frequently non-susceptible to a multitude of other antibiotics, making MRSA and MRCoNS a potentially significant concern. The broad range of resistance rates observed across Europe in this study confirms the importance of considering current local resistance patterns when antibacterial agents are chosen for empiric management of ocular infections.


Mental and physical quality of life in actual living liver donors versus potential living liver donors: a prospective, controlled, multicenter study.

Evaluation of malaria control programme in three selected districts of Assam, India. To ensure that the activities of Malaria Control Programme were taking place in effective and judicious manner, an intensive monitoring and supervision of various activities of the programme were carried out in Karbi-Anglong, Cachar and Nagaon districts of Assam, India during July-October 2007. Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities. Sixteen villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of three districts were selected for investigations. Results of monitoring of indoor residual spraying (IRS) revealed inadequate spraying coverage. Although recorded to be about 69-99%, but apparently it was 17-43% in the districts investigated. Cross-examination of 180 blood smears (90 positive and negative each) in the laboratories of the study PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the results of 67 blood smears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy was observed in positive blood smears and 30% in negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved in antimalaria activities. However, out of 13 fever treatment depots monitored, one was found partially functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of micro action plan were not followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various important components of the programme like constitution of Village Health Sanitation Committee, information education communication (IEC) activities, capacity building, use of larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised properly. However, 100% community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapid diagnostic test kits yielded poor and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was observed during 2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-Anglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar, however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-04. The results of this investigation revealed that the malaria control programme had been jeopardized seriously due to improper implementation of vector control measures, lack of adequate professional support and varied commitment on the part of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term malaria control strategy should be based on generation of increased awareness on the disease and various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observation also necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active surveillance round the year with prompt detection and treatment facilities in order to control malaria effectively in these districts.


Obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

Preharvest Salmonella Detection for Evaluation of Fresh Ground Poultry Product Contamination. Salmonella is an important economic and public health concern for the poultry industry. Fresh ground product has been linked with multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in humans. Exposure can be controlled by proper handling and preparation by consumers; however, the industry desires to minimize carriage levels in the final product. A substantial obstacle in reducing product contamination stems from limitations in diagnostic methodologies. Detection of Salmonella contamination currently requires extended incubation periods, and by the time test results are available, the fresh product has reached retail shelves. The goal of this study was to develop a preharvest diagnostic protocol for the evaluation of ground product contamination. The turkey processing plant where this research was conducted had previously established Salmonella screening (BAX system) of ground product, thus providing an opportunity for preharvest sample comparison. Drag swabs were collected from live-haul trailers entering the processing plant over a 12-month period. The swabs were added to modified buffered peptone water and incubated at 40°C. After incubation for 6 h or overnight, samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella with the DNAble assay and related to ground turkey samples from corresponding lots. The linear relationship for the percentage of Salmonella-positive live-haul trailers was significant for both the 6-h (slope = 1.02, R(2) = 0.96, and P < 0.0001) and overnight (slope = 0.35, R(2) = 0.93, and P = 0.0015) incubations, with the percentage of Salmonella-positive ground turkey samples. These data indicate that preharvest screening provides a meaningful evaluation of product contamination. Additionally, the 6-h incubation protocol is rapid enough to allow for product mitigation and could potentially aid in the reduction of future salmonellosis outbreaks.

Computed Tomography of Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer. Pancreatic disease often is asymptomatic until tissue damage and complications occur or until malignancies have reached advanced stages and have metastasized. Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography plays a central role in diagnosing, staging, and treatment planning for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. This article introduces the functional anatomy of the pancreas and common bile duct and the epidemiology, pathobiology, and computed tomography imaging of pancreatitis, calculi, and pancreatic cancer. 

Non-adherence to statin therapy: a major challenge for preventive cardiology. Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. In the last twenty years, effective lipid-lowering therapies, particularly statins, have become widely available to prevent and reverse the progression of disease. However, there is a significant gap between expected and actual benefits; this may be attributed to poor adherence to statin therapy. To define the extent, causes (including psychological aspects), consequences and management of non-adherence to statins. Literature using PubMed and Medline up to and including 30 July 2009. Adherence to statin therapy is suboptimal in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Causes vary, and include patient factors (e.g., comorbidities, financial constraints, psychological issues), practitioner factors (e.g., poor knowledge of adherence, time constraints, poor communication skills and patient-doctor working alliance) and system factors (e.g., medication costs, lack of clinical monitoring, drug side effects). Non-adherence is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased costs of healthcare. A framework, based on a multidisciplinary approach, for addressing non-adherence, including managing the statin-intolerant patient, is presented. Non-adherence to statins is a significant issue for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Increased awareness of the causes and solutions for overcoming non-adherence, including safer prescribing, improvement in physician-patient alliance and reduction in drug costs, will enhance the cost-effectiveness of the use of statins and significantly improve patient care and outcomes.

Preventive Effects on Birth Outcomes: Buffering Impact of Maternal Stress, Depression, and Anxiety. Although maternal stress, anxiety, and depression have been linked to negative birth outcomes, few studies have investigated preventive interventions targeting maternal mental health as a means of reducing such problems. This randomized controlled study examines whether Family Foundations (FF)-a transition to parenthood program for couples focused on promoting coparenting quality, with previously documented impact on maternal stress, depression, and anxiety-can buffer the negative effects of maternal mental health problems. To assess the effects of FF, we used a randomized block design with a sample of 259 expectant mothers assigned to FF or a control condition and analyzed using propensity score models. We examine two-way interactions of condition (intervention vs. control) with maternal mental health problems (financial stress, depression, and anxiety) on birth outcomes (birth weight, days in hospital for mothers and infants). For birth weight, we assess whether intervention effects depend on length of gestation by including a third interaction term. FF buffered (p < 0.05) the negative impact of maternal mental health problems on birth weight and both mother and infant length of post-partum hospital stay. For birth weight, assignment to FF was associated with higher birth weight for infants born before term. These results demonstrate that a psycho-educational program for couples focused on enhancing mutual coparental support, with preventive effects on maternal mental health, can reduce incidence of birth problems among women at elevated risk. Such improvements in birth outcomes could translate into substantial reductions in public and personal healthcare costs. Future work should assess mediating mechanisms of intervention impact and cost-benefit ratio of the intervention. The Family Foundations follow-up intervention study is currently registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov . The study identifier is NCT01907412.

Parotidectomies in benign parotid tumours: "Sant Pau" surgical extension classification. At present different options co-exist for treating a benign tumour of the parotid gland, which has led to some confusion about the extent of resection performed in each case. In an effort to improve this situation, we created a classification system to define the areas removed. We started using this classification in July, 2006, and this article reviews its applicability and usefulness. We analyzed 44 patients who underwent surgery for clinically benign tumours of the parotid gland in our department between July, 2006, and December, 2008. In all resections, our classification was applied, dividing the parotid gland into five areas: I (lateral superior), II (lateral inferior), III (deep superior), IV (deep inferior), V (accessory). The classification was easily applied and has presented no practical problem in the 44 patients operated. When analyzing the areas excised in surgery, the most common surgery was lateral inferior partial parotidectomy (removal of area II) in 47% of the cases. Lateral parotidectomy (removal of areas I and II) was the next most frequent, with 14 cases (33%). The remaining 20% was distributed among the other options. Our classification system appears to be a simple and easy way to define the surgery performed in each case, which simplifies the description of the resection performed, even in unusual resections.

[A case of unruptured fusiform aneurysm in a middle cerebral artery branch]. We report a case of a 55-year-old female presenting with headache. Neuroradiological investigations revealed a fusiform aneurysm at the M3 part of the right middle cerebral artery. The aneurysm rapidly developed in the course of one year. She underwent a craniotomy for superficial temporal artery middle cerebral artery bypass (STA-MCA bypass) and resection of the aneurysm. Pathological examination suggested that atherosclerosis was a predisposing factor for aneurysm formation. Although she had developed transient dysarthria and left-hand clumsiness after the operation, she was able to be discharged after 26 days with no neurological deficits. On reviewing the literature, fusiform aneurysms seem to be an important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral infarction of unverified origin. Etiology and treatment of spontaneous fusiform aneurysms in a branch of the middle cerebral artery are also discussed.

Neuron-specific cholinergic modulation of a forebrain song control nucleus. Cholinergic activation profoundly affects vertebrate forebrain networks, but pathway, cell type, and modality specificity remain poorly understood. Here we investigated cell-specific cholinergic modulation of neurons in the zebra finch forebrain song control nucleus HVC using in vitro whole cell recordings. The HVC contains projection neurons that exclusively project to either another song motor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) (HVC-RAn) or the basal ganglia Area X (HVC-Xn) and these populations are synaptically coupled by a network of GABAergic interneurons. Among HVC-RAn, we observed two physiologically distinct classes that fire either phasically or tonically to injected current. Muscarine excited phasic HVC-RAn and most HVC-Xn. Effects were observed under conditions of blockade of fast synaptic transmission and were reversed by atropine. In contrast, unlike what is commonly observed in mammalian systems, HVC interneurons were inhibited by muscarine and these effects were reversed by atropine. Thus cholinergic modulation reconfigures the HVC network in a more complex fashion than that implied by monolithic "gating." The two projection pathways are decoupled through suppression of the inhibitory network that links them, whereas each is simultaneously predominantly excited. We speculate that fluctuating cholinergic tone in HVC could modulate the interaction of song motor commands with basal ganglia circuitry associated with song perception and modification. Furthermore, if the in vitro distinction between RA-projecting neurons that we observed is also present in vivo, then the song system motor pathway exhibits greater physiological diversity than has been commonly assumed.

Use of small interfering ribonucleic acids to inhibit the adipogenic effect of alcohol on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells. This study tested the potential of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) to repress the adipogenic effect of alcohol on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (hBMSCs). hBMSCs were cultured from hip replacement surgery patients (n = 10). PPARγ-siRNA was transiently transfected into hBMSCs cultured in ostogenic media containing 50 mM alcohol by using a liposome-based strategy. Oil red O staining was used to test the development of differentiated adipocytes, and Alizarin red staining was used to test mineral deposition. Marker genes of adipogenesis (PPARγ2 and aP2) and osteogenesis (Osf2/Cbfa1) were examined through real time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin protein synthesis of cultures were also assayed. Data were presented as mean ± SD. Differences between the means of the treatment groups were determined with ANOVA. PPARγ-siRNA transfection resulted in significantly lower adipocyte number, increased matrix mineralisation, repressed adipogenic gene markers, up-regulated osteogenic gene marker and bone matrix protein synthesis in the PPARγ-siRNA group compared to controls (P < 0.05). PPARγ-siRNA is a useful strategy to inhibit the adipogenic effect and the osteogenic repression of alcohol on hBMSCs. This may be a novel therapeutic intervention for osteopenic disorders in alcoholism and other conditions.

The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the sun protection factor in Asian skin. The measurement of the sun protection factor (SPF) is the usual method in the examination of the effectiveness of sunscreen. The declared SPF is based on the use of a sunscreen layer of 2 mg/cm(2). However, only around a quarter (0.5 mg/cm(2)) of this amount is generally used in real life. Theoretical calculations have suggested that the effectiveness of SPF is related to sunscreen quantity in an exponential way but this was not confirmed in Asian skin. This study was performed to investigate the change in SPF values when less than the recommended amount of sunscreen was applied. A board divided into 10 areas measuring 7 x 4 cm was placed on the back of 15 healthy volunteers. Low- and high-SPF standard reference sunscreens, and two types of sunscreen (SPF 30 and 35) were each applied on 4 areas, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/cm(2), respectively, and were left to dry for 20 minutes. The irradiation was conducted at a distance of 50 cm using a template (1 x 1 cm) placed directly on the skin with 10 windows allowing ultraviolet (UV) radiation to pass through with a dose increment of 20%. Erythema was evaluated 20 to 24 hours after exposure to UV radiation. Sunscreen showed its expected SPF value when 2.0 mg/cm(2) was applied. The SPF values of the different amounts were significantly different from each other and decreased when less was applied (P < .05). The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the SPF provided was most likely to follow exponential growth. Spectral differences between our solar simulator and the UV sources of commercial laboratories are likely to be important. In addition, differences in sunscreen application techniques may have influenced the ultimate SPF values. This study concludes that to get the expected SPF value, it is important to apply the UV protective sunscreen precisely in the amount of 2.0 mg/cm(2) on Asian skin as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. In addition, it was difficult to predict the SPF values when the usual amount of 0.5 mg/cm(2) was applied.

[Efficiency of a combined peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavarin therapy in intravenous opiate substances abusers with chronic hepatitis C]. The most important ethiology factor of chronic liver disease that progresses into terminal insufficiency is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Intravenous (iv) drug abuse is the main cause for spreading HCV. Thus the therapy for such patients is of extreme importance in reducing the incidence of the disease. The aim of the study was to establish efficacy of a combined therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in iv opiate substances abusers having chronic HCV infection in relation to sex, age, genotype and level of fibrosis and duration of HCV infection before the treatment. Thirty one iv opiate substances abusers with chronic hepatitis C (HHC) were enrolled in the examination. The patients were divided according to the genotype into two groups. The patients with genotypes 1 and 4 (n = 18) were treated for 48 weeks, while those with genotypes 2 and 3 (n = 13) for 24 weeks. PCR HCV RNA, genotype determination and liver biopsy were done to each patient. A stabile virological response was achieved in 93.5% of the patients, so the therapy demonstrated statistically significant efficacy i. v. opiate substances abusers with HHC (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in therapeutic response among patient groups formed according to the genotype, sex, duration of the disease and level of fibrosis (p > 0.05). Therapy of of iv opiate substances abusers with HHC has its specificities, and these patients need special treatment. Efficacy of the therapy was equivalent in patient groups formed according to the sex, genotype, level of fibrosis and duration of HCV infection. A combined therapy with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin has high level of success in the treatment of these patients.

Cochlear implants: system design, integration, and evaluation. As the most successful neural prosthesis, cochlear implants have provided partial hearing to more than 120000 persons worldwide; half of which being pediatric users who are able to develop nearly normal language. Biomedical engineers have played a central role in the design, integration and evaluation of the cochlear implant system, but the overall success is a result of collaborative work with physiologists, psychologists, physicians, educators, and entrepreneurs. This review presents broad yet in-depth academic and industrial perspectives on the underlying research and ongoing development of cochlear implants. The introduction accounts for major events and advances in cochlear implants, including dynamic interplays among engineers, scientists, physicians, and policy makers. The review takes a system approach to address critical issues in cochlear implant research and development. First, the cochlear implant system design and specifications are laid out. Second, the design goals, principles, and methods of the subsystem components are identified from the external speech processor and radio frequency transmission link to the internal receiver, stimulator and electrode arrays. Third, system integration and functional evaluation are presented with respect to safety, reliability, and challenges facing the present and future cochlear implant designers and users. Finally, issues beyond cochlear implants are discussed to address treatment options for the entire spectrum of hearing impairment as well as to use the cochlear implant as a model to design and evaluate other similar neural prostheses such as vestibular and retinal implants.


Midterm outcomes after meniscal allograft transplantation: comparison of cases with extrusion versus without extrusion.

Proteomics of plasma membranes from poplar trees reveals tissue distribution of transporters, receptors, and proteins in cell wall formation. By exploiting the abundant tissues available from Populus trees, 3-4 m high, we have been able to isolate plasma membranes of high purity from leaves, xylem, and cambium/phloem at a time (4 weeks after bud break) when photosynthesis in the leaves and wood formation in the xylem should have reached a steady state. More than 40% of the 956 proteins identified were found in the plasma membranes of all three tissues and may be classified as "housekeeping" proteins, a typical example being P-type H(+)-ATPases. Among the 213 proteins predicted to be integral membrane proteins, transporters constitute the largest class (41%) followed by receptors (14%) and proteins involved in cell wall and carbohydrate metabolism (8%) and membrane trafficking (8%). ATP-binding cassette transporters (all members of subfamilies B, C, and G) and receptor-like kinases (four subfamilies) were two of the largest protein families found, and the members of these two families showed pronounced tissue distribution. Leaf plasma membranes were characterized by a very high proportion of transporters, constituting almost half of the integral proteins. Proteins involved in cell wall synthesis (such as cellulose and sucrose synthases) and membrane trafficking were most abundant in xylem plasma membranes in agreement with the role of the xylem in wood formation. Twenty-five integral proteins and 83 soluble proteins were exclusively found in xylem plasma membranes, which identifies new candidates associated with cell wall synthesis and wood formation. Among the proteins uniquely found in xylem plasma membranes were most of the enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, which suggests that they may exist as a complex linked to the plasma membrane.

Stress and anxiety in children after the use of computerized dental anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the transitory stress levels and the anxiety state in children submitted to conventional and computerized dental anesthesia. Twenty children (7 to 12 years) were randomly assigned to receive conventional and computerized dental anesthesia. To investigate the hypothesis that transitory stress could be lower after using computerized anesthesia compared to conventional anesthesia, cortisol levels in saliva were measured before and after each technique. Anxiety was also evaluated individually by answering the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). Numerical data were analyzed statistically by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test (5% significance level). Salivary cortisol levels increased in 8 (40%) patients after conventional anesthesia and in 9 (45%) patients after computerized anesthesia, with no statistically significant difference between the two types (p=0.34). In the same way, no statistically significant difference was found between the techniques (p=0.39) related to the psychological analysis based on the STAIC scores. Local anesthesia using either conventional anesthesia or a computerized delivery system produced similar level of stress/anxiety in pediatric patients, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Pathological differences between white and grey matter multiple sclerosis lesions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in widespread formation of white matter lesions (WMLs) and grey matter lesions (GMLs). WMLs are pathologically characterized by the presence of immune cells that infiltrate the CNS, whereas these immune cells are barely present in GMLs. This striking pathological difference between WMLs and GMLs raises questions about the underlying mechanism. It is known that infiltrating leukocytes contribute to the generation of WMLs; however, since GMLs show a paucity of infiltrating immune cells, their importance in GML formation remains to be determined. Here, we review pathological characteristics of WMLs and GMLs, and suggest some possible explanations for the observed pathological differences. In our view, cellular and molecular characteristics of WM and GM, and local differences within WMLs and GMLs (in particular, in glial cell populations and the molecules they express), determine the pathway to demyelination. Further understanding of GML pathogenesis, considered to contribute to chronic MS, may have a direct impact on the development of novel therapeutic targets to counteract this progressive neurological disorder. 

[Influence of titanium dioxide on growth of Azotobacter vinelandii IMV V-7076]. Adding highly dispersed titanium dioxide particles of the culture medium has a stimulatory effect on growth of Azotobacter vinelandii. The maximum effect was observed when using 5 g/l and 10 g/l concentrations of this component. Under these conditions the number of grown bacteria is several times more than in the control variants. It was shown that the stimulatory effect could not be the consequence of saccharose sorption on the surface of particles of the dispersed compound. Possibly, the contact interaction of bacterial cell with titanium dioxide causes an increase of cell wall permeability which leads to an increase of substrates transport to the cell.

Molecular basis of pharmacotherapies for cognition in Down syndrome. Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) ranges from low normal to severely impaired and has a significant impact on the quality-of-life of the individuals affected and their families. Because the incidence of DS remains at approximately 1 in 700 live births and the lifespan is now >50 years, development of pharmacotherapies for cognitive deficits is an important goal. DS is due to an extra copy of human chromosome 21 and has often been considered too complex a genetic abnormality to be amenable to intervention. However, recent successes in rescuing learning/memory impairments in a mouse model of DS suggest that this negative outlook may not be justified. In this contribution, we first review the DS phenotype, chromosome 21 gene content and mouse models. We then discuss recent successes and the remaining challenges in the identification of targets for and preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics.

Identification of the potential target genes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells. Using a microRNA (miRNA) array, we found that PMA induced miR-146a expression in human microvascular endothelial cells. The miR-146a expression was dependent on dose and time and independent of PKC activation. Using a combined approach involving predictions using miRanda algorithm and whole genome microarray experiments with or without inhibition of miR-146a expression by LNA-antimir-146a or LNA-control, 29 potential target genes of miR-146a were identified. Because endothelial cell S phase progression is an early event in the induction of angiogenesis, we evaluated 5 cell cycle-related genes from the 29 target genes and found that the transcripts of 3 genes (CCNA2, PA2G4, and BRCA1) were downregulated after PMA treatment, but their expression was rescued upon miR-146a inhibition. However, inhibition of miR-146a expression failed to alter the cell cycle distribution or angiogenesis induced by PMA treatment. By using a combined approach involving computational prediction and a whole genome microarray experiment in the presence or absence of antimir, the observations in this presented article raise the possibility that antimir strategies might be used to identify the potential miRNA targets.

Alternatives to national average income data as eligibility criteria for international subsidies: a social justice perspective. Current strategies to address global inequities in access to life-saving vaccines use averaged national income data to determine eligibility. While largely successful in the lowest income countries, we argue that this approach could lead to significant inefficiencies from the standpoint of justice if applied to middle-income countries, where income inequalities are large and lead to national averages that obscure truly needy populations. Instead, we suggest alternative indicators more sensitive to social justice concerns that merit consideration by policy-makers developing new initiatives to redress health inequities in middle-income countries.

[As opposed to normal subjects, eyelid position doesn't interfere with postural behavior in blind subjects]. A previous study has shown some behavioral differences in normal subjects depending on the position of the eyelids: the postural behavior was varying if the subject had the eyes open in darkness or the eyes closed. In this study, we explore the possible role of vision on this behavior. The postural behavior of 12 blind and nine visually impaired participants was studied during undisturbed upright stance. In this sample, no difference was found in the conditions eyes open in the dark and eyes closed: the observed behavior in blind and visually impaired subjects is different compared to normal sighted subjects who show a visual preference even in total darkness when the eyes are open. Our two groups (blind and visually impaired) actually show a difference on the median frequency of the centre of gravity displacements. Our results suggest an adaptive mechanism of the central nervous system in healthy individuals to predominantly weigh visual cues when the eyelids remain open. Good visual acuity and time seem to be necessary for this process.

A threshold photoelectron-photoion coincidence spectrometer with double velocity imaging using synchrotron radiation. A novel threshold photoelectron-photoion coincidence (TPEPICO) imaging spectrometer at the U14-A beamline of the Hefei National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory is presented. A set of open electron and ion lenses are utilized to map velocity imaging of photoelectrons and photoions simultaneously, in which a repelling electric field using an extra lens is applied to magnify images of photoelectrons instead of traditional accelerating electric field in order to suppress the contribution of energetic electrons in the threshold photoelectron spectroscopy (TPES) and the mass-selected TPEPICO spectroscopy. The typical energy resolution of TPES is measured to be 9 meV (full width at half maximum), as shown on the (2)P(1/2) ionization of argon. The measured mass resolving power for the present TPEPICO imaging spectrometer is above 900 of M/DeltaM. Subsequently as a benchmark, oxygen molecule is photoionized by monochromatic synchrotron radiation at 20.298 eV and dissociates to an oxygen atomic ion and a neutral oxygen atom, and the translation energy distribution of oxygen atomic ion is measured by the time-sliced imaging based on mass-selected TPEPICO experiment. The kinetic energy resolution of the present ion velocity imaging is better than 3% of DeltaE/E.

Compartmental analysis and its manifold applications to pharmacokinetics. In this paper, I show how the concept of compartment evolved from the simple dilution of a substance in a physiological volume to its distribution in a network of interconnected spaces. The differential equations describing the fate of a substance in a living being can be solved, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the help of a number of mathematical techniques. A number of parameters of pharmacokinetic interest can be computed from the experimental data; often, the data available are not sufficient to determine some parameters, but it is possible to determine their range.

Response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected Ugandan children exposed and not exposed to single-dose nevirapine at birth. To compare the response to a nevirapine (NVP)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected Ugandan children, exposed and nonexposed to single-dose NVP (sd NVP) at birth. HIV-infected study children were initiated on stavudine/lamivudine/NVP as a fixed dose combination. CD4 cell percent and HIV-1 RNA were documented at baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks post-initiation of HAART. Ninety-two children were enrolled in the study, 44 in the sd NVP-exposed and 48 in the nonexposed cohort. The median age at enrollment was 1.7 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.2-2.4] and 7.8 years (IQR 5.9-9.2) in the sd NVP-exposed and nonexposed cohorts,respectively (P < 0.001). At baseline and week 48 post-HAART, the median CD4 cell percentages were 14% and 33% for the NVP-exposed group and 8% and 22.5% in the nonexposed group (P < 0.0001). The median (IQR) viral load at baseline was 650,568 (359,979-2,086,613) RNA copies/mL and 239,027 (105,904-494,813) RNA copies/mL in the NVP-exposed and nonexposed cohorts, respectively. After 48 weeks of HAART, 76% of the NVP-exposed and 80% of the nonexposed children had a median viral load of < 400 copies/mL (P = 0.74). Both HIV-infected Ugandan older infants and children that were exposed and not exposed to sd NVP at birth had favorable treatment outcomes on NVP-containing HAART.


Phosphorylated neurofilament subunit levels in the serum of cervical compressive myelopathy patients.

Visual disability assessment: valid measurement of activity limitation and mobility in cataract patients. The Visual Disability Assessment (VDA), a questionnaire for measuring the impact of cataract on visual functioning, was developed using classical test theory. Since this approach is limited, our aim was to further investigate the psychometric properties of the VDA using Rasch analysis. 613 patients from the Flinders Medical Centre cataract surgery self-administered the VDA. Psychometric properties investigated for the overall VDA and each subscale included: measurement of a single construct (unidimensionality), item fit to the construct, reliable discrimination between strata of patient ability (person separation) and targeting of item difficulty to person ability. The VDA discriminated five strata of patient ability. However, seven mobility items constituted a second dimension and formed a valid separate scale. Sequestration of these items resulted in a unidimensional 11-item measure of activity limitation. Both the mobility and activity limitation scales had acceptable person separation and neither contained misfitting items. Targeting was suboptimal for mobility (-2.12 logits) but good for activity limitation (-0.72). The subscales also satisfied the requirements of the Rasch measurement model. The Rasch-scaled VDA effectively measures two separate constructs: mobility and activity limitation (with two subscales). Its good psychometric properties make it suitable for measuring cataract surgery outcomes.

Determination of naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol in human blood: comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric and tandem-mass-spectrometric detection. We present data for a comparison of a liquid-chromatographic method coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a high-performance liquid-chromatographic method with column switching and UV spectrophotometric detection. The two methods were developed for determination of naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol in blood serum or plasma aiming to be used for therapeutic drug monitoring to guide the treatment of patients with naltrexone. For the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/UV detection, online sample cleanup was conducted on Perfect Bond C(18) material with 2% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in deionized water. Drugs were separated on a C(18) column using 11.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and 0.4% (vol/vol) N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine within 20 min. LC-MS/MS used naltrexone-d (3) and 6beta-naltrexol-d (4) as internal standards. After protein precipitation, the chromatographic separation was performed on a C(18) column by applying a methanol gradient (5-100%, vol/vol) with 0.1% formic acid over 9.5 min. The HPLC/UV method was found to be linear for concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 ng/ml, with a regression correlation coefficient of r (2) > 0.998 for naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol. The limit of quantification was 2 ng/ml for naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol. For the LC-MS/MS method the calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.999) from 0.5 to 200 ng/ml for both substances, and the limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. The concentrations measured by the two methods correlated significantly for both substances (r(2) > 0.967; p < 0.001). Both methods could be used for therapeutic drug monitoring. The HPLC/UV method was advantageous regarding automatization and costs, whereas LC-MS/MS was superior with regard to sensitivity.

Characterization and assessment of contaminated soil and groundwater at an organic chemical plant site in Chongqing, Southwest China. Contamination from organic chemical plants can cause serious pollution of soil and groundwater ecosystems. To characterize soil contamination and to evaluate the health risk posed by groundwater at a typical organic chemical plant site in Chongqing, China, 91 soil samples and seven groundwater samples were collected. The concentrations of different contaminants and their three-dimensional distribution were determined based on the 3D-krige method. Groundwater chemistry risk index (Chem RI) and cancer risk were calculated based on TRIAD and RBCA models. The chemistry risk indices of groundwater points SW5, SW18, SW22, SW39, SW52, SW80, and SW82 were 0.4209, 0.9972, 0.9324, 0.9990, 0.9991, 1.0000, and 1.0000, respectively, indicating that the groundwater has poor environmental status. By contrast, the reference Yangtse River water sample showed no pollution with a Chem RI of 0.1301. Benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane were the main contaminants in the groundwater and were responsible for the elevated cancer risk. The cumulative health risk of groundwater points (except SW5 and SW18) were all higher than the acceptable baselines of 10(-6), which indicates that the groundwater poses high cancer risk. Action is urgently required to control and remediate the risk for human health and groundwater ecosystems.

Ligand Efficiency Outperforms pIC50 on Both 2D MLR and 3D CoMFA Models: A Case Study on AR Antagonists. The concept of ligand efficiency is defined as biological activity in each molecular size and is widely accepted throughout the drug design community. Among different LE indices, surface efficiency index (SEI) was reported to be the best one in support vector machine modeling, much better than the generally and traditionally used end-point pIC50. In this study, 2D multiple linear regression and 3D comparative molecular field analysis methods are employed to investigate the structure-activity relationships of a series of androgen receptor antagonists, using pIC50 and SEI as dependent variables to verify the influence of using different kinds of end-points. The obtained results suggest that SEI outperforms pIC50 on both MLR and CoMFA models with higher stability and predictive ability. After analyzing the characteristics of the two dependent variables SEI and pIC50, we deduce that the superiority of SEI maybe lie in that SEI could reflect the relationship between molecular structures and corresponding bioactivities, in nature, better than pIC50. This study indicates that SEI could be a more rational parameter to be optimized in the drug discovery process than pIC50.


Crop and non-crop productivity in a traditional maize agroecosystem of the highland of Mexico.

The structure of a DnaA/HobA complex from Helicobacter pylori provides insight into regulation of DNA replication in bacteria. Bacterial DNA replication requires DnaA, an AAA+ ATPase that initiates replication at a specific chromosome region, oriC, and is regulated by species-specific regulators that directly bind DnaA. HobA is a DnaA binding protein, recently identified as an essential regulator of DNA replication in Helicobacter pylori. We report the crystal structure of HobA in complex with domains I and II of DnaA (DnaA(I-II)) from H. pylori, the first structure of DnaA bound to one of its regulators. Biochemical characterization of the complex formed shows that a tetramer of HobA binds four DnaA(I-II) molecules, and that DnaA(I-II) is unable to oligomerize by itself. Mutagenesis and protein-protein interaction studies demonstrate that some of the residues located at the HobA-DnaA(I-II) interface in the structure are necessary for complex formation. Introduction of selected mutations into H. pylori shows that the disruption of the interaction between HobA and DnaA is lethal for the bacteria. Remarkably, the DnaA binding site of HobA is conserved in DiaA from Escherichia coli, suggesting that the structure of the HobA/DnaA complex represents a model for DnaA regulation in other Gram-negative bacteria. Our data, together with those from other studies, indicate that HobA could play a crucial scaffolding role during the initiation of replication in H. pylori by organizing the first step of DnaA oligomerization and attachment to oriC.

Perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1 infected children born to low risk mothers who tested antibody negative during pregnancy: three cases. Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations suggest all pregnant women have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing early in pregnancy. For women with specific identified risks for HIV-1 infection, the CDC recommends repeat testing in the third trimester. We report 3 cases of infants perinatally infected with HIV-1 whose mothers tested negative for HIV-1 during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because they were not considered to be "high risk" for HIV-1 infection, they did not have a third trimester HIV test. These cases suggest that repeat HIV antibody testing may be necessary to avoid cases of perinatal transmission that might be prevented with antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy.

The nature of international health security. Health issues occasionally intersect security issues. Health security has been viewed as an essential part of human security. Policymakers and health professionals, however, do not share a common definition of health security. This article aims to characterize the notions of health security in order to clarify what constitutes the nexus of health and security. The concept of health security has evolved over time so that it encompasses many entities. Analyzing the health reports of four multilateral organizations (the United Nations, World Health Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the European Union) produced eight categories of most significant relevance to contemporary health security, allowing comparison of the definitions. The four categories are: emerging diseases; global infectious disease; deliberate release of chemical and biological materials; violence, conflict, and humanitarian emergencies. Two other categories of common concern are natural disasters and environmental change, as well as chemical and radioactive accidents. The final two categories, food insecurity and poverty, are discussed less frequently. Nevertheless, food security is emerging as an increasingly important issue in public health. Health security is the first line of defence against health emergencies. As globalization brings more complexities, dealing with the increased scale and extent of health security will require greater international effort and political support.

Allergenicity of Hev b 13, a major esterase allergen in natural rubber latex (Hevea brasiliensis) allergy, does not only depend on its carbohydrate moiety. The three-dimensional model built for the major latex allergen Hev b 13 consists of the typical organization of plant esterases made of a central bundle of five parallel beta-strands surrounded by five alpha-helices associated to two shorter alpha-helical segments. Up to 12 sets of sequential IgE-binding peptides were identified in SPOT experiments along the amino acid sequence of Hev b 13. They correspond in fact to eight IgE-binding epitopic stretches exposed on the surface of the allergen. With the exception of epitope #5, all other epitopes contain charged residues. Epitope #8 contains the 3rd putative N-glycosylation site of Hev b 13 and should consist of a glycotope, whereas all other identified IgE-binding areas occur outside the two remaining putative N-glycosylation sites. Accordingly, the allergenicity of Hev b 13 does not primarily depends on its carbohydrate moiety.

Electrophysiological evidence of nicotine's distracter-filtering properties in non-smokers. Nicotine-enhanced attentional functions are purported to underlie improvements in behavioral performance in cognitive tasks but it is unclear as to whether these effects involve selective attention or attentional control under conditions of distraction. Behavioral and event-related potential measures were used to examine the effects of nicotine on distractibility in 21 non-smokers who were instructed to ignore task-irrelevant auditory stimuli while they performed a visual discrimination task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, nicotine gum (6 mg) shortened overall reaction times but failed to prevent increased response slowing and errors caused by deviant sounds. Relative to placebo, nicotine did not modulate the early pre-attentive detection of deviants as reflected in the mismatch negativity but it attenuated the amplitude of the deviant-elicited P3a, an event-related potential component indexing the involuntary shifting of attention. Nicotine also enhanced attentional re-focusing back on to task-relevant stimuli following distraction as evidenced by an increased amplitude of the re-orienting negativity. These findings and the behavioral-electrophysiological dissociation seen with nicotine are discussed in relation to theories of attention and smoking motivation.

[In-vitro fertilization: advantage and disadvantage of covering the costs of IVF/ICSI by the health insurance in Switzerland]. In-vitro fertilization: advantage and disadvantage of covering the costs of IVF/CSI by the health insurance in Switzerland The reimbursement of certain infertility treatments (stimulation with/without insemination) whereas IVF/ICSI is not leads patients with an indication of IVF to prefer treatments of low efficacy. The costs of multiple pregnancies issued by reimbursed or non-reimbursed fertility treatments are paid by the society. There should be measures to reduce these costs and to take the money used today to pay the complications of infertility treatments to reimburse IVF. The efficacy of such a system (single embryo transfer) has been proven in Belgium since several years. The dangers of complete reimbursement (IVF treatment in cases without any chances of success, only because it is for free) can be avoided by an Efficacy and Safety Board.

Addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine for greater palatine nerve block prolongs postoperative analgesia after cleft palate repair. The effect of dexmedetomidine on the duration of sensory blockade has not been studied in humans. We evaluated the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine on the duration of postoperative analgesia in children who underwent repair of a cleft palate. Thirty children who were scheduled for repair of a complete cleft palate using a combination of general anaesthesia and greater palatine nerve block were allocated randomly into one of two equal groups (n = 15). In both groups, the greater palatine nerve block was performed bilaterally using 0.5 ml of solution on each side. The B group received bupivacaine 0.25%, whereas the BD group received bupivacaine 0.25% with 1 microg kg(-1) dexmedetomidine. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, pain score, the time to the first request for analgesia, and the degree of sedation were recorded. There was no difference in haemodynamic variables between the two groups. The pain score was significantly higher in the B group as compared with the BD group. The time to the first request for analgesia was significantly longer in children in the BD group (mean 22 h, range 20.6-23.7 h) as compared with those who received bupivacaine alone (14.2 h, 13-15 h). Sedation scores in the postoperative period did not differ between the study groups. Greater palatine nerve block with a combination of dexmedetomidine and bupivacaine increased the duration of analgesia after repair of a cleft palate by 50% with no clinically relevant side effects.

Does College Matter for Emerging Adulthood? Comparing Developmental Trajectories of Educational Groups. Critics of emerging adulthood theory have suggested that it only applies to college students, but this assertion has largely gone untested. The purpose of the present study was to compare developmental trajectories of non-students versus college-educated youth in theoretically relevant domains of work, love, and financial independence. Using data from the Youth Development Study (N = 1139, 49.6 % female, 63.3 % White, 10.9 % Southeast Asian, 1.5 % Other Asian, 8.6 % Black, 5.3 % Mixed Race, 4.0 % Latino, 0.8 % Native American), latent growth curve models were fitted to chart each group's development, from ages 14 to 30. Different trajectories were revealed for hours worked, children, and financial dependence on parents, spouses, and government aid. No differences were found in employment rates, marriage rates, or financial dependence on own income. These results provide a clearer picture of emerging adulthood for non-students, and highlight problems with generalizing college student research to all emerging adults. 

Automatic fall detection using wearable biomedical signal measurement terminal. In our study, we developed a mobile waist-mounted device which can monitor the subject's acceleration signal and detect the fall events in real-time with high accuracy and automatically send an emergency message to a remote server via CDMA module. When fall event happens, the system also generates an alarm sound at 50Hz to alarm other people until a subject can sit up or stand up. A Kionix KXM52-1050 tri-axial accelerometer and a Bellwave BSM856 CDMA standalone modem were used to detect and manage fall events. We used not only a simple threshold algorithm but also some supporting methods to increase an accuracy of our system (nearly 100% in laboratory environment). Timely fall detection can prevent regrettable death due to long-lie effect; therefore increase the independence of elderly people in an unsupervised living environment.

Multiscale Biofabrication of Articular Cartilage: Bioinspired and Biomimetic Approaches. Articular cartilage is the load-bearing tissue found inside all articulating joints of the body. It vastly reduces friction and allows for smooth gliding between contacting surfaces. The structure of articular cartilage matrix and cellular composition is zonal and is important for its mechanical properties. When cartilage becomes injured through trauma or disease, it has poor intrinsic healing capabilities. The spectrum of cartilage injury ranges from isolated areas of the joint to diffuse breakdown and the clinical appearance of osteoarthritis. Current clinical treatment options remain limited in their ability to restore cartilage to its normal functional state. This review focuses on the evolution of biomaterial scaffolds that have been used for functional cartilage tissue engineering. In particular, we highlight recent developments in multiscale biofabrication approaches attempting to recapitulate the complex 3D matrix of native articular cartilage tissue. Additionally, we focus on the application of these methods to engineering each zone of cartilage and engineering full-thickness osteochondral tissues for improved clinical implantation. These methods have shown the potential to control individual cell-to-scaffold interactions and drive progenitor cell differentiation into a chondrocyte lineage. The use of these bioinspired nanoengineered scaffolds hold promise for recreation of structure and function on the whole tissue level and may represent exciting new developments for future clinical applications for cartilage injury and restoration. 

Seasonal variation of seclusion incidents from violent and suicidal acts in forensic psychiatric patients. A seasonal variation in violence and suicidal behaviour has been reported in several studies with partially congruent results. Most of forensic psychiatric patients have a history of severe violent behaviour that often continues in spite of regular treatment. In the forensic psychiatric hospital environment aggressive and suicidal acts are often sudden and unpredictable. For reasons of safety, rapid and intensive coercive measures, such as seclusion and restraint, are necessary in the treatment of such patients. To examine whether these involuntary seclusions have a seasonal pattern, possibly similar than the reported seasonal variation in violence and suicidal behaviour. By investigating the possibility of a seasonal variation of seclusion incidents from violent and suicidal acts, it may become possible to improve the management of forensic psychiatric patients. The hospital files of all secluded patients at Niuvanniemi Hospital from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2002 were examined. In total, 385 patients (324 male and 61 female) were identified as being secluded at least once in 1930 different incidents (1476 from male and 454 from female patients). Seasonal decomposition and linear regression with dummy month variables were used to examine the possibility of annual variations for seclusions. The seasonal variation of involuntary seclusion incidents was statistically significant. According to the linear regression model, most of the seclusion incidents, affecting many different patients, began in July and August, and were concentrated throughout the fall until November. The sum of all seclusion days was lowest in January and highest between July and November (difference +31% to +37%). These findings are mainly in agreement with results from other studies on seasonal variation and violent behaviour. The allocation of staff for late summer and fall might enhance the management of forensic psychiatric patients, thus leading to possible decreases in seclusion incidents. The factors affecting violent, aggressive and suicidal behaviours are complex and more investigation is needed to understand, identify, intervene and effectively reduce such behaviours.

The combination of baicalin and baicalein enhances apoptosis via the ERK/p38 MAPK pathway in human breast cancer cells. To examine whether the cell growth inhibitory effect of the combination of baicalin and baicalein is related to apoptosis. Moreover, to determine whether the expression of some apoptosis-related proteins is regulated by the ERK/p38 MAPK pathway. Cell viability was measured using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was detected by acridine orange (AO) staining, DNA ladder assay and flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis-related proteins were observed using Western blot analysis. Compared with baicalin or baicalein alone, the combination treatment of baicalin (50 micromol/L) and baicalein (25 micromol/L) had an anti-proliferative effect in a time-dependent manner. Isobologram analysis demonstrated that the combination treatment had a synergistic effect. Moreover, apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was increased by 12% and 20% with the combination treatment at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. With the combination treatment in MCF-7 cells, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 were observed, and the level of bcl-2 expression was decreased approximately 20% and 40% at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. The expression of bax and p53 were increased about 25% and 15% at 48 h, respectively. Moreover, the activation of caspase-3, -9 and the regulation of bcl-2, bax and p53 were related to ERK /p38 MAPK activation. In this study, apoptosis was enhanced by the combination treatment of baicalin and baicalein, which activated caspases-3 and caspase-9, downregulated the level of bcl-2 and upregulated the level of bax or p53 via the ERK/p38 MAPK pathway.

Quantification and real-time tracking of RNA in live cells using Sticky-flares. We report a novel spherical nucleic acid (SNA) gold nanoparticle conjugate, termed the Sticky-flare, which enables facile quantification of RNA expression in live cells and spatiotemporal analysis of RNA transport and localization. The Sticky-flare is capable of entering live cells without the need for transfection agents and recognizing target RNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. On recognition, the Sticky-flare transfers a fluorophore-conjugated reporter to the transcript, resulting in a turning on of fluorescence in a quantifiable manner and the fluorescent labeling of targeted transcripts. The latter allows the RNA to be tracked via fluorescence microscopy as it is transported throughout the cell. We use this novel nanoconjugate to analyze the expression level and spatial distribution of β-actin mRNA in HeLa cells and to observe the real-time transport of β-actin mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, we investigate the application of Sticky-flares for tracking transcripts that undergo more extensive compartmentalization by fluorophore-labeling U1 small nuclear RNA and observing its distribution in the nucleus of live cells.

Parylene-A coated microplate for covalent immobilization of proteins and peptides. Various types of microplates made of polystyrene have been widely used for immunoassays. A new microplate suitable for the covalent immobilization of proteins and peptides was developed by thermal deposition of amino-modified parylene (parylene-A) on the microplate. The primary amine groups of the parylene-A was exploited for the covalent coupling of proteins and peptides. The optical transmittance at the wavelength of 400-500 nm was estimated to be suitable for the application to immunoassays. The immobilization efficiency of the parylene-A coated microplate was demonstrated to be far improved in comparison to the conventional microplate by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP), anti-HRP antibody and a peptide with 9-residues as model biomolecules.


A Prospective International Multicenter Study of AKI in the Intensive Care Unit.

Pre-operative parathyroid localisation: surgical review of sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile images is important. To highlight the importance of pre-operative review of sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile imaging before parathyroid surgery. Technetium-99 m sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scanning is a well established imaging modality undertaken to locate the parathyroid glands prior to parathyroidectomy. Because of the relative lack of detail in the images obtained, the radiological report is normally the most important piece of information used by the surgeon for surgical planning. We report a case that illustrates the importance of surgical image review prior to revision parathyroid surgery. We also present a review of literature highlighting the need for surgical review of such imaging. We propose that surgeons routinely review sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile images pre-operatively.

[Inhibitory effects of HSV-tk/GCV system mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 on rabbit lens epithelial cells]. To study the inhibitory effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-mediated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system on the rabbit lens epithelial cells (N/N1003A) in vitro and to investigate the mechanism of cell death. After N/N1003A cells had been transfected with rAAV2-EGFP, expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were observed by inverted fluorescent microscope and the transfection efficiency was detected by flow cytometry. N/N1003A cells were infected by recombinant virus rAAV2/HSV-tk as the treated group, and the uninfected N/N1003A cells were used as the controls. The dose- and time-dependent efficiency and bystander effect of HSV-tk/GCV system on the cells were studied by MTT assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were observed by phase contrast microscope, electron microscope and Hoechst33258 stain. Apoptotic cell rate and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. rAAV2 vector encoding EGFP gene could be transfected into N/N1003A cells stably and efficiently. The effects of GCV on these two groups were dose-dependent (F = 13.076. 239, P < 0.001). The difference of percentages of survival cells between the study group and the control group at various doses of GCV was statistically significant (F = 53,47.119, P < 0.001). The 50% of the inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GCV in the study group was 2 mg/L and was 524 mg/L in the control group. The killing efficiency of GCV increased with the prolongation of time and showed significant bystander effect. Cell apoptosis and necrosis were observed in N/N1003A-tk cells transfected by GCV, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher than that of the control group (t = 3.83, P < 0.01). The percentages of N/N1003A-tk cells in the S phase of the cell cycle was significantly higher than that of the control group (t = 3.55, P < 0.01). Whereas the percentages of the G0/ G1 phase in GCV treated cells was significantly lower than that of the control group ( t = 4.29, P < 0.01). GCV can kill efficiently the N/N1003A cells infected by recombinant virus rAAV2/HSV-tk, and there is strong bystander effect. Recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated HSV-tk/GCV suicide gene system may provide an effective approach for the treatment of lens posterior capsular opacification.

Apaf-1-independent programmed cell death in mouse development. Many cells die during mammalian development and are engulfed by macrophages. In DNase II(-/-) embryos, the TUNEL-positive DNA of apoptotic cells is left undigested in macrophages, providing a system for studying programmed cell death during mouse development. Here, we showed that an Apaf-1-null mutation in the DNase II(-/-) embryos greatly reduced the number of macrophages carrying DNA at E11.5. However, at later stages of the embryogenesis, a significant number of macrophages carrying undigested DNA were present in Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, indicating that cells died and were engulfed in an Apaf-1-independent manner. In most tissues of the Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, no processed caspase-3 was detected, and the DNA of dead cells accumulated in the macrophages appeared intact. Many nonapoptotic dead cells were found in the tail of the Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, suggesting that the Apaf-1-independent programmed cell death occurred, and these dead cells were engulfed by macrophages. In contrast, active caspase-3 was detected in E14.5 thymus of Apaf-1(-/-) embryos. Treatment of fetal thymocytes with staurosporine, but not etoposide, induced processing of procaspases 3 and 9, indicating that the E14.5 thymocytes have the ability to undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis in an Apaf-1-independent manner. Thus, programmed cell death in mouse development, which normally proceeds in an efficient Apaf-1-depenent mechanism, appears to be backed up by Apaf-1-independent death systems.

Distinguishing glioma recurrence from treatment effect after radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy. Recent advancements have made radiation and chemotherapy the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastomas. The use of these therapies has resulted in an increased diagnosis of pseudoprogression and radiation-induced necrosis. Standard MRI techniques are inadequate in differentiating tumor recurrence from posttreatment effects. Diagnosis of a posttreatment lesion as glioma recurrence rather than radiochemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect is critical. This increase in accuracy plays a role as newer immunotherapies incurring posttreatment effects on MRI emerge. Advancements with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional positron emission tomography scans have shown promising capabilities. Further investigations are necessary to assess the imaging algorithms and accuracy of these modalities to differentiate true glioma recurrence from radiotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect.


Modeling ligand recognition at the P2Y12 receptor in light of X-ray structural information.

Technical feasibility of transnasal endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery ligation: assessment with intraoperative CT imaging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) ligation for acute control of epistaxis. A prospective study was conducted using eight cadaver heads. Pre- and intraoperative CT scans were performed using the xCAT (Xoran Technologies, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Skull base anatomy relative to the AEA was reviewed preoperatively. Endoscopic AEA ligation was attempted in all sides with a mesentery. Ligation was not deemed feasible in AEAs without a mesentery. It was attempted on two sides without a mesentery to assess risk of skull base and orbital disruption. Intraoperative CT scans were performed to assess the position of the clips and the integrity of the skull base and lamina papyracea. The mean lateral lamella height was 4.75 and 4.83 mm on the right and left, respectively. Of the 16 arteries, 6 (37.5%) of the AEAs were within a bony mesentery. No AEA canals were dehiscent. Four of the six AEAs (66%) within a mesentery were successfully clipped and two (33%) were partially clipped by endoscopic evaluation. Both arteries without mesentery where clipping was attempted were partially clipped by endoscopic examination. Review of intraoperative CT scans showed that the AEA with a mesentery was clipped successfully on three sides, partially on one side, and unsuccessfully on two sides. AEA clipping was unsuccessful on both sides without a mesentery. One AEA without a mesentery showed skull base disruption after ligation by endoscopy and CT. None of the specimens showed orbital injury. Intraoperative CT scanning revealed that AEA ligation was less successful than was apparent endoscopically. Effective AEA clipping was performed in 50% of cases with a mesentery. Endoscopic clipping was not technically feasible in cases with AEA without a mesentery. Overall, AEA clipping was only technically feasible in 3 of 16 sides (18.8%).

Patient-Reported Sexual Function After Staged Penile Urethroplasty. To evaluate sexual function after staged penile urethroplasty with oral mucosal graft (OMG). We identified men with completed staged penile urethroplasty with OMG from the Trauma and Urologic Reconstruction Network of Surgeons database between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2014. Our primary outcome was change in total Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) and total Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Ejaculatory Domain (MSHQ-EjD) Short Form at baseline vs after the second stage of the procedure. Second, we assessed subjective changes in penile curvature, length, and sensation. Thirty-three patients were included with a mean age of 45 years and mean body mass index of 27.6 kg/m(2). Urethral strictures arose from failed hypospadias repair in 52% and lichen sclerosus in 27%. Fifty-two percent of patients reported a previous urethroplasty. The median follow-up time between the second stage procedure and postoperative questionnaires was 6.3 months (interquartile range: 3.5-13.3). There was no significant change in the total SHIM (Δ0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.00∼1.72) and MSHQ-EjD (Δ1.55, 95% CI: -1.53∼4.63) scores preoperatively vs postoperatively. In addition, 32% reported improved and 52% no change in satisfaction with sexual intercourse (SHIM Q5). Forty percent of patients reported reduced and 45% no change in bother with ejaculation after surgery (MSHQ-EjD Q4). Men reported new penile curvature (23%), loss of penile length (55%), and altered penile sensitivity (45%) after surgery. Patients undergoing staged penile urethroplasty with OMG are likely to have minimal changes in erectile and ejaculatory function postoperatively, although many may experience new penile curvature, reduced penile length, and/or reduced penile sensitivity.

Involvement of rhodopsin and ATP in the activation of membranous guanylate cyclase in retinal photoreceptor outer segments (ROS-GC) by GC-activating proteins (GCAPs): a new model for ROS-GC activation and its link to retinal diseases. Membranous guanylate cyclase in retinal photoreceptor outer segments (ROS-GC), a key enzyme for the recovery of photoreceptors to the dark state, has a topology identical to and cytoplasmic domains homologous to those of peptide-regulated GCs. However, under the prevailing concept, its activation mechanism is significantly different from those of peptide-regulated GCs: GC-activating proteins (GCAPs) function as the sole activator of ROS-GC in a Ca(2+)-sensitive manner, and neither reception of an outside signal by the extracellular domain (ECD) nor ATP binding to the kinase homology domain (KHD) is required for its activation. We have recently shown that ATP pre-binding to the KHD in ROS-GC drastically enhances its GCAP-stimulated activity, and that rhodopsin illumination, as the outside signal, is required for the ATP pre-binding. These results indicate that illuminated rhodopsin is involved in ROS-GC activation in two ways: to initiate ATP binding to ROS-GC for preparation of its activation and to reduce [Ca(2+)] through activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase. These two signal pathways are activated in a parallel and proportional manner and finally converge for strong activation of ROS-GC by Ca(2+)-free GCAPs. These results also suggest that the ECD receives the signal for ATP binding from illuminated rhodopsin. The ECD is projected into the intradiscal space, i.e., an intradiscal domain(s) of rhodopsin is also involved in the signal transfer. Many retinal disease-linked mutations are found in these intradiscal domains; however, their consequences are often unclear. This model will also provide novel insights into causal relationship between these mutations and certain retinal diseases.

Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Intracranial Abnormalities in Unprovoked Seizures. Prospective data are lacking to determine which children might benefit from prompt neuroimaging after unprovoked seizures. We aimed to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, relevant intracranial abnormalities in children with first, unprovoked seizures. We conducted a 6-center prospective study in children aged >28 days to 18 years with seemingly unprovoked seizures. Emergency department (ED) clinicians documented clinical findings on a standardized form. Our main outcome was the presence of a clinically relevant intracranial abnormality on computed tomography (CT) or MRI, defined as those that might change management, either emergently, urgently, or nonurgently. We enrolled 475 of 625 (76%) eligible patients. Of 354 patients for whom cranial MRI or CT scans were obtained in the ED or within 4 months of the ED visit, 40 (11.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0-14.6%) had clinically relevant intracranial abnormalities, with 3 (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.1-1.8%) having emergent/urgent abnormalities. On logistic regression analysis, a high-risk past medical history (adjusted odds ratio: 9.2; 95% CI: 2.4-35.7) and any focal aspect to the seizure (odds ratio: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-5.3) were independently associated with clinically relevant abnormalities. Clinically relevant intracranial abnormalities occur in 11% of children with first, unprovoked seizures. Emergent/urgent abnormalities, however, occur in <1%, suggesting that most children do not require neuroimaging in the ED. Findings on patient history and physical examination identify patients at higher risk of relevant abnormalities.


The impact on outcome of the addition of all-trans retinoic acid to intensive chemotherapy in younger patients with nonacute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia: overall results and results in genotypic subgroups defined by mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA.

Circumpolar synchrony in big river bacterioplankton. Natural bacterial communities are extremely diverse and highly dynamic, but evidence is mounting that the compositions of these communities follow predictable temporal patterns. We investigated these patterns with a 3-year, circumpolar study of bacterioplankton communities in the six largest rivers of the pan-arctic watershed (Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), five of which are among Earth's 25 largest rivers. Communities in the six rivers shifted synchronously over time, correlating with seasonal shifts in hydrology and biogeochemistry and clustering into three groups: winter/spring, spring freshet, and summer/fall. This synchrony indicates that hemisphere-scale variation in seasonal climate sets the pace of variation in microbial diversity. Moreover, these seasonal communities reassembled each year in all six rivers, suggesting a long-term, predictable succession in the composition of big river bacterioplankton communities.

Implications of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) during public health emergencies and on alternate sites of care. Hospitals throughout the country are using innovative strategies to accommodate the surge of patients brought on by the novel H1N1 virus. One strategy has been to help decompress the amount of patients seeking care within emergency departments by using alternate sites of care, such as tents, parking lots, and community centers as triage, staging, and screening areas. As at any other time an individual presents on hospital property, hospitals and providers must be mindful of the requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. In this article we review the act and its implications during public health emergencies, with a particular focus on its implications on alternative sites of care.

A rapid, valid and inexpensive assay for measuring epiphyseal plates in mouse tibia. One of the most accurate indices of changes in somatic tissue growth rate in rodents is the width of tibial epiphyseal plates as unlike most mammals, rodent growth plates never ossify. Unfortunately, the original procedure to measure tibial epiphyseal plate width (TEPW) was developed for rats and yields poor results with mice. This paper demonstrates a simple method for silver staining growth plates that can be used to inexpensively and quickly measure the TEPW of mice. Poor visualization due to overstaining and the shattering of growth plates necessitated several revisions to the original protocol. These include exposing the growth plate prior to acetone dehydration, reducing the silver nitrate concentration from 2% to 1.5% and staining time from 2 min to 10 s and finally, the use of reflective light rather than transmissive light when imaging. The optimized protocol was then validated by generating an age-dependent TEPW growth curve that matched changes in tibia length. A total of 120 tibias were processed in a combined time of less than one day and for less than $30. By contrast, histological processing in the university's core facility would have cost $1440 and taken approximately three weeks. Thus, the revised protocol is vastly more cost effective, reliable and can be performed considerably quicker with minimal training.

Consensus on the current use of sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. An expert panel was convened to reach a consensus on the current use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A multinational, multidisciplinary group of experts objectively reviewed clinical data of sorafenib and considered clinical experience to develop statements summarizing our consensus on the current use of sorafenib. Sorafenib is the standard of care for Child-Pugh (CP) A patients with advanced HCC (i.e. not amenable to surgery or locoregional treatment). There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine clinical use of sorafenib in CP B patients, but sorafenib can be offered as an option for those with compensated liver cirrhosis. Patients with stable performance status who have progressive disease during sorafenib treatment can be maintained on sorafenib, although there are no clear data supporting the continuation of sorafenib in these patients. The effectiveness of the adjuvant use of sorafenib in preventing recurrence after resection or local ablation, or in combination with transarterial chemoembolization, are being evaluated in clinical studies. In conclusion, sorafenib has extended treatment options for patients with HCC, and is now established as the standard of care for CP A patients with HCC not amenable to surgery or locoregional treatment. Based on its multikinase-inhibitor activity and proven efficacy in prolonging survival in HCC, broader use - including a subgroup of patients with CP B (clinically compensated cirrhosis) and earlier disease stages - might be expected dependent on the results of ongoing studies of safety and clinically relevant benefit in these patients.

Emergence of H274Y oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses in Japan during the 2008-2009 season. A substantial increase in oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses was reported in Europe in late 2007. To monitor the antiviral susceptibility profile of human A(H1N1) influenza viruses in Japan during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. Viruses were obtained from respiratory samples of patients with influenza collected in Japan between December 2007 and April 2008 (n=1046) and between December 2008 and April 2009 (n=1789). Oseltamivir resistance was determined by an H274Y-specific real-time PCR cycling probe assay and a neuraminidase inhibition assay. Amantadine resistance was assessed by sequencing the M2 gene. Sequencing of the hemagglutinin and NA genes was performed to infer phylogenetic relationships between different strains. Three of 687 (0.4%) A(H1N1) viruses from the 2007-2008 season and 745 of 745 (100%) viruses from the 2008-2009 season carried the NA-H274Y substitution and demonstrated a >300-fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility. All oseltamivir-resistant viruses from the 2008-2009 season possessed an A193T substitution in the receptor-binding domain of the hemagglutinin. Amantadine resistance was detected in 431 of 687 (62.7%) and 0 of 745 (0.0%) of the A(H1N1) viruses from the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons, respectively. A dramatic surge in oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses possessing the NA-H274Y substitution was detected in Japan during the 2008-2009 season. The emergence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses was facilitated by mutations in the viral genome. Intensified surveillance, including phenotypic assays and sequencing of the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and M2 gene would allow monitoring of the spread and evolution of drug-resistant influenza virus variants.

Computational modelling of blood-flow-induced changes in blood electrical conductivity and its contribution to the impedance cardiogram. Studies have shown that blood-flow-induced change in electrical conductivity is of equal importance in assessment of the impedance cardiogram (ICG) as are volumetric changes attributed to the motion of heart, lungs and blood vessels. To better understand the sole effect of time-varying blood conductivity on the spatiotemporal distribution of trans-thoracic electric fields (i.e. ICG), this paper presents a segmented high-resolution (1 mm(3)) thoracic cardiovascular system, in which the time-varying pressures, flows and electrical conductivities of blood in different vessels are evaluated using a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations, red blood cell orientation and cardiac cycle functions. Electric field and voltage simulations are performed using two and four electrode configurations delivering a small alternating electric current to an anatomically realistic and electrically accurate model of modelled human torso. The simulations provide a three-dimensional electric field distribution and show that the time-varying blood conductivity alters the voltage potential difference between the electrodes by a maximum of 0.28% for a cardiac output of about 5 L min(-1). As part of a larger study, it is hoped that this initial model will be useful in providing improved insights into blood-flow-related spatiotemporal electric field variations and assist in the optimal placement of electrodes in impedance cardiography experiments.

[Serum marker screening during the second trimester for prenatal diagnosis and predicting pregnancy outcome]. To explore the clinical value of screening the serum markers during the second trimester of pregnancy in preventing congenital birth defect and predicting the pregnancy outcome. Between November, 2011 and October, 2013, a total of 25 520 pregnant women (15-20+6 gestational weeks) underwent a screening test of triple serum markers including free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free βhCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and unconjugated estriol (µE3) during the second semester of pregnancy. The women identified by the screening test as having high risks were referred to invasive prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis, or to color Doppler ultrasound examination for suspected patent neural tube defect (NTD), and their pregnancy outcomes were followed up. High-risk pregnancies were identified by the screening test in 4.91% (1254/25520) of the total cohort. Of the 818 patients receiving invasive prenatal diagnosis, the abnormal rate was 5.75% (47/818). The high-risk pregnancies identified by the screening test was associated with a significantly higher rate of abnormal outcomes compared with the low-risk pregnancies (1.91% vs 0.1%, P<0.01). Of the 210 high-risk cases of NTD, a definite diagnosis was established in 34 cases. We also found that pregnancies at an advanced age (>35 years) was associated with increased risks for trisomy 21 compared with those at younger ages (15% vs 1.65%P<0.01). The detection rate of abnormal karyotypes in pregnancies with an abnormal MoM value of a single marker was 3.17% (6/189). Screening tests of serum markers during the second trimester of pregnancy can be helpful to identify fetal chromosomal and anatomical anomalies, predict unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, and prevent birth defects in pregnancies at an advanced age. The MoM value of a single marker in the second trimester can be indicative of potential chromosomal abnormalities.

Novel CLCN1 mutations and clinical features of Korean patients with myotonia congenita. Myotonia congenita (MC) is a form of nondystrophic myotonia caused by a mutation of CLCN1, which encodes human skeletal muscle chloride channel (CLC-1). We performed sequence analysis of all coding regions of CLCN1 in patients clinically diagnosed with MC, and identified 10 unrelated Korean patients harboring mutations. Detailed clinical analysis was performed in these patients to identify their clinical characteristics in relation to their genotypes. The CLCN1 mutational analyses revealed nine different point mutations. Of these, six (p.M128I, p.S189C, p.M373L, p.P480S, p.G523D, and p.M609K) were novel and could be unique among Koreans. While some features including predominant lower extremity involvement and normal to slightly elevated creatine kinase levels were consistently observed, general clinical features were highly variable in terms of age of onset, clinical severity, aggravating factors, and response to treatment. Our study is the first systematic study of MC in Korea, and shows its expanding clinical and genetic spectrums.

Health-related quality of life among children with cancer in Hyderabad, India. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) experienced by children with cancer is more important than ever before as survival rates are increasing. The aim of this study was to assess the HRQL of children with cancer in a developing country, using physician proxy assessments. The Health Utilities Index (HUI) was chosen as the measurement tool and physicians' assessments were obtained using an HUI proxy-respondent interview-administered questionnaire. A total of 45 patients and their physicians (n=6) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Andhra Pradesh, India. Most of the children had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There were no differences in patterns observed between cancer types for the child's HRQL, but there was wide variation in the total HRQL scores among the children. This variation was more evident in certain aspects of children's life such as emotion and pain. This study has shown that HRQL as determined by physician proxy assessments in children with cancer in India is compromised, matching results in similar populations elsewhere.

Pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm is mediated by proinflammatory cytokine TNFA and IFNG and through stochastic regulation of IL10 and TGFB1 by comorbid factors. Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is often asymptomatic until the time of rupture resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).There is no precise biochemical or phenotype marker for diagnosis of aneurysm. Environmental risk factors that associate with IA can result in modifying the effect of inherited genetic factors and thereby increase the susceptibility to SAH. In addition subsequent to aneurismal rupture, the nature and quantum of inflammatory response might be critical for repair. Therefore, genetic liability to inflammatory response caused by polymorphisms in cytokine genes might be the common denominator for gene and environment in the development of aneurysm and complications associated with rupture. Functionally relevant polymorphisms in the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes IL-1 complex (IL1A, IL1B, and IL1RN), TNFA, IFNG, IL3, IL6, IL12B, IL1RN, TGFB1, IL4, and IL10] were screened in radiologically confirmed 220 IA patients and 250 controls from genetically stratified Malayalam-speaking Dravidian ethnic population of south India. Subgroup analyses with genetic and environmental variables were also carried out. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFA rs361525, IFNG rs2069718, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 rs1800871 and rs1800872 were found to be significantly associated with IA, independent of epidemiological factors. TGFB1 rs1800469 polymorphism was observed to be associated with IA through co-modifying factors such as hypertension and gender. Functional prediction of all the associated SNPs of TNFA, IL10, and TGFB1 indicates their potential role in transcriptional regulation. Meta-analysis further reiterates that IL1 gene cluster and IL6 were not associated with IA. The study suggests that chronic exposure to inflammatory response mediated by genetic variants in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFA and IFNG could be a primary event, while stochastic regulation of IL10 and TGFB1 response mediated by comorbid factors such as hypertension may augment the pathogenesis of IA through vascular matrix degradation. The implication and interaction of these genetic variants under a specific environmental background will help us identify the resultant phenotypic variation in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm. Identifying genetic risk factors for inflammation might also help in understanding and addressing the posttraumatic complications following the aneurismal rupture.

Association between women's self-diagnosis of labor and labor duration after admission. To examine the association between women's perception of onset and the duration of labor after hospital admission. Women whose labor started spontaneously at term, delivering at the Hannover Medical School Hospital, Germany, between 2001 and 2004 were asked when and how labor had started. Answers were analyzed using structured content analysis. Women's symptoms were grouped in eight predefined categories; inter-rater agreement was assessed (kappa=0.93). Associations between women's symptoms and labor duration after admission were also analyzed. Duration of labor after admission was longer in nulliparas (n=347) than in multiparas (n=304, P<0.001). Nulliparas experienced shorter labor in association with recurrent pain, advanced cervical dilatation at admission and spontaneous rupture of membranes. Oxytocin augmentation and epidural analgesia were associated with a longer duration. In multiparas, advanced cervical dilatation at admission, spontaneously ruptured membranes, blood-tinged mucus or emotional upheaval perceived by women were associated with a shorter interval from admission until birth. How women diagnose their onset of labor relates to some extent with labor duration after admission. Recognized symptoms and their association with labor duration differed between nulliparas and multiparas.

Scoliosis model created by pedicle screw tethering in immature goats: the feasibility, reliability, and complications. An in vivo model of scoliosis was established in immature goats. To assess the feasibility, reliability, and complications of the innovative animal model. Among the methods of creating a scoliotic model, posterior asymmetric tethering of spine yielded encouraging results. However, some shortcomings associated with the use of posterior asymmetric tether are apparent. Fourteen female goats (age: 5-8 weeks old, weight: 6-8 kg), were instrumented and tethered using unilateral pedicle screws and contralateral rib resections. Twelve of the goats were followed up for 8 weeks by serial radiography. Six goats were removed of the posterior load and no treatment was given. Two goats were selected randomly from the 6 animals and subjected to computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional reconstruction after another 8 weeks. All the 6 goats were killed and spine specimens were harvested for histologic study 16 weeks after observation. Radiographic observation showed that 12 goats developed scoliosis with convex toward the right side, and the curvature increased with time in 11 goats, and it remained unchanged in 1 animal. The angle immediately after the procedures averaged 29.0 degrees (23 degrees -38 degrees ) and increased to an average of 43.0 degrees (36.0 degrees -58.0 degrees ) over a period of 8 to 10 weeks, with average angle increment being 14.0 degrees (P < 0.001). The curvature ceased to increase in 6 goats during the subsequent 2 months after the tether were removed (P > 0.05). Three-dimensional CT reconstruction revealed that the vertebral bodies were wedged, the 2 sides of the thoracic skeleton were asymmetric, and the vertebrae in the major curve were rotated. Histologic study revealed that the goats remained in growth stage and the growth potential of 2 sides of the spine was not identical. Radiography and three-dimensional CT reconstruction of vertebrae revealed that the architectural alterations found in the model were similar to those of idiopathic-type deformity observed in clinical practice.

Use of green fluorescent protein to monitor cell envelope stress in Lactococcus lactis. A Lactococcus lactis reporter system suitable to detect cell envelope stress in high-throughput settings was developed by fusing the CesR-regulated promoter of llmg0169 to the gfp(uv) gene. A dot blot assay allowed fast detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence even at low production levels. Unexpectedly, this promoter was also induced by mitomycin C via CesR.

Thyroid cancer and renal transplantation: a meta-analysis. Kidney transplantation and the associated immune suppression are associated with a significantly increased risk of developing cancer during long-term follow-up. Thyroid cancer has been recognised as a potential post-transplant risk but has not yet been subject of a focused review. We therefore performed a meta-analysis on data of 50,861 patients with a total follow-up of 198 595 patient-years and identified a 6.9-fold higher standardised incidence ratio (95% confidence interval 5.6-8.7, P<0.001) of thyroid cancer post renal transplantation as compared with a non-transplant group. All such cancers were of papillary type as far as histopathology was known. The mean time to discovery was 6.0 years post transplantation. This puts thyroid cancer into the group of high cancer risk following solid organ transplantation which already includes cervical cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, oral and lip cancer and haematological malignancies. It is unclear what causes the increased cancer incidence. Inclusion of thyroid ultrasound in long-term post-transplant evaluation may help to ensure timely recognition of this condition.

GSK3β Interactions with Amyloid Genes: An Autopsy Verification and Extension. Glyocogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the phosphorylation of tau. Recent work has suggested that GSK3β also plays a role in the amyloid pathway of AD through genetic interactions with APP and APBB2 on in vivo measures of amyloid. This project extends the previously identified genotype interactions to an autopsy measure of amyloid, while also testing the same interactions leveraging gene expression data quantified in the prefrontal cortex. 797 participants (251 cognitively normal, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 350 Alzheimer's disease) were drawn from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. A mean score of amyloid load was calculated across eight brain regions, gene expression levels from frozen sections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were quantified using RNA amplification, and expression signals were generated using Beadstudio. Three SNPs previously identified in genetic interactions were genotyped using the Illumina 1M genotyping chip. Covariates included age, sex, education, and diagnosis. We were able to evaluate 2 of the 3 previously identified interactions, of which the interaction between GSK3β (rs334543) and APBB2 (rs2585590) was found in this autopsy sample (p = 0.04). We observed a comparable interaction between GSK3β and APBB2 when comparing the highest tertile of gene expression to the lowest tertile, t(1) = -2.03, p = 0.043. These results provide additional evidence of a genetic interaction between GSK3β and APBB2 and further suggest that GSK3β is involved in the pathophysiology of both of the primary neuropathologies of Alzheimer's disease.

Estimation of postmortem interval based on the spectrophotometric analysis of postmortem lividity. The color of postmortem lividity and control skin in 21 adult cadavers whose postmortem interval was within 72h, was measured by spectrophotometry in order to estimate the postmortem interval, objectively. The L *a *b * system, which has been widely used for the digital expression of skin color, was used and linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the postmortem interval and 31 color factors including L * (Value), a * and b * (Chroma and Hue) and C * (Chroma). The difference in Chroma between postmortem lividity and control skin (DeltaC * and DeltaC( *)/C(c)( *)) was only weakly correlated with the postmortem interval. We propose a new equation for calculating the postmortem interval using several color factors obtained by measurement of postmortem lividity, together with some autopsy findings that are known to affect the formation of postmortem lividity. The new equation makes it possible to estimate the postmortem interval within +/-4.76h.

Rapid Detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari in Fresh Chicken Meat and By-Products in Bangkok, Thailand, Using Modified Multiplex PCR. A multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari was developed and validated to assess the occurrence of these bacteria in fresh chicken meat and by-products in Bangkok, Thailand, by using a new combination of four previously published PCR primers for C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari, and a universal 16S rDNA gene as an internal control. The specificity was determined by using 13 strains of other bacteria. With pure culture DNA, the detection limit was 0.017 ng/PCR for C. jejuni and C. coli and was 0.016 ng/PCR for C. lari. It can detect 10 CFU of C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari in 2 g of chicken meat within a 16-h enrichment time. Our multiplex PCR assay was applied for identification of Campylobacter spp. in 122 supermarket samples and 108 fresh market samples. Of the 230 samples evaluated by multiplex PCR, 54.0, 3.3, and 10.7% of supermarket samples were positive for C. jejuni, C. coli, and mixed C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively, and 56.5 and 33.3% of fresh market samples were positive for C. jejuni and mixed C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively. No sample was positive for C. lari. Fresh market samples had significantly higher C. jejuni and C. coli contamination than those from supermarkets (relative risk: 1.3; P = 0.0001). Compared with the culture method (a gold standard), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of multiplex PCR were 97.7, 86.8, 96.1, 92.0, and 95.2%, respectively. No significant difference was observed between results from two methods (P = 0.55). Therefore, the established multiplex PCR was not only rapid and easy to perform but had a high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari, even in samples containing mixed contamination. Our study indicated that fresh chicken meat and by-products from fresh markets were significantly less hygienic than those from supermarkets. 

Alendronate treatment does not inhibit bone formation within biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics in posterolateral spinal fusion: an experimental study in porcine model. Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics has a potential advantage as an osteoconductive matrix and has an optimal resorption rate for bone formation. Using BCP ceramics as a bone graft during spinal fusion requires osteogenesis within the material and subsequent bridging between adjacent vertebrae to provide long-term support. Bisphosphonates have been reported to prolong the process of bone healing. The influence of bisphosphonate treatment on bone formation within BCP ceramics in spinal fusion remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of alendronate on BCP osteogenesis in posterolateral spinal fusion. Posterolateral spinal fusion with pedicle screw fixation was performed at the lumbar spine in twenty-two pigs. BCP ceramics were applied as a bone graft to obtain bone fusion between adjacent transverse processes. Eleven pigs in the treatment group received oral alendronate 10 mg/d for three months postoperatively. Eleven pigs in the control group did not receive treatment with alendronate. All animals underwent posterolateral spinal fusion with BCP ceramics. The fusion rate was evaluated three months after the operation. The fusion rates evaluated by X-ray were 27.3% in the treatment group and 20% in the control group. The fusion rates using histological evaluation were 18.2% in the treatment group and 20% in the control group. The mean volumes of fusion mass were (3.64 +/- 0.86) cm(3) in the treatment group and (4.26 +/- 0.63) cm(3) in the control group. No significant differences were found in either trabecular bone volume or residual BCP volume between treatment and control groups using histological evaluation. The new bone formation within BCP ceramics was greater in the area adjacent to transverse process (P < 0.01). Oral alendronate with a dose of 10 mg daily do not inhibit bone formation within BCP ceramics or affect the fusion rate in posterolateral spinal fusion from porcine models.


Pathophysiology of fibromyalgia.

Sex matters in the establishment of murine tendon composition and material properties during growth. The existence of sex-based differences in tendon and ligament injury rates has led investigators to test the hypothesis that sex plays a significant role in modulating tendon and ligament composition and material properties. To date, no studies have attempted to characterize how such differences develop during the course of normal tissue maturation and growth. Thus, the primary aim of the present study was to use a murine model to test the hypothesis that sex-based differences in the normal age-related development of tendon composition and material properties exist by assessing these parameters in the Achilles and tail tendons from 4-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice. Despite significantly lower levels of total collagen content in females subsequent to sexual maturity (p<0.0001), as well as a significant effect of sex on glycosaminoglycan content (p<0.0001), Achilles tendon elastic modulus was not compromised in females. Female Achilles tendons did exhibit a significantly higher failure strain (p=0.0201) and strain energy density (p=0.0004) than did males, as well as a trend toward higher ultimate strength (p=0.0556). In contrast to the high load-bearing environment of the Achilles tendon site, sex did not have a statistically significant effect on any compositional or material property in the low load-bearing tendon fascicles of the tail. These data support recent studies by others, which suggest that male and female tendons have a differential adaptational response to their local mechanical loading environment.

Developing a Comprehensive Critical Care Orientation Program for Graduate Nurses. In 2014, newly graduated nurses are welcomed and recruited to practice in critical care, and hiring trends in hospitals support a demand for newly graduated nurses. At a 501-bed, quaternary care, academic medical center located in the Rocky Mountain region, an orientation program was formalized to prepare newly graduated nurses for critical care practice. The critical care clinical orientation program presented utilizes a dynamic approach that includes didactic study, case study integration, a clinical staging program, active preceptor development, and care-based simulation exercises. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical orientation program developed in critical care, which augments an accredited New Graduate Nurse Residency Program.

Early diagnosis of dengue in travelers: comparison of a novel real-time RT-PCR, NS1 antigen detection and serology. The increased traveling to dengue endemic regions and the numerous epidemics have led to a rise in imported dengue. The laboratory diagnosis of acute dengue requires several types of tests and often paired samples are needed for obtaining reliable results. Although several diagnostic methods are available, proper comparative data on their performance are lacking. To compare the performance of novel methods including a novel pan-DENV real-time RT-PCR and a commercially available NS1 capture-EIA in regard to IgM detection for optimizing the early diagnosis of DENV in travelers. A panel of 99 selected early phase serum samples of dengue patients was studied by real-time RT-PCR, NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM-EIA, IgG-IFA and cell culture virus isolation. The novel real-time RT-PCR was shown specific and sensitive for detection of DENV-1-4 RNA and suitable for diagnostic use. The diagnostic rate using combination of RNA and IgM detection was 99% and using NS1 and IgM detection 95.9%. The results of RNA and NS1 antigen detection disagreed in 15.5% of samples that had only RNA or NS1 antigen detected. The diagnostic rates of early samples are higher when either RNA or NS1 antigen detection is combined with IgM detection. Besides the differences in the RNA and NS1 detection assays, the observed discrepancy of results could suggest individual variation or differences in timing of these markers in patient serum.

Horizontally-acquired HIV infection in Kenyan and Swazi children. Despite many reports of HIV-infected African children who have HIV-uninfected mothers, little is known about the extent and modes of horizontal HIV transmission in African children. We estimated the extent of horizontal HIV transmission in Swazi children by comparing child and mother HIV statuses in the 2006-2007 Swaziland Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). To identify correlates of horizontal HIV transmission, we conducted a case-control study of Kenyan children with horizontally acquired HIV infections and their uninfected siblings. Of 50 HIV-positive Swazi children in the DHS, 11 (weighted percent = 20, 95% confidence interval 11-33%) had HIV-negative mothers. These 11 children represented 0.6% of all Swazi children aged 2-12 who lived with their mothers. In the Kenyan study, children with horizontally acquired HIV infections had more kinds of blood exposures than their uninfected siblings. In particular, punctures related to health care for suspected malaria (phlebotomy, injection and infusion), injections while hospitalized and dental surgery (especially by informal providers) were more common in infected children. Horizontal HIV transmission appears to be common in some sub-Saharan African countries, and blood exposures seem to be the most likely routes of transmission. Rigorous surveillance and investigation of horizontally acquired HIV infection in children are urgently needed, along with universal public education about risks of specific blood exposures and ways to avoid them.

High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects on Motor Intracortical Neurophysiology: A Sham-Controlled Investigation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus sham stimulation on intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation within the motor cortex. Such data are needed to better understand the presumed neurophysiologic effects of rTMS. The authors hypothesized that, compared with sham stimulation, 20 Hz rTMS will decrease ICI and increase intracortical facilitation in healthy volunteers. Using single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS, the authors evaluated prestimulation and poststimulation effects on motor cortex neurophysiology in neurologically healthy volunteers who received 2,000 stimuli of either 20 Hz rTMS (n = 11) or sham rTMS (n = 8). Primary outcomes were changes in ICI and intracortical facilitation and secondary outcomes were changes in motor threshold and motor evoked potential amplitude, and both were assessed using separate 2 × 2 (group × time) repeated-measures analysis of variance. For ICI, there were main effects of time (P = 0.002) and group (P < 0.001) with a significant group-by-time interaction (P < 0.01). Intracortical inhibition decreased after rTMS, but was unchanged by sham rTMS. Intracortical facilitation results revealed a main effect of group (P = 0.02) and a significant group-by-time interaction (P = 0.048). Intracortical facilitation increased after rTMS and was slightly reduced after sham rTMS. The group-by-time interactions for motor threshold and motor evoked potential amplitude were not significant. High-frequency rTMS significantly influences the excitatory and inhibitory outputs of motor intracortical networks, specifically increasing intracortical facilitation and reducing ICI as compared with sham stimulation. Such changes were observed despite no significant changes in broader measures of motor cortex activation, that is, motor threshold and motor evoked potential amplitude.


Time Course for Onset and Recovery from Effects of a Novel Male Reproductive Toxicant: Implications for Apical Preclinical Study Designs.

Guanylate cyclases and associated activator proteins in retinal disease. Two isoforms of guanylate cyclase, GC1 and GC2 encoded by GUCY2D and GUCY2F, are responsible for the replenishment of cGMP in photoreceptors after exposure to light. Both are required for the normal kinetics of photoreceptor sensitivity and recovery, although disease mutations are restricted to GUCY2D. Recessive mutations in this gene cause the severe early-onset blinding disorder Leber congenital amaurosis whereas dominant mutations result in a later onset less severe cone-rod dystrophy. Cyclase activity is regulated by Ca(2+) which binds to the GC-associated proteins, GCAP1 and GCAP2 encoded by GUCA1A and GUCA1B, respectively. No recessive mutations in either of these genes have been reported. Dominant missense mutations are largely confined to the Ca(2+)-binding EF hands of the proteins. In a similar fashion to the disease mechanism for the dominant GUCY2D mutations, these mutations generally alter the sensitivity of the cyclase to inhibition as Ca(2+) levels rise following a light flash.

Study of the fragmentation pattern of ketamine-heptafluorobutyramide by gas chromatography/electron ionization mass spectrometry. Ketamine is an anaesthetic compound used in human and veterinary medicine with hallucinogen properties that have resulted in its increased illicit use by teenagers at rave parties. Although several gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methods have been reported for the quantification of the drug both in urine and in hair, its electron ionization (EI) fragmentation after derivatization with different reagents has been not yet fully investigated. The present work reports the study of the fragmentation of ketamine, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA-Ket), using gas chromatography/electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS). The complete characterization of the fragmentation pattern represented an intriguing exercise and required tandem mass spectrometry (MS(n)) experiments, high-resolution accurate mass measurements and the use of deuterated d(4)-ketamine to corroborate the proposed structures and to characterize the fragment ions carrying the unchanged aromatic moiety. Extensive fragmentation was observed, mainly located at the cyclohexanone ring followed by rearrangement of the fragment ions, as confirmed by the mass spectra obtained from the deuterated molecule. The GC/EI-MS analysis of HFBA-Ket will represent a useful tool in forensic science since high-throughput analyses are enabled, preserving both the GC stationary phase and the cleanliness of the mass spectrometer ion optics.

New targets for Ph+ leukaemia therapy. The outcome for adults with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) leukaemias (chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) has been dramatically improved with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but progression and/or relapse are still present in the majority of patients. We reviewed recent findings obtained from analysis of BCR-ABL point mutations, gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and characterised by the identification of multiple novel genetic alterations targeting key cellular pathways, including lymphoid differentiation, cell cycle, tumour suppression, apoptosis and drug responsiveness. By GEP analysis, several down/up-expressed genes have been identified. Furthermore, by SNP array analysis, deletions of genes such as IKAROS, PAX5 and CDKN2A-CDKN2B were frequently identified. New therapeutic approaches with novel TKIs are now available. Dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are now in clinical development. Some emerging aurora kinase inhibitors, such as VX-680, PHA-739358, MK-0457 and AS703569, and Smo1 and Hedgehog (Hh) inhibitors promise clinical efficacy against the Bcr-Ab T315I mutant form and leukaemia stem cells, respectively. In this review, we highlight the most promising drugs for the treatment of adult BCR-ABL-positive leukaemias.

Diagnostic pediatric computed tomographic scans of the head: actual dosage versus estimated risk. Recent publications have implicated computed tomographic scans in the genesis of cancer and developmental delay. To determine whether the imaging protocols used in the authors' craniofacial practice could be harmful, they reviewed patient radiation exposure data for 77 patients. They then reviewed the literature concerning the documented effects of low linear energy transfer received during radiation and the application of the linear no-threshold hypothesis. This is a retrospective single-institution analysis of the senior surgeon's (A.D.) patients who underwent computed tomographic scanning of the head and face. Patient data from the years 2001 through the first half of 2008 were reviewed and the authors evaluated those who had radiation dose reports for each computed tomographic examination. Newly diagnosed craniosynostosis patients underwent an average of 1.74 computed tomographic scans per year at an average dose of approximately 1.39 mSv. Syndromic patients had a higher total number of studies when compared with nonsyndromic patients (9.73 versus 4.11). In comparison with published data, the level of radiation received by the authors' patients for computed tomographic scans of the head was 100 to 1000 times less than those levels shown to increase carcinogenesis, and nearly 40 times less than that shown to purportedly affect development and cognition. The authors suggest that published experimental evidence does not support the linear no-threshold model at low linear energy transfer levels similar to the exposure of their patients undergoing computed tomographic scans of the head. In addition, no convincing epidemiologic data exist demonstrating an increase in cancer incidence for doses below 100 mSv.

Simple method for determining the need for sternotomy/manubriotomy with the anterior approach to the cervicothoracic junction. Frequently, the cervicothoracic junction can be reached through a simple anterior approach. In some cases, access to this region requires a much more aggressive surgical intervention, such as manubriotomy or sternotomy. Information regarding the need for such interventions is particularly useful to have preoperatively to guide surgical planning as well as discussions regarding surgical risks and expected morbidities. Whereas methods utilizing magnetic resonance imaging have been proposed for determining the lowest level that can be accessed through a simple low cervical approach, we describe a simple technique using sagittal computed tomographic imaging. Our technique does not require any complex geometry and has given us very consistent results. Computed tomographic sagittal reconstruction of the cervical and upper thoracic spine that includes the entire sternum is obtained. The lowest accessible disc space is determined by a straight line passing through and parallel to the disc space that also passes above the manubrium (the intervertebral disc line). Sagittal computed tomographic reconstructions obtained from 50 adult patients were reviewed, and the lowest disc space accessible from an anterior low cervical approach was determined. The most common accessible level was T1-T2 (23 patients), followed by C7-T1 (13 patients), T2-T3 (10 patients), and C6-C7 (4 patients). A 35-year-old man with T2-T3 compression fractures with kyphotic deformity was treated with T2 and T3 vertebrectomies and T1-T4 fusion through an anterior approach. We propose a simple and consistent method for determining the need for manubriotomy or sternotomy for anterior approaches to the cervicothoracic junction.


Aliphatic hyperbranched polyester: a new building block in the construction of multifunctional nanoparticles and nanocomposites.

Childhood abuse uncovered in a palliative care audit. This article aims to highlight potentially high levels of childhood sexual abuse within Cancer and Palliative Care Service users. During a routine audit, data was collated to quantify a perceived high level of disclosure of pre-existing psychological trauma within the palliative care caseload of a Macmillan Children and Families Therapist. Families comprised adults (generally parents or step-parents), one of whom was terminally ill or recently deceased who had direct responsibility for children and young people aged under 20 years old. Each family had at least two members using the service for advice, emotional support or counselling. A childhood sexual abuse rate of 33% for women and 10% for men was revealed. Of 59 families, 49% had one or more members who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In addition a further 9% of adults had experienced severe physical and emotional abuse in childhood. Many families had faced multiple trauma. Palliative care clinicians have access to detailed personal and family history during a highly vulnerable transition. While confidentiality is paramount it is essential to develop better data collection methods and raise the profile of childhood sexual abuse as a major contributing factor to morbidity. A whole family assessment is crucial to ensure child protection and emotional care for children facing the loss and subsequently bereaved of a parent or a carer. Clinicians must be able to offer a range of approaches which provide distressed patients with a history of childhood abuse some sense of emotional containment at the end of life, a challenge which cannot be overstated.

An epileptic seizures detection algorithm based on the empirical mode decomposition of EEG. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects around 50 million people worldwide. The seizure detection is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was proposed on the development of an automatic epileptic seizure detection algorithm. The algorithm first computes the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of EEG records, then calculates the energy of each IMF and performs the detection based on an energy threshold and a minimum duration decision. The algorithm was tested in 9 invasive EEG records provided and validated by the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg. In 90 segments analyzed (39 with epileptic seizures) the sensitivity and specificity obtained with the method were of 56.41% and 75.86% respectively. It could be concluded that EMD is a promissory method for epileptic seizure detection in EEG records.


Proteomic analysis of the murine liver in response to a combined exposure to psychological stress and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene.

Eutigoside C attenuates radiation-induced crypt injury in the mouse intestine. On Jeju Island, South Korea, the leaves of Eurya emarginata have been traditionally used to treat ulcers or as a diuretic. Eutigoside C isolated from the leaves has been reported to have in vitro anti-inflammatory effects. We evaluated the radioprotective effects of eutigoside C on jejunal cell apoptosis and crypt survival in mice subjected to gamma irradiation. In addition, the ability of eutigoside C to protect against radiation-induced oxidative stress was examined by evaluating the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in radiation-induced hepatic injury. Eutigoside C was administered intraperitoneally at 48, 12, and 1 h before irradiation. The administration of eutigoside C (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight) before irradiation protected the intestinal crypts from radiation-induced apoptosis (p < 0.05), and attenuated radiation-induced decrease of villous height (p < 0.05). Pretreating mice prior to irradiation with eutigoside C (100 mg/kg) significantly improved the survival of the jejunal crypt (p < 0.01). The dose reduction factor was 1.09 at 3.5 days after irradiation. Treatment of eutigoside C prior to irradiation significantly protected SOD and CAT activities in radiation-induced hepatic injury (p < 0.05). These results suggest that eutigoside C is a useful radioprotector capable of defending intestinal progenitor cells against indirect depletion, such as oxidative stress and inflammatory response caused by gamma irradiation.

Increased thrombin generation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A pilot study on the effect of metformin and oral contraceptives.

[Primary study on the effects of high-salt diet on the myocardium and the related mechanisms]. The study was to evaluate the effects of high-salt diet on the blood pressure and myocardium in Sprague-Dawley rats and to investigate the related mechanisms. Rat model of high-salt diet was established by receiving standard rat chow with salt concentration of 0.3% and additional salt load via the drinking water (1% sodium chloride solution). Systolic blood pressure was measured by The indirect tail-cuff method in the rats on high-salt and normal-salt diet. The rats were placed in metabolic cages. Food intake and urine volume were recorded. The sodium and chloride in plasma and urine were measured. Transthoracic echocardiographic studies were performed at the eighth week with an echocardiographic system. The pathological variations of the myocardium were observed by the electron microscopy. The p22phox and p47phox mRNA expressions were analyzed by real time RT-PCR. The p22phox and p47phox protein expressions were analyzed by Western blot. The NADPH oxidase activity of myocardium and the serum 8-isoprostane levels were measured. Left ventricular hypertrophy (all P < 0.05) and the decreased diastolic function of left ventricle without significantly elevated blood pressure [(128 +/- 4) mm Hg versus (125 +/- 3) mm Hg in controls, P > 0.05] were found in the rats on high-salt diet, compared to those in the rats on normal-salt diet. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expressions of the p22phox and p47phox, and the NADPH oxidase activity of myocardium were increased [(0.332 +/- 0.015) micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) versus (0.142 +/- 0.023) micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) in controls, P <0.05]. Serum 8-isoprostane levels [(1117 +/- 86) pg/ml versus (327 +/- 80) pg/ml in controls, P < 0.05] were also significantly increased in the rats on high-salt diet. High-salt diet might lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and the decreased diastolic function of left ventricle through oxidative stress without significantly elevated blood pressure.

Environmental factors associated with the malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus in Kenya. The Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus mosquito species complexes are the primary vectors of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. To better understand the environmental factors influencing these species, the abundance, distribution and transmission data from a south-eastern Kenyan study were retrospectively analysed, and the climate, vegetation and elevation data in key locations compared. Thirty villages in Malindi, Kilifi and Kwale Districts with data on An. gambiae sensu strict, Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus entomological inoculation rates (EIRs), were used as focal points for spatial and environmental analyses. Transmission patterns were examined for spatial autocorrelation using the Moran's I statistic, and for the clustering of high or low EIR values using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Environmental data were derived from remote-sensed satellite sources of precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and elevation. The relationship between transmission and environmental measures was examined using bivariate correlations, and by comparing environmental means between locations of high and low clustering using the Mann-Whitney U test. Spatial analyses indicated positive autocorrelation of An. arabiensis and An. funestus transmission, but not of An. gambiae s.s., which was found to be widespread across the study region. The spatial clustering of high EIR values for An. arabiensis was confined to the lowland areas of Malindi, and for An. funestus to the southern districts of Kilifi and Kwale. Overall, An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis had similar spatial and environmental trends, with higher transmission associated with higher precipitation, but lower temperature, humidity and NDVI measures than those locations with lower transmission by these species and/or in locations where transmission by An. funestus was high. Statistical comparisons indicated that precipitation and temperatures were significantly different between the An. arabiensis and An. funestus high and low transmission locations. These finding suggest that the abundance, distribution and malaria transmission of different malaria vectors are driven by different environmental factors. A better understanding of the specific ecological parameters of each malaria mosquito species will help define their current distributions, and how they may currently and prospectively be affected by climate change, interventions and other factors.

Socioeconomic disparity in healthcare-seeking behavior among Chinese Women with genitourinary symptoms. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are of growing concern in China. Understanding the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and healthcare-seeking (HCS) behavior will help design effective policies to contain the epidemic of STIs across SES. We used the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey, a nationally representative survey of 3813 adults from 48 Chinese cities and counties during 1999-2000. We studied the 730 women with at least one genitourinary (GU) symptom. HCS was measured by whether respondents visited a hospital or an unrecognized clinic, self-treatment, or doing nothing. Formal treatment was defined as visiting a hospital. SES was measured by income (tertile group) and education (< or =primary school, junior high school, senior high school, college or above). Bivariate tests and logistic regressions were applied. There was a significantly positive relationship among income, education, and treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) of medium and high income were 2.01 (p = 0.04) and 1.39 (p = 0.46), respectively, after controlling demographics. ORs of middle school, high school, and college or above were 1.81 (p = 0.05), 2.27 (p = 0.03), and 1.27 (p = 0.64), respectively. The relationship between income and formal treatment was also positive, and the relationship between education and formal treatment was negative. Additional adjustment for STI knowledge and experience reduced the HCS disparity across education. Income and education have different effects on HCS behavior among Chinese women with GU symptoms. Income may affect HCS via affordability, and education is a complicated proxy for sex education, STI knowledge, and experience that will affect the socioeconomic disparity in HCS.

Plaque control effectiveness and handling of interdental brushes during multibracket treatment--a randomized clinical trial. The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare the plaque control effectiveness and handling of an interdental brush with a short curved handle and a triangular cross-section of the brush head (IDB) and an interdental brush with a long straight handle in combination with a monotufted brush head (MTB). In a split-mouth design, 110 multibracket patients were randomly assigned to group A using the MTB in the first and third quadrants and the IDB in the second and fourth quadrants or to group B who proceeded the other way around. A crossover was performed after 3 months. The plaque index (PI) was scored every 6 weeks for a period of 24 weeks, and handling was evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS). Wilcoxon tests were used to determine differences in PI and VAS scores between the two brushes and for PI differences between the different observation periods. Differences concerning personal preference and perceived cleaning efficacy were analysed with chi-square tests. The significance levels used were P < 0.001 and P < 0.01. The PI decreased significantly, but no statistically significant difference was found between the two brushes. Subjects experienced less pain and reported better access behind the archwire with the IDB. The use of an interdental brush reduced the PI irrespective of the design of the brush head. In direct comparison, adolescent patients preferred the IDB. Further trials are required to investigate the effectiveness of the IDB in reducing decalcification during orthodontic treatment.

Mathematical modeling of a tethered bilayer sensor containing gramicidin A ion channels. This paper considers the mathematical modeling of chemical kinetics and electrical dynamics of a tethered bilayer biosensor, comprising of Gramicidin A (gA) ion channels. The electrical dynamics of the biosensor are modeled by an equivalent second order linear system. The chemical kinetics of the biosensor, which involve the binding of analyte to the receptor sites immobilized on the biosensor surface, are modeled in both the reaction-rate-limited regime, where analyte concentration is constant through out the biosensor flow chamber, and the mass transport influenced region, where the analyte concentration is subject to variations in time and space. Using the theory of Singular Perturbation, we show that the channel conductance varies according to one of three possible modes depending on the analyte concentration present.

Adequate histologic sampling of breast magnetic resonance imaging-guided core needle biopsy. -The increasing use of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast as a valuable adjunct to mammography and ultrasound in the detection of breast lesions, in association with needle core biopsy taken from the suspicious areas, has major workload implications for histopathology laboratories wherever breast MRI is practiced. -To establish the number of histologic levels necessary for the evaluation of breast MRI-guided needle core biopsy specimens taken from suspicious areas on breast MRI examination. -Retrospective histologic review of a series of breast MRI-guided core needle biopsies, initially examined routinely at 4 levels, in the Pathology Department at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, New York. -Accurate diagnostic classification was possible after examination of the first level in 95.4% of cases. For a small group of patients (4.4%), 4 levels were considered to provide additional useful information, although this information did not alter the diagnosis. In only a single case (0.2%) was it likely that routine examination of 4 levels could have led to an incidental finding of a very small intraductal papilloma (0.15 cm) present only at the second histologic level. However, this incidental finding would have not changed the patient outcome. -Needle core biopsies for MRI-detected abnormalities should be routinely examined at only 1 level. Further levels may be needed in occasional cases to identify more conclusively an associated pathologic abnormality and may be of particular value when assessing atypical intraductal proliferative epithelial lesions.

Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture. Agricultural food production and agriculturally-related change in land use substantially contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide. Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector. Although livestock products are a source of some essential nutrients, they provide large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We considered potential strategies for the agricultural sector to meet the target recommended by the UK Committee on Climate Change to reduce UK emissions from the concentrations recorded in 1990 by 80% by 2050, which would require a 50% reduction by 2030. With use of the UK as a case study, we identified that a combination of agricultural technological improvements and a 30% reduction in livestock production would be needed to meet this target; in the absence of good emissions data from Brazil, we assumed for illustrative purposes that the required reductions would be the same for our second case study in São Paulo city. We then used these data to model the potential benefits of reduced consumption of livestock products on the burden of ischaemic heart disease: disease burden would decrease by about 15% in the UK (equivalent to 2850 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] per million population in 1 year) and 16% in São Paulo city (equivalent to 2180 DALYs per million population in 1 year). Although likely to yield benefits to health, such a strategy will probably encounter cultural, political, and commercial resistance, and face technical challenges. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed across agricultural, nutritional, public health, and climate change communities worldwide to provide affordable, healthy, low-emission diets for all societies.

Association between serum alkaline phosphatase and C-reactive protein in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a widely used marker for skeletal and hepatobiliary disorders, but its activity is also increased in atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease. It is an inflammatory marker like C-reactive protein (CRP). We therefore analyzed its relationship with CRP in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006. The analysis included 4155 men and non-pregnant women over the age of 20 years. The relationship between log-transformed ALP and plasma CRP was analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. ALP activity was significantly correlated with age, waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, exercise, alcohol, triglycerides, and other liver enzymes after adjusting for age, gender and ethnicity (p<0.001). ALP was significantly associated with a higher frequency of cardiovascular disease (p=0.02), hypertension (p=0.01) hypercholesterolemia (p=0.04), and diabetes (p=0.02). Compared to the lowest quartile of ALP, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) associated with the highest quartile were 1.9 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.1-3.5], 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.5), 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.1) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.4) for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, respectively. In multivariate analysis, log ALP was an independent predictor of log CRP (p=1.0x10(-6)). A multivariate model that included log ALP, ethnicity, glycohemoglobin, waist circumference, albumin, apolipoprotein B, gamma-glutamyltransferase and uric acid explained 40% of the variance in log CRP. ALP is a marker of cardiometabolic risk, but it needs to be tested as part of a multivariate model in prospective studies.

Antimüllerian hormone: prediction of cumulative live birth in gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist treatment for in vitro fertilization. To assess the accuracy of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) in predicting cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) within 1 year after treatment initiation in GnRH antagonist treatment cycles for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Observational (retrospective) substudy as part of an ongoing prospective cohort study. University medical center. A total of 487 patients scheduled for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Patients starting their first IVF/ICSI cycle with 150 or 225 IU recombinant FSH and GnRH antagonist cotreatment were included. Serum samples collected before the first IVF treatment were used to determine AMH. Treatment data after treatment initiation for a maximum of 1 year were recorded. Prediction of CLBR with the use of AMH. The model for predicting CLBR within 1 year included age at first treatment, AMH, type of infertility, and previous assisted reproductive technology treatment leading to live birth. The accuracy in discriminating between women who did or did not achieve a live birth was only 59%. AMH had intermediate added value in the prediction of CLBR as demonstrated by the net reclassification improvement (total 29.8). A nomogram based on age and AMH was developed by which a subgroup of patients could be identified with the poorest pregnancy prospects. The predictive accuracy of AMH for 1-year CLBR in GnRH antagonist treatment cycles was limited and did not yield much additional value on top of age. Withholding treatment based on predictors such as age and AMH, or a combination, remains problematic. www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02309073.

Pulmonary mechanics: a system identification perspective. The mechanical properties of the lungs are important determinants of its ability to function properly, and may become severely compromised in disease. Being able to assess lung mechanical function is thus crucial to the diagnosis of many lung diseases and for following the progress of therapy. Assessing lung mechanical function is essentially an exercise in system identification, whereby measurements of pressures and flows made at certain sites are linked in terms of mathematical models. Most often, the lung is assumed to function as a linear dynamic system, allowing determination of its input impedance over a range of frequencies. In mice, for example, impedance is frequently determined between 1 and 20 Hz. The interpretation of impedance in physiological terms is central to its utility as a diagnostic tool, and is best done with reference to a suitable mathematical model. Currently, the most widely used model for animal studies of lung disease consists of a single flow-resistive airway serving a uniformly ventilated alveolar region surrounded by tissue having a constant-phase impedance. This model has also been employed in human studies, and allows the mechanical properties of the lungs to be subdivided into those reflecting the conducting airway tree and those due to the behavior of the lung periphery. The parameters of this model have been shown in animals to change characteristically following interventions that mimic human pathologies such as asthma and acute lung injury. Furthermore, these changing parameter values can be linked to specific physical processes occurring within the lungs.

[Portal vein flow rate used as a early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization]. To evaluate the predictive value of portal vein flow rate preoperative for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after periesophagastric devascularization in hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension. From January 2007 to July 2008, 45 patients with portal hypertension caused by hepatitis B cirrhosis were performed splenectomy with peri-esophagogastric devascularization in the same medical group in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The portal vein flow rate and the diameter of portal vein were measured with doppler sonography respectively before and after the operation. At the same time, the level of PT and PLT were detected. The weight of spleens were measured after operation. Thirteen cases suffered from PVT postoperatively. Portal vein flow rate was significantly lower in patients with PVT postoperation than that in patients without PVT (P < 0.01). In patients with PVT (n = 13) postoperation, the preoperative portal vein flow rate was (19.5 +/- 5.3) cm/s. Among the 13 cases, there were 12 cases whose flow rate were lower than 25 cm/s, and 1 case whose flow rate was 32. 3 cm/s; In patients without PVT (n = 32), the preoperative portal vein flow rate was (9.6 +/- 8.0) cm/s. In patients with lower rate (n = 17), the incidence rate of PVT was 70.6%; in patients with higher rate (n = 28), the incidence rate of PVT was 3.6%. The incidence rate of PVT in patients with lower rate was significantly lower than patients with higher rate (P < 0.01). The diameter of portal vein in patients with PVT was significantly wider than patients without PVT. The diameter of portal vein was negative correlative with the portal vein flow rate. The value 25 cm/s was of diagnostic efficiency, the sensitivity was 92.3%, and specificity was 70.6%. The portal vein flow rate preoperative can be used as an early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization in hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension to give a guide to clinical work.

Diabetes, Nutrition, and Exercise. Aging is associated with body composition changes that lead to glucose intolerance and increased risk of diabetes. The incidence of diabetes increases with aging, and the prevalence has increased because of the increased life expectancy of the population. Lifestyle modifications through nutrition and exercise in combination with medications are the main components of diabetes management. The potential benefits of nutrition and exercise intervention in older people with diabetes are enormous. Nutrition and exercise training are feasible even in frail older people living in care homes and should take into consideration individual circumstances, cultural factors, and ethnic preferences. 


[Relationship of Chinese medicine syndrome with endothelium-dependent vasodilatation function and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with hypertensive disease].

Risedronate on 2 consecutive days a month reduced vertebral fracture risk at 1year compared with historical placebo. The use of historical controls may be a viable alternative for comparing antifracture efficacy in osteoporosis fracture endpoint trials that do not have a placebo control group. The risedronate 2 consecutive days a month (2CDM) study showed that risedronate 75mg on 2 consecutive days had similar increases in bone mineral density compared with risedronate 5mg/d. To assess the antifracture efficacy of this regimen, data collected in the 2CDM study were analyzed using historical control data matched for key clinical characteristics from 2 placebo-controlled trials. Fracture rates in historical groups were compared with those of the 2CDM study treatment groups. At 12mo, vertebral fractures occurred in 5.1% and 1.0% of the placebo and 5-mg risedronate historical patients, respectively. In the risedronate 5mg/d and 75mg 2CDM groups, fracture incidence was 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Based on comparisons with the historical control group, risedronate 75mg 2CDM appears as effective as the 5-mg/d dose in reducing the risk of new vertebral fractures in the first year of treatment. The use of appropriate historical control data may provide an alternative design to assess fracture effects in osteoporosis trials for which simultaneous placebo-controlled data are unavailable.

Cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in the elderly: comparative diagnostic findings. Patients suspected of having cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis are diagnosed using investigations such as fine needle aspiration cytology and the polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, these investigations are intended for primary tuberculosis infection. The majority of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases in the elderly are thought to be caused by reactivation. The aims of this study were (1) to examine the efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology, polymerase chain reaction and blood tests in the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis caused by reactivation, and (2) to clarify any differences when compared with primarily infected cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases. Thirty-three elderly patients with neck lumps underwent excisional biopsy from 2003 to 2008. The efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology was examined by comparing the results of excisional biopsy with those of fine needle aspiration cytology performed at the initial medical examination for cases of suspected tuberculous disease. Furthermore, the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration were compared for cases of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis versus cases of malignant lymphoma. Although nine cases were diagnosed with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis using excisional biopsy, only one of these had been suspected based on fine needle aspiration cytology results. Three cases with tuberculous lymphadenitis were suspected of having malignant lymphoma on initial examination. There was no significant difference in the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration, comparing cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis versus malignant lymphoma. Unlike the primary infection often seen in endemic areas, the diagnosis of early stage tuberculous lymphadenitis of the swelling type caused by reactivation in elderly people is difficult to confirm unless excisional biopsy is performed. In elderly patients with neck lumps, cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included in the differential diagnosis.

Novel nano-composite biomaterials that respond to light. Composites of nanoparticles and polymers are finding wide applications to alter material properties, conductivity, and utility. Here, we show that nano-composites can be designed to heat in the presence of near infrared light. This process is useful in transitioning materials through a transition temperature for a range of applications. For example, shape-memory materials (including polymers, metals, and ceramics) are those that are processed into a temporary shape and respond to some external stimuli (e.g., temperature) to undergo a transition back to a permanent shape and may be useful in a range of applications from aerospace to fabrics, to biomedical devices and microsystem components. In this work, we formulated composites of gold nanorods (<1% by volume) and biodegradable networks, where exposure to infrared light induced heating and consequently, shape transitions. The heating is repeatable and tunable based on nanorod concentration and light intensity.

Chemical composition and phytotoxic effects of essential oils of Salvia hierosolymitana Boiss. and Salvia multicaulis Vahl. var. simplicifolia Boiss. growing wild in Lebanon. The chemical composition of the essential oils of S. hierosolymitana Boiss. and S. multicaulis Vahl. var. simplicifolia Boiss. collected in Lebanon was studied by means of GC and GC-MS analysis. In all 115 compounds were identified: 82 for S hierosolymitana and 72 for S. multicaulis var. simplicifolia. The presence of carbonylic compounds (17%) characterizes the oil from S. hierosolymitana,while S. multicaulis var. simplicifolia oil is rich of monoterpenes (34.5%) and sesquiterpenes (46.9%). The effects of the essential oils on germination and initial radical elongation of Raphanus sativus L. (radish) and Lepidium sativum L. (garden cress) were studied, indicating in a different activity against radical elongation of the species tested.

Neonatal seizures: an update on mechanisms and management. The lifespan risk of seizures is highest in the neonatal period. Current therapies have limited efficacy. Although the treatment of neonatal seizures has not changed significantly in the last several decades, there has been substantial progress in understanding developmental mechanisms that influence seizure generation and responsiveness to anticonvulsants. This article provides an overview of current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal seizures, and some of the recent insights about the pathophysiology of neonatal seizures that may provide the foundation for better treatment are identified.

Geochemical fractions of rare earth elements in soil around a mine tailing in Baotou, China. Rare earth mine tailing dumps are environmental hazards because tailing easily leaches and erodes by water and wind. To assess the influence of mine tailing on the geochemical behavior of rare earth elements (REEs) in soil, sixty-seven surface soil samples and three soil profile samples were collected from different locations near China's largest rare earth mine tailing. The total concentration of REEs in surface soils ranged from 156 to 5.65 × 10(4) mg·kg(-1) with an average value of 4.67 × 10(3) mg·kg(-1), which was significantly higher than the average value in China (181 mg·kg(-1)). We found obvious fractionation of both light and heavy REEs, which was supported by the North American Shale Composite (NASC) and the Post-Archean Average Australian Shale (PAAS) normalized concentration ratios calculated for selected elements (La(N)/Yb(N), La(N)/Sm(N) and Gd(N)/Yb(N)). A slightly positive Ce anomaly and a negative Eu anomaly were also found. For all 14 REEs in soils, enrichment was intensified by the mine tailing sources and influenced by the prevailing wind.

Pathology in dogs with experimental canine H3N2 influenza virus infection. Avian-lineage H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV)-associated respiratory disease, which can be fatal, emerged in South Korean dogs in 2007. We show here that dogs experimentally infected with CIV only developed respiratory tract diseases, as no extrapulmonary lesions and virus antigens were detected. This differs from the multiorgan diseases that avian influenza H5N1 induces in small experimental animals. However, the CIV-infected dogs developed a distinctively severe, long-persistent bronchointerstitial pneumonia, which differs from the acute but short-term bronchopneumonia that human (H1N1 and H3N2) influenza cause in rodents and ferrets. Histopathology and in situ TUNEL assays revealed that the neutrophils infiltrating the lesions were undergoing apoptosis, which probably reflects the attempts by the body to maintain appropriate numbers of neutrophils for defense against secondary bacterial infections. Our observations suggest that neutrophils along with the related chemoattractant cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-8, etc.) may play a key role in the pathogenesis of H3N2 CIV in dogs.

[Oral health among institutionalized elderly in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil]. This study assessed the oral health of the institutionalized elderly in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. A sample of 335 individuals over 60 years of age was randomly selected. Data were collected through interviews, review of medical records, and clinical examination by a single researcher. Oral health was evaluated in terms of oral hygiene, caries, and periodontal disease. Bacterial plaque was present on 76% of the dental surfaces, and 57% of the elderly using upper dentures presented plaque on at least one of its surfaces. DMF-T index was 30.8, with the missing component representing 94.2%. Missing sextant was the worst periodontal finding in 78.2% of the elderly. Among the valid sextants, there was a higher prevalence of 4 to 5mm periodontal pocket and attachment loss from 4 to 5mm (47%). According to the findings, institutionalized elderly suffer from precarious oral health, with deficient oral hygiene, high caries rate, tooth loss, and periodontal pocket.

Prostaglandin-D synthetase induces transcription of the LH beta subunit in the primary culture of chicken anterior pituitary cells via the PPAR signaling pathway. Downstream effects of prostaglandin-D synthetase (PGDS) in a primary culture of chicken (Gallus gallus) anterior pituitary cells were investigated to study how PGDS regulated laying in hens. Either PGDS downstream metabolite, PGD(2) or PGJ(2), elevated LHB mRNA and LHB protein levels in dose- and time-dependent manners, and treatment with arachidonic acid (1 microM) alone upregulated 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15-d-PGJ(2); derived from PGJ(2))/PGJ(2), LHB mRNA, and LHB protein levels (P<0.05) in the primary culture of chicken pituitary anterior cells. Transfection of the plasmid Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein-PGDS plasmid into these cells in medium containing 1 microM arachidonic acid additionally increased 15-d-PGJ(2)/PGJ(2), LHB mRNA, and LHB protein levels (P<0.05). In the hypothalamus/pituitary gland of laying hens, there was a high correlation (r=0.64; P<0.05) between PGDS and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor A (PPARA) mRNA level in a high egg production strain, the L2 Taiwan country chickens. In commercial Single-Comb White Leghorn layers, there were high correlation coefficients between PGDS and PPARA (r=0.65; P<0.05) and between PGDS and PPARG (r=0.67; P<0.01) mRNA levels. A broad-range PPARs agonist, GW9578 (5 to 500 nM), enhanced LHB mRNA and LHB protein levels (P<0.05). The PPARA-specific (GW6471) and PPARG-specific (T0070907) antagonists suppressed endogenous LHB mRNA and LHB protein levels (P<0.05); in addition, both antagonists attenuated arachidonic acid-induced LHB mRNA levels (P<0.05) and PGDS-induced (in the presence of 1 microM arachidonic acid) LHB mRNA and LHB protein (P<0.05) levels in the primary culture of chicken anterior pituitary cells. Higher LHB mRNA/LHB protein ratios in PGD(2)-, PGJ(2)-, arachidonic acid-, PGDS-, and GW9578-induced as well as GW6471- and T0070907-suppressed anterior pituitary cells suggested that LHB transcription occurred before translation. In conclusion, PGDS induced LHB transcription and subsequent translation via the PPAR signaling pathway.

PRC2 inhibition counteracts the culture-associated loss of engraftment potential of human cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (CB-HSCs) are an outstanding source for transplantation approaches. However, the amount of cells per donor is limited and culture expansion of CB-HSCs is accompanied by a loss of engraftment potential. In order to analyze the molecular mechanisms leading to this impaired potential we profiled global and local epigenotypes during the expansion of human CB hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs). Human CB-derived CD34+ cells were cultured in serum-free medium together with SCF, TPO, FGF, with or without Igfbp2 and Angptl5 (STF/STFIA cocktails). As compared to the STF cocktail, the STFIA cocktail maintains in vivo repopulation capacity of cultured CD34+ cells. Upon expansion, CD34+ cells genome-wide remodel their epigenotype and depending on the cytokine cocktail, cells show different H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels. Expanding cells without Igfbp2 and Angptl5 leads to higher global H3K27me3 levels. ChIPseq analyses reveal a cytokine cocktail-dependent redistribution of H3K27me3 profiles. Inhibition of the PRC2 component EZH2 counteracts the culture-associated loss of NOD scid gamma (NSG) engraftment potential. Collectively, our data reveal chromatin dynamics that underlie the culture-associated loss of engraftment potential. We identify PRC2 component EZH2 as being involved in the loss of engraftment potential during the in vitro expansion of HPSCs. 

Outcomes after arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair. Although a number of reports have documented outcomes after open revision rotator cuff repair, there are few studies reporting results after arthroscopic revision. Arthroscopic repair of failed rotator cuff results in significant improvement in shoulder functional outcome and pain relief. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Multiple variables including demographic data, the number of prior ipsilateral shoulder surgeries, and tear size were recorded from chart review. An independent examiner then measured shoulder strength, range of motion, and shoulder functional outcome scores including American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog pain scale. Paired t tests were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative measures. Additionally, contingency table analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for failure of repair requiring further surgery and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score less than 50. Fifty-four patients (88.5%) were available for follow-up evaluation with a mean age of 54.9 +/- 10.1 years (range, 22.7-82.5 years) and a mean follow-up of 31.1 +/- 11.9 months. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved from 43.8 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) before revision to 68.1 +/- 7.2 at final follow-up (P = .0039). The Simple Shoulder Test improved significantly from 3.56 +/- 0.8 before surgery to 7.5 +/- 1.1 at most recent follow-up (P < .0001). Visual analog pain scale scores improved from 5.17 +/- 0.8 to 2.75 +/- 0.8 (P = .03), and forward elevation increased from 121.0 degrees +/- 12.3 degrees to 136 degrees +/- 11.8 degrees postoperatively (P = .025). Greater than 1 prior shoulder surgery was associated with cases that required additional surgery (P = .031). Female gender (P = .007) and preoperative abduction less than 90 masculine (P = .009) were associated with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores less than 50. Arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair may be a reasonable treatment option even after prior open repairs and provides both improved pain relief and shoulder function. Nonetheless, results are not completely optimal. Female patients and those who have undergone more than 1 ipsilateral shoulder surgery are at increased risk for poorer results.

Optimizing cardiac resuscitation outcomes using wavelet analysis. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most lethal of cardiac arrhythmias that leads to sudden cardiac death if untreated within minutes of its occurrence. Defibrillation using electric shock resets the heart to return to spontaneous circulation (ROSC) state, however the success of which depends on various factors such as the viability of myocardium and the time lag between the onset of VF to defibrillation. Recent studies have reported that performing cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) procedure prior to applying shock increases the survival rate especially when VF is untreated for more than 5 minutes. Considering the limited time within which the VF has to be treated for better survival rates, the choice of the right therapy (shock parameters, shock first or CPR first, drug administration) is vital. In aiding this choice, it would be of immense help for emergency medical staff (EMS) if an objective feedback could be provided at near real-time rate on the VF characteristics and its relation to the shock outcomes. Existing works in the literature have demonstrated correlation between the characteristics of the VF waveform and the outcome (ROSC) of the defibrillation. The proposed work improves on this by attempting to arrive at a near real-time monitoring tool in aiding the EMS staff. Using data collected from 16 pigs during VF, the proposed wavelet methodology achieved an overall accuracy of 94% in successfully predicting the shock outcomes.

Decreased serum prolidase activity and increased oxidative stress in early pregnancy loss. To compare the levels of serum prolidase activity and oxidative stress markers including total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and total free sulfhydryl (-SH) in healthy pregnant women without early pregnancy loss (EPL) and women with EPL. Serum samples were obtained from 45 healthy first-trimester pregnancies and 45 pregnancies complicated with EPL. We have measured serum prolidase activity, TAC, TOS, -SH and LOOH levels spectrophotometrically. Serum prolidase, TAC and -SH levels were significantly lower in the women with EPL than in the women without EPL (p <0.001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas TOS and LOOH levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001, p = 0.004, respectively). Prolidase activity was negatively correlated with TOS and LOOH levels (r = -0.299, p = 0.004; r = -0.323, p = 0.002, respectively), while positively correlated with TAC and -SH levels (r = 0.232, p = 0.028, and r = 0.418, p <0.001, respectively) Findings of this study have shown that serum prolidase activity and oxidative stress are significantly associated with the presence of EPL, and the correlation between serum prolidase activity and the markers of oxidative stress was reflected in increased serum TOS and LOOH levels and decreased serum TAC and -SH levels.

Research advances in microneme protein 3 of Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite. It has extensive host populations and is prevalent globally; T. gondii infection can cause a zoonotic parasitic disease. Microneme protein 3 (MIC3) is a secreted protein that is expressed in all stages of the T. gondii life cycle. It has strong immunoreactivity and plays an important role in the recognition, adhesion and invasion of host cells by T. gondii. This article reviews the molecular structure of MIC3, its role in the invasion of host cells by parasites, its relationship with parasite virulence, and its induction of immune protection to lay a solid foundation for an in-depth study of potential diagnostic agents and vaccines for preventing toxoplasmosis. 

Alzheimer's mechanisms in ischemic brain degeneration. There is increasing evidence for influence of Alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology on ischemic brain injury. This review investigates the relationships between beta-amyloid peptide, apolipoproteins, presenilins, tau protein, alpha-synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal survival/death decisions in brain following ischemic episode. The interactions of these molecules and influence on beta-amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to ischemic brain degeneration and finally to dementia are reviewed. Generation and deposition of beta-amyloid peptide and tau protein pathology are important key players involved in mechanisms in ischemic neurodegeneration as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence suggests that inflammatory process represents next component, which significantly contribute to degeneration progression. Although inflammation was initially thought to arise secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators may stimulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism by upregulation of beta-secretase and therefore are able to establish a vicious cycle. Functional brain recovery after ischemic lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury-related increase in the amount of the neurotoxic C-terminal of amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid peptide. Moreover, ischemic neurodegeneration is strongly accelerated with aging, too. New therapeutic alternatives targeting these proteins and repairing related neuronal changes are under development for the treatment of ischemic brain consequences including memory loss prevention.

The effects of hypercapnia on DTI quantification in anesthetized rat brain. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) offers a valuable in vivo tool to characterize water diffusion behavior in biological tissues, particularly brain tissues. The accuracy of DTI derived parameters can directly affect the interpretation of underlying microstructures, physiology or pathologies. It is anticipated that measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using DTI could be influenced and complicated by the presence of water molecules in brain vasculature. However, little is known about to what degree does blood signal from vasculature affect the diffusion quantitation. In this study, we examined the effects of hypercapnia on DTI quantification in rat brains using inhalation of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). It was found that statistically significant changes occurred in parametric DTI maps in response to cerebrovascular challenges, indicating that vascular factors could interfere with in vivo DTI characterization of neural tissues. Consequently, hemodynamic alterations can potentially affect the DTI quantitation and detection of tissue microstructures and pathological alterations. Therefore, cautions must be taken when interpreting DTI parameters in vivo.

[Determination of taxol in taxol injection using near infrared transmission spectroscopy]. The objective of this study was to develop a method for the determination of taxol injection using near infrared transmission spectroscopy, turning out redetermination for injection from hospital pharmacy before using. Near infrared spectra (NIR) in the range of 12 000 approximation 4 000cm(-1) were recorded for the taxol injection manufactured during recent 24 months with different time. Calibration models were established using the partial least squares (PLS). Comparing different spectra pretreatments methods, dimension and spectra range, The study showed that spectra information cab be extracted thoroughly by delete a line method with dimension 6, spectra range 9002.5 approximately 4597.7cm(-1) ,standard error of the calibration sets(SEC) 0.035 and standard error of the prediction sets(SEP) 0. 059. Percent of prediction sets sample is less than +/- 2%. Results indicate that near infrared transmission spectroscopy method can be used to rapidly analyze the frequent and important drugs from hospital pharmacy.


Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta activates AMPK without forming a stable complex: synergistic effects of Ca2+ and AMP.

A novel protein Com1 is required for normal conidium morphology and full virulence in Magnaporthe oryzae. In Magnaporthe oryzae, pyriform conidia are the primary inoculum and the main source for disease dissemination in the field. In this study, we identified and characterized the COM1 gene that was disrupted in three insertional mutants producing slender conidia. COM1 encodes a putative transcription regulator unique to filamentous ascomycetes. The com1 disruption and deletion mutants had similar defects in conidium morphology and were significantly reduced in virulence on rice and barley seedlings. Microscopic examination revealed that the Deltacom1 mutants were defective in appressorium turgor generation, penetration, and infectious growth. COM1 was expressed constitutively in M. oryzae. The Com1 protein had putative helix-loop-helix structures and three predicted nuclear localization signal sequences. In transformants expressing COM1(335-613)-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion constructs, fluorescence signals were observed in the nucleus. Our data indicated that the COM1 gene may encode a novel transcription regulator that regulates conidial development and invasive growth in M. oryzae.

Interleukin-6 induces microglial CX3CR1 expression in the spinal cord after peripheral nerve injury through the activation of p38 MAPK. Peripheral nerve injury leading to neuropathic pain induces the upregulation of interleukin (IL)-6 and microglial CX3CR1 expression, and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the spinal cord. Here, we investigated whether IL-6 regulates CX3CR1 expression through p38 MAPK activation in the spinal cord in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Similar temporal changes in the expression of IL-6, phosphorylated p38 MAPK and CX3CR1 were observed following CCI. The increases in CX3CR1 expression, p38 MAPK activation and pain behavior after CCI were suppressed by blocking IL-6 action with a neutralizing antibody, while they were enhanced by supplying exogenous recombinant rat IL-6 (rrIL-6). rrIL-6 also induced increases in spinal CX3CR1 expression, p38 MAPK activation and pain behavior in naive rats without nerve injury. Furthermore, treatment with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, suppressed the increase in CX3CR1 expression induced by CCI or rrIL-6 treatment. Finally, blocking CX3CR1 or p38 MAPK activation prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI or rrIL-6 treatment. These results suggest a new mechanism of neuropathic pain, in which IL-6 induces microglial CX3CR1 expression in the spinal cord through p38 MAPK activation, enhancing the responsiveness of microglia to fractalkine in the spinal cord, thus playing an important role in neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury.

Isolation of novel cell-penetrating peptides from a random peptide library using in vitro virus and their modifications. A number of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been reported, but their transduction efficiencies are too low to be used as intracellular carriers for therapeutic purposes. We conducted a comprehensive search to find novel CPPs using an in vitro virus (IVV) library, which presented random peptides consisting of 15 amino acids (diversity of the library was >10(12)). We found 9 kinds of novel CPPs with an intracellular translocation efficiency higher than that of the TAT peptide (YGRKKKRRQRRR). Interestingly, one of the novel CPPs, No. 14 (KLWMRWYSPTTRRYG), showed a dramatic improvement in translocation activity relative to the TAT peptide in CHO cells (>10-fold efficiency in 50 microM). As the intracellular translocation efficiency of No. 14 was increased by substitution Arg for Lys1 (14-1), we carried out alanine scanning on the basis of 14-1 to determine important amino acids for the intracellular translocation. The Ala substitution analysis showed that both Arg and Trp residues were important for the cell-penetrating activity and that their contribution was in the order Trp3<Arg12<Arg1<Arg5, Arg13<Trp6. Moreover, it was possible to substitute two Trp with other bulky amino acids such as Ile or Tyr. In this study, we showed that novel CPPs could be acquired by screening random peptides and modifying some amino acids could increase their cell-penetrating activity.

Predictability of quantification of beta-trace protein for diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak: cutoff determination in nasal fluids with two control groups.

Endogenous reactive oxygen species are essential for proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells. It is widely thought that accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes injury to cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of endogenous ROS on the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the hippocampus of embryonic mice. The cells were treated with free radical-scavenging agents [3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (edaravone) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (tempol)], an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin), catalase, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor [N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)] or a peroxynitrite generator (SIN-1) during the culture period. Edaravone and tempol had the ability to decrease endogenous ROS in the cells exposed for periods from 1 to 24h, with attenuation of the proliferation activity of the cells during culture. Apocynin and L-NAME were also effective in attenuating cell proliferation but not cellular damage. Conversely, SIN-1 was capable of promoting the proliferation activity. However, catalase had no effect on the proliferation activity of the cells during culture. Furthermore, tempol significantly decreased the level of NFkappaB p65, phospho-cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, and beta-catenin within the nucleus of the cells. These data suggest that endogenous ROS and nitric oxide are essential for the proliferation of embryonic neural stem/progenitor cells.

Gastric injury from (90)Y to left hepatic lobe tumors adjacent to the stomach: fact or fiction? Radioembolization with (90)Y microspheres is a locoregional radiation therapy for unresectable hepatic neoplasm. Non-target delivery of (90)Y microspheres resulting in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is a recognized complication; there is minimal knowledge regarding the radiation effect to the gastric wall from left hepatic lobe (90)Y treatments. Our aim was to study the incidence of GI complications when the target tissue (hepatic parenchyma ± tumor) is in close proximity to the gastric wall. We hypothesized that liver (tumor) to stomach proximity does not correlate with increased toxicity. Between November 2011 and September 2013, we studied all patients who underwent left lobe radioembolization with (90)Y glass microspheres. With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively reviewed MRI/CT images of these patients, identifying a subset of patients with the left hepatic lobe <1 cm from the gastric wall. Patients were seen in clinic 1 month posttreatment and subsequently at 3-month intervals. Short- and long-term gastric adverse events were tabulated. Ninety-seven patients successfully underwent left hepatic lobe (90)Y microsphere radioembolization in which the average distance from the liver to the stomach wall was 1.0 ± 2.8 mm. The average dose for patients who received radioembolization to the left hepatic lobe was 109 ± 57 Gy. Fifty patients had tumor within 1 cm of the gastric wall. The average dose for patients who received radioembolization to the left hepatic lobe with tumor within 1 cm of the gastric wall was 121 ± 41 Gy. There were no reportable or recordable medical events. Of the patients, 34% reported abdominal pain that was grade 1-2; 65% of the patients reported no abdominal pain. None of the 97 patients developed a clinically evident GI ulcer. Patients with left lobe tumors adjacent to or abutting the stomach do not exhibit acute or chronic radiation effects following radioembolization with glass microspheres.

Therapeutic targeting of melanoma cells using neural stem cells expressing carboxylesterase, a CPT-11 activating enzyme. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been investigated in preclinical models as delivery vehicles for therapeutic genes for treatment of tumors in the central nervous system and other organs. Melanoma at early stages is effectively treated with surgery and radiotherapy, however metastatic disease is almost universally fatal, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. We studied the use of HB1.F3.CD therapeutic NSCs, a well-characterized clonal cell line derived from human fetal telencephalon, for their potential of secreting prodrug-activating enzyme. HB1.F3.CD cells were transduced by adenovirus encoding rabbit carboxylesterase (rCE), which converts CPT-11 into SN-38, a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. In vitro cell migration assays revealed robust migration of NSCs to conditioned media from melanoma cells. Cytokine profiles showed that IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and TIMP-2, known chemoattractants for stem cells, were highly expressed by melanoma cells. Exposure of melanoma cells to conditioned media from the HB1.F3.CD.rCE cells in the presence of CPT-11 increased the tumor cell-killing effect by approximately 100-fold when compared to CPT-11 alone. Our data demonstrate the rational for NSC-based enzyme/prodrug therapeutic approach to target metastatic melanoma. Future experiments will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of NSC-mediated melanoma therapy in animal models, which will provide the basis for targeted therapy in patients with advanced melanoma.

Multiparametric MRI analysis for the evaluation of MR-guided high intensity focused ultrasound tumor treatment. For the clinical application of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for thermal ablation of malignant tumors, accurate treatment evaluation is of key importance. In this study, we have employed a multiparametric MRI protocol, consisting of quantitative T1, T2, ADC, amide proton transfer (APT), T1ρ and DCE-MRI measurements, to evaluate MR-guided HIFU treatment of subcutaneous tumors in rats. K-means clustering using all different combinations of the endogenous contrast MRI parameters (feature vectors) was performed to segment the multiparametric data into tissue populations with similar MR parameter values. The optimal feature vector for identification of the extent of non-viable tumor tissue after HIFU treatment was determined by quantitative comparison between clustering-derived and histology-derived non-viable tumor fractions. The highest one-to-one correspondence between these clustering-based and histology-based non-viable tumor fractions was observed for the feature vector {ADC, APT-weighted signal} (R(2) to line of identity (R(2)y=x) = 0.92) and the strongest agreement was seen 3 days after HIFU (R(2)y=x = 0.97). To compare the multiparametric MRI analysis results with conventional HIFU monitoring and evaluation methods, the histology-derived non-viable tumor fractions were also quantitatively compared with non-perfused tumor fractions (derived from the level of contrast enhancement in the DCE-MRI measurements) and 240 CEM tumor fractions (i.e. thermal dose > 240 cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 °C). The correlation between histology-derived non-viable tumor fractions directly after HIFU and the 240 CEM fractions was high, but not significant. The non-perfused fractions overestimated the extent of non-viable tumor tissue directly after HIFU, whereas an underestimation was observed 3 days after HIFU. In conclusion, we have shown that a multiparametric MR analysis, especially based on the ADC and the APT-weighted signal, can potentially be used to determine the extent of non-viable tumor tissue 3 days after HIFU treatment. We expect that this method can be incorporated in the current clinical workflow of MR-HIFU ablation therapies.


Cross-sectional survey of California childbirth hospitals: implications for defining maternal levels of risk-appropriate care.

Insulin-mediated regulation of decidual protein induced by progesterone (DEPP) in adipose tissue and liver. We analyzed the profile of the genes expressed in human adipose tissue and identified the fat-derived molecules, adiponectin and aquaporin 7, which modulate glucose and lipid metabolism. The same Bodymap analysis revealed abundant expression of the decidual protein induced by progesterone (DEPP) in the white adipose tissue. Northern blot analysis confirmed that human DEPP mRNA was highly expressed in white adipose tissue. Mouse DEPP mRNA was detected in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue under feeding state. In contrast, under fasting state, mouse DEPP mRNA was enhanced in lung, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue and it appeared also in the liver and kidney, suggesting up regulation of DEPP by fasting. Because fasting-induced DEPP expression was observed in insulin-sensitive organs, we investigated the regulation of DEPP in white adipose tissue and liver. During adipogenesis of mouse 3T3-L1 cells, DEPP mRNA increased in a differentiation-dependent manner similar to adiponectin and aquaporin 7. Treatment of cultured 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes, rat H4IIE, and human HepG2 hepatoma cells with insulin significantly decreased DEPP mRNA levels in dose- and time-dependent manners. IN VIVO experiments showed significant decrease of hepatic and adipose DEPP mRNA levels in refed mice, compared to fasted animals, and also showed significant increase in DEPP mRNA in streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficient diabetic mice. These results indicate that DEPP is a novel insulin-regulatory molecule expressed abundantly in insulin-sensitive tissues including white adipose tissue and liver.


Macrophage death and defective inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis.

Biomembranes in atomistic and coarse-grained simulations. The architecture of biological membranes is tightly coupled to the localization, organization, and function of membrane proteins. The organelle-specific distribution of lipids allows for the formation of functional microdomains (also called rafts) that facilitate the segregation and aggregation of membrane proteins and thus shape their function. Molecular dynamics simulations enable to directly access the formation, structure, and dynamics of membrane microdomains at the molecular scale and the specific interactions among lipids and proteins on timescales from picoseconds to microseconds. This review focuses on the latest developments of biomembrane force fields for both atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the different levels of coarsening of biomolecular structures. It also briefly introduces scale-bridging methods applicable to biomembrane studies, and highlights selected recent applications.

[Clinical and laboratory features of the Menkes disease]. To study the clinical and laboratory features of the patients with Menkes disease. Three infants were diagnosed as Menkes disease. Their clinical feature, laboratory findings, radiological manifestation and genes were reviewed. All the three cases were male infants. Their clinical manifestations began at the 3, 5 and 6 months after birth. They all had light complexion, sparse fuzzy woolly hair. The main clinical manifestation was severe mental retardation. The first and the third case also had focal clonus seizures. The second case had feeding difficulty after birth. Their hair showed pili torti and trichorrhexis nodosa microscopically. Their ceruloplasmin in plasma were 32.3 mg/L, 72.5 mg/L and 60.7 mg/L, which were significantly lower as compared with the normal values. Their neuroimaging findings were cortical atrophy, delayed myelination of the white matter and tortuosity of the intracranial vessels. The gene examination of the first and the second case showed deletion and nonsense mutation on exon 14 respectively. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a copper-transporting ATPase defect. The main clinical manifestation is progressive nerve damage.

Human skeletal muscle drug transporters determine local exposure and toxicity of statins. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are important drugs used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. Interindividual differences in the activities of hepatic membrane drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are known to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics and risk for myopathy. Interestingly, little is known regarding the molecular determinants of statin distribution into skeletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. We sought to identify statin transporters in human skeletal muscle and determine their impact on statin toxicity in vitro. We demonstrate that the uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) and the efflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates of these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity.

Oxidative stress response in the adult rat retina and plasma after repeated administration of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychostimulant that target the sensory systems, with the neurosensory retina having been shown to be affected. In the brain, MA-related toxicity can be linked to oxidative stress; the same relationship has yet to be established for the retina. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to MA on oxidative stress parameters in the rat retina. Oxidative stress parameters in the blood plasma were also assessed. Male Wistar rats were given 5mg/kg MA every 2h for a period of 6h (i.e., 4 injections) daily between postnatal day (PND) 91 and 100. Evolution of body weight was registered. Rats were sacrificed at PND 110. Blood plasma was collected and immediately frozen for storage at -70 degrees C. The eyes were enucleated, and the retina and choroids rapidly dissected on ice under dim light also to be stored at -70 degrees C. Lipid peroxidation activity was measured by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. Total antioxidant status, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (Cat) activity, and nitrogen oxides contents were also determined. Lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in the retina and blood plasma of the MA-treated rats. Total antioxidant levels were significantly lower in both retina and blood plasma of the MA-treated rats. The activity of SOD was significantly increased in the retina and blood plasma of MA-treated rats. Catalase activity did not differ between groups in either the retina or the blood plasma. Nitric oxide production was significantly higher in both the retina and blood plasma in the MA-treated animals. The overall findings show that the oxidative stress defence mechanisms in the retina are compromised by MA toxicity. The results are similar to those found in the brain, and, moreover, showed some correlation with the blood plasma.

Imaging the future of stroke: I. Ischemia. Envisioning the future of stroke appears daunting considering the milestones already achieved in stroke imaging. A historical perspective on the developments in stroke care provides a striking narrative of how imaging has transformed diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Multimodal imaging techniques such as CT and MRI, incorporating parenchymal depictions, illustration of the vasculature, and perfusion data, can provide a wealth of information regarding ischemic pathophysiology. Key elements of ischemic pathophysiology depicted with imaging include vascular occlusion, compensatory collateral flow, resultant hemodynamic conditions that reflect these sources of blood flow, and the neurovascular injury that ensues. The mantra of "time is brain" has been perpetuated, but this does not provide an entirely accurate reflection of ischemic pathophysiology and imaging insight shows far more than time alone. Maximizing the potential of perfusion imaging will continue to expand the nascent concept that cerebral ischemia may be completely reversible in certain scenarios. Novel modalities provide a fertile ground for discovery of therapeutic targets and the potential to assess effects of promising strategies. Beyond clinical trials, imaging has become a requisite component of the neurological examination enabling tailored stroke therapy with the use of detailed neuroimaging modalities. In this first article on ischemia, the focus is on the most recent imaging advances and exploring aspects of cerebral ischemia where imaging may yield additional therapeutic strategies. A subsequent article will review recent and anticipated imaging advances in hemorrhage. These thematic overviews underscore that imaging will undoubtedly continue to dramatically shape the future of stroke.

The biochemistry, measurement and current clinical significance of asymmetric dimethylarginine. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and an important cause of endothelial dysfunction. Its increased plasma concentration is associated with a variety of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and may mediate their effects on the vascular endothelium. ADMA is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality, and predicts outcomes in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. This work has provided insights into the role of ADMA as an endogenous regulator of nitric oxide synthesis. At present there is no specific therapy to modify ADMA concentration, but increasing interest and work on protein arginine methyltransferases and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, which synthesize and metabolize ADMA, respectively, might provide novel therapeutic targets.

Targeted Proteomics-Driven Computational Modeling of Macrophage S1P Chemosensing. Osteoclasts are monocyte-derived multinuclear cells that directly attach to and resorb bone. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)(1) regulates bone resorption by functioning as both a chemoattractant and chemorepellent of osteoclast precursors through two G-protein coupled receptors that antagonize each other in an S1P-concentration-dependent manner. To quantitatively explore the behavior of this chemosensing pathway, we applied targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, and rule-based pathway modeling using the Simmune toolset. RAW264.7 cells (a mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line) were used as model osteoclast precursors, RNA-seq was used to identify expressed target proteins, and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry using internal peptide standards was used to perform absolute abundance measurements of pathway proteins. The resulting transcript and protein abundance values were strongly correlated. Measured protein abundance values, used as simulation input parameters, led to in silico pathway behavior matching in vitro measurements. Moreover, once model parameters were established, even simulated responses toward stimuli that were not used for parameterization were consistent with experimental findings. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of combining targeted mass spectrometry with pathway modeling for advancing biological insight. 


Connecting parts with processes: SubtiWiki and SubtiPathways integrate gene and pathway annotation for Bacillus subtilis.

VLSI architecture of NEO spike detection with noise shaping filter and feature extraction using informative samples. An emerging class of multi-channel neural recording systems aims to simultaneously monitor the activity of many neurons by miniaturizing and increasing the number of recording channels. Vast volume of data from the recording systems, however, presents a challenge for processing and transmitting wirelessly. An on-chip neural signal processor is needed for filtering uninterested recording samples and performing spike sorting. This paper presents a VLSI architecture of a neural signal processor that can reliably detect spike via a nonlinear energy operator, enhance spike signal over noise ratio by a noise shaping filter, and select meaningful recording samples for clustering by using informative samples. The architecture is implemented in 90-nm CMOS process, occupies 0.2 mm(2), and consumes 0.5 mW of power.


Advances and challenges in developing a therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.

Use of macroalgae stored in an Environmental Specimen Bank for application of some European Framework Directives. Different European Framework Directives have established a series of objectives for conservation of the coast, and monitoring tools must be made available to test compliance with these aims. In the present study the use of macroalgae deposited in an Environmental Specimen Bank was evaluated as a possible environmental tool for monitoring the coastal ecosystem. The concentrations of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in three species of the genus Fucus (Fucus spiralis, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus ceranoides) were measured at sampling sites distributed along the coast of Galicia (NW Spain). In the period 1990-2001, the concentrations of the metals were higher in 1990 than in 2001, with the exception of: i) Mn in F. ceranoides and Fe in F. spiralis-F. vesiculosus, for which there were no differences between the sampling periods, and ii) Zn in F. vesiculosus and Fe in F. ceranoides, for which the concentrations were higher in 2001 than in 1990. In the period 2001-2007 concentrations of the metals were more stable, especially in F. ceranoides (e.g. Al, Fe, Hg, Ni and V). The concentrations were also more stable vin F. vesiculosus in 2005 (i.e. Al, Cr, Fe, Mn and Zn). The population density distributions are consistent with the results of the statistical tests. The results indicate that macroalgae of the genus Fucus may be useful for applying different European Framework Directives, given that the macroalgae are sufficiently sensitive to changes in concentrations of metals, and may be suitable for long-term monitoring and used for the detection of increased concentrations of metals (real-time monitoring).

Mass spectrometric characterization of the Campylobacter jejuni adherence factor CadF reveals post-translational processing that removes immunogenicity while retaining fibronectin binding. Campylobacter jejuni is a major gastrointestinal pathogen that colonizes host mucosa via interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn). Fn-binding is mediated by a 37 kDa outer membrane protein termed Campylobacter adherence Factor (CadF). The outer membrane protein profile of a recent gastrointestinal C. jejuni clinical isolate (JHH1) was analysed using 2-DE and MS. Several spots were identified as products of the cadF gene. These included mass and pI variants of 34 and 30 kDa, as well as 24 kDa (CadF(24)) and 22 kDa (CadF(22)) mass variants. CadF variants were fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-MS/MS. These data confirmed that CadF forms re-folding variants resulting in spots with lower mass and varying pI that are identical at the amino acid sequence level and are not modified post-translationally. CadF(22) and CadF(24), however, were characterized as N-terminal, membrane-associated polypeptides resulting from cleavage between serine(195) and leucine(196), and glycine(201) and phenylalanine(202), respectively. These variants were more abundant in the virulent (O) isolate of C. jejuni NCTC11168 when compared with the avirulent (genome sequenced) isolate. Hexahistidine fusion constructs of full-length CadF (34 kDa), CadF(24), and the deleted C-terminal OmpA domain (14 kDa; CadF(14)) were created in Escherichia coli. Recombinant CadF variants were probed against patient sera and revealed that only full-length CadF retained reactivity. Binding assays showed that CadF(24) retained Fn-binding capability, while CadF(14) did not bind Fn. These data suggest that the immunogenic epitope of CadF is cleaved to generate smaller Fn-binding polypeptides, which are not recognized by the host humoral response. CadF cleavage therefore may be associated with virulence in C. jejuni.

Phylogeography of Influenza A(H3N2) Virus in Peru, 2010-2012. It remains unclear whether lineages of influenza A(H3N2) virus can persist in the tropics and seed temperate areas. We used viral gene sequence data sampled from Peru to test this source-sink model for a Latin American country. Viruses were obtained during 2010-2012 from influenza surveillance cohorts in Cusco, Tumbes, Puerto Maldonado, and Lima. Specimens positive for influenza A(H3N2) virus were randomly selected and underwent hemagglutinin sequencing and phylogeographic analyses. Analysis of 389 hemagglutinin sequences from Peru and 2,192 global sequences demonstrated interseasonal extinction of Peruvian lineages. Extensive mixing occurred with global clades, but some spatial structure was observed at all sites; this structure was weakest in Lima and Puerto Maldonado, indicating that these locations may experience greater viral traffic. The broad diversity and co-circulation of many simultaneous lineages of H3N2 virus in Peru suggests that this country should not be overlooked as a potential source for novel pandemic strains. 

[Amplitude coupling analysis of EEG using nonlinear regressive coefficients during mental fatigue]. Computing the Nonlinear regressive (NLR) coefficients of electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms at different brain cortical areas for the mental fatigue caused by long-term cognitive task, the variations of NLR coefficients of EEG rhythms under different mental fatigue level are sought out. The experimental results show that the NLR coefficients of EEG rhythms can effectively characterize the changes of amplitude coupling at different brain cortical areas under different mental fatigue level. The NLR coefficient provides a powerful tool for the EEG functional coupling analysis of mental fatigue.

[Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of severe malaria in adults in hospital in Antananarivo, Madagascar]. Few data are available about severe malaria in Madagascar. Our aims were to describe epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of severe malaria in patients in Antananarivo. We conducted a retrospective study from 1 March 2006 to 31 March 2008 at the infectious disease department. We recorded 61 cases of severe malaria among 1,803 in patients. Sex ratio was 2 and average age was 35.3 years old. Three pregnant women were recorded among women (15.8%). Self-medication was registered in 23%. Among 35 patients who received first medical care, no one had parasitological examination. The treatment was inadequate for all patients (n = 19). Conscience impairment (65.6%), jaundice (24.6%), seizure (18%) and prostration (14.8%) were the major severe signs. Diagnosis was made 6.54 days after the onset of the disease. Mortality rate was 11.5%. Self-medication, inappropriate primary care and delayed diagnosis represented risk factors for severe malaria in our cohort.

A rare form of trifascicular block with intermittent complete atrioventricular block in a patient with Chagas disease. Trifascicular block, which consists of impaired conduction in the three main fascicles of the ventricular conduction system, may progress to high-grade or complete atrioventricular block. Exceptionally, it is possible to register in the same patient paroxysmal alternating atrioventricular block and bilateral bundle branch block. This is the electrocardiogram of a male, 60 year-old patient coming from an endemic area, with positive serology for Chagas disease, with the exclusively dromotropic form (there are no signs of cardiac muscle involvement), manifest by repetitive pre-syncope and syncope episodes.

CK2 is a novel negative regulator of NADPH oxidase and a neuroprotectant in mice after cerebral ischemia. NADPH oxidase is a major complex that produces reactive oxygen species (ROSs) during the ischemic period and aggravates brain damage and cell death after ischemic injury. Although many approaches have been tested for preventing production of ROSs by NADPH oxidase in ischemic brain injury, the regulatory mechanisms of NADPH oxidase activity after cerebral ischemia are still unclear. In this study, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a critical modulator of NADPH oxidase and elucidated the role of CK2 as a neuroprotectant after oxidative insults to the brain. We found that the protein levels of the catalytic subunits CK2alpha and CK2alpha', as well as the total activity of CK2, are significantly reduced after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). We also found this deactivation of CK2 caused by ischemia/reperfusion increases expression of Nox2 and translocation of p67(phox) and Rac1 to the membrane after tFCI. Interestingly, we found that the inactive status of Rac1 was captured by the catalytic subunit CK2alpha under normal conditions. However, binding between CK2alpha and Rac1 was immediately diminished after tFCI, and Rac1 activity was markedly increased after CK2 inhibition. Moreover, we found that deactivation of CK2 in the mouse brain enhances production of ROSs and neuronal cell death via increased NADPH oxidase activity. The increased brain infarct volume caused by CK2 inhibition was restored by apocynin, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. This study suggests that CK2 can be a direct molecular target for modulation of NADPH oxidase activity after ischemic brain injury.

Gene clustering analysis in human osseous remodeling. Tentative bioinformatic predictions were performed to comprehend the complexity of the gene interaction networks of the T lymphocyte cell cycle and of human periodontitis. This study aims to identify and rank genes involved in osseous augmentation or bone remodeling to obtain groups with more numerous predicted associations called the leader gene clusters. An iterative search (consisting of a consecutive expansion-filtering loop) was performed for which only genes involved in a specific process were identified. For each gene, predicted associations with all other involved genes were obtained from a Web-available database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) and the weighted number of links (WNL), given by the sum of only high-confidence predicted associations (results with a score > or =0.9), allowing gene ranking. Genes belonging to higher clustering classes were identified. A total of 161 genes potentially involved in bone-volume augmentation and 128 genes connected with the bone-remodeling phenomenon were identified. For the bone-volume augmentation process, only one gene belonged to the leader gene group, whereas six other genes were classified as cluster B genes; for the bone-remodeling phenomenon, three leader genes were identified, whereas six other genes formed the cluster B group. No one gene belonged to leader gene clusters of both processes, whereas one gene of each higher cluster group belonged to the immediately lower cluster of the opposite process. Only three genes of the higher clusters were experimentally involved in both analyses. A de novo identification was performed based on the data mining of leader genes involved in bone-volume augmentation or bone remodeling to acquire primeval information about their molecular basis and to plan future ad hoc targeted experiments. For several genes of the upper clusters, an active role in the bone processes was already known, but the present analysis suggested that they play a major role in the analyzed phenomena. The role of the transcription factors as leader genes and the numerous orphan genes (genes with WNL = 0) recovered probably attest to a lack of information regarding these processes, which could be further clarified through specific DNA microarray experiments.

The coiled-coil domain of EHD2 mediates inhibition of LeEix2 endocytosis and signaling. Endocytosis has been suggested to be crucial for the induction of plant immunity in several cases. We have previously shown that two Arabidopsis proteins, AtEHD1 and AtEHD2, are involved in endocytosis in plant systems. AtEHD2 has an inhibitory effect on endocytosis of transferrin, FM-4-64, and LeEix2. There are many works in mammalian systems detailing the importance of the various domains in EHDs but, to date, the domains of plant EHD2 that are required for its inhibitory activity on endocytosis remained unknown. In this work we demonstrate that the coiled-coil domain of EHD2 is crucial for the ability of EHD2 to inhibit endocytosis in plants, as mutant EHD2 forms lacking the coiled-coil lost the ability to inhibit endocytosis and signaling of LeEix2. The coiled-coil was also required for binding of EHD2 to the LeEix2 receptor. It is therefore probable that binding of EHD2 to the LeEix2 receptor is required for inhibition of LeEix2 internalization. We also show herein that the P-loop of EHD2 is important for EHD2 to function properly. The EH domain of AtEHD2 does not appear to be involved in inhibition of endocytosis. Moreover, AtEHD2 influences actin organization and may exert its inhibitory effect on endocytosis through actin re-distribution. The coiled-coil domain of EHD2 functions in inhibition of endocytosis, while the EH domain does not appear to be involved in inhibition of endocytosis.

Pharyngeal perforation masquerading as esophageal atresia. We present a case of pharyngeal perforation from a nasogastric tube mistakenly diagnosed as esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula in a full term infant female. The correct diagnosis was identified with rigid bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy immediately prior to the planned thoracotomy which was aborted. After one week of oral restriction and antibiotics, the healed perforation did not demonstrate leakage on a contrasted pharyngoesophagogram and bottle feeds were initiated. The infant was discharged to home on day of life 13 without any further complications.

Endocannabinoids contribute to metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated inhibition of GABA release onto hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons in an isolated neuron/bouton preparation. Retrograde synaptic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) is a recently discovered form of neuromodulation in various brain regions. In hippocampus, it is well known that endocannabinoids suppress presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter release in CA1 region. However, endocannabinoid signaling in CA3 region remains to be examined. Here we investigated whether presynaptic inhibition can be caused by activation of postsynaptic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and following presynaptic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) using mechanically dissociated rat hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons with adherent functional synaptic boutons. Application of group I mGluR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) reversibly suppressed spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), frequency of miniature IPSCs was significantly reduced by DHPG, while there were no significant changes in minimum quantal size and sensitivity of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors to the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol, indicating that this suppression was caused by a decrease in GABA release from presynaptic nerve terminals. Application of CB1 synthetic agonist WIN55212-2 (mesylate(R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[4-morpholino)methyl]pyrrolo-[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthyl)methanone) or endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol also suppressed the spontaneous IPSC. The inhibitory effect of DHPG on spontaneous IPSCs was abolished by SR-141716 (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide), a CB1 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, postsynaptic application of GDP-betaS blocked the DHPG-induced inhibition of spontaneous IPSCs, indicating the involvement of endcannabinoid-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling. These results provide solid evidence for retrograde signaling from postsynaptic group I mGluRs to presynaptic CB1 receptors, which induces presynaptic inhibition of GABA release in rat hippocampal CA3 region.

Responsibility ascriptions in technology development and engineering: three perspectives. In the last decades increasing attention is paid to the topic of responsibility in technology development and engineering. The discussion of this topic is often guided by questions related to liability and blameworthiness. Recent discussions in engineering ethics call for a reconsideration of the traditional quest for responsibility. Rather than on alleged wrongdoing and blaming, the focus should shift to more socially responsible engineering, some authors argue. The present paper aims at exploring the different approaches to responsibility in order to see which one is most appropriate to apply to engineering and technology development. Using the example of the development of a new sewage water treatment technology, the paper shows how different approaches for ascribing responsibilities have different implications for engineering practice in general, and R&D or technological design in particular. It was found that there was a tension between the demands that follow from these different approaches, most notably between efficacy and fairness. Although the consequentialist approach with its efficacy criterion turned out to be most powerful, it was also shown that the fairness of responsibility ascriptions should somehow be taken into account. It is proposed to look for alternative, more procedural ways to approach the fairness of responsibility ascriptions.

Pulmonary artery growth after palliation of congenital heart disease with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation: arterial duct stenting versus surgical shunt. The aim of this study was to compare the pulmonary artery (PA) growth after arterial duct (AD) stenting versus modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) in neonates with congenital heart disease with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation (CHD-DPC). Arterial duct stenting is increasingly deemed a reliable alternative to surgical shunt in CHD-DPC. A stented duct might better adapt to the PA anatomy than a surgical conduit, thereby promoting a more uniform PA development. This study enrolled 27 patients with CHD-DPC submitted to AD stenting (n = 13, Group I) or MBTS (n = 14, Group II) at our institution. The PA growth was angiographically assessed with the Nakata and McGoon indexes as well as the individual PA z-scores. The right-to-left PA diameter ratio was considered as index of uniform growth. After 10 +/- 5 months, both options had promoted a significant increase of the Nakata index (from 136 +/- 72 mm/m(2) to 294 +/- 99 mm/m(2), p < 0.0001, Group I; from 151 +/- 74 mm/m(2) to 295 +/- 177 mm/m(2), p < 0.003, Group II) and McGoon ratio (from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3, p < 0.0001, Group I; from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01, Group II). However, the surgical shunt had caused a worsening of the left-to-right PA diameter ratio compared with AD stenting (0.9 +/- 0.1 Group I vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9 Group II, p < 0.01), due to preferential growth of the PA contralateral to the shunt. Percutaneous AD stenting is as effective as MBTS in promoting a global PA growth in CHD-DPC. In addition, it ensures an even distribution of the pulmonary blood flow, thereby promoting a more balanced pulmonary vascular development than MBTS.

Middle ear structure and bone conduction in Spalax, Eospalax, and Tachyoryctes mole-rats (Rodentia: Spalacidae). There is evidence that spalacine, tachyoryctine, and myospalacine mole-rats all communicate with conspecifics through a form of seismic signaling, but the route for the detection of these signals is disputed. It has been proposed that two unusual anatomical adaptations in Spalax allow jaw vibrations to pass to the inner ear via the incus and stapes: a pseudoglenoid (=postglenoid) fossa which accomodates the condylar process of the mandible, and a bony cup, supported by a periotic lamina, through which the incus articulates with the skull. In this study, a combination of dissection and computed tomography was used to examine the ear region in more detail in both Spalax and its subterranean relatives Tachyoryctes and Eospalax, about which much less is known. Tachyoryctes was found to lack a pseudoglenoid fossa, while Eospalax lacks a periotic lamina and bony cup. This shows that these structures need not simultaneously be present for the detection of ground vibrations in mole-rats. Based on the observed anatomy, three hypothetical modes of bone conduction are argued to represent more likely mechanisms through which mole-rats can detect ground vibrations: ossicular inertial bone conduction, a pathway involving sound radiation into the external auditory meatus, and a newly-described fluid pathway between pseudoglenoid fossa and cranial cavity. The caudolateral extension of the tympanic cavity and the presence of a bony cup might represent synapomorphies uniting Spalax and Tachyoryctes, while the loss of the tensor tympani muscle in Spalax and Eospalax may be convergently derived.

Pharmacokinetics and disposition of a localized lymphatic polymeric hyaluronan conjugate of cisplatin in rodents. Cisplatin (CDDP) is an effective anticancer agent for many solid tumors but has significant systemic toxicity limiting its use in many patients. We have designed a loco-regional delivery system to increase platinum levels in the lymphatics, where early metastasis is most likely to occur, while reducing systemic toxicities. CDDP was conjugated to a biocompatible polymer hyaluronan (HA), with a conjugation degree of approximately 20% (w/w). Conjugates were delivered via subcutaneous injection into the mammary fat pad of rats. Intravenous hyaluronan-cisplatin (HA-Pt) exhibited an increased plasma area under the curve (AUC) 2.7-fold compared to conventional CDDP but with a reduced peak plasma level (C(max)), and HA-Pt increased the ipsilateral lymph node AUC by 3.8-fold compared to CDDP. Urine creatinine was unchanged over 30 days following dosing of HA-Pt. This study demonstrates that intralymphatic drug delivery with polymer-conjugated platinum may provide greater tissue and systemic plasma concentrations of platinum than intravenous CDDP. In addition, localized particle delivery augmented distribution in the loco-regional tissue basin where tumor burden predominates, while renal toxicity compared to standard intravenous CDDP was significantly reduced.

Hepatoprotective effects of gamma-irradiated caraway essential oils in experimental sepsis. Irradiation is an important method of processing herbal drugs, while our understanding of the effects of gamma-irradiation on pharmacological properties of seed products such as caraway essential oils is however still very limited. In this study, caraway seeds were irradiated at dose levels of 0, 10 and 25kGy. After extracting the essential oils, the effects of fresh and gamma-irradiated caraway oils (100mg/kg b.w) on preventing septic-related oxidative liver injury induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model were investigated by measuring oxidative stress parameters in the liver. CLP operation caused a marked increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity which was readily reversed in rats treated with fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Likewise, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level in the liver was compensated in rats treated with the fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Moreover, liver GSH which was initially depleted due to CLP was recovered by essential oil treatments. The protective role of oils was further confirmed by showing that liver function tests (ALT/AST) as well as histopathological changes following CLP operation were recovered in rats treated with oils from either fresh or irradiated caraway seeds. These data may suggest that gamma-irradiation to caraway seeds at 10 and 25kGy has no influence on the antioxidative properties of caraway essential oils.

Cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing pharmacological reperfusion: a Canadian analysis of the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 trial. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in conjunction with fibrinolysis in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients within Canada. Based on the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 trial, a model was created to analyze the cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin in conjunction with fibrinolysis among ST elevation myocardial infarction patients within Canada. Clinical outcomes were derived from published results of the main trial. Resource use costs were first assessed based on United States Diagnosis-Related Group values for hospitalizations and Current Procedural Terminology codes for outpatient visits and tests. Both were then converted using Canadian local costs. Survival and life expectancy were estimated from Framingham survival data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per life year gained. Through 30 days after random assignment, the primary composite end point favoured the enoxaparin group over the unfractionated heparin group (death or recurrent myocardial infarction rate 9.9% versus 12.0%, P<0.001), and was associated with a modest increased cost of $169.50 ($8,757.00 versus $8,587.50, respectively). Life years gained as a result of treatment with enoxaparin was increased by 0.11 years (P<0.05). Enoxaparin was found to be cost-effective, as indicated by an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4,930 with a 99% probability of costing less than $20,000. Although associated with modest increased direct medication costs, enoxaparin following fibrinolysis improved the clinical efficacy in STEMI patients and increased the life years gained.

A lack of contact of sperm with accessory sex gland secretions deregulates DNA methylation and imprinted gene expression in rodent embryos. Increased oxidative DNA damage is observed in sperm devoid of contact with accessory sex gland (ASG) secretion. After fertilization, these sperm may produce abnormal embryos. In this study, we investigated the possibility that the pattern of DNA methylation and imprinted gene expression in these embryos may be perturbed. Epididymal sperm, uterine sperm, and embryonic day 13 (E13) embryos were collected from hamster and mouse. The extent of global DNA methylation was determined with an antibody against methylcytosine using an embryo DNA dot. The sperm and embryo Gtl2 promoter and H19 differential methylated region (DMR) were subject to bisulfite sequencing. Expression of their reciprocally activated genes Dlk1 and Igf2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Genome-wide DNA hypo-methylation in both hamster and mouse embryos sired by males without ASG was observed. The imprinting pattern of fetal mouse Gtl2 promoter and fetal hamster H19 DMR were also disrupted while the expression of Dlk1 and Igf2 was dysregulated in the hamster embryo. This study suggests that a lack of contact of sperm with the ASG secretion disrupts genome-wide DNA methylation and also affects the DNA methylation pattern of imprinted genes in embryos.

Prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and utility of FIBROspect II to detect liver fibrosis in morbidly obese Hispano-American patients undergoing gastric bypass. Our study describes the prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis in Hispano-American morbidly obese patients and the utility of different serum markers to predict significant liver fibrosis in this population. We perform a retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with routine liver biopsy performed at Valley Baptist medical center during a 24-month period (2005-2006). Of 129 liver biopsies, only 25.7% had some degree of steatosis, but about 55% had NASH, and 30.9% had liver fibrosis. Of those patients with liver fibrosis, only 6.9% had moderate to severe fibrosis (stages 2-4), and only one patient had cirrhosis (0.7%). Of the 129 patients, only 92 had a FIBROspect score II in their chart, and they ranged from 9 to 95, with a mean of 28.3. Of these patients, 36 had a score less than 20, and none had significant fibrosis in their biopsy. FIBROspect II® score (cutoff <20) had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.9035-1) positive predictive value (PPV) of 15% (CI 95%, 0.0838-0.2693), sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 42% to predict stage 2 fibrosis or higher. NASH and liver fibrosis are present in a high percentage of morbidly obese patients. Liver function tests and ultrasound are not reliable tests to diagnose or rule out advance liver fibrosis. The use of FIBROspect II® score in the preoperative evaluation of morbidly obese patients can rule out significant liver fibrosis (stages 2-4) and avoid the morbidities related to liver biopsy.

Too much content, not enough thinking, and too little fun! Teachers often overrate the importance of their content and underrate their influence. However, students forget much of the content that they memorize. Thus, attempts to teach students all that they will need to know is futile. Rather, it is important that students develop an interest and love for lifelong learning. Inspiring and motivating students is critical because unless students are inspired and motivated our efforts are pointless. Once students are inspired and motivated, there are countless resources available to learn more about a subject. Thus, teachers must abandon the mistaken notion that unless they "cover the content" students will be unprepared for the future and they will have failed as teachers. Teachers must not worry about "losing" or "wasting" valuable lecture time for in-class discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and inquiry-based activities that take time away from covering content. Rather than worrying about covering content, teachers must design activities to focus student learning on how to use scientific knowledge to solve important questions. This is important because learning is not committing a set of facts to memory but the ability to use resources to find, evaluate, and use information. In fact, memorizing anything discourages deep thinking. Deep thinking is essential because understanding is the residue of thinking! To encourage thinking we must create a joy, an excitement, and a love for learning. We must make learning fun; because if we are successful, our students will be impatient to run home, study, and contemplate-to really learn.

Self-neglect and cognitive function among community-dwelling older persons. Elder self-neglect is a common public health issue, but it is unclear to what degree it is associated with cognitive function. This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between self-neglect and cognitive function. Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) is a population-based epidemiological study conducted in a geographically defined community in Chicago (N = 8698): we identified 1094 CHAP participants who had self-neglect reported to social services agency, which assessed the self-neglect severity. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (Perceptual Speed), and both immediate and delayed recall of the East Boston Memory Test (Episodic Memory). An index of global cognitive function scores was derived by averaging z-scores of all tests. Linear regression models were used to assess the association of self-neglect severity and cognitive function. Self-neglect was associated with poorer cognitive function. After adjusting for confounders, self-neglect was associated with lower global cognitive function (parameter estimate[PE] = -0.367, standard error[SE] = 0.026, p < 0.001), lower MMSE (PE = -2.592, SE = 0.182, p < 0.001), episodic memory (PE = -0.288, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001), and perceptual speed (PE = -5.428, SE = 0.444, p < 0.001). In addition, higher self-neglect severity scores were associated with lower global cognitive function (PE = -0.008, SE = 0.003, p = 0.014). Greater self-neglect severity was not correlated with worse performance on MMSE, but was correlated with worse performance on episodic memory (PE = -0.008,=SE = 0.003, p = 0.010), and perceptual speed (PE = -0.131, SE = 0.042, p = 0.002). Self-neglect is associated with lower global cognitive function, episodic memory and perceptual speed. Future studies are needed to examine the temporality of these associations.

UCP1 ectopically expressed in murine muscle displays native function and mitigates mitochondrial superoxide production. Mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle has raised a major interest as a therapeutic target for treatment of obesity, insulin sensitivity, and age-related disease. These physiological effects could be demonstrated in several mouse models ectopically expressing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Here, we investigated whether UCP1 expressed under the control of the human skeletal actin (HSA) promoter in mouse skeletal muscle can be regulated, and whether it affects mitochondrial superoxide production. We show that the skeletal muscle UCP1 can be fully inhibited by a purine nucleotide (GDP) and reactivated by fatty acids (palmitate). During mitochondrial resting state (State 4), mitochondrial superoxide production is about 76% lower in transgenic mice. We suggest that this reduction is due to uncoupling activity as the administration of GDP restores superoxide production to wildtype levels. Our study confirms native behaviour of UCP1 in skeletal muscle and demonstrates beneficial effects on prevention of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production which may reduce age-related deleterious processes.

Occupational immediate-type asthma and rhinitis due to rhodium salts. Whereas platinum salts are well known occupational allergens, rhodium salts have not been identified as inhalative sensitizing substances. A 27-year-old atopic operator of an electroplating plant developed work-related shortness of breath and runny nose with sneezing after exposure to rhodium salts. Quantitative skin prick tests (SPT) and bronchial challenge tests with a dosimeter protocol were performed with quadrupling doses of the sodium chloride salts of rhodium (Na(3)RhCl(6)) and platinum (Na(2)PtCl(6)). The patient showed positive SPT reactions and positive bronchial immediate-type reactions with rhodium and platinum salts. Sensitivity to rhodium salt was much higher than to platinum salt; the molar concentrations differed by a factor of 256 in SPT and a factor of 16 in bronchial challenges. Rhodium salts should be considered as occupational immediate-type allergens.

Anomaly detection in gene expression via stochastic models of gene regulatory networks. The steady-state behaviour of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can provide crucial evidence for detecting disease-causing genes. However, monitoring the dynamics of GRNs is particularly difficult because biological data only reflects a snapshot of the dynamical behaviour of the living organism. Also most GRN data and methods are used to provide limited structural inferences. In this study, the theory of stochastic GRNs, derived from G-Networks, is applied to GRNs in order to monitor their steady-state behaviours. This approach is applied to a simulation dataset which is generated by using the stochastic gene expression model, and observe that the G-Network properly detects the abnormally expressed genes in the simulation study. In the analysis of real data concerning the cell cycle microarray of budding yeast, our approach finds that the steady-state probability of CLB2 is lower than that of other agents, while most of the genes have similar steady-state probabilities. These results lead to the conclusion that the key regulatory genes of the cell cycle can be expressed in the absence of CLB type cyclines, which was also the conclusion of the original microarray experiment study. G-networks provide an efficient way to monitor steady-state of GRNs. Our method produces more reliable results then the conventional t-test in detecting differentially expressed genes. Also G-networks are successfully applied to the yeast GRNs. This study will be the base of further GRN dynamics studies cooperated with conventional GRN inference algorithms.

A-delta and C-fibres function in primary restless legs syndrome. The sensory symptoms that are reported in restless legs syndrome (RLS) suggest involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in general and of the small-fibre system in particular. We aimed to study the status of the small-fibre system in primary RLS. We investigated 10 patients with idiopathic RLS (mean time since disease onset: 11.4 +/- 12 years, mean International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group [IRLSSG] score: 23.4 +/- 8). Five had a family history. All had normal results for laboratory tests, neurological examination, and a sural/deep-peroneal nerve conduction study. Lower-limb thulium YAG laser-evoked potentials (LEP) and skin sympathetic reflexes (SSR) were performed. The results were compared with data from 10 healthy subjects. The nociceptive thresholds were 293 +/- 62 mJ for patients and 333 +/- 77 mJ for controls. For patients, the vertex N2 and P2 latencies were 208 +/- 25 ms and 366 +/- 51 ms, respectively (controls: N2 = 235 +/- 41 ms; P2 = 373 +/- 44 ms). The N2-P2 amplitude was 19 +/- 6 microV for patients and 18 +/- 7 microV for controls. SSR were normal in all patients. No significant differences between patients and healthy subjects were observed. We failed to demonstrate any significant involvement of small fibres and spinothalamic tracts in idiopathic RLS. Even though sufferers of this specific form of RLS report sensory symptoms, pathogenesis appears to be dissociated from a PNS alteration.

Use of the internet by legal guardians of patients from public and private pediatric urology health services in Brazil. To describe the internet access characteristics of parents of patients in both public (PubHS) and private (PrivHS) pediatric urology health services. Question sheets (200) were supplied to the legal guardians (LG) of patients seen in the PubHS (100) and a PrivHS (100) which have different socio-economic perspectives. LG were questioned on whether they sought on the web information about the urologic problem of their child, the kind of information sought, and whether it affected communication and the overall relationship with their physicians. LG from the PubHS had less access to the internet than those from the PrivHS (51% vs 81%, P<0.001). Overall, 44 LG (with no significant difference between PubHS and PrivHS) reported that they sought on the web information about their child's urologic disease. Out of these, 28 considered that communication with their doctor improved. There were no statistically significant differences between the PubHS and PrivHS regarding peace of mind and confidence in treatment after internet consultation. The internet is utilized by LG of patients in both the PubHS and PrivHS. Of the 44% who sought information on the web about their child's urologic disease, 64% considered that communication with the doctor improved.

Geographic differences in heart failure trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential to develop advances in heart failure (HF). The need for increasing numbers of patients (without substantial cost increase) and generalization of results led to the disappearance of international boundaries in large RCTs. The significant geographic differences in patients' characteristics, outcomes, and, most importantly, treatment effect observed in HF trials have recently been highlighted. Whether the observed regional discrepancies in HF trials are due to trial-specific issues, patient heterogeneity, structural differences in countries, or a complex interaction between factors are the questions we propose to debate in this review. To do so, we will analyse and review data from HF trials conducted in different world regions, from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and acute heart failure (AHF). Finally, we will suggest objective and actionable measures in order to mitigate regional discrepancies in future trials, particularly in HF-PEF where prognostic modifying treatments are urgently needed and in which trials are more prone to selection bias, due to a larger patient heterogeneity.

Inhibitory effects of pharmacological doses of dexamethasone on mineralization of mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro. Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, has a clinical adverse effect on bone acquisition and metabolism at pharmacological doses. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of Dex induced bone loss, we employed calvaria derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) to examine the effects of Dex on their osteoblast lineage commitment and mineralization function. MPCs were cultured up to 28 days in the presence or absence of pharmacological doses of Dex. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and von Kossa histochemical staining showed that Dex decreased ALP activity and mineralized nodule formation. In addition, Dex treatment led to inhibition of cell proliferation and a decrease of cell numbers as assessed by BrdU incorporation and MTT methods, while it increased apoptosis as shown by flow cytometry of annexin V-stained cells. These effects were associated with a marked reduction of secreted IGF-I levels as indicated by ELISA quantification, raising the possibility that Dex decreased proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MPCs through the inhibition of IGF-I secretion. To further define the effect of Dex on osteoblast lineage commitment, Runx2 and Osx, the key transcription regulators of osteogenesis, were determined at both mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, no effects were observed on mRNA and protein expression of Osx, while the mRNA and protein levels of Runx2 were inhibited by Dex treatment. Taken together, the inhibition of the expression of IGF-I and Runx2 by Dex in this in vitro system may account for the impaired MCP proliferation, osteoblastic differentiation and mineralized matrix deposition. These findings and the in vitro MCP system developed will facilitate further mechanistic studies of glucocorticoid induced bone loss.

Electroporating fields target oxidatively damaged areas in the cell membrane. Reversible electropermeabilization (electroporation) is widely used to facilitate the introduction of genetic material and pharmaceutical agents into living cells. Although considerable knowledge has been gained from the study of real and simulated model membranes in electric fields, efforts to optimize electroporation protocols are limited by a lack of detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the electropermeabilization of the complex biomolecular assembly that forms the plasma membrane. We show here, with results from both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments with living cells, that the oxidation of membrane components enhances the susceptibility of the membrane to electropermeabilization. Manipulation of the level of oxidative stress in cell suspensions and in tissues may lead to more efficient permeabilization procedures in the laboratory and in clinical applications such as electrochemotherapy and electrotransfection-mediated gene therapy.

Development of a robotic endoscope that locomotes in the colon with flexible helical fins. The purpose of this study was to develop a robotic endoscope that is low invasive, easy to operate and capable of locomotion from the rectum to the appendix in the human body. We believe that it would contribute to relieving pain in patients. We therefore developed a robotic endoscope that consists of a front and rear body with clockwise and anticlockwise helical fins, respectively. The front and rear bodies are connected via a DC motor. This robot moves forward in the colon by rotating the front body in the clockwise direction and the rear body in the anticlockwise direction. In addition, the radius of each helical fin can be changed by blowing air into a balloon implemented under each fin using an air compressor. Before experiments with animals, we performed experiments to evaluate the mechanical performance and safety of the robot. We confirmed that the maximum radius of the fins was less than the maximum radius of the colon by blowing air continuously into the balloons. We then confirmed that the robot can locomote in the colon without invasion of scratch and make short hole by performing an in-vivo experiment in live swine.

Changes in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity during walking and running of the same and different intensities. The aim was to investigate the changes in lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities, and muscle damage in the same and different exercise intensities during walking and running. Fourteen healthy males participated in this study. The subjects' individual preferred walk-to-run transition speeds (WRTS) were determined. Each subject covered a 1.5-mile distance for 4 exercise tests; walking (WRTS-W) and running (WRTS-R) tests at WRTS, 2 kmxh-1 slower walking than WRTS (WRTS-2) and 2 kmxh-1 faster running than WRTS (WRTS+2). Blood samples were taken pre, immediately, and 30 minutes post each test. The changes in (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and creatine kinase activities were measured. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight, and heart rate during exercises were significantly higher in both the WRTS-W and the WRTS+2 exercises compared with the WRTS-2 and WRTS-R. Oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were higher in walking than in the running exercise at the preferred WRTS and only WRTS-W exercise significantly increased MDA levels. Catalase activities were increased by WRTS-W, WRTS-R, and WRTS+2 exercises. Changes in SOD and CAT activities were not different between walking and running exercises at the preferred WRTS. Total plasma GSH increased in response to WRTS-W exercise, which could be associated with an increase in MDA. Also, total GSH levels 30 minutes postexercise were significantly lower than postexercise in WRTS-2, WRTS-W, and WRTS+2 exercises. Our results indicate that walking and running exercises at the preferred WRTS have different oxidative stress and antioxidant responses.


Management of spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery.

The joint subclinical elevation of CRP and IL-6 is associated with lower health-related quality of life in comparison with no elevation or elevation of only one of the biomarkers. Measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), like the Short Form (SF)-36, have been suggested to correlate with inflammatory biomarkers. It is, however, unclear whether a joint measure of two inflammatory biomarkers would bring additional information in comparison with evaluation of one inflammatory biomarker. To evaluate associations between SF-36 and low-grade inflammation in a Swedish population, with emphasis on a combined measure of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a proxy for low-grade inflammation. In a randomly selected sample of a middle-aged Swedish general population (n = 905; aged 45-69 years, 50% women), relations between SF-36 parameters and the biomarkers were tested. Regression and correlation analyses were adjusted for sex, age, presence of disease, lifestyle, and psychological factors. After adjustment for sex and age, HRQoL was significantly lower in the group with a joint elevation of CRP and IL-6 in comparison with either the group with no elevation or the groups showing elevation of one of the two biomarkers. Also after full adjustments, the combined measure of elevated CRP and IL-6, with few exceptions, was associated with significantly lower HRQoL in comparison with elevations in one of them, difference ranging from 4 (Mental Health scale) to 18 scale steps (Role-Physical scale). This study confirms that there is a relationship between HRQoL and low-grade inflammation. In particular, SF-36 scores are significantly lower in a group with joint elevation of IL-6 and CRP, in comparison with elevation of either one of them.

Dengue virus infection elicits highly polarized CX3CR1+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity. Dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly spreading pathogen with unusual pathogenesis, and correlates of protection from severe dengue disease and vaccine efficacy have not yet been established. Although DENV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses have been extensively studied, the breadth and specificity of CD4(+) T-cell responses remains to be defined. Here we define HLA-restricted CD4(+) T-cell epitopes resulting from natural infection with dengue virus in a hyperepidemic setting. Ex vivo flow-cytometric analysis of DENV-specific CD4(+) T cells revealed that the virus-specific cells were highly polarized, with a strong bias toward a CX3CR1(+) Eomesodermin(+) perforin(+) granzyme B(+) CD45RA(+) CD4 CTL phenotype. Importantly, these cells correlated with a protective HLA DR allele, and we demonstrate that these cells have direct ex vivo DENV-specific cytolytic activity. We speculate that cytotoxic dengue-specific CD4(+) T cells may play a role in the control of dengue infection in vivo, and this immune correlate may be a key target for dengue virus vaccine development.

Disulfiram induces copper-dependent stimulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in melanoma. Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. The current standard of care produces response rates of less than 20%, underscoring the critical need for identification of new effective, nontoxic therapies. Disulfiram (DSF) was identified using a drug screen as one of the several compounds that preferentially decreased proliferation in multiple melanoma subtypes compared with benign melanocytes. DSF, a member of the dithiocarbamate family, is a copper (Cu) chelator, and Cu has been shown previously to enhance DSF-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells. Here, we report that in the presence of free Cu, DSF inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in a panel of cell lines representing primary and metastatic nodular and superficial spreading melanoma. Both decreased cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis were seen at 50-500 nmol/l DSF concentrations that are achievable through oral dosing of the medication. In the presence of Cu, DSF caused activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis as measured by caspase-8 cleavage. The addition of Z-IETD-FMK, a selective caspase-8 inhibitor, was protective against DSF-Cu-induced apoptosis. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to DSF-Cu treatment preceded the induction of apoptosis. Both ROS production and apoptosis were prevented by coincubation of N-acetyl cysteine, a free radical scavenger. Our study shows that DSF might be used to target both nodular and superficial spreading melanoma through ROS production and activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.

Adrenergic stimulation promotes T-wave alternans and arrhythmia inducibility in a TNF-alpha genetic mouse model of congestive heart failure. T-wave alternans (TWA) is a proarrhythmic repolarization instability that is common in congestive heart failure (CHF). Although transgenic mice are commonly used to study the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in CHF, little is known about the dynamics of TWA in these species. We hypothesized that TWA is present in a TNF-alpha model of CHF and can be further promoted by adrenergic stimulation. We studied 16 TNF-alpha mice and 12 FVB controls using 1) in vivo intracardiac electrophysiological testing and 2) ambulatory telemetry during 30 min before and after an intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol. TWA was examined using both linear and nonlinear filtering applied in the time domain. In addition, changes in the mean amplitude of the T wave and area under the T wave were computed. During intracardiac electrophysiological testing, none of the animals had TWA or inducible arrhythmias before the injection of isoproterenol. After the injection, sustained TWA and inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias were observed in TNF-alpha mice but not in FVB mice. In ambulatory telemetry, before the isoproterenol injection, the cardiac cycle length (CL) was longer in TNF-alpha mice than in FVB mice (98 +/- 9 and 88 +/- 3 ms, P = 0.04). After the injection of isoproterenol, the CL became 8% and 6% shorter in TNF-alpha and FVB mice (P < 10(-4)); however, the 2% difference between the groups in the magnitude of CL changes was not significant. In TNF-alpha mice, the magnitude of TWA was 1.5-2 times greater than in FVB mice both before and after the isoproterenol injection. The magnitude of TWA increased significantly after the isoproterenol injection compared with the baseline in TNF-alpha mice (P = 0.003) but not in FVB mice. The mean amplitude of the T wave and area under the T wave increased 60% and 80% in FVB mice (P = 0.006 and 0.009) but not in TNF-alpha mice. In conclusion, TWA is present in a TNF-alpha model of CHF and can be further promoted by adrenergic stimulation, along with the enhanced susceptibility for ventricular arrhythmias.

Surveillance of HIV type 1 drug resistance among naive patients from Venezuela. We have studied 65 HIV-1-infected untreated patients recruited in Caracas, Venezuela with TCD4 counts > or =350/microl. The reverse transcriptase and protease sequences of the virus were sequenced, aligned with reference HIV-1 group M strains, and analyzed for drug resistance mutations. Most of the viruses were subtype B genotype in both the protease and RT genomic regions. Five of the 62 virus isolates successfully amplified showed evidence of recombination between protease and RT, with their protease region being non-B while their RT region was derived from subtype B. Four strains were found bearing resistance mutations either to NRTIs, NNRTIs, or PIs. The prevalence of HIV-1 isolates bearing resistance mutations was therefore above the 5% threshold of WHO.

Clinicopathological characteristics of immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly recognized fibro-inflammatory condition. Forty-two cases with immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis (IgG4-RS) confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment were studied to clarify the clinicopathologic characteristics of the salivary glands involved in IgG4-RS, especially the relationship between the histopathologic features and function of salivary glands or serum levels of IgG4. Clinical, serologic, imaging and histopathological data of these cases were analyzed. CT volumes of submandibular, parotid, and lacrimal glands were calculated. The saliva flow rate was measured. Scintigraphy with 99mTc-pertechnetate was undertaken in 31 cases, and the concentration index (CI) and secretion index (SI) was calculated. Relationships between fibrosis severity and salivary gland function or serum IgG4 levels were analyzed. The first symptom was swelling of bilateral submandibular or lacrimal glands. Physical examination showed multiple bilateral major salivary glands (including sublingual and accessory parotid glands) and lacrimal glands were enlarged in IgG4 RS. Multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted in 30 patients. Saliva flow at rest was lower than normal in 34 cases; stimulated saliva flow was lower than normal in 15 cases. Secretory function was reduced more severely in the submandibular glands than in the parotid glands. Serum levels of IgG4 were elevated in 95.2% of cases and 78.6% patients had increased IgE levels. Serum IgG4 level was higher and saliva secretion lower as glandular fibrosis increased. Prominent changes in the morphology, histology, immunohistochemistry and secretion of the major salivary glands of IgG4-RS patients were accompanied by involvement of the lacrimal glands and cervical lymph nodes. Elevated IgE, allergic history, eosinophil infiltration suggest allergic reactions as a potential pathogenesis of IgG4-RS. Severity of glandular fibrosis correlated with salivary function and serum levels of IgG4.

Impedance cardiography for cuffless and non-invasive measurement of systolic blood pressure. In this study, we have used impedance cardiography to determine blood pressure (BP) cufflessly and non-invasively. We have devised a new parameter, QdZ [the duration measured from the foot of electrocardiogram (ECG) Q wave to the peak of impedance cardiogram (ICG)], for this purpose. Twenty-two subjects performed four minutes of treadmill exercise such that systolic BP (SBP) was increased significantly. We found that SBP was closely correlated with QdZ (R(2)=0.65) demonstrating the potential application of ICG to cuffless and non-invasive BP measurement.

Articular cartilage imaging by the use of phase-contrast tomography in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the use of phase-contrast computed tomographic (CT) imaging for the identification of articular cartilage abnormalities of the knees in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Arthritis was induced in nine male DBA/1 J mice by the intradermal injection of collagen. After 50 days, the nine mice were sacrificed, along with four mice that did not receive intradermal injections of collagen. Phase-contrast CT imaging using a microfocus x-ray source of the entire knee was performed. The images were evaluated by two blinded readers, and histopathologic grades were considered the reference standard. The phase-contrast CT images of cartilage were graded 0, I, or II. Evaluation of the grading agreement between the phase-contrast CT images and histopathologic findings was performed using correlation analysis. Phase-contrast CT images highly reflected the subchondral bone status in the assessment of articular cartilage abnormalities in the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Three-dimensional reformed images showed the articular surface and subchondral bony status of the knee joints. On the basis of the histopathology of the 26 knee joints, 12 joints were grade 0, six joints were grade I, and eight joints were grade II. Grading agreement between the use of the phase-contrast CT images and histopathologic results was high (r = 0.76). Phase-contrast CT imaging using a microfocus x-ray source offers a promising tool for the assessment of articular cartilage abnormalities of the knees in a mouse model.

Outcomes in microsurgery. The reporting of microsurgical outcomes has been variable. Historically, emphasis has been placed on flap and digit survival or failure in the case of free-tissue transfer or digit replantation, respectively. Outcomes have also been measured with indices such as range of motion or grip strength for digital replantations, the ability to eat or talk for head and neck microsurgery, and the ability to walk or return to work for lower extremity microsurgery. Although relevant, this type of reporting of outcomes may fail to capture the effectiveness of microsurgical intervention from the patient's, the third-party payer's, or society's perspective. Significant events have arisen in the past two decades, including the emphasis on outcomes research, recent recommendations to adopt evidence-based microsurgery, and the inclusion in academic training programs of the competency "manager" to the health care system. This necessitates rethinking the way we report outcomes in microsurgery. This article explains the need to (1) use health-related quality-of-life scales to measure the benefits of microsurgical interventions, (2) measure outcomes with high-quality clinical research designs, and (3) incorporate proper cost-effectiveness studies in our clinical research before adopting new technologies such as new free flaps or techniques.

Efficient production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate using engineered Escherichia coli. A metabolically engineered Escherichia coli has been constructed for the production of xylitol, one of the top 12 platform chemicals from agricultural sources identified by the US Department of Energy. An optimal plasmid was constructed to express xylose reductase from Neurospora crassa with almost no inclusion bodies at relatively high temperature. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system (ptsG) was disrupted to eliminate catabolite repression and allow simultaneous uptake of glucose and xylose. The native pathway for D-xylose catabolism in E. coli W3110 was blocked by deleting the xylose isomerase (xylA) and xylulose kinase (xylB) genes. The putative pathway for xylitol phosphorylation was also blocked by disrupting the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent fructose phosphotransferase system (ptsF). The xylitol producing recombinant E. coli allowed production of 172.4 g L(-1) xylitol after 110 h of fed-batch cultivation with an average productivity of 1.57 g L(-1) h(-1). The molar yield of xylitol to glucose reached approximately 2.2 (mol xylitol mol(-1) glucose). Furthermore, the recombinant strain also produced about 150 g L(-1) xylitol from hemicellulosic sugars in modified M9 minimal medium and the overall productivity was 1.40 g L(-1) h(-1), representing the highest xylitol concentration and productivity reported to date from hemicellulosic sugars using bacteria. Thus, this engineered E. coli is a candidate for the development of efficient industrial-scale production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate.

[Chronic bronchitis: prevalence and quality of life. Analysis of data from the French Health Interview Survey 2002-2003]. Chronic bronchitis is associated with an increased risk of COPD and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of chronic bronchitis and to describe its relations with quality of life. The French Health Interview Survey was conducted in 2003 in a representative sample of households. Data were collected during an interviewer's visits to the home. Respiratory symptoms and HRQoL (SF-36) were assessed in 9,050 adults aged 45 years and older using a self-administered questionnaire. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis was estimated at 3.5%. Chronic bronchitis was associated with an impaired physical component summary score after adjusting for sex, age and dyspnoea. It was associated with a reduced mental component summary score (MCS) among men. In women, this association was only significant in the absence of dyspnoea. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis was 3.5% among adults aged 45 years and older. Chronic bronchitis was associated with impairment in health-related quality of life.


Evidence from knockout mice that neuropeptide-Y Y2 and Y4 receptor signalling prevents long-term depression-like behaviour caused by immune challenge.

Alopecia in epidermolysis bullosa. Hair abnormalities observed in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) are of variable severity and include mild hair shaft abnormalities, patchy cicatricial alopecia, cicatricial alopecia with a male pattern distribution, and alopecia universalis. Alopecia is usually secondary to blistering, and scalp areas more exposed to friction, such as the occipital area, are involved more frequently. This article reviews the hair abnormalities reported in the different subtypes of EB.

Exogenous carbon monoxide protects the bystander Chinese hamster ovary cells in mixed coculture system after alpha-particle irradiation. In the present work, the inhibitory effect of carbon monoxide (CO), generated by tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer [CO-releasing molecule (CORM-2)], on the toxicity of radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) after alpha-particle irradiation was studied in a mixed coculture system. CO (CORM-2) treatment showed a significant inhibitory effect to the formation of p53 binding protein 1 (BP1) and micronuclei (MN) induced by RIBE in a concentration-dependent manner, but in the directly irradiated cell population no distinct decreases of BP1 and MN formation were observed. In this mixed coculture system, nitric oxide (NO) or superoxide anion (O2(*-)) was also proved to mediate the transduction of RIBE by using a NO synthase inhibitor or NADPH-oxidase-specific inhibitor treatment. The elevated O2(*-) was attenuated by CO (CORM-2) treatment in the bystander cells as measured by hydroethidine staining and fluorescence assessment. The exogenous NO (sper) or O2(*-) (H2O2) was used to mimic NO/O(2)-mediated RIBE, and CO (CORM-2) treatment also showed a protective effect to cells against the toxicity of these exogenous factors. Considering the inhibitory effect of CO on RIBE and the wide use of CO in therapy of diseases, it is hoped that a low concentration of CO can protect normal tissues against RIBE during radiotherapy.

Neuropsychological performance in childhood OCD: a preliminary study. Neuropsychological deficits have often been found in studies of adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). However, few studies have examined such impairment in children with OCD and of those studies published, the results are mixed. In the present study, 14 OCD children were compared to 24 healthy developing children of similar age and intellectual ability on a series of neuropsychological tests that assess response inhibition, abstract reasoning and problem solving, planning ability, verbal and nonverbal fluency, working memory, attention and information processing speed, and visual and verbal memory and learning. No significant differences emerged between the children with OCD and healthy controls for working memory, verbal fluency, attention, information processing speed, concept formation/abstraction, and response inhibition. We observed some deficits and a trend toward performance differences between the groups for psychomotor speed and attention, cognitive flexibility, nonverbal fluency, planning ability, and verbal memory and learning. Results are partially consistent with those found in adults with OCD. Findings were not related to depressive symptoms or self-report feeling of anxiety. This preliminary survey indicates that OCD children may have deficits for cognitive flexibility and planning ability and differ from adults with OCD in not presenting with poor response inhibition or memory deficits. Larger, multi-site studies are warranted to help delineate the neurocognitive deficits associated with childhood OCD.

Exploring the potentialities of an improved ultrasound-assisted quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe-based extraction technique combined with ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection for determination of Zearalenone in cereals. Zearalenone (ZEA), a secondary metabolite from Fusarium graminearum fungi that invade crops and grow during blooming in moist cool field conditions, is a nonsteroidal oestrogen, biologically very potent, although hardly toxic. Different analytical methods, among which a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) strategy, combined with or liquid chromatography, have been proposed for ZEA determination in foods. However, this extraction procedure has the disadvantage of using large amount of organic solvents, partitioning salts and sample volume, which limits the technique application on the fields where the sample amount is critical. Therefore in this work an improved sample preparation step based on the original QuEChERS (O-QuEChERS) approach, the μ-QuEChERS, combined with ultrasound-assisted extraction (USAE) and ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis with fluorescence detection (FLR) is proposed for the sensitive and high-throughput quantification of ZEA in cereals. The proposed analytical strategy, μ-QuEChERSUSAE, uses up to 32 times lower amounts of partitioning salts, lower sample amount and lower extraction solvents, in comparison with O-QuEChERS technique. The performance of the analytical approach was assessed by studying the selectivity, specificity, limits of detection and quantification, linear dynamic range, matrix effect and precision. Good linearity (r(2)>0.99) was achieved for ZEA, and limits of detection (LOD=3.4μgkg(-1)) and limits of quantification (LOQ=4.7μgkg(-1)) were found below the tolerance levels set by European Commission. Good recoveries were obtained with different spiked concentrations, ranged from 80.2% to 109.7%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 5.0%. The comparison of the analytical performance of the proposed μ-QuEChERSUSAE with O-QuEChERS showed the powerful ability of the proposed strategy since it gives comparable results but using lower amounts of sample, partitioning salts and volume of the organic solvent, revealing of great potential and improvement of the proposed method. 

Characterization of volatile compounds in Astraeus spp. Astraeus spp. is consumed in several regions of Southeast Asia. C(8) compounds, including 1-octen-3-ol, are the main volatile compounds in fresh Astraeus spp. Other compounds typical of edible mushrooms, such as terpenoids and sulfur-containing compounds, were not detected in fresh Astraeus spp. The amounts of fatty acids, including linoleic acid, substantially decreased after homogenization of fresh Astraeus spp. This high metabolic activity possibly correlates with formation of the C(8) volatiles. Heating the mushrooms produced cyclohexene compounds, 2-n-pentyl-furan, furanyl compounds, and benzaldehyde.

Hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with stasis dermatitis and ulcer: a novel finding with important therapeutic implications. Although homocysteine (Hcy) has profound effects concerning vascular lesions and thrombosis, it has not previously been investigated in patients with stasis dermatitis and ulcer. To evaluate plasma Hcy levels in patients with stasis dermatitis and ulcer. A total of 25 patients (17 male, eight female; mean age of 36 +/- 5.97 years) with stasis dermatitis, 40 patients with stasis ulcer (27 male, 13 female; mean age of 38.5 +/- 7.96 years) and 35 healthy control individuals (25 male, 10 female; mean age of 36.9 +/- 6.49 years) were included in this study. Patients taking vitamin supplements or patients with folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus, chronic hepatitis, renal failure and chronic alcoholism which might affect Hcy levels were excluded from the study. Hcy levels were found to be elevated in patients with stasis dermatitis (p = 0.00) and stasis ulcer (p = 0.00) compared to healthy controls with a median (range) of 19.1 micromol/l (15-28), 18.98 micromol/l (15-29), and 8.1 micromol/l (5-12.2), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in Hcy level in patients with stasis dermatitis and ulcer (p = 0.877). As hyperhomocysteinemia can be treated by selected vitamin supplementation even in patients with normal serum vitamin concentrations, ulcer formation might be prevented by lowering Hcy in the clinical stage of stasis dermatitis.

Functionalized PDMS with Versatile and Scalable Surface Roughness Gradients for Cell Culture. This manuscript describes a simple and versatile approach to engineering surface roughness gradients via combination of microfluidics and photopolymerization. Through UV-mediated polymerization, N-isopropylacrylamide with concentration gradients are successfully grafted onto PDMS surface, leading to diverse roughness degrees on the obtained PDMS substrate. Furthermore, the extent of surface roughness can be controllably regulated via tuning the flow rate ratio between the monomer solution and deionized water. Average roughness ranging from 2.6±0.7 nm to 163.6±11.7 nm has been well-achieved in this work. Such PDMS samples are also demonstrated to be capable of working as supporting substrates for controlling cell adhesion or detachment. Because of the different degrees of surface roughness on a single substrate, our method provides an effective approach for designing advanced surfaces for cell culture. Finally, the thermosensitive property of N-isopropylacrylamide makes our sample furnish as another means for controlling the cell detachment from the substrates with correspondence to the surrounding temperature.

Is a nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis using the modified Kakita method a safe procedure? After standardization of the perioperative management of pancreaticoduodenectomy, we retrospectively compared results in nonstented pancreaticojejunostomy with external-stented pancreaticojejunostomy. The study population included 129 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 2004 and 2008. The postoperative mortality and morbidity were compared between 51 patients with restrictive use of external stenting (group A) and 78 patients without external stenting (group B). The patient with a pancreatic duct of less than 3 mm in diameter was 31% in group A and 46% in group B. There were no differences in postoperative morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups. Although the frequency of overall postoperative pancreatic fistula development was significantly higher in group B than in group A (44% vs 27%, P = 0.0004), there was no difference in grade B/C postoperative pancreatic fistula rate (group A: 5.9% vs group B: 14.1%). The length of in-hospital stay in group B was significantly shorter than group A (13 vs 24 days, P < 0.0001). There were no differences in postoperative morbidity and mortality between subgroups that were consisted of patients with small pancreatic duct diameter. This retrospective single-center study showed that nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis was a safe procedure and was associated with a shortened in-hospital stay.

A computational model of cardiovascular physiology and heart sound generation. A computational model of the cardiovascular system is described which provides a framework for implementing and testing quantitative physiological models of heart sound generation. The lumped-parameter cardiovascular model can be solved for the hemodynamic variables on which the heart sound generation process is built. Parameters of the cardiovascular model can be adjusted to represent various normal and pathological conditions, and the acoustic consequences of those adjustments can be explored. The combined model of the physiology of cardiovascular circulation and heart sound generation has promise for application in teaching, training and algorithm development in computer-aided auscultation of the heart.

Microbial endocrinology as a basis for improved L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's patients treated for Helicobacter pylori. Antibiotic therapy to eradicate Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of gastric and duodenal ulcers, has been suggested to improve L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's and thereby improve patient symptomology. To date, there has been no proven mechanism to explain the purported benefit of treatment of H. pylori in the management of Parkinson's disease. I propose the hypothesis, and provide initial data, that the mechanism of action is due to direct utilization of L-DOPA by H. pylori to maintain its ecological niche within the gastrointestinal tract. In support of this hypothesis, data is presented which demonstrates for the first time the ability of L-DOPA to influence the in vitro growth of H. pylori in an iron-restricted minimal medium. H. pylori utilization of L-DOPA for its own growth requirement reduces the amount of per orally administered L-DOPA that would be available to the patient for the treatment of Parkinson's disease-related pathology. Neuroendocrine-mediated interactions with bacteria represent the emerging interdisciplinary field of microbial endocrinology. Thus, microbial endocrinology provides for a mechanism between L-DOPA and H. pylori with which to explain the purported benefit of H. pylori-directed antibiotic therapy to improve L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's patients and thereby improve drug therapy management. Further, if other bacterial species within the gastrointestinal tract depend on the availability of L-DOPA or other similar neuroendocrine-based drugs for their survival, then the efficacy of such neuroendocrine-based drugs not restricted solely for the management of parkinsonian symptomology may also be adversely affected and may therefore justify the use of an antibiotic regimen to eradicate them.

Gatekeeper residues in the major curlin subunit modulate bacterial amyloid fiber biogenesis. Amyloid fibers are filamentous protein structures commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike disease-associated amyloids, which are the products of protein misfolding, Escherichia coli assemble membrane-anchored functional amyloid fibers called curli. Curli fibers are composed of two proteins, CsgA and CsgB. In vivo, the polymerization of the major curli subunit protein, CsgA, is dependent on CsgB-mediated nucleation. The amyloid core of CsgA features five imperfect repeats (R1-R5), and R1 and R5 govern CsgA responsiveness to CsgB nucleation and self-seeding by CsgA fibers. Here, the specificity of bacterial amyloid nucleation was probed, revealing that certain aspartic acid and glycine residues inhibit the intrinsic aggregation propensities and nucleation responsiveness of R2, R3, and R4. These residues function as "gatekeepers" to modulate CsgA polymerization efficiency and potential toxicity. A CsgA molecule lacking gatekeeper residues polymerized in vitro significantly faster than wild-type CsgA and polymerized in vivo in the absence of the nucleation machinery, resulting in mislocalized fibers. This uncontrolled polymerization was associated with cytotoxicity, suggesting that incorrectly regulated CsgA polymerization was detrimental to the cell.

Reaction of nitrite with human fetal oxyhemoglobin: a model simulation study with implications for blood flow regulation in sickle cell disease (SCD). Nitrite can react in parallel with adult oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbA), resulting in oxidative denitrosylation of nitrosyl-hemoglobin and rapid dissociation of nitric oxide. Here, simulation studies are presented using a new model to analyze data in the literature comparing the reaction of nitrite with isolated human oxy-HbA, oxy-fetal hemoglobin (oxy-HbF) and oxy-Hb Bart's (a gamma-chain tetramer). The results show that the kinetic constant at the rate-limiting step is 25-fold larger for the reaction of human oxy-HbF, and 63-fold larger for oxy-Hb Bart's both compared to oxy-HbA. This analysis suggests that red cells containing oxy-HbF (F-cells) should have accelerated oxidative denitrosylation. Thus, high levels of HbF present or induced in individuals homozygous for sickle cell disease may serve two functions: (a) the classical function, to directly inhibit polymerization of deoxy sickle hemoglobin, and (b) a novel function, enhanced vasodilation.

Normal human epithelial cells regulate the size and morphology of tissue-engineered capillaries. The survival of thick tissues/organs produced by tissue engineering requires rapid revascularization after grafting. Although capillary-like structures have been reconstituted in some engineered tissues, little is known about the interaction between normal epithelial cells and endothelial cells involved in the in vitro angiogenic process. In the present study, we used the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering to examine this relationship. An endothelialized tissue-engineered dermal substitute was produced by adding endothelial cells to the tissue-engineered dermal substitute produced by the self-assembly approach. The latter consists in culturing fibroblasts in the medium supplemented with serum and ascorbic acid. A network of tissue-engineered capillaries (TECs) formed within the human extracellular matrix produced by dermal fibroblasts. To determine whether epithelial cells modify TECs, the size and form of TECs were studied in the endothelialized tissue-engineered dermal substitute cultured in the presence or absence of epithelial cells. In the presence of normal keratinocytes from skin, cornea or uterine cervix, endothelial cells formed small TECs (cross-sectional area estimated at less than 50 microm(2)) reminiscent of capillaries found in the skin's microcirculation. In contrast, TECs grown in the absence of epithelial cells presented variable sizes (larger than 50 microm(2)), but the addition of keratinocyte-conditioned media or exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor induced their normalization toward a smaller size. Vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization inhibited the effect of keratinocyte-conditioned media. These results provide new direct evidence that normal human epithelial cells play a role in the regulation of the underlying TEC network, and advance our knowledge in tissue engineering for the production of TEC networks in vitro.

Differential responses in yield of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) and nightshade (Solanum retroflexum Dun.) to the application of three animal manures. Crop responses to different manures differs considerably, however, the factors responsible for it have not been conclusively elucidated. Consequently, this study examined the biomass response of Cucurbita maxima and Solanum retroflexum to application rates of chicken and kraal manures of cattle and goat, and soil factors related to salinity. The crops' biomass yield increased linearly with increase in application rates of kraal and chicken manures, but steeper in the latter. Results showed that significant decline in biomass yield in chicken manure at rates above 8.5 tons ha(-1) were not due to salinity. The crops' response to cattle and goat kraal manures was linear but polynomial (cubic) in layer chicken manure. It was concluded that the yield decline in chicken manure was due to other manure factors except salinity, probably toxicity effect of the manure fatty acids. Further research was however, recommended to elucidate this claim.

Down-regulation of miR-27a might reverse multidrug resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. So far, the miRNAs involved in multidrug resistance of esophageal cancer have not been reported. Here we have firstly investigated the roles of miR-27a in multidrug resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using MTT assay, flow cytometry assay, and reporter gene assay, etc. Down-regulation of miR-27a could confer sensitivity of both P-glycoprotein-related and P-glycoprotein-non-related drugs on esophageal cancer cells, and might promote ADR-induced apoptosis, accompanied by increased accumulation and decreased releasing amount of ADR. Down-regulation of miR-27a could significantly decrease the expression of P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, and the transcription of the multidrug resistance gene 1, but up-regulate the expression of Bax. MiR-27a might play important roles in multidrug resistance of esophageal cancer. The further study of the biological functions of miR-27a might be helpful for developing possible strategies to treat esophageal cancer.

[Remote cerebellar hemorrhage after cervical spinal surgery: two case reports and literature review]. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) following spinal surgery is extremely rare. We present two cases of RCH following cervical spinal surgery. The first case is a 71-year-old female. She underwent surgery for atlantoaxial subluxation and a subcutaneous suction drain was placed. Three hours after surgery, she became comatose and computed tomography (CT) revealed RCH. The second case is a 51-year-old female. She underwent surgery for ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine. Intraoperatively, the dura was opened unintentionally and a subcutaneous suction drain was placed. She complained of a severe headache and nausea postoperatively, and CT obtained two days after the surgery demonstrated RCH. In both cases, drains contained much fluid, which was assumed to be consistent with cerebrospinal fluid. Both cases were managed conservatively and displayed no cerebellar symptoms on discharge. Rapid loss of a great amount of cerebrospinal fluid might be the causative factor of RCH. RCH might occur after any type of spinal surgery with dural tear or intradural manipulation. Early diagnosis is particularly important for the treatment of RCH following spinal surgery and spinal drainage might be useful to manage cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Microstructure, mechanical properties and bio-corrosion properties of Mg-Si(-Ca, Zn) alloy for biomedical application. Mg-Si alloy was investigated for biomedical application due to the biological function of Si in the human body. However, Mg-Si alloy showed a low ductility due to the presence of coarse Mg(2)Si. Ca and Zn elements were used to refine and modify the morphology of Mg(2)Si in order to improve the corrosion resistance and the mechanical properties. The cell toxicity of Mg, Zn and Ca metals was assessed by an MTT test. The test results indicated that increasing the concentrations of Mg, Zn and Ca ions did not cause cell toxicity, which showed that the release of these three elements would not lead to cell toxicity. Then, microstructure, mechanical properties and bio-corrosion properties of as-cast Mg-Si(-Ca, Zn) alloys were investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy, mechanical properties testing and electrochemical measurement. Ca element can slightly refine the grain size and the morphology Mg(2)Si phase in Mg-Si alloy. The bio-corrosion resistance of Mg-Si alloys was improved by the addition of Ca due to the reduction and refinement of Mg(2)Si phase; however, no improvement was observed in the strength and elongation. The addition of 1.6% Zn to Mg-0.6Si can modify obviously the morphology of Mg(2)Si phase from course eutectic structure to a small dot or short bar shape. As a result, tensile strength, elongation and bio-corrosion resistance were all improved significantly; especially, the elongation improved by 115.7%. It was concluded that Zn element was one of the best alloying elements of Mg-Si alloy for biomedical application.


Diffusion-weighted imaging of the rectosigmoid colon: preliminary findings.

The effect of frequency-dependent microphone directionality on horizontal localization performance in hearing-aid users. Frequency-dependent microphone directionality alters the spectral shape of sound as a function of arrival azimuth. The influence of this on horizontal-plane localization performance was investigated. Using a 360 degrees loudspeaker array and five stimuli with different spectral characteristics, localization performance was measured on 21 hearing-impaired listeners when wearing no hearing aids and aided with no directionality, partial (from 1 and 2 kHz) directionality, and full directionality. The test schemes were also evaluated in everyday life. Without hearing aids, localization accuracy was significantly poorer than normative data. Due to inaudibility of high-frequency energy, front/back reversals were prominent. Front/back reversals remained prominent when aided with omnidirectional microphones. For stimuli with low-frequency emphasis, directionality had no further effect on localization. For stimuli with sufficient mid- and high-frequency information, full directionality had a small positive effect on front/back localization but a negative effect on left/right localization. Partial directionality further improved front/back localization and had no significant effect on left/right localization. The field test revealed no significant effects. The alternative spectral cues provided by frequency-dependent directionality improve front/back localization in hearing-aid users.

[Features of lipid peroxidation in rats of different age with postinfarction cardiosclerosis]. Results of research of a state of lipid peroxidation (LP) system at rats by age of 4 and 12 months with postinfarction cardiosclerosis are presented in this work. It has been shown, that in the remote terms after an experimental myocardium infarct, age-dependent alteration of the LP and antioxidizing enzymes activity were observed. Also distinction in expressiveness of the LP processes in the intact animals in these age groups was revealed. Such age features probably cause various intensities of the LP and the state of antioxidant protection at postinfarction remodeling of heart.

Biological diversity of prokaryotic type IV secretion systems. Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) translocate DNA and protein substrates across prokaryotic cell envelopes generally by a mechanism requiring direct contact with a target cell. Three types of T4SS have been described: (i) conjugation systems, operationally defined as machines that translocate DNA substrates intercellularly by a contact-dependent process; (ii) effector translocator systems, functioning to deliver proteins or other macromolecules to eukaryotic target cells; and (iii) DNA release/uptake systems, which translocate DNA to or from the extracellular milieu. Studies of a few paradigmatic systems, notably the conjugation systems of plasmids F, R388, RP4, and pKM101 and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system, have supplied important insights into the structure, function, and mechanism of action of type IV secretion machines. Information on these systems is updated, with emphasis on recent exciting structural advances. An underappreciated feature of T4SS, most notably of the conjugation subfamily, is that they are widely distributed among many species of gram-negative and -positive bacteria, wall-less bacteria, and the Archaea. Conjugation-mediated lateral gene transfer has shaped the genomes of most if not all prokaryotes over evolutionary time and also contributed in the short term to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other virulence traits among medically important pathogens. How have these machines adapted to function across envelopes of distantly related microorganisms? A survey of T4SS functioning in phylogenetically diverse species highlights the biological complexity of these translocation systems and identifies common mechanistic themes as well as novel adaptations for specialized purposes relating to the modulation of the donor-target cell interaction.

New dose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of patients with large tumour volumes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to be 17%, with 2% lethal RP. The aim of this study was to monitor the incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 beam arrangements and introduced in three phases. In phase I, 12 patients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited to 40%. In phase II, 25 patients were treated with an additional dose constraint of mean lung dose (MLD) ≤ 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constraint (V5) in which the total lung volume receiving a dose of 5 Gy was ≤ 60%. RP was prospectively documented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2). The median follow-up time was 17 months. The introduction of IMRT was associated with an increase in the incidence of RP in Phase I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Introducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses ≤ 20 Gy from 51 ± 2% to 41 ± 1% (p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 constraint did not decrease the incidence of severe (grade ≥ 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4% (two of 50 patients), p = 0.05. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volume of lung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumonitis.

Early induction of hypothermia during cardiac arrest improves neurological outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who undergo emergency cardiopulmonary bypass and percutaneous coronary intervention. Therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has demonstrated neurological benefits. Although early cooling during cardiac arrest enhances efficacy in animal studies, few clinical studies are available. The 171 patients who failed to respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation were studied prospectively. Patients underwent emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) plus intra-aortic balloon pumping, with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if needed. Mild hypothermia (34 degrees C for 3 days) was induced during cardiac arrest or after return of spontaneous circulation. Of the 171 patients, 21 (12.3%) had a favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge. An unadjusted rate of favorable outcome decreased in a stepwise fashion for increasing quartiles of collapse-to-34 degrees C interval (P=0.016). An adjusted odds ratio for favorable outcome after collapse-to-CPB interval was 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.97) and after CPB-to-34 degrees C interval, 0.99 (95%CI 0.98-0.99) when collapse-to-34 degrees C interval was divided into 2 components. Favorable neurological accuracy of a collapse-to-CPB interval at a cutoff of 55.5 min and CPB-to-34 degrees C interval at a cutoff of 21.5 min was 85.4% and 89.5%, respectively. Early attainment of a core temperature had neurological benefits for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent CPB and PCI. (Circ J 2010; 74: 77 - 85).

Metazoan tRNA introns generate stable circular RNAs in vivo. We report the discovery of a class of abundant circular noncoding RNAs that are produced during metazoan tRNA splicing. These transcripts, termed tRNA intronic circular (tric)RNAs, are conserved features of animal transcriptomes. Biogenesis of tricRNAs requires anciently conserved tRNA sequence motifs and processing enzymes, and their expression is regulated in an age-dependent and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, we exploited this biogenesis pathway to develop an in vivo expression system for generating "designer" circular RNAs in human cells. Reporter constructs expressing RNA aptamers such as Spinach and Broccoli can be used to follow the transcription and subcellular localization of tricRNAs in living cells. Owing to the superior stability of circular vs. linear RNA isoforms, this expression system has a wide range of potential applications, from basic research to pharmaceutical science.

System to improve AED resuscitation using interactive CPR coaching. A positive impact on cardiac arrest survival has been demonstrated with the substantial reduction in time to defibrillation provided by the widespread deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). However, recent studies have identified the importance of performing chest compressions before defibrillation in facilitating effective recovery from long duration ventricular fibrillation (VF). Despite the importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), effective performance of it in the field is hampered by many problems including the dependence on rescuer technique, which is known to be variable even with trained professionals. This research seeks to enhance survival outcomes following resuscitation. A full experimental system was developed that used an instrumented CPR manikin to provide interactive CPR coaching while collecting performance data. This system was utilized in a controlled human CPR performance study comparing the differences in chest compression performance with and without visual coaching and with and without interactive performance feedback coaching. Results from the human study support a number of conclusions and recommendations. In general using any type of coaching provided improvements in all of the CPR performance measures excluding chest recoil where there was a slight decrease in performance. The statistical results also indicated that the audio/visual coaching conditions provided a more effective coaching condition with respect to chest compression rate. Most notably, the feedback conditions both provided a statistically significant or trends toward improving chest compression effectiveness and produced superior performance as a whole.

Minimizing intracochlear trauma during cochlear implantation. Several clinical trials have now demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of ipsilateral bimodal electric and acoustic stimulation of the auditory system for patients with varying degrees of hearing loss. Surgical techniques employed as a part of these investigations have been similar and focus on the implementation of atraumatic surgical principles. Each procedural step aims at minimizing intracochlear damage. A cochleostomy site inferior and slightly anterior to the round window membrane forms the basis for creating an opening into the scala tympani that avoids the critical structures of the inner ear. Electrode arrays have also been developed and refined to allow for relatively limited insertion-related damage. Using these specialized approaches, hearing preservation rates approaching 90% have been achieved. While impressive, this number reflects the conservation of only some degree of residual hearing. Complete preservation of hearing without any loss in pure tone thresholds and/ or discrimination abilities remains unusual, especially in subjects that have received a full-turn insertion. Thus, further work is clearly needed to optimize surgical protocols in an attempt to achieve total hearing preservation in all cases. A variety of biological and technological areas of investigation hold promise for fulfilling these goals. This report will review the current state of hearing preservation cochlear implantation as it relates to combined ipsi-lateral bimodal or electric acoustic stimulation.


Hand processing depends on the implicit access to a spatially and bio-mechanically organized structural description of the body.

High-sensitive flow-based kinetic exclusion assay for okadaic acid assessment in shellfish samples. Episodes of shellfish contamination with okadaic acid (OA) are a human health threat that is causing increasing concern. As a way to overcome the shortcomings involved in the reference methods of analysis set by legislations, alternative procedures are envisaged. This paper describes the development of different immunosensors for the analysis of OA, focusing on the comparison of their sensitivity, precision, ease of use and sample matrix effects. Initially, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunosensor was developed, which enabled the quantification of the toxin in mussel samples at concentrations in the range of the 160 microg kg(-1) European regulatory limit with good percentages of recovery. Nevertheless, calibration curves with spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effects could not be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based on kinetic exclusion measurements was developed achieving the theoretical lowest limit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA antibody (IC(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in the assay solution). This highly sensitive automated system allows rapid and reliable OA quantification, with no significant matrix effects for the analysis of spiked mussel and scallop samples. Performance features such as high sensitivity and precision, low limits of detection and simplicity of the analysis protocol, shows the biosensing-systems based on kinetic exclusion measurements for toxin detection in shellfish samples as highly performing tools for rapid and continuous screening.

Effect of mitral isthmus block on development of atrial tachycardia following ablation for atrial fibrillation. Successful mitral isthmus (MI) ablation may reduce recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia (AT) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for AF. To determine if achieving bidirectional MI conduction block (MIB) during circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) plus left atrial linear ablation (LALA) affects development of AT. Sixty consecutive patients with persistent (n = 25) or paroxysmal (n = 35) AF undergoing CPVA plus LALA at the MI and LA roof were evaluated in a prospective, nonrandomized study. PVI was achieved in all patients. Bidirectional MI block was achieved in 50 of 60 patients (83%). During 18 +/- 5 months follow-up, 12 patients (20%) developed recurrent AF and 15 (25%) developed AT. Patients in whom MIB was not achieved at initial ablation had four times higher risk of developing AT (P = 0.008, 95% confidence interval 1.43-11.48) versus patients with MIB. In 12 patients with AT undergoing repeat ablation, 22 ATs were identified, with reentry involving the MI in nine, the LA roof in six, and the ridge between the LA appendage and left PVs in seven. In patients with MIB at initial ablation, recovery of MI conduction was seen in eight of 13 undergoing repeat ablation. AT occurring after CPVA plus LALA is often due to incomplete MI ablation, but may also occur at the LA roof, and ridge between the LA appendage and left PVs. Failure to achieve MI block increases the risk of developing AT. Resumption of MI conduction may also be a mechanism for AT recurrence. (PACE 2010; 460-468).

Pleiotropic effects on subclasses of HDL, adiposity, and glucose metabolism in adult Alaskan Eskimos. The aim of this study was to analyze the heritability and the presence of pleiotropic effects on subfractions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), parameters for adiposity, and glucose metabolism in adult Alaskan Eskimos. The present family study included 1,214 adult Alaskan Eskimos (537 male/677 female). Body weight, height, circumferences, selected skinfolds, and blood pressure were measured in all participants. Blood samples were collected under fasting conditions for the isolation of plasma. Glucose, insulin, subclasses and size of lipoproteins, triglycerides, total, and HDL cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) were measured in plasma. HbA1c was measured in total blood. Univariate and bivariate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted between HDL subclasses and size and the anthropometric and biochemical measures using the variance decomposition approach. Variation in all the analyzed traits exhibits a significant genetic component. Heritabilities ranged between 0.18 +/- 0.11 for LDL(2) (intermediate) and 0.89 +/- 0.07 for small HDL. No common genetic effects were found on the HDL subclasses (small, intermediate, and large). Small HDL particles were genetically correlated with LDL particles and HbA1c. Negative genetic correlations were observed between intermediate and large HDL subfractions, HDL size and measures of adiposity, and LDL and parameters for glucose metabolism (HbA1, insulin). These observations confirm the presence of possible pleiotropic effects on HDL, adiposity, and cardiovascular risk factors and provide novel insight on the relationship between HDL subclasses, adiposity, and glucose regulation.

Collagen XIX is expressed by interneurons and contributes to the formation of hippocampal synapses.

[Effect of vitamin K on bone material properties]. Collagen cross-links are determinants of bone quality. Because vitamin K is thought to ameliorate bone quality, we summarized the literature regarding the effect of vitamin K such as menatetorenone (MK-4) on bone matrix property in the review. MK-4 seems to stimulate the osteoblastic activity. This results in the increase in collagen accumulation and lysyl oxidase controlled enzymatic cross-links in bone. Furthermore, vitamin K stimulates the secretion of collagen binding protein regulating proper fibrillogenesis such as leucine-rich repeat protein (tsukushi). This kinds of non-collagenous proteins induced by the treatment of vitamin K may also affect proper collagen cross-link formation and show the favorable effect on bone material quality.

Lipid droplet analysis in caveolin-deficient adipocytes: alterations in surface phospholipid composition and maturation defects. Caveolins form plasmalemnal invaginated caveolae. They also locate around intracellular lipid droplets but their role in this location remains unclear. By studying primary adipocytes that highly express caveolin-1, we characterized the impact of caveolin-1 deficiency on lipid droplet proteome and lipidome. We identified several missing proteins on the lipid droplet surface of caveolin-deficient adipocytes and showed that the caveolin-1 lipid droplet pool is organized as multi-protein complexes containing cavin-1, with similar dynamics as those found in caveolae. On the lipid side, caveolin deficiency did not qualitatively alter neutral lipids in lipid droplet, but significantly reduced the relative abundance of surface phospholipid species: phosphatidylserine and lysophospholipids. Caveolin-deficient adipocytes can form only small lipid droplets, suggesting that the caveolin-lipid droplet pool might be involved in lipid droplet size regulation. Accordingly, we show that caveolin-1 concentration on adipocyte lipid droplets positively correlated with lipid droplet size in obese rodent models and human adipocytes. Moreover, rescue experiments by caveolin- green fluorescent protein in caveolin-deficient cells exposed to fatty acid overload demonstrated that caveolin-coated lipid droplets were able to grow larger than caveolin-devoid lipid droplets. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the lipid droplet-caveolin pool impacts on phospholipid and protein surface composition of lipid droplets and suggest a functional role on lipid droplet expandability.

Current practice in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Saudi Arabia. To gather data on current practices in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Saudi Arabia and to evaluate the degree of compliance with international guidelines. This paper represents the results of the Saudi Arabia T2DM data collected at the cross-sectional part of Wave 2006 of the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). Data were collected on a case report form from 28 health centers all over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in the period between 01/12/2006 and 30/12/2006. It included demographic and socioeconomic profile in addition to diabetes management and metabolic control. Three hundred and fifty-three Saudi T2DM diabetic patients were studied. The mean age was 51.61+/-10.84 years; average duration of diabetes was 8.25+/-6.49 years; 63-86% had never been screened for diabetes complications or cardiovascular risk factors during the previous year. Of all patients with T2DM, 7% were treated with insulin alone, 28% with oral glucose lowering drug (OGLD) + insulin and 64% with OGLD alone. The average last hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.20+/-1.89% and among all patients, only 27% had reached the target HbA1c of <7% while 42% of patients had been considered as reached glycemic control by physicians. Sixteen percent attained the target blood pressure of <130/80, and 65% had lipid profile above the optimal level. The majority of patients did not attain the recommended target glycemic level. This indicates the presence of a gap between recommendations of the international guidelines and the actual practices.


Phonological awareness of children with Down syndrome: its role in learning to read and the effectiveness of related interventions.

Impact of amino acid substitutions in the hepatitis C virus genotype 1b core region on liver steatosis and hepatic oxidative stress in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver steatosis and hepatic oxidative stress are the histopathological features of chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 core protein induces hepatic steatosis and reactive oxygen species production in transgenic mice. The amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region appear to be related to hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of mutations in the HCV core region on oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Sixty-seven patients (35 men, 32 women; mean age, 58.4 +/- 10.2 years) with chronic hepatitis C with high titres (>5 log IU/ml) were enrolled. Substitutions in amino acids 70, 75 and 91 of the HCV genotype 1b core region, the percentage of hepatic steatosis, and hepatic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were investigated in all patients. Urinary 8-OHdG levels were measured in 35 patients. Body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and triglyceride levels and substitutions of amino acid 70/Q (glutamine) were significantly associated with the presence of steatosis on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that substitution of amino acid 70 of glutamine and triglyceride levels were the independent factors related to liver steatosis. Hepatic and urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in patients with methionine at amino acid 91 of the HCV core region than in those with leucine. Substitutions in the amino acids of the HCV genotype1b core region are associated with hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress in patients with chronic hepatitis C.


Tumor-stroma co-evolution in prostate cancer progression and metastasis.

An adult tissue-specific stem cell in its niche: a gene profiling analysis of in vivo quiescent and activated muscle satellite cells. The satellite cell of skeletal muscle provides a paradigm for quiescent and activated tissue stem cell states. We have carried out transcriptome analyses on satellite cells purified by flow cytometry from Pax3(GFP/+) mice. We compared samples from adult skeletal muscles where satellite cells are mainly quiescent, with samples from growing muscles or regenerating (mdx) muscles, where they are activated. Analysis of regulation that is shared by both activated states avoids other effects due to immature or pathological conditions. This in vivo profile differs from that of previously analyzed satellite cells activated after cell culture. It reveals how the satellite cell protects itself from damage and maintains quiescence, while being primed for activation on receipt of the appropriate signal. This is illustrated by manipulation of the corepressor Dach1, and by the demonstration that quiescent satellite cells are better protected from oxidative stress than those from mdx or 1-week-old muscles. The quiescent versus in vivo activated comparison also gives new insights into how the satellite cell controls its niche on the muscle fiber through cell adhesion and matrix remodeling. The latter also potentiates growth factor activity through proteoglycan modification. Dismantling the extracellular matrix is important for satellite cell activation when the expression of proteinases is up-regulated, whereas transcripts for their inhibitors are high in quiescent cells. In keeping with this, we demonstrate that metalloproteinase function is required for efficient regeneration in vivo.

Contributions of Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida chitinases and Sec secretion system to biofilm formation on chitin. Francisella tularensis, the zoonotic cause of tularemia, can infect numerous mammals and other eukaryotes. Although studying F. tularensis pathogenesis is essential to comprehending disease, mammalian infection is just one step in the ecology of Francisella species. F. tularensis has been isolated from aquatic environments and arthropod vectors, environments in which chitin could serve as a potential carbon source and as a surface for attachment and growth. We show that F. tularensis subsp. novicida forms biofilms during the colonization of chitin surfaces. The ability of F. tularensis to persist using chitin as a sole carbon source is dependent on chitinases, since mutants lacking chiA or chiB are attenuated for chitin colonization and biofilm formation in the absence of exogenous sugar. A genetic screen for biofilm mutants identified the Sec translocon export pathway and 14 secreted proteins. We show that these genes are important for initial attachment during biofilm formation. We generated defined deletion mutants by targeting two chaperone genes (secB1 and secB2) involved in Sec-dependent secretion and four genes that encode putative secreted proteins. All of the mutants were deficient in attachment to polystyrene and chitin surfaces and for biofilm formation compared to wild-type F. novicida. In contrast, mutations in the Sec translocon and secreted factors did not affect virulence. Our data suggest that biofilm formation by F. tularensis promotes persistence on chitin surfaces. Further study of the interaction of F. tularensis with the chitin microenvironment may provide insight into the environmental survival and transmission mechanisms of this pathogen.

Visual discrimination of male and female faces by infant rhesus macaques. Recent studies have revealed that human infants process female faces differently from male faces. To test whether a similar preference for female faces exists in other primates, we presented nursery-reared infant rhesus macaques with photographs of macaque faces and human faces. At <1 month old, infant macaques preferentially oriented towards female macaque faces when faces were presented upright. No preference for female human faces was found. At 9 months old, infants failed to show a visual preference for female macaque faces or female human faces, although they showed significantly more lipsmacking responses at female human faces. Compared to human infants, macaques appear to have stronger predispositions early in life but this preference may nonetheless be amendable to experience. Understanding how innate predispositions and the social rearing environment shape infants' understanding of faces remain important issues to be explored in order to understand facial processing abilities in humans and other primates.

Health care utilization by adolescents on medicaid: implications for delivering vaccines. To examine the degree to which current health care utilization patterns of Medicaid-enrolled adolescents living in Michigan would allow opportunities for adolescent immunizations to be provided. Outpatient claims data from 2001-2005 were analyzed for 11- to 18-year-old Medicaid-enrolled adolescents living in Michigan. Visits were classified as either health-maintenance examinations (HMEs) or problem focused by using diagnostic and procedural codes. Data were divided into 4 overlapping 2-year time periods, and the age-specific proportion of adolescents who attended these 2 visit types was calculated for each. chi(2) tests were used to evaluate associations of visit patterns with gender. Of the 718847 adolescents included in the study, <50% had >or=1 HME visit within any 2-year time period, and substantially fewer (<15%) had annual HMEs. In contrast, at least 75% of the adolescents had >or=1 problem-focused visit in any given 2-year period, and approximately half had participated in at least 2 problem-focused visits. Problem-focused, but not HME, visit utilization was significantly associated with gender, with girls increasing, but boys decreasing, visit utilization as they aged. Similar to privately insured adolescents, most Medicaid-enrolled adolescents do not have annual preventive-care visits, which calls into question the feasibility of providing immunizations primarily at annual HMEs. Participation in problem-focused encounters was generally high in our study. However, even problem-focused visit utilization was low among older adolescent boys. This suggests that in addition to strengthening immunization within the medical home, alternative venues for reaching certain subpopulations of adolescents should also be developed.

Brachytherapy or surgery? A composite view. The treatment of prostate cancer presents the patient and clinician with several options. The choice of modality is often the most difficult. For low- and intermediate-risk disease, the choice is often between surgery and brachytherapy because the other major option, external-beam radiotherapy, has toxicity that generally only makes sense in the risk/benefit analysis for high-risk prostate cancer. The comparison of brachytherapy and surgery may be done on several levels. This review will focus the comparison on toxicity, the "soft" endpoints of biochemical relapse-free survival and clinical relapse-free survival, and the "hard" endpoint of prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Attenuation of the neuronal stress responsiveness and corticotrophin releasing hormone synthesis after sexual activity in male rats.

A suitable base material for composite resin restorations: zinc oxide eugenol. This in vitro study evaluated the effects of a zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) base on the mechanical properties of a composite resin restoration. Class I cavities were prepared on plastic teeth and filled with ZOE plus composite resin, following standard clinical procedures. The samples were sectioned sagittally and the ZOE-resin interface was exposed. After polishing, nanoindentation was performed on the region near the interface, and elastic modulus and hardness were plotted in the form of a color contour map. SEM was employed to observe the interface between composite resin and ZOE base. In the region close to the ZOE base, the elastic modulus and hardness of composite resin reduced to the values of 9.71+/-0.54 and 0.51+/-0.05 GPa, respectively. Eugenol from ZOE had detrimental effects on the composite resin only to a distance of less than 100 microm from the ZOE base. Although eugenol suppresses polymerization slightly, by considering the biological advantages of ZOE, together with the results of the current investigation, ZOE may still be considered a suitable base material for composite resin. Bonding is essential for composite resin restorations over ZOE bases to avoid shrinkage detachment.

Neuropsychiatric correlates of white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the association of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Thirty-seven patients with probable AD received the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and an MRI scan as part of their initial evaluation at the Outpatient Memory Diagnostic Clinic at McLean Hospital. MRI-based volumetric measurements of whole brain atrophy, hippocampal volumes, and WMH were obtained. Analysis of covariance models, using age as a covariate and the presence of specific BPSD as independent variables, were used to test for differences in whole brain volumes, hippocampal volumes and WMH volumes. Increased WMH were associated with symptoms of anxiety, aberrant motor behavior, and night time disturbance, while symptoms of disinhibition were linked to lower WMH volume. No associations were found for whole brain or hippocampal volumes and BPSD. These findings suggest that white matter changes are associated with the presence of BPSD in AD.

Derivation of burn scar depths and estimation of carbon emissions with LIDAR in Indonesian peatlands. During the 1997/98 El Niño-induced drought peatland fires in Indonesia may have released 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels. One major unknown in current peatland emission estimations is how much peat is combusted by fire. Using a light detection and ranging data set acquired in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, in 2007, one year after the severe peatland fires of 2006, we determined an average burn scar depth of 0.33 +/- 0.18 m. Based on this result and the burned area determined from satellite imagery, we estimate that within the 2.79 million hectare study area 49.15 +/- 26.81 megatons of carbon were released during the 2006 El Niño episode. This represents 10-33% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in the year 2006. These emissions, originating from a comparatively small area (approximately 13% of the Indonesian peatland area), underline the importance of peat fires in the context of green house gas emissions and global warming. In the past decade severe peat fires occurred during El Niño-induced droughts in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009. Currently, this important source of carbon emissions is not included in IPCC carbon accounting or in regional and global carbon emission models. Precise spatial measurements of peat combusted and potential avoided emissions in tropical peat swamp forests will also be required for future emission trading schemes in the framework of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries.

Personal mastery and lower body mobility in community-dwelling older persons: the Invecchiare in Chianti study. To test the hypothesis that, in older persons, sense of personal mastery, defined as the extent to which one regards one's life chance as being under one's own control, predicts change in lower extremity performance during a 6-year follow-up. Prospective cohort study. Community based. Six hundred twenty-six participants aged 65 and older. Personal mastery was assessed at baseline using Pearlin's mastery scale. Lower extremity performance was measured at baseline and at 6-year follow-up using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) of lower extremity function. Higher sense of mastery was associated with a significantly less-steep decline in lower extremity performance. Participants in the two lowest quartiles of personal mastery had, respectively, a 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.4-5.1, P=.01) and 3.2 (95% CI=1.6-6.6, P=.002) higher risk of experiencing a substantial decline (> or =3 points) in SPPB scores after 6 years as those in the highest quartile. Older individuals with poor sense of personal mastery are at high risk of accelerated lower extremity physical function decline. Whether interventions aimed at improving personal mastery may prevent disability remains unknown.

Self-management of persistent neck pain: a randomized controlled trial of a multi-component group intervention in primary health care. Studies regarding self-management of persistent neck pain are infrequent. to compare treatment effects of (a) a multi-component pain and stress self-management group intervention (PASS) and (b) individually administered physical therapy (IAPT) for patients with persistent musculoskeletal tension-type neck pain. Persons seeking physical therapy treatment due to persistent tension-type neck pain at nine primary health care centers in Sweden were randomly assigned to either PASS or IAPT. Before treatment (baseline) and at 10- and 20-weeks the participants completed a self-assessment questionnaire comprising: the Self-Efficacy Scale, the Neck Disability Index, the Coping Strategies Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and questions regarding neck pain, analgesics and utilization of health care. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance between baseline, 10-week and 20-week follow-up. One hundred and fifty six participants were included (PASS n=77, IAPT n=79). On average participants receiving PASS attended seven treatment sessions and participants receiving IAPT 11 sessions over the 20-week follow-up period. Repeated measures ANCOVA showed significant time x group interaction effects for ability to control pain (p<0.001), self-efficacy regarding pain-interfering activities (p=0.005), disability due to neck pain (p=0.001) and levels of catastrophic thinking (p<0.001) in favour of PASS. PASS had a better effect than IAPT in the treatment of persistent musculoskeletal tension-type neck pain regarding coping with pain, in terms of patients' self-reported pain control, self-efficacy, disability and catastrophizing, over the 20-week follow-up.

Ascitic form of sporadic acute viral hepatitis in children: a distinct entity for recognition. This study looked at the frequency and differences in presentation, laboratory parameters, and outcome between ascitic acute viral hepatitis (AAVH) and nonascitic acute viral hepatitis (NAVH) in children. Diagnosis of AVH was based on clinical features, >3-fold elevation of alanine aminotransferase, viral marker positivity (IgM antihepatitis A virus, IgM antihepatitis E virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, and IgM antihepatitis B core antigen) at presentation, absence of history of liver disease, and subsequent normalization within 6 months of clinical features and liver functions including sustained resolution of ascites in AAVH on follow-up. A total of 139 children (121 children with NAVH and 18 with AAVH, 12.9%) were studied. Children with AAVH in comparison with those with NAVH were younger (median age 4 vs 8 years), had lower frequency of prodrome (22% vs 51%), lower serum albumin (median 2.8 vs 3.7 g/dL), low total serum protein (median 6.5 vs 7.4 g/dL), and prolongation of prothrombin time (median 4.8 vs 1.05 seconds); all P < 0.03. No significant differences were found in sex, height standard deviation scores, duration of symptoms, liver span or consistency, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and etiology of NAVH versus AAVH. Among the AAVH group clinically detectable ascites was present in 38.9% (7/18), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 11%, and diuretics had to be used in 44% of cases. Ascites resolved in all of the cases in 8 weeks (94.4% cases in <4 weeks) and liver functions normalized in 17%, 50%, and 33% cases in <4, 4 to 8, and >8 weeks duration, respectively. We report AAVH as a distinct entity that affects younger children. This subgroup has compromised biosynthetic liver functions irrespective of viral etiology with total recovery.

Clinical inquiries. What's the best way to monitor low-risk patients with a history of differentiated thyroid cancer? Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH)-stimulated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level alone is sufficient to monitor for recurrent disease in low-risk patients with a history of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Low-risk patients are defined as patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (I(131)) remnant ablation therapy and show no clinical evidence of recurrent disease.

Does private insurance adequately protect families of children with mental health disorders? Although private insurance typically covers many health care costs, the challenges faced by families who care for a sick child are substantial. These challenges may be more severe for children with special health care needs (CSHCN) with mental illnesses than for other CSHCN. Our objective was to determine if families of privately insured children who need mental health care face different burdens than other families in caring for their children. We used the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) to study privately insured children aged 6 to 17 years. We compared CSHCN with mental health care needs (N = 4918) to 3 groups: children with no special health care needs (n = 2346); CSHCN with no mental health care needs (n = 16250); and CSHCN with no mental health care need but a need for other specialty services (n = 7902). The latter group was a subset of CSHCN with no mental health care need. We used weighted logistic regression and study outcomes across 4 domains: financial burden; health plan experiences; labor-market and time effects; and parent experience with services. We found that families of children with mental health care needs face significantly greater financial barriers, have more negative health plan experiences, and are more likely to reduce their labor-market participation to care for their child than other families. Families of privately insured CSHCN who need mental health care face a higher burden than other families in caring for their children. Policies are needed to help these families obtain affordable, high-quality care for their children.

Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in marine and lacustrine sediments from the Shandong Peninsula, China. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in sediments from Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea coastal waters and lakes in Shandong Peninsula were determined. The total PCB concentrations of the measured 50 congeners (Sigma50PCBs) in the sediments ranged from 273.7 to 644.5 pg g(-1) dw (dry weight). The PCB congener profiles in the lacustrine sediments were different from those in the marine sediments. TriCBs and TetraCBs were the dominant homologues in marine sediments, whereas in the sediments from the Nansi Lakes, contributions of PCB homologues were similar. The total concentrations of 2,3,7,8-PCDD/Fs ranged from 6.2 to 27.4 pg g(-1) dw. The congener profiles of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/Fs for the sediments were generally similar for both the lakes and the coastal sea areas in Shandong Peninsula. They were characterized by high OCDD, followed by 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD and OCDF. The congener profiles of PCDD/Fs in the sediments were consistent with the profiles of main dominant PCDD/Fs in pentachlorophenol and sodium pentachlorophenate products in China. PCDD/F-TEQ ranged from 0.11 to 0.80 pg TEQg(-1) dw. The dioxin-like PCB-TEQ had concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 0.08 pg TEQ g(-1) dw, mainly from PCB126. PCBs and PCDD/Fs concentrations found in the sediments were from background to low polluted levels.

Overexpression of the NHE1 isoform of the Na(+)/H (+) exchanger causes elevated apoptosis in isolated cardiomyocytes after hypoxia/reoxygenation challenge. The mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein that regulates intracellular pH in the myocardium and other tissues. NHE1 is an important mediator of myocardial damage that occurs after ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has also been implicated in apoptotic damage in many tissues and its expression and activity are elevated in disease states in the myocardium. In this study, we examined the effect of additional exogenous NHE1 expression on isolated cardiomyocytes susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion damage. Exogenous NHE1 elevated Na(+)/H(+) exchanger expression and activity when introduced into isolated cardiomyocytes through an adenoviral system. Isolated cardiomyocytes were subjected to simulated ischemia and reperfusion after infection with either control or NHE1-containing adenovirus. Cells were placed into an anaerobic chamber and effects of NHE1 expression after hypoxia/reoxygenation were examined. Hypoxia/reoxygenation increased caspase-3-like activity in controls, and the effect was greatly magnified in cells expressing NHE1 protein. It also elevated the percentage of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, which was also aggravated by expression of NHE1 protein. Hypoxia/reoxygenation also increased phospho-ERK levels. Elevated NHE1 expression was coincidental with increased expression of the ER stress protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin (CRT). Our results demonstrate that increased NHE1 protein expression makes cells more susceptible to damage induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation in isolated cardiomyocytes. They suggest that elevated NHE1 in cardiovascular disease could predispose the human myocardium to enhanced apoptotic damage.


Transglutaminase 2 is involved in autophagosome maturation.

Information content analysis in automated microscopy imaging using an adaptive autofocus algorithm for multimodal functions. We present a new algorithm to analyse information content in images acquired using automated fluorescence microscopy. The algorithm belongs to the group of autofocusing methods, but differs from its predecessors in that it can handle thick specimens and operate also in confocal mode. It measures the information content in images using a 'content function', which is essentially the same concept as a focus function. Unlike previously presented algorithms, this algorithm tries to find all significant axial positions in cases where the content function applied to real data is not unimodal, which is often the case. This requirement precludes using algorithms that rely on unimodality. Moreover, choosing a content function requires careful consideration, because some functions suppress local maxima. First, we test 19 content functions and evaluate their ability to show local maxima clearly. The results show that only six content functions succeed. To save time, the acquisition procedure needs to vary the step size adaptively, because a wide range of possible axial positions has to be passed so as not to miss a local maximum. The algorithm therefore has to assess the steepness of the content function online so that it can decide to use a bigger or smaller step size to acquire the next image. Therefore, the algorithm needs to know about typical behaviour of content functions. We show that for normalized variance, one of the most promising content functions, this knowledge can be obtained after normalizing with respect to the theoretical maximum of this function, and using hierarchical clustering. The resulting algorithm is more reliable and efficient than a simple procedure with constant steps.

Taxi driver seat belt wearing in Nanjing, China. To determine and validate patterns of seat belt use and attitudes of taxi drivers on wearing a seat belt following national and provincial seat belt legislation in 2004-2005. Roadside daylight seat belt observation and interview survey methods were used, as well as observations from inside taxis during routine trips and a taxi driver focus group. The setting was Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China in April of 2006 and 2007. Prevalence of seat belt use and attitudes to wearing a seat belt were determined, as were vehicle and driver characteristics, and comparisons with other motor-vehicle driver's seat belt use and attitudes. Taxi drivers interviewed were predominantly male and aged 30-39 years. They spent more hours per week in their vehicles and had more driving experience than other drivers. Over half (56.2%) of taxi drivers interviewed reported that they always wore seat belts, while observation of taxi drivers showed lower wearing rates (i.e., roadside observation was 43.8%, and observation from inside taxis was 36.2%). Belt tampering was a practice of 12-15% of taxi drivers. "Fine avoidance, safety, high speed and long trips" were given as important reasons for wearing and "feeling trapped and uncomfortable" for not wearing. Seat belt reminder signs in taxis were common (82.6% of taxis), but did not appear to impact on driver seat belt use. The four research methods found taxi drivers to have consistently low "correct wearing" rates. As in several other countries, taxi drivers are particularly resistant to seat belt use. Innovative strategies, including occupational health and safety approaches, may be required to achieve increased levels of seat belt use.


Worldwide frequency of G2019S LRRK2 mutation in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.

Titanium-based multi-channel, micro-electrode array for recording neural signals. Micro-scale brain-machine interface (BMI) devices have provided an opportunity for direct probing of neural function and have also shown significant promise for restoring neurological functions lost to stroke, injury, or disease. However, the eventual clinical translation of such devices may be hampered by limitations associated with the materials commonly used for their fabrication, e.g. brittleness of silicon, insufficient rigidity of polymeric devices, and unproven chronic biocompatibility of both. Herein, we report, for the first time, the development of titanium-based "Michigan" type multi-channel, microelectrode arrays that seek to address these limitations. Titanium provides unique properties of immediate relevance to microelectrode arrays, such as high toughness, moderate modulus, and excellent biocompatibility, which may enhance structural reliability, safety, and chronic recording reliability. Realization of these devices is enabled by recently developed techniques which provide the opportunity for fabrication of high aspect ratio micromechanical structures in bulk titanium substrates. Details regarding the design, fabrication, and characterization of these devices for eventual use in rat auditory cortex and thalamus recordings are presented, as are preliminary results.


Complications but not obesity or diabetes mellitus have impact on the intraperitoneal lactate/pyruvate ratio measured by microdialysis.

Partial analysis of hepatitis B virus DNA from hepatocellular carcinoma showing negative hepatitis B virus surface antigen: an analysis of two Japanese cases. It has been reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is detected in serum and/or liver in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without HBsAg. To adress this issue, we analyzed HBV genome in 2 HCC cases without HBsAg. The DNA from serum from patients with HCC was amplified with a nested PCR, and 'a' determinant of S region, core promoter region and precore region were sequenced. The first case, a 50 years-old male, was negative for HBsAg and HBeAg, and positive for anti-HBs, anti-HBe and anti-HBc. Viral load of HBV in serum was 4.0 log genome equivalent/ml by TMA assay, and was 1.1 X 105 copy/ml by real-time PCR system. A nucleotide analysis of the common 'a' determinant of S gene showed that the 5 first amino acids of 'a' determinant, CTIPA, were changed to CKTCTTPA. The second case, a 76 years-old male, was positive for anti-HBe, but negative for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg and anti-HBc. No missense or nonsense mutations were seen in 'a' determinant of S region. Viral load of serum HBV was < 3.7 log genome equivalent/ml by TMA assay, but was 2.4X103 copy/ml by real-time PCR system. The results of the present study suggest that the mechanisms of HBsAg loss are diverse among HCC patients without HBsAg, and that an analysis of HBV genome is a useful tool to dissolve molecular mechanisms losing HBs antigenicity.

Preferences in choosing between breast reconstruction options: a survey of female plastic surgeons. Female plastic surgeons are well suited to make a personal choice regarding breast reconstruction options, based on their knowledge of the actual procedures and first-hand experience with results. The authors surveyed this group to elicit their personal views on various modalities of breast reconstruction and to ascertain which types of reconstruction they would choose if faced with such a decision. All board-certified female plastic surgeons in the United States and Canada were surveyed by means of e-mail. This survey included questions regarding basic demographic and practice data. Respondents were requested to rank desired methods of reconstruction for themselves and to cite reasons for these choices. A total of 435 surveys were sent: 350 were delivered (85 had invalid e-mail addresses), and 143 were returned (response rate, 41 percent). Overall, 66 percent of respondents chose implant-based reconstruction, 25 percent chose autologous reconstruction, and 9 percent chose no reconstruction. Respondents selecting autologous reconstruction cited cosmetic outcome as the most important factor considered in 47 percent of cases, compared with 14 percent of those choosing implant-based breast reconstruction (p = 0.0001). Invasiveness of the procedure/recovery time was cited as the most important factor by 83 percent of those surgeons opting for no breast reconstruction and by 51 percent of those choosing implant-based breast reconstruction (p = 0.0175). Board-certified female plastic surgeons exhibit a strong desire to pursue implant-based breast reconstruction over autologous reconstruction. When it was chosen, autologous reconstruction was felt to offer improved aesthetic outcomes. When making such a decision, patients can use female plastic surgeons as a resource for information, thus helping them to make an informed decision.

Unsupervised feature selection in cardiac arrhythmias analysis. The problem of detecting clinical events related to cardiac arrhythmias in long term electrocardiograms is a difficult one due to the large amount of irrelevant information that hides such events. This problem has been addressed in the literature by means of clustering or classification algorithms that create data partitions according to a cost function based on heartbeat features dissimilarity measures. However, studies about the type or number of heartbeat features is lacking. Usually, the feature sets used are relevant but redundant, which degrades algorithm performance. This paper describes a method for automatic selection of heartbeat features. This method is assessed using real signals from the MIT database and common features used in previous works.

Emotion-cognition interactions in schizophrenia: Implicit and explicit effects of facial expression. Working memory (WM) and emotion classification are amongst the cognitive domains where specific deficits have been reported for patients with schizophrenia. In healthy individuals, the capacity of visual working memory is enhanced when the material to be retained is emotionally salient, particularly for angry faces. We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia also have an enhanced WM capacity for angry faces. We compared 34 inpatients with schizophrenia and 34 age-, handedness- and gender-matched control participants in three separate tasks. In the WM task, participants saw two faces with angry, happy or neutral emotional expressions for 2s and had to decide whether a probe face presented after a 1s delay was identical to one of them. In the emotion classification task, they had to assign these faces to the appropriate categorical emotion. They also rated faces for valence and arousal. Although patients performed generally worse on the working memory task, they showed the same benefit for angry faces as control participants. However, patients were specifically impaired for angry faces on the emotion classification task. These results indicate preserved implicit emotion processing in schizophrenia patients, which contrasts with their impairment in explicit emotion classification. With regard to clinical practice, our findings underline the importance of assessing responsiveness to emotions in patients with schizophrenia, with a view possibly to utilize preserved implicit emotion processing in cognitive remediation programs.

Use and reporting of restricted randomization: a review. Restricted randomization, such as blocking or minimization, allows for the creation of balanced groups and even distribution of covariates, but it increases the risk of selection bias and technical error. Various methods are available to reduce these risks but there is limited evidence about their current usage, and there are also indications that reporting of these methods may not be adequate. This review aims to identify how frequently different methods of restriction are being used and to assess the reporting of these methods against established reporting standards. 82 reports of randomized controlled trial were reviewed. For each trial, the reported method of randomization was recorded and the reporting of randomization was assessed. Where the method of randomization was not clear from the main paper, protocols and other published materials were also reviewed, and authors were contacted for further information. For 11% of trials the method of randomization was not reported in either the paper or a published protocol, and in a further 39% of cases the report omitted key details so that the predictability of the method could not be evaluated. In total, 88% of trials appear to have used some form of restricted randomization, and all of those that report the exact methods used either blocking or minimization. 15% of trials reported using blocks of six or less and 4% used minimization with no random element reported, both of which are highly predictable. Our results indicate that the majority of trials use some form of restriction, with many using relatively predictable methods that put them at greater risk of selection bias and technical error. Reporting of randomization methods often falls short of the minimum requirements set out by the CONSORT statement, leaving the reader unable to make an informed judgement about the risk of bias.

The epidemiology of psychosis in Luton. There is a dearth of epidemiological research on psychosis. Little is known about how psychosis rates vary within contrasting urban areas. Variation in rates would have implications for the aetiology of psychosis. The aim was to determine the variation in psychosis prevalence in different areas of a city. We conducted a retrospective audit of the caseloads of the four Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) in Luton. Caseloads were categorised by diagnoses recorded in the medical notes, and by patient age. We performed a descriptive analysis of the levels of psychosis in each CMHT, considered against parameters including deprivation and ethnicity as recorded in the 2001 UK census. Areas with high indices of deprivation, and a large ethnic minority and migrant population, demonstrated higher rates of psychosis. Our findings are consistent with, the MRC Aetiology & Ethnicity of Schizophrenia & Other Psychoses study. Increased rates of psychosis observed in areas with large migrant and ethnic minority populations, and in areas of high deprivation, have implications for the planning of local services, and in further understanding the role of environmental factors in the aetiology of psychosis. There is a need for further prospective epidemiological studies at this geographical scale.

Detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using conventional PCR and heteroduplex/amplicon size differences. In many families with histories suggestive of BRCA1- or BRCA2-related disease, the proband is deceased. Reliable assessment of archived tissue blocks not amenable to full gene sequencing would be helpful. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers that bracket the BRCA mutation site and microfluidics-based detection of heteroduplex/amplicon size differences was developed to circumvent artifacts associated with low quality DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 FFPE specimens from patients that had previously undergone BRCA gene sequence analysis on blood specimens. Conventional PCR amplification products were differentiated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. One FFPE specimen failed to amplify the wild-type alleles for all three sites and was therefore called indeterminate. All 62 FFPE specimens with known Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations had both the wild-type and the correct mutated allele amplified, including one specimen that failed to amplify the mutant allele in other real-time PCR assays. Appropriately, 21 FFPE specimens known to have other BRCA1/2 mutations and 16 without any mutation had only the wild-type allele correctly amplified for each target. Therefore, by changing the primer location and detecting amplicons via heteroduplexes formed by size differences, we identified mutations from FFPE tissues missed using real-time methods.

Hebei Spirit oil spill monitored on site by fluorometric detection of residual oil in coastal waters off Taean, Korea. The spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved and/or dispersed oil in seawater and pore water were monitored on site by fluorometric detection method after the Hebei Spirit oil spill. The oil concentrations in intertidal seawater, 15 days after the spill, were as high as 16,600 microg/L and appeared to decrease below the Korean marine water quality standard of 10 microg/L at most sites 10 months after the spill. Fluorometric detection of oil in pore water was introduced to eliminate the effects of grain size for the quantification of oil in sediments and to better explain spatial and temporal distribution of oil pollution at sandy beaches. The fluorescence detection method was compared with the conventional laboratory technique of total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis using gas chromatography. The method of fluorescence detection of oil was capable of generating results much faster and more cost-effectively than the traditional GC technique.

Serologic survey for toxoplasmosis in domestic birds from the Czech Republic. The present study was carried out on domestic fowls in the Czech Republic in the years 2003 and 2004. A total of 1108 samples obtained from 538 water birds (geese and ducks) and 570 gallinaceous birds (chickens and turkeys) were tested for specific antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii using the indirect fluorescent antibody test. In geese, 43% prevalence (77 positive out of 178 examined) was found with titres of 40, 320 and 2560 in 40, 29 and eight geese, respectively. In ducks, 14% prevalence (52 out of 360) was found with titres of 40 and 320 in 46 and six ducks, respectively. In gallinaceous birds, only one of 293 broiler chickens was positive with a titre of 40; sera of 217 hens and 60 turkeys were negative. We found extremely high antibody prevalence in geese and ducks compared with gallinaceous birds. This is the first seroprevalence study in domestic birds by indirect fluorescent antibody test in Europe.

Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: an update.

[Recurrent massive bloody pleural effusion caused by pancreatic pleural fistula in a case]. To introduce the early clinical features and the main points of diagnosis and treatment of children with pancreatic pleural fistula presenting massive bloody pleural effusion. The clinical data of symptoms, signs, laboratory examination, diagnosis and treatment methods of pancreatic pleural fistula in a child are presented. A 4-year-old boy presented with one month history of intermittent fever, cough, chest tightness and chest pain. His pleural effusion collected from three thoracic closed drainage was hemorrhagic. He had no positive abdominal signs. His abdominal B-mode ultrasonography showed rough pancreatic echo. The levels of amylase in blood and pleural fluid were 495 U/L and 35 938 U/L, respectively. There was a fistulous tract from the thoracic cavity leading to the pancreas at thoracic surgical exploration. The child was cured by total parenteral nutrition, intravenous infusion of somatostatin and a stent placed in the pancreatic duct by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The child with pancreatic pleural fistula in early stage mainly present respiratory symptoms and lack abdominal symptoms, so the diagnosis and treatment is often delayed. Significant increase of pancreatic amylase level in pleural effusion can be an important clue and basis for the diagnosis. If conservative therapy fails, the examination and treatment with ERCP should be considered.

A comparison of the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection methods in eliminating Salmonella spp. from commercial egg laying houses. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection (C&D) is regarded as a necessary step for the elimination of Salmonella spp. from laying houses. A total of 60 commercial laying houses that had housed laying flocks infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that were representative of all production systems (cage, barn, free-range) were intensively sampled immediately after C&D as well as in the follow-on flock. The procedures investigated were: (1) a compound disinfectant consisting of a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and quarternary ammonium applied at the recommended concentration; (2) a 10% (vol/vol) dilution of the standard 37% commercial formalin, applied by a contractor; and (3) other disinfection procedures selected and applied by the farmer. The recovery of Salmonella in the cleaned and disinfected houses was variable, with samples from floor and dropping boards/belts (cage houses) and scratching areas (non-cage houses) being the most likely to remain contaminated. In cage houses, the use of the 10% formalin dilution led to a statistically greater reduction in the sample prevalence than using any of the other C&D methods. A negative post-C&D result predicted clearance of Salmonella in 52% of cases, although the isolation of Salmonella from the houses immediately after C&D was not a perfect predictor of carry-over of infection.

Model-based neuroimaging for cognitive computing. The continuity of the mind is suggested to mean the continuous spatiotemporal dynamics arising from the electrochemical signature of the neocortex: (i) globally through volume transmission in the gray matter as fields of neural activity, and (ii) locally through extrasynaptic signaling between fine distal dendrites of cortical neurons. If the continuity of dynamical systems across spatiotemporal scales defines a stream of consciousness then intentional metarepresentations as templates of dynamic continuity allow qualia to be semantically mapped during neuroimaging of specific cognitive tasks. When interfaced with a computer, such model-based neuroimaging requiring new mathematics of the brain will begin to decipher higher cognitive operations not possible with existing brain-machine interfaces.

Spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation: study of the effect of atrial geometry in a biophysical model. We studied the mechanisms of spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation in a biophysical model of human atria, during the eight seconds preceding termination. The earliest detectable changes in the cycle length and the number of wavefronts occurred about three seconds prior to termination. We compared the mechanisms involved in the right and left atrium and investigated the effects of atrial geometry on the termination processes. We observed that cycle length started to increase 800 ms earlier in the left atrium than in the right atrium. Similarly, the number of wavefronts decreased even 1800 ms earlier in the left atrium than in the right one. Significantly fewer episodes terminated in the left atrium. Four areas of the atrial geometry showing distinct termination mechanisms were identified.

Comparison of several classifiers to evaluate endocardial electrograms fractionation in human. Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) may represent the electrophysiological substrate for atrial fibrillation (AF). Progress in signal processing algorithms to identify CFAEs sites is crucial for the development of AF ablation strategies. A novel algorithm for automated description of atrial electrograms (A-EGMs) fractionation based on wavelet transform and several statistical pattern recognition methods was proposed and new methodology of A-EGM processing was designed and tested. The algorithms for A-EGM classification were developed using normal density based classifiers, linear and high degree polynomial classifiers, nearest mean scaled classifiers, nonlinear classifiers, neural networks and j48. All classifiers were compared and tested using a representative set of 1.5 s A-EGMs (n = 68) ranked by 3 independent experts 100% coincidentialy into 4 classes of fractionation: 1 - organized atrial activity; 2 - mild; 3 - intermediate; 4 - high degree of fractionation. Feature extraction and well performing classification algorithms tested here showed maximal error of 15% and mean classification error across all implemented classifiers 9%, and the best mean classification error 5.9% (nearest mean classifier), and classification error of highly fractionated A-EGMs of approximately 9%.

Reinforced polypropylene composites: effects of chemical compositions and particle size. In this work, the effects of wood species, particle sizes and hot-water treatment on some physical and mechanical properties of wood-plastic composites were studied. Composites of thermoplastic reinforced with oak (Quercus castaneifolia) and pine (Pinus eldarica) wood were prepared. Polypropylene (PP) and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) were used as the polymer matrix and coupling agent, respectively. The results showed that pine fiber had significant effect on the mechanical properties considered in this study. This effect is explained by the higher fiber length and aspect ratio of pine compared to the oak fiber. The hot-water treated (extractive-free) samples, in both wood species, improved the tensile, flexural and impact properties, but increased the water absorption for 24h. This work clearly showed that lignocellulosic materials in both forms of fiber and flour could be effectively used as reinforcing elements in PP matrix. Furthermore, extractives have marked effects on the mechanical and physical properties.

Inhibition of apoptosis in periodontitis. This study investigated whether the prolonged survival of inflammatory cells in periodontal disease could be due to the inhibition of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) decoy receptors and inhibition of the terminal stages of apoptosis signaling by inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members. Gingival tissue samples were taken from healthy individuals and those with chronic periodontitis. The expression of TRAIL, TRAIL receptors, TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3, xIAP, and survivin was determined immunohistologically and at the level of mRNA expression. Higher levels of TRAIL and the TRAIL decoy receptor, TRAIL R4, were expressed in the diseased periodontal tissues (p < 0.005). Statistically (p < 0.05) higher levels of cleaved caspase-3 and the cleaved caspase-3 inhibitors, xIAP and survivin, were seen. Similar changes were seen at the level of mRNA. The results indicate that apoptosis in periodontitis may be inhibited by elevated expression of TRAIL decoy receptors and cleaved caspase-3 inhibitors.

Changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs. The incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. Two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. Fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug Chlo-Site or Metronidazole. Even within two weeks, a turnover of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. A relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. This should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

A naturally occurring human RPA subunit homolog does not support DNA replication or cell-cycle progression. Replication Protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for DNA replication, repair, recombination and cell-cycle regulation. A human homolog of the RPA2 subunit, called RPA4, was previously identified and shown to be expressed in colon mucosal and placental cells; however, the function of RPA4 was not determined. To examine the function of RPA4 in human cells, we carried out knockdown and replacement studies to determine whether RPA4 can substitute for RPA2 in the cell. Unlike RPA2, exogenous RPA4 expression did not support chromosomal DNA replication and lead to cell-cycle arrest in G2/M. In addition, RPA4 localized to sites of DNA repair and reduced gamma-H2AX caused by RPA2 depletion. These studies suggest that RPA4 cannot support cell proliferation but can support processes that maintain the genomic integrity of the cell.


Using biointelligence to search the cancer genome: an epistemological perspective on knowledge recovery strategies to enable precision medical genomics.

Safety evaluation of repeated intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in rabbit eyes. Repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab are a common treatment for several retinal diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term retinal toxicity of repeated injections of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in rabbits. Albino rabbits were injected intravitreally with ranibizumab (1 mg/0.1 mL) or bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.1 mL) into the right eye, whereas the left eye of each rabbit was injected with saline. Nine consecutive injections were administered at 14-day intervals. Electroretinographic responses and flash visual-evoked potentials were recorded periodically. After 18 weeks of follow-up, the rabbits were killed, and the retinas were prepared for morphologic examination and for immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Electroretinographic and visual-evoked potential responses of the experimental and control eyes were similar in amplitude and pattern throughout the follow-up period. The histopathologic studies yielded similar results. No retinal damage was observed in the experimental and control eyes of all rabbits. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity showed staining only in retinal astrocytes but not in Müller cells in all rabbits. The electrophysiological tests and the morphologic data indicate that the repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab have no cumulative long-term toxic effect on the retina in rabbits.

Influence of delivery mode on the urinary excretion of nandrolone metabolites. This study examined the influence of a supplement matrix on the excretion pattern of nandrolone metabolites in response to ingestion of a trace amount of 19-norandrostenedione. Ten male and nine female volunteers (mean ± SD: age = 26 ± 3 yr, height = 1.71 ± 0.09 m, body mass = 70.9 ± 13.2 kg) were recruited. On two occasions, subjects entered the laboratory in the morning after an overnight fast. After an initial urine collection, subjects ingested either 500 mL of plain water or a commercially available energy bar; 10 µg of 19-norandrostenedione was added to each. The volume of each urine sample passed during the next 24 h was measured, and an aliquot was retained for analysis. All samples were analyzed for the metabolites 19-norandrosterone (19-NA) and 19-noretiocholanolone (19-NE) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The total volume of urine passed was higher in the water trial (2.10 ± 0.52 L) than in the bar trial (1.85 ± 0.55 L; P = 0.040). Baseline urinary 19-NA concentrations were all below the limit of quantification for the assay. Peak urinary 19-NA was lower (P = 0.002) in the water trial (4.80 ± 2.84 ng·mL(-1)) than in the bar trial (8.46 ± 4.44 ng·mL(-1)). The time elapsed between ingestion of the supplement and the peak urinary 19-NA concentration was longer (P = 0.023) on the bar trial (4.6 ± 2.4 h) than on the water trial (2.8 ± 1.9 h). There was no difference in the total recovery of 19-NA + 19-NE between the liquid and solid supplements (water 30 ± 10%; bar 28 ± 12%; P < 0.140). Peak 19-NA concentrations were higher, and occurred later, when the 19-norandrostenedione was added to a solid supplement. This may be due to a slower rate of absorption and/or a reduced diuresis, resulting in a longer period for the metabolites to accumulate in the urine.

A comparison of retinal prosthesis electrode array substrate materials. Simulations of artificial vision suggest that 1000 electrodes may be required to restore vision to individuals with diseases of the outer retina. In order to achieve such an implant, new technology is needed, since the state-of-the-art implantable neural stimulator has at most 22 contacts with neural tissue. A critical component of this system is the multi-channel, stimulating electrode array. This array must meet very challenging, competing requirements for manufacturing, integration, surgical handling, and biocompatibility. Our lab has evaluated 3 polymers as retinal prosthesis substrates: polyimide, parylene, and silicone.

Eosinophils as antigen-presenting cells in allergic upper airway disease. The recognition of eosinophils as complex immunomodulatory cells has been increasing in recent years. One prominent novel immunomodulatory function of eosinophils is their role as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This review will examine the evidence that has enhanced the understanding of eosinophils as APCs in the context of allergic inflammation, with a focus on data applicable to allergic upper airway disease. Recent studies expand on prior findings that eosinophils can express major histocompatibility complex class II and costimulatory molecules. Eosinophils have also been found to traffic to regional lymph nodes and act as professional APCs in various experimental settings. Accumulating evidence of the ability of eosinophils to act as APCs suggests that eosinophils may have more complex immunomodulatory roles in allergic upper airway disease than previously appreciated.

[Correlation of the sensitivity of NP chemotherapy in non-small lung cancer with DNA repair gene XRCC1 polymorphism]. The gene polymorphism is used to predict the sensitivity of chemotherapy, which is significant for the individualized treatment of tumor. This study was to explore the correlation of codon 194 and codon 399 polymorphisms of DNA repair gene X-ray repair cross complementing (XRCC1) with the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to NP (vinorebine and cisplatin) chemotherapy. XRCC1 polymorphisms at codon 194 and codon 399 were detected in 164 patients with NSCLC using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The haplotype of XRCC1 gene was analyzed using SHEsis analysis software. Patients treated with NP chemotherapy were evaluated after two periods of treatment, then the correlation of the sensitivity of chemotherapy with polymorphisms was analyzed. The patients with the XRCC1 codon 194 C/T+T/T polymorphisms were 2.038 times as sensitive to the chemotherapy as the patients with C/C genotype (P=0.036, 95% CI:1.044-3.976). The effective rate to chemotherapy was no significant difference between the patients with XRCC1 codon 399 G/G, A/G, and A/A polymorhism. The effective rate of chemotherapy of the patients with T-A haplotype significantly increased compared with those with other haplotype (P=0.031), while that of the patients with C-A haplotype significantly decreased compared with others(P=0.035). The sensitivity to NP chemotherapy significantly increased in the NSCLC patients with XRCC1 194 CT and TT genotypes compared with those with CC genotype. XRCC1 codon 194 and codon 399 polymorphisms may be used to predict the sensitivity of NSCLC to NP chemotherapy.

Neurotensin-polyplex-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene delivery into nigral dopamine neurons prevents nigrostriatal degeneration in a rat model of early Parkinson's disease. The neurotrophin Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) influences nigral dopaminergic neurons via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The reduction of BDNF expression in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra (SN) might contribute to the death of dopaminergic neurons because inhibiting BDNF expression in the SN causes parkinsonism in the rat. This study aimed to demonstrate that increasing BDNF expression in dopaminergic neurons of rats with one week of 6-hydroxydopamine lesion recovers from parkinsonism. The plasmids phDAT-BDNF-flag and phDAT-EGFP, coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein, were transfected using neurotensin (NTS)-polyplex, which enables delivery of genes into the dopaminergic neurons via neurotensin-receptor type 1 (NTSR1) internalization. Two weeks after transfections, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence techniques showed that the residual dopaminergic neurons retain NTSR1 expression and susceptibility to be transfected by the NTS-polyplex. phDAT-BDNF-flag transfection did not increase dopaminergic neurons, but caused 7-fold increase in dopamine fibers within the SN and 5-fold increase in innervation and dopamine levels in the striatum. These neurotrophic effects were accompanied by a significant improvement in motor behavior. NTS-polyplex-mediated BDNF overexpression in dopaminergic neurons has proven to be effective to remit hemiparkinsonism in the rat. This BDNF gene therapy might be helpful in the early stage of Parkinson's disease.

Composition and Comprehensive Antioxidant Activity of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) Essential Oil from Ecuador. In the present study, the chemical composition and antioxidant potential of an essential oil of ginger rhizomes from Ecuador was elucidated. The analysis of the essential oil by GC/FID/MS resulted in identification of 71 compounds, of which the main are citral (geranial 10.5% and neral 9.1%), α-zingiberene (17.4%), camphene (7.8%), α-farnesene (6.8%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (6.7%). The in vitro antioxidant activity of the essential oil expressed by IC50 in descending order is: hydroxyl radical (OH*) scavenging (0.0065 μg/mL) > chelating capacity (0.822 μg/mL) > 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS*+) scavenging (3.94 μg/mL) > xanthine oxidase inhibition (138.0 μg/mL) > oxygen radical (O2*) scavenging (404.0 μg/mL) > 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH*) scavenging (675 μg/mL). Lipid peroxidation inhibition of the essential oil was less efficient than butylhydroxytoluol (BHT) in both stages, i.e. hydroperoxide and malondialdehyde formation. In vivo studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in antioxidant marker enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), blocking the oxidation processes in yeast cells. Moreover, ginger essential oil in concentrations of 1.6 mg/mL increases the viability of cells to oxidative stress induced by H2O2.

Low-grade inflammation in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: prognostic value of inflammatory plasma lipids and peripheral blood leukocyte biomarkers. Inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are produced by osteoarthritic (OA) joint tissue, where they may contribute to disease pathogenesis. We undertook the present study to examine whether inflammation, evidenced in plasma and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), reflects the presence, progression, or specific symptoms of symptomatic knee OA. Patients with symptomatic knee OA were enrolled in a 24-month prospective study of radiographic progression. Standardized knee radiographs were obtained at baseline and 24 months. At baseline, levels of the plasma lipids PGE2 and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were measured, and transcriptome analysis of PBLs was performed by microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Baseline PGE2 synthase (PGES) levels determined by PBL microarray gene expression and plasma PGE2 levels distinguished patients with symptomatic knee OA from non-OA controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.87 and 0.89, respectively, P < 0.0001). Baseline plasma 15-HETE levels were significantly elevated in patients with symptomatic knee OA versus non-OA controls (P < 0.0195). In the 146 patients who completed the 24-month study, elevated baseline expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) messenger RNA in PBLs predicted higher risk of radiographic progression as evidenced by joint space narrowing (JSN). In a multivariate model, AUC point estimates of models containing COX-2 in combination with demographic traits overlapped the confidence interval of the base model in 2 of the 3 JSN outcome measures (JSN >0.0 mm, JSN >0.2 mm, and JSN >0.5 mm; AUC 0.62-0.67). The inflammatory plasma lipid biomarkers PGE2 and 15-HETE identify patients with symptomatic knee OA, and the PBL inflammatory transcriptome identifies a subset of patients with symptomatic knee OA who are at increased risk of radiographic progression. These findings may reflect low-grade inflammation in OA and may be useful as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in clinical development of disease-modifying OA drugs.

Functional monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promoter -2518 polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism has been reported inconsistently to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this study was to explore whether the MCP-1 polymorphism confers susceptibility to SLE or LN. We surveyed studies on the MCP-1 polymorphism and SLE or LN identified by MEDLINE or manual searches. Meta-analysis was conducted on the AA genotype (recessive effect), AA, and AG genotypes (dominant effect), AA versus GG (genotype contrast), and on the A allele of MCP-1 in SLE and LN in each ethnic population studied and on all subjects. Ten studies, which included 1,739 SLE patients and 1,680 controls, were included in our meta-analysis. These consisted of two European, six Asian, one Latin American, and one mixed study. We did not find any association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE in all subjects or in ethnic groups. Meta-analysis also failed to reveal an association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphisms and LN. This meta-analysis on 3419 subjects indicates that no association exists between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE or LN.

Probing phase segregation in porphyrin-polymer blends with multidimensional IR spectroscopy. Multidimensional IR spectroscopy is used to study blends of the regioregular semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) with ruthenium porphyrins in solid state thin films. A ruthenium-bound carbon monoxide ligand is a sensitive reporter of the local electrostatic environment and indicates that the porphyrins localize into phase-segregated domains upon annealing in solvent vapor. The FTIR spectrum of this ligand reports on the state of aggregation, which we then correlate with transmission electron microscopy images of these films before and after annealing. We then use 2D-IR spectroscopy, an ultrafast IR technique, to measure the fast structural dynamics that are present in the vicinity of the CO ligand when it is homogeneously blended in the polymer film and phase segregated into purely porphyrinic domains.

Nerve growth factor mediated SH2-Bbeta/Akt signal pathway activated in allergic airway challenge in mice. Nerve growth factor (NGF) contributes to airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in allergic asthma. The Src homology 2beta/serine/threonine kinase (SH2-Bbeta/Akt) pathway is one of the avenues through which NGF regulates the biological activity of pheochromocytoma (PC)12 cells. It has also been reported that NGF upregulates the expression of SH2-Bbeta in the lung tissue of asthmatic mice. The present study investigated the effects of NGF and SH2-Bbeta on Akt activation during allergic airway challenge. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. The effects of NGF and SH2-Bbeta on Akt in allergic airway challenge were assessed by intravenously administering anti-NGF antibody or a mutant of SH2-Bbeta (R555E) to these mice. Pulmonary histological changes were then assessed and the inflammatory cells in the BAL fluid (BALF) were counted. Additionally, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) expression was determined by fluorescence microscopy, western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. Airway resistance was also measured using closed-type body plethysmography. We observed p-Akt overexpression in the lungs after allergen challenge by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and RT-PCR, as compared with the control. However, after treatment with anti-NGF or R555E, p-Akt levels and allergen-induced airway inflammation were reduced in comparison with those of allergen-challenged mice. Anti-NGF and R555E also decreased airway hyperresponsiveness caused by allergen challenge in response to methacholine (MCH). These results suggest that SH2-Bbeta regulation of Akt partly participates in the NGF-mediated development of allergic airway challenge.


Multidrug resistance phosphoglycoprotein (ABCB1) expression in the guinea pig placenta: developmental changes and regulation by betamethasone.

[Paraplegia due to adhesive arachnoiditis. A case report]. Various conditions of the spinal column occur at the lumbar level and new therapeutic surgical techniques have been applied to reduce the length of hospital stay, contribute to a quick return of patients to their activities of daily living, and reduce the postoperative limitations. However, a silent complication, adhesive arachnoiditis, has been reported with a frequency of 6-16% in cases undergoing lumbar surgery or with a history of revision surgery, and thus a second complication may occur, paraplegia, since the common symptom of arachnoiditis is persistent low back pain. The case of a 40-year-old patient is presented herein, who underwent lumbar spine surgery for herniated discs, and developed adhesive arachnoiditis involving the cauda equina, which was diagnosed with MRI. He had irreversible paraplegia with diffuse involvement of the cauda equina despite the mechanical lavage and surgical debridement performed due to the persistence of serous fluid discharge from the wound. The interbody implant placed during the first surgery was removed and the treatment was completed with posterior stabilization reinstrumentation; the patient had persistent neurologic impairment. There are few reports in the world literature of paraplegia due to non-infectious adhesive arachnoiditis. The remaining reports of paraplegia have been in patients with spinal infection, such as HIV-TB, mycosis, brucellosis or meningeal hemorrhage. It is not easy for patients to understand the very likely irreversible neurologic lesion of his complication. However, it is important for the spine surgeon to bear in mind the occurrence and frequency of adhesive arachnoiditis which could lead to irreversible neurologic deficit in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery.

A comparative analysis of remuneration models for pharmaceutical professional services. Pharmacists provide a wide range of professional services to support the appropriate use of medicines by patients. This study aims to conduct an international, comparative analysis of remuneration models for pharmaceutical professional services. Information about remuneration models was derived from a literature review and a semi-structured questionnaire completed by experts. Remuneration models differ in the way that pharmacists are paid for professional services beyond dispensing medicines. Also, the scope of services that are remunerated varies. The majority of countries regulate remuneration for services only when the medicine is paid for under the reimbursement scheme. Remuneration of services implies a commitment to assure their quality in some countries. Collaborative practice models have been set up where pharmacists work together with other health care professionals to deliver diagnosis-specific services or services based on the patient's use of medicines. The remuneration of services is influenced by the value of services, budgetary constraints, the payer perspective, and the attitude of physicians, pharmacists and patients. Professional organisations need to formulate a clear strategy for developing and gaining remuneration for pharmaceutical professional services. This implies that pharmacists not only demonstrate the value of services, but also assure their quality.


Human genome variation in health and in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Renal failure occurs in chronic lithium treatment but is uncommon. We sought to establish the prevalence of lithium-induced end-stage renal disease in two regions of Sweden with 2.7 million inhabitants corresponding to about 30% of the Swedish population. Eighteen patients with lithium-induced end-stage renal disease were identified among the 3369 patients in the general lithium-treated population, representing a sixfold increase in prevalence compared with the general population for renal replacement therapy. All lithium-treated patients were older than 46 years at end-stage renal disease with a mean lithium treatment time of 23 years with ten patients having discontinued lithium treatment an average of 10 years before the start of renal replacement therapy. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (defined as plasma creatinine over 150 micromol/l) in the general lithium-treated population was about 1.2% (excluding patients on renal replacement therapy). Compared with lithium-treated patients without renal failure, those with chronic kidney disease were older and most were men but, as groups, their mean serum lithium levels and psychiatric diagnoses did not differ. We found that end-stage renal disease is an uncommon but not rare consequence of long-term lithium treatment and is more prevalent than previously thought. Time on lithium was the only identified risk factor in this study, suggesting that regular monitoring of renal function in these patients is mandatory.

Mini-lap cholecystectomy: modifications and innovations in technique. As with any technology-driven field, laparoscopic surgery has made tremendous progress in recent years. Since the performance of first laparoscopic cholecystectomy by Prof Dr Med Erich Mühe of Böblingen, Germany 1985, this procedure has overtaken open cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice in cholelithiasis. However due to the cost incurred thereof and surgical training needed, open cholecystectomy is still performed on a very large scale in most parts of the third world countries. We tried to modify the conventional cholecystectomy to a minimal access approach (with minimal required infrastructure) to suit majority of patients with cholelithiasis in lieu of cost and morbidity. To assess the outcome of modified mini-lap cholecystectomy and report our experience with our innovations and modifications of the technique. Between May 2006 and May 2008, two hundred patients with cholelithiasis aged between 15 and 56 years underwent mini-lap cholecystectomy in a prospective study in Government medical college Srinagar. Our surgical approach was carried out using a 3-5cm oblique incision located two finger breadths below the costal margin; fashioned more laterally with a muscle cutting or splitting technique. The outcome was assessed in terms of intraoperative and postoperative parameters. The median (range) age was 38 (15-56) years and there were 143 females and 57 males in the study. All the procedures were completed successfully without any complications, though one patient needed the extension of incision as in conventional cholecystectomy. All the procedures were completed successfully. The mean (range) operative time was 35 (20-110)min and the average blood loss was 30ml. The mean (range) hospital stay was 2 (1-5) days. All patients returned back to routine work within 9 days of surgery. The mean follow-up was 12 (7-14) months. These results confirm that mini-lap cholecystectomy by our modified approach is safe, feasible and has lesser morbidity and postoperative pain as compared to conventional open cholecystectomy. The technique is cost effective, easy to practice and can benefit majority of patients who otherwise cannot afford the laparoscopic surgery. Hence it can serve as an alternative to the gold standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy with almost comparable results.

Increasingly restrictive definitions of hyperkalemia outcomes in a database study: effect on incidence estimates. To determine the incidence of hyperkalemia-associated adverse outcomes among ambulatory patients with diabetes newly initiating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy and to examine to what extent increasingly restrictive definitions of hyperkalemia-associated outcomes influenced incidence estimates. Retrospective cohort study of 27 355 individuals with diabetes who were new users of RAAS inhibitors at three integrated healthcare systems. Using the least restrictive definition of hyperkalemia-associated outcome, an ambulatory visit (AV), inpatient hospitalization (IP), or emergency department (ED) visit co-occurring within 7 days of coded hyperkalemia diagnosis and/or potassium concentration of > or =5.5 mmol/L, the incidence rate of hyperkalemia was 30.1 per 1000 person-years (p-y). Restricting to only IP or ED visits co-occurring within 24 hours of coded diagnosis and/or potassium > or =6 mmol/L, the incidence rate was 10.2 per 1000 p-y. When this latter definition was further restricted by removing available potassium laboratory values, the incidence rate declined to 9.5 per 1000 p-y. Modifying the definition of hyperkalemia-associated outcome resulted in up to threefold differences in incidence rate estimates. Our results demonstrate the value of including potassium laboratory results and AVs in identifying hyperkalemia from electronic data. Comparing incidence estimates across published studies requires consideration of differences in outcome definitions.

Photophysical properties of clozapine and determination of its concentration by using Eu(III)-dipicolinic acid complex as photo probe. Clozapine drug is photo-stable under irradiation of light for a long time, so we can store it in difficult and hot conditions. In addition the activity of clozapine is inhibited of the absorption spectra in the presence of glucose and enhanced in the presence of iron(III). We succeeded in detecting the concentration of clozapine in the range 1-60x10(-9)M using Eu(III)-dipicolinic acid complex as photo probe type and using Stern-Völmer equation to determine the Stern-Völmer constant, critical radius and the mechanism of quenching of luminescence of Eu(III)-dipicolinic acid complex is found to be of dipolar-dipolar interaction.

[Medication associated long QT syndrome]. We report on a 76 year old woman who fainted on her way to the restroom during the night. At the emergency department, a prolonged QT-interval was noticed in addition to sinusbradycardia and marginal hypokalemia. The QT-interval normalized promptly after citalopram was discontinued. Taking into account the clinical picture and the ascertained orthostatic dysregulation, a diagnosis of orthostatic syncope was made. Because of the lengthened QT-interval, drug-induced torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmia was considered as a differential diagnosis. We describe that citalopram was most probably the cause for the prolonged QT-interval. In our article we discuss the pathophysiology of drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS), the most important drugs involved, and finally the prophylaxis and treatment of a TdP ventricular arrhythmia.


Evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer by means of 99mTc-glucarate.

Ultrasound evaluation of obstructive uropathy and its hemodynamic responses in southwest Nigeria. To determine the renal arterial hemodynamic changes induced by obstructive uropathy using Doppler ultrasonography. 60 adult subjects with suspected obstructive uropathy and 60 asymptomatic apparently healthy controls with normal renal ultrasound features were evaluated. B-mode sonography of the kidneys and spectral Doppler examination of the renal interlobar arteries of all the participants were performed. The mean resistive indices (mRI) of both interlobar arteries were obtained and compared to that of the controls. The mRI of bilaterally obstructed kidneys were also compared with the mRI of unilaterally obstructed kidneys. The mRI of the right and left kidneys of subjects were 0.72±0.04 and 0.69±0.06 while those of the controls were 0.64±0.04 and 0.63±0.03 respectively. The mRI for the grades of caliectasis increased from grade I (0.72±0.03) to grade II (0.73±0.03) and grade III (0.73±0.02) but fell within the most severe levels of obstruction (0.69±0.07). There was no statistically significant relationship between the grades of caliectasis and unilateral or bilateral obstruction for both kidneys. The results show a sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 90% respectively when mRI≥0.7 was used to determine presence of obstruction. Renal duplex sonography is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of obstructive uropathy. Increased resistive index of the obstructed kidney may be a useful diagnostic tool in situations where intravenous urography cannot be done or is contraindicated.

PARP inhibitors in cancer therapy: two modes of attack on the cancer cell widening the clinical applications. The abundant nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) represents an important novel target in cancer therapy. PARP-1 is essential to the repair of single strand DNA breaks via the base excision repair pathway. Inhibitors of PARP-1 have been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of ionising radiation and DNA damaging chemotherapy agents such as the methylating agents and topoisomerase-I inhibitors. There are currently at least eight PARP inhibitors in clinical trial development. In vitro data, in vivo preclinical data and most recently early clinical trial data suggests that PARP inhibitors could be used not only as chemo/radiotherapy sensitizers but also as single agents to selectively kill cancers defective in DNA repair, specifically cancers with mutations in the breast cancer associated (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 genes. This theory of selectively exploiting cells defective in one DNA repair pathway by inhibiting another is a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. The current clinical data are discussed within this review with reference to the preclinical models which predicted activity and also future directions and the possible dangers/pitfalls of this clinical strategy are explored.

Quality of life measurements in epidermolysis bullosa: tools for clinical research and patient care. Quality of life (QOL) evaluation in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) has important applications in clinical management, patient advocacy, clinical research, and the development of new treatments. Several new quantitative and qualitative QOL measurement tools were developed recently, providing insight into the impact EB has on individuals and their family members. Selection of the most appropriate QOL tool for patients who have EB depends on not only the type of information required but also the general or specific cohort being examined. EB-specific quantitative tools possess the highest level of content validity and statistical accuracy. However, generic dermatologic tools may also be appropriate in some circumstances. Overall, QOL evaluation in EB is still a developing area of research that may help improve patient management and assess emerging treatment modalities for their efficacy in improving the QOL of patients with EB.


Mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, StAR, inhibits human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophage apoptosis.

Short-term exposure to hydrogen peroxide during oocyte maturation improves bovine embryo development. Recent studies have shown that short-term exposure of oocytes to a stressor such as hydrostatic pressure or osmotic stress might induce stress tolerance in embryos. The aim of the present study was to investigate the consequences of short-term hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) exposure to bovine in vitro matured cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) on subsequent preimplantation embryo development and apoptosis. In the first experiment, mature COCs were incubated in H(2)O(2) at concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 100 micromol/l, and subsequently fertilized and cultured. Oocyte incubation with 50-100 micromol/l of H(2)O(2) resulted in a significantly higher blastocyst yield (47.3%) in comparison with control medium (31.8%), while apoptotic cell ratio was inversely related with H(2)O(2) concentration. In the second experiment, we showed that the stress tolerance after H(2)O(2) exposure was not mediated by increased glutathione content in treated oocytes nor by enhanced fertilization or penetration. Further research should concentrate on the potential role of players that have been associated with stress tolerance in somatic cell lines.


Effect of dentin pretreatment with mild acidic HOCl solution on microtensile bond strength and surface pH.

Sudden cardiac death in adults with congenital heart disease. Sudden cardiac death is one of the leading causes of death in patients with congenital heart disease, especially in patients with repaired cyanotic and left heart obstructive lesions. While the overall annual incidence of sudden cardiac death is relatively low, estimated at 0.09% per year, this nonetheless represents a many-fold increase over that of comparable age-matched control populations. The most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death is believed to be arrhythmic, usually ventricular arrhythmia. Most studies investigating risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death have focused on patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and patients with Mustard/Senning repair for complete transposition of the great arteries. Despite a multitude of risk factors, their predictive value for the occurrence of sudden cardiac death is relatively low. Current experience with implantable cardioverter defibrillators in this patient population is limited to observational studies and the selection of patients for prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation is impeded both by the absence of randomized trials and weak predictors. Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia has emerged as a promising therapy for abolishing or reducing the burden of arrhythmia but experience is still limited and the impact on long-term outcome uncertain. Future studies will have to focus on improving risk stratification of patients with congenital heart disease.

The fewer and the better: prioritization of populations for  conservation under limited resources, a genetic study with  Borderea pyrenaica (Dioscoreaceae) in the Pyrenean National Park. Taxa considered under low International Union for the Conservation of Nature categories of extinction risk often represent cases of concern to conservation biology. Their high relative abundance precludes management of the entire range due to limited economical resources. Therefore, they require a cost-effective management plan. Borderea pyrenaica (Dioscoreaceae), an endemic plant of the Central Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenees, reaches the French side of the Central Pyrenees on its narrow northernmost boundary at Gavarnie (Parc National des Pyrenées, PNP, France), where it is protected as Vulnerable and considered a priority species. We have used nuclear microsatellite population genetic data to design a management strategy for the 11 populations of B. pyrenaica present in this area and to identify Relevant Genetic Units for its Conservation. The 18 SSR loci analysed identified 56 alleles, 24 of which fulfilled the rarity criterion for this set of populations. Genetic structuring of populations and representativity values derived from regression analyses of probabilities of loss of rare alleles together support differentiation of the B. pyrenaica populations into different management units. Estimates derived from G(ST) values indicate that five populations would adequately represent the 99.9% of the variation relative to most common alleles whereas calculations based on representativity values indicated that these five populations should equate the proportion 2:2:1 from the three different phylogeographical subdivisions of Gavarnie (Western, Eastern-1 and Eastern-2 ranges). This scheme would allow the preservation of 98.21% of the total B. pyrenaica alleles present in Gavarnie, according to the post glacial history of its populations. This conservation genetic approach could be applied to other low-extinction risk categories of extremely rare and subalpine plants in need of regulatory plans in European National Parks and Natural Reserves.


Oxidative damage induced in A549 cells by physically and chemically characterized air particulate matter (PM2.5) collected in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

Cultural conditions required for the induction of an adaptive acid-tolerance response (ATR) in Sinorhizobium meliloti and the question as to whether or not the ATR helps rhizobia improve their symbiosis with alfalfa at low pH. Sinorhizobium meliloti associates with Medicago and Melilotus species to develop nitrogen-fixing symbioses. The agricultural relevance of these associations, the worldwide distribution of acid soils, and the remarkable acid sensitivity of the microsymbiont have all stimulated research on the responses of the symbionts to acid environments. We show here that an adaptive acid-tolerance response (ATR) can be induced in S. meliloti, as shown previously for Sinorhizobium medicae, when the bacteria are grown in batch cultures at the slightly acid pH of 6.1. In marked contrast, no increased tolerance to hydrogen ions is obtained if rhizobia are grown in a chemostat under continuous cultivation at the same pH. The adaptive ATR appears as a complex process triggered by an increased hydrogen-ion concentration, but operative only if other--as yet unknown--concomitant factors that depend on the culture conditions are present (although not provided under continuous cultivation). Although the stability of the ATR and its influence on acid tolerance has been characterized in rhizobia, no data have been available on the effect of the adapted state on symbiosis. Coinoculation experiments showed that acid-adapted indicator rhizobia (ATR+) were present in >90% of the nodules when nodulation was performed at pH 5.6, representing a >30% increase in occupancy compared with a control test. We show that the ATR represents a clear advantage in competing for nodulation at low pH. It is not yet clear whether such an effect results from an improved performance in the acid environment during preinfection, an enhanced ability to initiate infections, or both conditions. The practical use of ATR+ rhizobia will depend on validation experiments with soil microcosms and on field testing, as well as on the possibility of preserving the physiology of ATR+ bacteria in inoculant formulations.

Mucilage and polysaccharides in the halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya virginica: localization and composition in relation to salt stress. Mucilage is thought to play a role in salinity tolerance in certain halophytic species by regulating water ascent and ion transport. The localization and composition of mucilage in the halophyte Kosteletzkya virginica was therefore investigated. Plants were grown in a hydroponic system in the presence or absence of 100mM NaCl and regularly harvested for growth parameter assessment and mucilage analysis with the gas liquid chromatography method. NaCl treatment stimulated shoot growth and biomass accumulation, had little effect on shoot and root water content, and reduced leaf water potential (Psi(w)), osmotic potential (Psi(s)) as well as stomatal conductance (g(s)). Mucilage increased in shoot, stems and roots in response to salt stress. Furthermore, changes were also observed in neutral monosaccharide components. Levels of rhamnose and uronic acid increased with salinity. Staining with a 0.5% alcian blue solution revealed the presence of mucopolyssacharides in xylem vessels and salt-induced mucilaginous precipitates on the leaf abaxial surface. Determination of ion concentrations showed that a significant increase of Na(+) and a decrease of K(+) and Ca(2+) simultaneously occurred in tissues and in mucilage under salt stress. Considering the high proportion of rhamnose and uronic acid in stem mucilage, we suggest that the pectic polysaccharide could be involved in Na(+) fixation, though only a minor fraction of accumulated sodium appeared to be firmly bound to mucilage.

A partially open porous media flow with chaotic advection: towards a model of coupled fields. In nature, dissipative fluxes of fluid, heat and/or reacting species couple to each other and may also couple to deformation of a surrounding porous matrix. We use the well-known analogy of Hele-Shaw flow to Darcy flow to make a model porous medium with porosity proportional to local cell height. Time- and space-varying fluid injection from multiple source/sink wells lets us create many different kinds of chaotic flows and chemical concentration patterns. Results of an initial time-dependent potential flow model illustrate that this is a partially open flow, in which parts of the material transported by the flow remain in the cell forever and parts pass through with residence time and exit time distributions that have self-similar features in the control parameter space of the stirring. We derive analytically the existence boundary in stirring control parameter space between where isolated fluid regions can and cannot remain forever in the open flow. Experiments confirm the predictions.

Elevation of serum ferritin is associated with the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Serum ferritin is a marker of acute phase reactions and iron storage. In addition, hematologic malignancies are associated with elevated serum ferritin levels. Other studies have suggested that ferritin is a surrogate for advanced disease and has an impact on relapse, because elevated serum ferritin predicts overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival following autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphomas. We studied 89 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to determine the value of serum ferritin in comparison with known prognostic factors. The OS in the elevated serum ferritin group (>or=300 ng/mL) was shorter than that in the normal serum ferritin group (<300 ng/mL, p<0.001) after a median follow-up of 25 months. In univariate analysis, elevated ferritin was correlated with poor survival in the patients (relative risk [RR], 2.588; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.536 to 4.358; p<0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that elevated serum ferritin was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with multiple myeloma (RR, 2.594; 95% CI, 1.403 to 4.797; p=0.002). The serum ferritin can a prognostic parameter of survival as well as disease activity in patients with multiple myeloma.


Assessment of intravascular granulomas in testicular seminomas and their association with tumour relapse and dissemination.

Barriers and facilitators related to the implementation of surgical safety checklists: a systematic review of the qualitative evidence. The objective of this review is to obtain a better understanding of the user-related barriers against, and facilitators for, the implementation of surgical safety checklists. We searched MEDLINE for articles describing stakeholders' perspectives regarding, and experiences with, the implementation of surgical safety checklists. The quality of the papers was assessed by means of the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Thematic synthesis was used to integrate the emergent descriptive themes into overall analytical themes. The synthesis of 18 qualitative studies indicated that implementation requires change in the workflow of healthcare professionals as well as in their perception of the checklist and the perception of patient safety in general. The factors impeding or advancing the required change concentrated around the checklist, the implementation process and the local context. We found that the required safety checks disrupt operating theatre staffs' routines. Furthermore, conflicting priorities and different perspectives and motives of stakeholders complicate checklist implementation. When approaching the checklist as a simple technical intervention, the expectation of cooperation between surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses is often not addressed, reducing the checklist to a tick-off exercise. The complex reality in which the checklist needs to be implemented requires an approach that includes more than eliminating barriers and supporting facilitating factors. Implementation leaders must facilitate team learning to foster the mutual understanding of perspectives and motivations, and the realignment of routines. This paper provides a pragmatic overview of the user-related barriers and facilitators upon which theories, hypothesising potential change strategies and interactions, can be developed and tested empirically.

[Idiopathic diffuse pulmonary ossification: a case report and review of the literature]. To describe the clinical features and diagnosis of idiopathic diffuse pulmonary ossification (DPO). A case of DPO confirmed by video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy was reported, and the literature was reviewed. A 32 year-old male was admitted to this hospital because of increased lung markings on chest X-ray for 7 years, and diffuse micro-nodular and reticular lesions on chest CT for 2 years. There were no significant symptoms, such as cough, sputum production and shortness of breath. Routine examinations and transbronchial lung biopsy failed to give a definite diagnosis, and therefore VATS lung biopsy was performed. The pathological study confirmed the presence of bone tissue in the lung, and the diagnosis of idiopathic DPD was made after careful exclusion of underlying diseases. Eleven cases of DPO diagnosed by lung biopsy in living patients were collected by review of the literature. The patients were all males, with a mean age of (48 +/- 17) years. No clinical symptoms were present in 4 cases, while spontaneous pneumothorax was the initial presentation in 3 cases. Other complaints included cough and shortness of breath. No case was reported in the Chinese literature. DPO is a rare disease, often without significant symptoms despite radiologically diffuse pulmonary lesions, which are easily misdiagnosed as other interstitial lung diseases.

Interferon induced thyroiditis. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used for the treatment of various disorders, most notable chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. One of the commonest side effects of IFNalpha therapy is thyroiditis, with up to 40% of HCV patients on IFNalpha developing clinical or subclinical disease. In some cases interferon induced thyroiditis (IIT) may result in severe symptomatology necessitating discontinuation of therapy. IIT can manifest as clinical autoimmune thyroiditis, presenting with symptoms of classical Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, or as non-autoimmune thyroiditis. Non-autoimmune thyroiditis can manifest as destructive thyroiditis, with early thyrotoxicosis and later hypothyroidism, or as non-autoimmune hypothyroidism. While the epidemiology and clinical presentation of IIT have been well characterized the mechanisms causing IIT are still poorly understood. It is likely that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) itself plays a role in the disease, as the association between HCV infection and thyroiditis is well established. It is believed that IFNalpha induces thyroiditis by both immune stimulatory effects and by direct effects on the thyroid. Early detection and therapy of this condition are important in order to avoid complications of thyroid disease such as cardiac arrhythmias.


HDAC inhibition radiosensitizes human normal tissue cells and reduces DNA Double-Strand Break repair capacity.

Dynamic control of maximal ventricular elastance in conscious dogs before and after pacing-induced heart failure. We identified the transfer functions relating beat-to-beat fluctuations in arterial blood pressure to maximal ventricular elastance (ABP-->E(max)) and beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate to E(max) (HR-->E(max)) to characterize the dynamic properties of the arterial ventricular contractility baroreflex and force-frequency relation, respectively, in three conscious dogs before and after pacing-induced heart failure. During the control condition, the average gain value, dominant time constant, and time delay were respectively -0.0374 ml(-1), 12.8 sec, and 2 sec for the ABP-->E(max) transfer function and 0.0137 mmHg/ml-bpm, 1.77 sec, and 0 sec for the HR-->E(max) transfer function. During the heart failure condition, both transfer functions were markedly depressed. These results are consistent with known physiology and previous studies and provide perhaps the first quantitative information on the dynamic control of E(max) during normal closed-loop operation.

Colesevelam HCl improves fasting plasma glucose and lipid levels in patients with prediabetes. Although colesevelam hydrochloride (HCl) is indicated to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, its effects on glucose and lipids in patients with prediabetes have not been previously studied. To evaluate the effects of colesevelam HCl in patients with prediabetes, a post-hoc analysis was conducted on data from a 24-week lipid-lowering study. Using baseline laboratory safety data for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 88 patients were identified as having prediabetes according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Fasting plasma glucose was reduced by 4.0 mg/dL with colesevelam HCl 3.8 g/day and by 6.1 mg/dL with colesevelam HCl 4.5 g/day compared with placebo. Additionally, LDL-C was reduced by 13.2% and 12.0% with colesevelam HCl 3.8 and 4.5 g/day, respectively, versus placebo. Colesevelam HCl 3.8 g/day also significantly reduced total cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo)B levels, whereas no significant difference in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apoA-I, or triglyceride levels was observed versus placebo. In patients with hyperlipidemia and prediabetes, colesevelam HCl improved glycemic control and the lipid profile.


Effects of hyperprolactinemia on the tibial epiphyseal plate of mice treated with sex hormones.

Effectiveness of ribavirin and corticosteroids for severe acute respiratory syndrome. Ribavirin and corticosteroids were used widely as front-line treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome; however, previous evaluations were inconclusive. We assessed the effectiveness of ribavirin and corticosteroids as the initial treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome using propensity score analysis. We analyzed data on 1755 patients in Hong Kong and 191 patients in Toronto with severe acute respiratory syndrome using a generalized propensity score approach. The adjusted excess case fatality ratios of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome receiving the combined therapy of ribavirin and corticosteroids within 2 days of admission, compared with those receiving neither treatment within 2 days of admission, were 3.8% (95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 9.2) in Hong Kong and 2.1% (95% confidence interval, -44.3 to 48.5) in Toronto. Our results add strength to the hypothesis that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids has no therapeutic benefit when given early during severe acute respiratory syndrome infection. Further studies may investigate the effects of these treatments later in disease course.


[Adipose tissue as a therapeutic target in obesity].

Allele frequency data for 17 short tandem repeats in a Czech population sample. Allele frequencies for 17 short tandem repeats (STRs) autosomal loci (D2S1338, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D19S433, D21S11, CSF1PO, FGA, PentaD, PentaE, TH01, TPOX, vWA) were studied in an extensive sample (max. N=1411) of unrelated individuals originating from the Czech Republic. Population and forensic parameters were estimated. Except for FGA and Penta E loci, no deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were detected. A comparative analysis with published data revealed significant differences in allele frequencies for some loci from the Polish population and three Hungarian populations (Ashkenazim population and Romany populations from Debrecen and Baranya County, respectively). A combination of these 17 STR loci provides a powerful tool for forensic identification in the native Czech population.

Resuscitation-induced intestinal edema and related dysfunction: state of the science. High volume resuscitation and damage control surgical methods, while responsible for significantly decreasing morbidity and mortality from traumatic injuries, are associated with pathophysiologic derangements that lead to subsequent end organ edema and dysfunction. Alterations in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures frequently result in intestinal edema and subsequent dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to examine the principles involved in the development of intestinal edema, current and historical models for the study of edema, effects of edema on intestinal function (particularly ileus), molecular mediators governing edema-induced dysfunction, potential role of mechanotransduction , and therapeutic effects of hypertonic saline. We review the current state of the science as it relates to resuscitation induced intestinal edema and resultant dysfunction.

Do cultural factors predict mammography behaviour among Korean immigrants in the USA? This paper is a report of a study of the correlates of mammogram use among Korean American women. Despite the increasing incidence of and mortality from breast cancer, Asian women in the United States of America report consistently low rates of mammography screening. A number of health beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics have been associated with mammogram participation among these women. However, studies systematically investigating cultural factors in relation to mammogram experience have been scarce. We measured screening-related health beliefs, modesty and use of Eastern medicine in 100 Korean American women in 2006. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine the unique contribution of the study variables, after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics. Only 51% reported past mammogram use. Korean American women who had previously had mammograms were statistically significantly older and had higher perceived benefit scores than those who had not. Perceived benefits (odds ratio = 6.3, 95% confidence interval = 2.12, 18.76) and breast cancer susceptibility (odds ratio = 3.18, 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 9.59) were statistically significant correlates of mammography experience, whereas cultural factors did not correlate. Post hoc analysis showed that for women with some or good English skills, cultural factors statistically significantly correlated with health beliefs and breast cancer knowledge (P < 0.05). Nurses should consider the inclusion in culturally tailored interventions of more targeted outreach and healthcare system navigation assistance for promoting mammography screening in Korean American women. Further research is needed to unravel the interplay between acculturation, cultural factors and health beliefs related to cancer screening behaviours of Korean American women.

Alpha-eleostearic acid induces autophagy-dependent cell death through targeting AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signal together with the generation of reactive oxygen species. Alpha-eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3), a linolenic acid isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically-active compound that has been shown to possess potent anti-tumor properties. Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA induced apoptosis and autophagy with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells. Treatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phase in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also induced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading to a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC3 II compared to that of the control. The autophagy was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry through monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining. It appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanism against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mTOR signaling, and AKT were further reduced by pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhanced. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that the generation of ROS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding death promotion.

Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on four types of pressure-programmable valves. Exposure to powerful magnetic fields may alter the settings of programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunt valves or even cause permanent damage to these devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance imaging both generate a high-intensity, focal magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature data on the compatibility of TMS with neurosurgical implants. The aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate the effects of TMS on four types of pressure-programmable valves (the Strata 2 from Medtronic, the Polaris from Sophysa, the ProGAV from Miethke, and a cylindrical valve from Codman-Hakim). We used a Magpro X100 stimulator (Medtronic) for monophasic or biphasic TMS via a circular or a figure-of-eight coil. Each valve setting was tested before and after exposure to TMS. Experiment 1: The effect of the coil-valve distance (10, 5, 2.5, and 1 cm) was assessed. Experiment 2: We mimicked in situ stimulation with a human mannequin by placing the valve in a retroauricular position, the TMS circular coil on the apex, and figure-of-eight coil centered over the primary motor area site. Temperature changes were monitored throughout the experiments. Experience 3: TMS-induced valve movements were assessed by using an in-house accelerometric setup. Our results primarily demonstrated that the Strata 2 and Codman-Hakim valves' settings were perturbed by TMS. There was no heating effect for any of the valves. However, TMS induced movements of the Strata 2, Polaris, and ProGAV valves. Experiment 1: The unsetting frequencies observed for the Strata 2 and the Codman-Hakim valve showed an influence of the distance, the coil model, and the magnetic field characteristics, whereas the Polaris and ProGAV's settings remained unchanged. Experiment 2: Unsetting occurred for Strata 2 valve with the circular coil only, whereas the Polaris, ProGAV, and Codman-Hakim valves' settings remained stable. Experiment 3: The Strata 2, Polaris, and ProGAV valves showed high-amplitude oscillations during TMS under all stimulation conditions, whereas the Codman-Hakim valve did not move. Our in vitro experiments showed that TMS can interfere with programmable shunt valves by inducing unsetting or movement. This finding suggests that great care must be taken if applying TMS in hydrocephalic, shunted patients.


Postoperative Complications After Prophylactic Thyroidectomy for Very Young Patients With Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2: Retrospective Cohort Analysis.

Heightened flexor withdrawal response in individuals with knee osteoarthritis is modulated by joint compression and joint mobilization. Patients with chronic pain often present with hyperalgesia, possibly due to hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in flexor withdrawal reflex (FWR) excitability in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the potential effect of specific physical inputs or therapeutic interventions (ie, joint compression and mobilization) on these behaviors. Ten subjects with and 10 without knee OA (age 45-75) were recruited. The FWR was examined utilizing suprathreshold, noxious electrocutaneous stimuli applied at the medial foot. Surface electromyographic (EMG) was recorded from the tibialis anterior (TA) and biceps femoris (BF), and peak joint torques recorded at the hip, knee, and ankle. FWR threshold was ascertained and responses at 2x threshold recorded after the following conditions: a maximal, volitional, joint-compression task, a sham hands-on intervention, and a Grade III oscillatory joint-mobilization intervention. A decreased threshold-to-flexor withdrawal response was found in the OA vs control group (P < .01). EMG and joint-torque FWR responses were further augmented in the OA group following the maximal joint-compression task (P < .05), yet remained unchanged or diminished in controls. Joint mobilization, but not sham intervention, reduced reflex responses significantly, although primarily by decreasing BF activity and knee torques (P < .05). Application of specific physical inputs to individuals with knee OA similar to those encountered during activity of daily living or during therapeutic interventions appear to modulate involuntary, nociceptive reflex responses. Routine weight-bearing activities such as walking may potentially enhance heightened FWR responses, while joint mobilization, a commonly used clinical intervention, may diminish reflex excitability.

Mood-congruent attention and memory bias in dysphoria: Exploring the coherence among information-processing biases. Recent studies indicate that depression is characterized by mood-congruent attention bias at later stages of information-processing. Moreover, depression has been associated with enhanced recall of negative information. The present study tested the coherence between attention and memory bias in dysphoria. Stable dysphoric (n = 41) and non-dysphoric (n = 41) undergraduates first performed a spatial cueing task that included negative, positive, and neutral words. Words were presented for 250 ms under conditions that allowed or prevented elaborate processing. Memory for the words presented in the cueing task was tested using incidental free recall. Dysphoric individuals exhibited an attention bias for negative words in the condition that allowed elaborate processing, with the attention bias for negative words predicting free recall of negative words. Results demonstrate the coherence of attention and memory bias in dysphoric individuals and provide suggestions on the influence of attention bias on further processing of negative material.

Tuberculosis: a disease without boundaries. Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that usually affects the lungs leading to severe coughing, fever, and chest pains. Although current research in the past four years has provided valuable insight into TB transmission, diagnosis, and treatment, much remains to be discovered to effectively decrease the incidence of and eventually eradicate TB. The disease still puts a strain on public health, being only second to HIV/AIDS in causing high mortality rates. This review will highlight the history of TB as well as provide an overview of the current literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and the immune response, treatment, and control of TB. In this race to combat a disease that knows no boundaries, it is necessary to have a conceptual and clear understanding of TB overall with the hope of providing better treatment through novel and collaborative research and public health efforts.

[Changes of the brain stem neurocytes in newborn rats in the conditions of experimental model of hypoxia during neuroprotective correction]. The work includes a research of morphological and immune-histochemical specifics of baby rats' cerebral structures in the conditions of experimental hypoxia model and with the administration of Cerebrocurin. It was ascertained that the most pronounced changes in the form of pericellular and perivascular edema, spongiform loci and loci of necrosis, with the phenomena of apoptosis and aponeuroses, occurred during severe hypoxia. Administration of Cerebrocurin in baby rats, which experienced moderate hypoxia, causes a decrease in pathological changes in cerebral structures and the approximation of the level of CD95 APO-1/Fas and Bcl-21 gene expression to their level in intact animals.

Health risk evaluation associated to Planktothrix rubescens: An integrated approach to design tailored monitoring programs for human exposure to cyanotoxins. Increasing concern for human health related to cyanotoxin exposure imposes the identification of pattern and level of exposure; however, current monitoring programs, based on cyanobacteria cell counts, could be inadequate. An integrated approach has been applied to a small lake in Italy, affected by Planktothrix rubescens blooms, to provide a scientific basis for appropriate monitoring program design. The cyanobacterium dynamic, the lake physicochemical and trophic status, expressed as nutrients concentration and recycling rates due to bacterial activity, the identification/quantification of toxic genotype and cyanotoxin concentration have been studied. Our results indicate that low levels of nutrients are not a marker for low risk of P. rubescens proliferation and confirm that cyanobacterial density solely is not a reliable parameter to assess human exposure. The ratio between toxic/non-toxic cells, and toxin concentrations, which can be better explained by toxic population dynamic, are much more diagnostic, although varying with time and environmental conditions. The toxic fraction within P. rubescens population is generally high (30-100%) and increases with water depth. The ratio toxic/non-toxic cells is lowest during the bloom, suggesting a competitive advantage for non-toxic cells. Therefore, when P. rubescens is the dominant species, it is important to analyze samples below the thermocline, and quantitatively estimate toxic genotype abundance. In addition, the identification of cyanotoxin content and congeners profile, with different toxic potential, are crucial for risk assessment.

Development of motion correction technique for cardiac (15)O-water PET study using an optical motion tracking system. Cardiac (15)O-water PET studies provide an accurate quantitation of regional myocardial blood flow (rMBF). We developed a motion correction system using an optical motion-tracking device to detect a subject's global movement for cardiac study. PET studies were carried out on a cardiac phantom and a healthy volunteer at rest. The three-dimensional locations of the markers attached to the subjects during scans were measured using an optical motion-tracking system. In the phantom study, we performed a transmission scan and seven (18)F emission scans of a baseline and with artificial misalignment of shifts and rotations. The correlation coefficients between the baseline and the other images before and after the corrections for the misalignment were calculated. In the human study, we performed a (15)O-water dynamic scan with a transmission and axially 30 mm-shifted transmission scans. Motion of the subject was estimated by the information from the system, and was corrected on each sinogram using attenuation maps realigned to dynamic frames. Reconstructed dynamic images were then realigned to the transmission data. We calculated rMBF values for nine segments and myocardial images from the emission images, which were reconstructed with the first attenuation map (reference) and with the misaligned attenuation map before and after our corrections. In the phantom study, the correlation coefficients were improved from 0.929 +/- 0.022 to 0.987 +/- 0.010 (mean +/- SD) after the corrections. In the human study, the global and cyclic movements were detected. The cyclic movement due to respiration was smoothed by frame-averaging, and reasonable information of the global movement was obtained. The rMBF value (mean +/- SD) was 0.94 +/- 0.12 mL/min/g for the reference. The rMBF values using the misaligned attenuation map changed from 1.03 +/- 0.21 to 0.93 +/- 0.11 mL/min/g after the correction, and spurious defects in myocardial images were also recovered. Our technique provided reasonable information for correcting the global movement of the subject. It was shown that this system was applicable to detect and correct subject movement in cardiac PET studies at rest.

In vivo toxicity testing of methyl blue and aniline blue as vital dyes for intraocular surgery. To investigate the biocompatibility of methyl blue and aniline blue as vital dyes for vitreoretinal surgery in an in vivo rat model and to evaluate the effect of these dyes on retinal structure and function. Adult Brown-Norway rats received intravitreal injections of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 2% methyl blue or aniline blue dissolved in balanced salt solution with balanced salt solution serving as a control. Retinal toxicity was assessed 7 days thereafter by means of retinal ganglion cell counts, light microscopy, and electroretinography. No significant decrease in retinal ganglion cell counts at concentrations up to 0.2% was observed. At 2%, however, a significant retinal ganglion cell loss was detected with both dyes (more pronounced for aniline blue). Light microscopy showed no structural changes in the central retina for concentrations up to 0.2%. Electroretinographies detected no adverse effects of methyl blue or aniline blue on rod- or cone-driven responses at concentrations up to 0.2%. Methyl blue and aniline blue are very biocompatible and may, therefore, be usable for intraocular surgery. Further testing with other animal models will be necessary to confirm this. The safety margin of methyl blue is possibly higher than that of aniline blue.

The role of nonbonded interactions in the conformational dynamics of organophosphorous hydrolase adsorbed onto functionalized mesoporous silica surfaces. The enzyme organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of organophosphorous compounds with high catalytic efficiency and broad substrate specificity. The immobilization of OPH in functionalized mesoporous silica (FMS) surfaces increases significantly its catalytic specific activity, as compared to the enzyme in solution, with important applications for the detection and decontamination of insecticides and chemical warfare agents. Experimental measurements of immobilization efficiency as a function of the charge and coverage percentage of different functional groups have been interpreted as electrostatic forces being the predominant interactions underlying the adsorption of OPH onto FMS surfaces. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for OPH in bulk solution and adsorbed onto two distinct interaction potential models of the FMS functional groups to investigate the relative contributions of nonbonded interactions to the conformational dynamics and adsorption of the protein. Our results support the conclusion that electrostatic interactions are responsible for the binding of OPH to the FMS surface. However, these results also show that van der Waals forces are detrimental for interfacial adhesion. In addition, it is found that OPH adsorption onto the FMS models favors a protein conformation whose active site is fully accessible to the substrate, in contrast to the unconfined protein.

Region- and pattern-specific effects of glutamate uptake blockers on epileptiform activity in rat brain slices. Many epileptic syndromes develop into pharmaco-resistant forms, calling for the development of new anticonvulsant strategies. The transmitter glutamate serves a double role as excitatory transmitter and as precursor for GABA, thus interfering with glutamate uptake may therefore exert complex effects on excitation-inhibition-balance in epileptic networks. In the present study we tested the effect of two different glutamate uptake blockers on acutely induced epileptiform activity in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices from adult rats: dihydrokainate (DHK) which blocks predominantly glial glutamate uptake, and threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) which blocks both glial and neuronal glutamate uptake. Three different models were used to induce epileptiform discharges: (i) increasing NMDA receptor-mediated excitation by omitting Mg(2+)-ions; (ii) blocking potassium channels by 4-aminopyridine; (iii) reducing GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition by penicillin. Application of DHK or TBOA markedly reduced the frequency of epileptiform discharges in CA1 in the low magnesium and the 4-AP model while pathological activity was increased in the penicillin-model. In contrast, frequency of epileptiform discharges in EC was consistently increased by DHK and TBOA. Effects of DHK were more easily reversible than those of TBOA. Thus glutamate uptake blockers exert variable effects on epileptiform activity, depending on brain region and on the mechanism of ictogenesis.

[The strain differentiation of Candida albicans by morphotyping]. Morphotyping is a phenotypic method for strain differentiation of yeast cultures based on the comparison of appearance of their surfaces and fringes. For its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, it is recommended as an alternative tool to genotyping of Candida albicans. Our study aimed at verifying its usefulness for typing a group of C. albicans clinical isolates with emphasis on discrimination power. Prevalence of specific morphotypes in body locations with more tested isolates and according to age groups and gender of patients was also evaluated. The tested group comprised 97 C. albicans isolates from 93 patients. With a cotton swab, 24-hour cultures were streaked onto malt extract agar. The surface and fringe morphology was assessed after 10-day incubation at 30 degrees C. A total of 30 morphotypes were detected. The most frequent one had a code profile 7240 (n = 13, 13.4 %), followed by 5240 (n = 11) and 7340 (n = 9). The discrimination power calculated by Simpson's index of diversity reached 0.95. Results of reproducibility testing were identical in 54.6 % of isolates, another 36.1 % of isolates differed in one character. Some isolates (n = 35) were biotyped by our modification of Odds method. Using morphological criteria, 14 different phenotypes were defined, as opposed to 8 found by biotyping. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing morphotypes from the oropharynx, vagina and urine; the same was true for male and female morphotypes. Our results clearly documented very good discrimination power of morphotyping for C. albicans isolates. This advantage as well as easiness to perform and low costs but markedly lower reproducibility in comparison with molecular genetic techniques makes it an optimal typing method for first-line use. Evaluation of morphological diversity of strains by this method can be further utilized in the studies of virulence, switching phenomenon or antifungal resistance.

Association of anti-Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein antibody response with anti-aquaporin-4 autoimmunity in Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. There are two distinct subtypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Asians: opticospinal (OSMS) and conventional (CMS). OSMS has similar features to neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and half of OSMS patients have the NMO-Immunoglobulin G (IgG)/ anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody. We reported that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was significantly less common in CMS patients than controls. To reveal the immune responses to the H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) in Japanese MS patients, according to anti-AQP4 antibody status, sera from 162 MS patients, 37 patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND), and 85 healthy subjects were assayed for anti-H. pylori antibodies, anti-HP-NAP antibodies, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) by enzyme immunoassays. H. pylori seropositivity rates were significantly higher in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive MS/NMO (AQP4 + /MS) patients (19/27, 70.4%) than anti-AQP4 antibody-negative CMS (AQP4 - /CMS) patients (22/83, 26.5%). Among H. pylori-infected individuals, the anti-HP-NAP antibody was significantly more common in AQP4 + /MS and AQP4 - /OSMS patients than healthy subjects (36.8%, 34.6% versus 2.8%). Among the AQP4 + /MS patients, a significant positive correlation between anti-HP-NAP antibody levels and the final Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale scores was found, and MPO levels were higher in anti-HP-NAP antibody-positive patients than anti-HP-NAP antibody-negative ones. Therefore, HP-NAP may be associated with the pathology of anti-AQP4 antibody-related neural damage in MS/NMO patients.

The CAPER studies: five case-control studies aimed at identifying and quantifying the risk of cancer in symptomatic primary care patients. This paper reviews the background to five primary care case-control studies, collectively known as the CAPER studies (Cancer Prediction in Exeter). These studies, on colorectal, lung, prostate and brain tumours, sought to identify the particular features of cancer as reported to primary care. They also sought to quantify the risk of cancer for symptoms and primary care investigations, both individually and paired together. Two studies were on colorectal cancer: the former with 349 cases used hand searching and coding of entries, while the latter obtained 6442 cases from a national electronic database. The lung and prostate studies had 247 and 217 cases, respectively, and used manual methods. The brain study also used a national electronic database, which provided 3505 cases. Generally, the symptoms matched previous series from secondary care, though the risks of cancer, expressed as positive predictive values, were lower. Rectal bleeding in colorectal cancer, and haemoptysis in lung cancer both had positive predictive values of 2.4%. The risk of a brain tumour with headache was one in a thousand. The results identify areas where current guidance on urgent referral for investigation of suspected cancer could be improved.

Surgical repair of a giant aneurysm of the right subclavian artery. Giant isolated subclavian aneurysm is a rare disease. We report a case of a 66-year-old lady, with a proximal intrathoracic true aneurysm of the right subclavian artery. Due to the absence of a proximal neck, and for the relevant tortuosity of the vessels, we decided to approach the aneurysm through a median sternotomy. The aneurysm was excluded and opened. Then, we performed a direct subclavian-carotid transposition. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Development of diet-induced fatty liver disease in the aging mouse is suppressed by brief daily exposure to low-magnitude mechanical signals. The age-induced decline in the body's ability to fight disease is exacerbated by obesity and metabolic disease. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, the combined challenge of a high-fat diet and age on liver morphology and biochemistry was characterized, while evaluating the potential of 15 min per day of high frequency (90 Hz), extremely low-magnitude (0.2 G) mechanical signals (LMMS) to suppress lipid accumulation in the liver. Following a 36-week protocol (animals 43 weeks of age), suppression of hepatomegaly and steatosis was reflected by a 29% lower liver mass in LMMS animals as compared with controls. Average triglyceride content was 101.7+/-19.4 microg mg(-1) tissue in the livers of high-fat diet control (HFD) animals, whereas HFD+LMMS animals realized a 27% reduction to 73.8+/-22.8 microg mg(-1) tissue. In HFD+LMMS animals, liver free fatty acids were also reduced to 0.026+/-0.009 microEq mg(-1) tissue from 0.035+/-0.005 microEq mg(-1) tissue in HFD. Moderate to severe micro- and macrovesicular steatosis in HFD was contrasted to a 49% reduction in area covered by the vacuoles of at least 15 microm(2) in size in HFD+LMMS animals. These data provide preliminary evidence of the ability of LMMS to attenuate the progression of fatty liver disease, most likely achieved indirectly by suppressing adipogenesis and thus the total adipose burden through life, thereby reducing a downstream challenge to liver morphology and function.

Etiology and treatment of hypogonadism in adolescents. Adequate functioning at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is necessary for normal gonadal development and subsequent sex steroid production. Deficiencies at any level of the axis can lead to a hypogonadal state. The causes of hypogonadism are heterogeneous and may involve any level of the reproductive system. This review discusses various causes of hypogonadism, describes the evaluation of hypogonadal states, and outlines treatment options for the induction of puberty in affected adolescents. Whereas some conditions are clearly delineated, the exact etiology and underlying pathogenesis of many disorders is unknown.

Differential role of mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors in ethanol-mediated locomotor activation and ethanol intake in preweanling rats. The opioid system modulates ethanol intake and reinforcement in adult and preweanling rodents. While adult heterogeneous rats normally do not show ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation, preweanling rats show it quite clearly. We recently observed that naloxone, a non-specific opioid antagonist, attenuated ethanol-induced locomotor activation in preweanling rats. In the present study we tested the role of specific opioid receptors (mu, delta and kappa) in ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation and ethanol intake. In Experiment 1 13-day-old rats received naloxonazine (mu antagonist: 0, 7.5 or 15 mg/kg), naltrindole (delta antagonist: 0, 2 or 4 mg/kg) or nor-binaltorphimine (kappa antagonist: 0, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg) before an intragastric administration of ethanol (0 or 2.5 g/kg), and subsequent locomotor activity assessment. In Experiment 2, the same opioid antagonists were administered on postnatal days 13 and 14 before consumption of ethanol (6%), saccharin (0.05%) or distilled water. In Experiment 1 only naloxonazine reduced ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation. None of the opioid antagonists affected locomotor activity in water controls. In Experiment 2 naloxonazine and naltrindole suppressed ingestion of all the solutions tested. Similar to what has been reported in adult rodents, mu-opioid receptors seem to modulate ethanol-activating effects during early ontogeny. Hence, there seems to be a partial overlap of neurochemical mechanisms involved in the rewarding and stimulating effects of ethanol in preweanling rats. Mu-receptor antagonists reduced both ethanol-induced activity and ethanol intake, but it is unclear whether the latter effect is specific to ethanol or only a reflection of an effect on consummatory behavior generally, since mu and delta receptor antagonists also suppressed ingestion of water and saccharin.

Characterization of the O-antigen in the lipopolysaccharide of Cronobacter (Enterobacter) malonaticus 3267. Cronobacter malonaticus, a Gram-negative bacterium previously known as Enterobacter sakazakii, is an opportunistic pathogen known to cause serious infection in infants and neonates. To provide aid for the serological and chemical identification of clinical, environmental, or food isolates of this emerging pathogen, the characterization of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-polysaccharide (O-PS) antigens of Cronobacter spp. is being undertaken. The structural analysis of the O-PS, obtained by hydrazinolysis of the lipopolysaccharide produced by Cronobacter malonaticus HPB 3267, was investigated by composition, methylation, and two-dimensional high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance methods, and was found to be a polymer of a branched pentasaccharide unit. This unit is composed of D-glucose (D-Glc), D-galactose (D-Gal), 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (D-GlcN), 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-galactose (D-GalN) and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residues (1: 1: 1: 1: 1), forms the repeating oligosaccharide in the O-PS antigen, and has the structure: [structure: see text].


Cost effectiveness of nonoperative management versus laparoscopic appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis.

CCR2, MCP-1, SDF-1a & DC-SIGN gene polymorphisms in HIV-1 infected patients with & without tuberculosis. Variability in the clinical outcome of persons exposed to and infected with HIV-1 and tuberculosis (TB) is determined by multiple factors including host genetic variations. The aim of the present study was to find out whether chemokine, chemokine receptor and DC-SIGN gene polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility or resistance to HIV and HIV-TB in south India. CCR2 V64I (G/A), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) -2518 A/G, stromal cell derived factor-1alpha; (SDF-1alpha) 3'UTR G/A and DC-SIGN gene polymorphisms were studied by polymerase chain reaction based methods in HIV-1 infected patients without TB (n=151), with pulmonary TB (PTB) (n=81) and extrapulmonary TB (n=31), 155 PTB patients without HIV and 206 healthy controls. The genotype frequencies of CCR2 V64I, MCP-1 -2518 and DC-SIGN polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the study groups. A significantly increased frequency of GG genotype of SDF-1alpha polymorphism was observed among HIV+PTB+ patients compared to healthy controls (P=0.009, Pc=0.027). Our data suggest that GG genotype of SDF-1alpha 3'UTR polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to PTB in HIV-1 infected patients. A better understanding of genetic factors that are associated with TB could help target preventive strategies to those HIV patients likely to develop tuberculosis.


Dynamic solution to the EEG source localization problem using Kalman filters and particle filters.

Spontaneous asymptomatic coronary artery dissection in a young man. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare condition that most often presents as acute coronary syndrome or sudden cardiac death. Here we present the case of a young man of 25 years, who had remained asymptomatic in spite of SCAD. This case highlights the fact that spontaneous dissections can occur at a young age and can involve more than one coronary artery, without producing clinical symptoms.

Vaccine safety: current systems and recent findings. An understanding of vaccine safety is important for all immunization providers, who have responsibilities to identify, report, and prevent adverse events. New analytic methods can provide more rapid information on adverse events compared with traditional observational studies. Some adverse events following vaccination are preventable. Syncope is increasingly recognized postvaccination and may be associated with severe injury or death. Both human and system factors should be addressed to prevent vaccine administration errors. Ongoing basic science and clinical research is critical to improved understanding of vaccine safety. A recent study suggests that many cases of encephalopathy following whole-cell pertussis vaccine were due to severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, a severe seizure disorder associated with mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN1A. Vaccine safety requires prelicensure evaluation, postlicensure surveillance and investigation, addressing preventable adverse events, reconsideration of vaccine policy as understanding of risks and benefits changes, and ongoing research to better understand the response to vaccination and the pathogenesis of adverse events.

Characterization of oligosaccharides in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells: two decades of analytical technology development. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is a well-characterized glycoprotein with a great deal of published information on its structure, post-translational modifications, and O- and N-glycosylation. Most of the characterization was accomplished in the late 1980s. During the past 2 decades, however, mass spectrometry has made a quantum leap forward offering new capabilities in soft electrospray ionization, speed, resolution, and accuracy of mass measurements. From this point of view, it is worthwhile to revisit the characterization of familiar proteins, such as rt-PA, using the new capabilities of modern analytical technology. In this work, we applied LC-MS with state-of-the-art instrumentation to the characterization of glycoforms of rt-PA. This method takes advantage of accurate mass measurements along with a fast "in-source" voltage switching for the detection of characteristic oxonium ions of saccharides. This method confirmed previously identified glycan structures based on existing knowledge of rt-PA glycans. In addition, we identified two novel glycan structures in rt-PA. A low level of Asn142 N-glycosylation was detected at an atypical Asn-Xaa-Cys consensus motif. It was found to be modified predominantly by biantennary hybrid structures. This N-glycosylation site was confirmed using a recently developed electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) technique. Also using this method, we detected low levels of elongation of fucose-O-Thr61 to di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides, not previously observed in rt-PA. The results demonstrate that use of state-of-the-art analytical methods can reveal low-level, previously undetected modifications of well-characterized biopharmaceuticals.


Human papillomavirus testing and cervical cytology in primary screening for cervical cancer among women in rural China: comparison of sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of referral.

Dysmenorrhea in a multiethnic population of adolescent Asian girls. To determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea, its impact, and the treatment-seeking behavior of adolescent Asian girls. A cross-sectional study with 1092 girls from 15 public secondary schools and 3 ethnic groups in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Overall, 74.5% of the girls who had reached menarche had dysmenorrhea; 51.7% of these girls reported that it affected their concentration in class; 50.2% that it restricted their social activities; 21.5% that it caused them to miss school; and 12.0% that it caused poor school performance. Ethnicity and form at school were significantly associated with the poor concentration, absenteeism, and restriction of social and recreational activities attributed to dysmenorrhea. Only 12.0% had consulted a physician, and 53.3% did nothing about their conditions. There were ethnic differences in the prevalence, impact, and management of dysmenorrhea. There is a need for culture-specific education regarding menstruation-related conditions in the school curriculum.

Intraoperative CT as a registration benchmark for intervertebral motion compensation in image-guided open spinal surgery. An accurate and reliable benchmark of registration accuracy and intervertebral motion compensation is important for spinal image guidance. In this study, we evaluated the utility of intraoperative CT (iCT) in place of bone-implanted screws as the ground-truth registration and illustrated its use to benchmark the performance of intraoperative stereovision (iSV). A template-based, multi-body registration scheme was developed to individually segment and pair corresponding vertebrae between preoperative CT and iCT of the spine. Intervertebral motion was determined from the resulting vertebral pair-wise registrations. The accuracy of the image-driven registration was evaluated using surface-to-surface distance error (SDE) based on segmented bony features and was independently verified using point-to-point target registration error (TRE) computed from bone-implanted mini-screws. Both SDE and TRE were used to assess the compensation accuracy using iSV. The iCT-based technique was evaluated on four explanted porcine spines (20 vertebral pairs) with artificially induced motion. We report a registration accuracy of 0.57 [Formula: see text] 0.32 mm (range 0.34-1.14 mm) and 0.29 [Formula: see text] 0.15 mm (range 0.14-0.78 mm) in SDE and TRE, respectively, for all vertebrae pooled, with an average intervertebral rotation of [Formula: see text] (range 1.5[Formula: see text]-7.9[Formula: see text]). The iSV-based compensation accuracy for one sample (four vertebrae) was 1.32 [Formula: see text] 0.19 mm and 1.72 [Formula: see text] 0.55 mm in SDE and TRE, respectively, exceeding the recommended accuracy of 2 mm. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of iCT in place of invasive fiducials as a registration ground truth. These findings are important for future development of on-demand spinal image guidance using radiation-free images such as stereovision and ultrasound on human subjects.


Do robotic and non-robotic arm movement training drive motor recovery after stroke by a common neural mechanism? Experimental evidence and a computational model.

Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 may be associated with menstrual cycle disorders: a case-control study. Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) can develop after severe trauma or surgery in the limbs, and presents with chronic, changes in temperature, edema and dysfunction. Seventy-five percent of CRPS1 patients are female. While neurological and inflammatory components have been proposed, the etiology remains unclear. No consensus on optimal management of CRPS1 exists. In traditional Chinese medicine, menstrual disorders are related to the state of women's constitution and therefore identify their pain patterns. A classification by constitution might improve the pain management in CRPS1 patients. It is unknown whether associations exist between menstrual-cycle-conditions and CRPS1. To investigate whether a specified menstrual condition is associated with the risk of developing CRPS1. A population-based case-control study of CRPS1 was conducted among Dutch women aged 18-82; i.e. 34 women with CRPS1 and 147 controls. A standard questionnaire consisting of 59 menstrual-cycle-symptom-based questions was administered. From this questionnaire, 15 CRPS1-related questions (DRQ 15) were analyzed. We used multivariate logistic regression to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for specified menstrual disorders adjusting for age, oral contraceptives, hysterectomy and age at menarche < or = 12 and > or = 17 years. On the basis of the DRQ 15, women with CRPS1 were 5.3 (95%CI 2.1, 12.9) times more likely to have menstrual disorders than comparable controls. Our results suggest that selected menstrual conditions are associated with the risk of developing CRPS1.

Genetic parameters for growth traits in Mexican Nellore cattle. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for growth traits in Mexican Nellore cattle. A univariate animal model was used to estimate (co)variance components and genetic parameters. The traits evaluated were birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), and yearling weight (YW). Models used included the fixed effects of contemporary groups (herd, sex, year, and season of birth) and age of dam (linear and quadratic) as a covariate. They also included the animal, dam, and residual as random effects. Phenotypic means (SD) for BW, WW, and YW were 31.4 (1.6), 175 (32), and 333 (70) kg, respectively. Direct heritability, maternal heritability, and the genetic correlation between additive direct and maternal effects were 0.59, 0.17, and -0.90 for BW; 0.29, 0.17, and -0.90 for WW; and 0.24, 0.15, and -0.86 for YW, respectively. The results showed moderate direct and maternal heritabilities for the studied traits. The genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects were negative and high for all the traits indicating important tradeoffs between direct and maternal effects. There are significant possibilities for genetic progress for the growth traits studied if they are included in a breeding program considering these associations.

Role of NADPH oxidase-2 in lipopolysaccharide-induced matrix metalloproteinase expression and cell migration. This study examined the hypothesis that the control of NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the migration of macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of Raw264.7 cells and mice peritoneal macrophages increased the expression of MMP-9, 10, 12 and 13 mRNA, and also increased Raw264.7 cell migration. Treatment with an antioxidant (N-acetyl cysteine) or Nox inhibitors strongly inhibited the expression of MMPs by LPS and inhibited cell migration. LPS caused ROS production in macrophages and increased the mRNA expression of Nox isoforms Nox1 and Nox2 by 20-fold and two-fold, respectively. While Nox1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not inhibit LPS-mediated expression of MMPs, Nox2 siRNA inhibited the expressions of MMP-9, 10 and 12. Neither Nox1 nor Nox2 siRNA influenced the LPS-mediated expression of MMP-13. In addition, NAC or apocynin attenuated LPS-induced ROS production and MMP-9 expression. MMP-9 expression and cell migration were controlled by ERK1/2-ROS signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that LPS stimulates ROS production via ERK and induce various types of MMPs expression and cell migration.

A Prospective International Multicenter Study of AKI in the Intensive Care Unit. AKI is frequent and is associated with poor outcomes. There is limited information on the epidemiology of AKI worldwide. This study compared patients with AKI in emerging and developed countries to determine the association of clinical factors and processes of care with outcomes. This prospective observational study was conducted among intensive care unit patients from nine centers in developed countries and five centers in emerging countries. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours. Between 2008 and 2012, 6647 patients were screened, of whom 1275 (19.2%) developed AKI. A total of 745 (58% of those with AKI) agreed to participate and had complete data. Patients in developed countries had more sepsis (52.1% versus 38.0%) and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores (mean±SD, 61.1±27.5 versus 51.1±25.2); those from emerging countries had more CKD (54.3% versus 38.3%), GN (6.3% versus 0.9%), and interstitial nephritis (7.0% versus 0.6%) (all P<0.05). Patients from developed countries were less often treated with dialysis (15.5% versus 30.2%; P<0.001) and started dialysis later after AKI diagnosis (2.0 [interquartile range, 0.75-5.0] days versus 0 [interquartile range, 0-5.0] days; P=0.02). Hospital mortality was 22.0%, and 13.3% of survivors were dialysis dependent at discharge. Independent risk factors associated with hospital mortality included older age, residence in an emerging country, use of vasopressors (emerging countries only), dialysis and mechanical ventilation, and higher APACHE score and cumulative fluid balance (developed countries only). A lower probability of renal recovery was associated with residence in an emerging country, higher APACHE score (emerging countries only) and dialysis, while mechanical ventilation was associated with renal recovery (developed countries only). This study contrasts the clinical features and management of AKI and demonstrates worse outcomes in emerging than in developed countries. Differences in variations in care may explain these findings and should be considered in future trials.

Guided remote endarterectomy for superficial femoral artery occlusions: a technical note. The aim of this paper was to describe a new modification of the remote endarterectomy for the treatment of long superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusions and to present our preliminary results. Through a subinguinal incision and arteriotomy over the SFA origin, a hydrophilic guidewire was introduced into the subintimal plane of the SFA and advanced distally until reentry into the distal patent popliteal artery. The hydrophilic guidewire is exchanged for an Ablatz wire to provide support for the advancement of the single endarterectomy ring. The MollRing Cutter was introduced in the SFA after the removal of the single endarterectomy ring and it was advanced until the re-entry point. The atherosclerotic core was removed and a nitinol self-expanding stent was placed at the peripheral end of the endarterectomy. Arteriotomy was closed with a patch. Guided subintimally-assisted remote endarterectomy seems to be a successful and safe modification of the traditional technique in the treatment of SFA occlusion, in patients with critical limb ischemia.

Gene expression of ERbeta isoforms in laser microdissected human breast cancers: implications for gene expression analyses. Despite many published studies on ERbeta, progress towards understanding its role in breast cancer remains slow. This is largely due to discordant data between mRNA and protein studies as well as failure to take into account the biologically distinct ERbeta isoforms and their heterogeneous expression profile. We compared expression of ERbeta1, -2 and -5 genes in HB2 and MCF-7 breast cell lines, primary breast fibroblasts (n=5) and whole tissue and laser microdissected epithelial and stromal cells obtained from 25 human breast tumours. Our study shows that the level of gene expression of ERbeta isoforms depends on the cell population within a given tumour and varies dramatically in different cellular compartments. This has implications for gene expression analyses and could explain some of the contradictory data published to date, rendering "grind and bind" analyses of ERbeta uninformative. With the technology now available, we suggest a more refined approach be adopted to help resolve some of the controversy surrounding ERbeta.

Chemical modifier screen identifies HDAC inhibitors as suppressors of PKD models. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common human genetic disease with severe medical consequences. Although it is appreciated that the cilium plays a central role in PKD, the underlying mechanism for PKD remains poorly understood and no effective treatment is available. In zebrafish, kidney cyst formation is closely associated with laterality defects and body curvature. To discover potential drug candidates and dissect signaling pathways that interact with ciliary signals, we performed a chemical modifier screen for the two phenotypes using zebrafish pkd2(hi4166) and ift172(hi2211) models. pkd2 is a causal gene for autosomal dominant PKD and ift172 is essential for building and maintaining the cilium. We identified trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, as a compound that affected both body curvature and laterality. Further analysis verified that TSA inhibited cyst formation in pkd2 knockdown animals. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibiting class I HDACs, either by valproic acid (VPA), a class I specific HDAC inhibitor structurally unrelated to TSA, or by knocking down hdac1, suppressed kidney cyst formation and body curvature caused by pkd2 deficiency. Finally, we show that VPA was able to reduce the progression of cyst formation and slow the decline of kidney function in a mouse ADPKD model. Together, these data suggest body curvature may be used as a surrogate marker for kidney cyst formation in large-scale high-throughput screens in zebrafish. More importantly, our results also reveal a critical role for HDACs in PKD pathogenesis and point to HDAC inhibitors as drug candidates for PKD treatment.

Variations of brain endothelial nitric oxide synthase concentration in rat and mouse cortex. No information exists on the differences of eNOS concentration in brain tissue, [eNOS](br), between animals during normal and hypotensive blood pressure and both between and within animals during moderate hypotension. To address these questions, we modified a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for determining murine [eNOS](br) since no method exists to measure [eNOS](br). Optimization of the kit ELISA procedure using brain cortex homogenates from 3 normotensive rats and 1 wild-type and 1 eNOS(-/-) (ko) mouse included recovery evaluation for each sample and the use of an "eNOS-free" homogenate calibrator diluent obtained from a mutant eNOS-ko mouse. Initial spike-and-recovery values of 12.5-27% suggesting a substantial sample matrix effect were improved with lipid removal treatment to 37.3% and to 70% with 1:20 dilution of the sample. Calibration standards prepared using eNOS-free buffer increased recovery values to 78% in micro-punch samples. The optimized ELISA was used in micro-punch (<1mg) brain cortex samples from 6 hypotensive rats. Whole brain [eNOS](br) varied considerably from 5-11fmol/mg wet weight and was different between normo- and hypotensive animals (p=0.023). The variability of [eNOS](br) due to moderate hypotension in micro-punch rat brain cortex samples was composed of both between (24%) and within (76%) animal components. The differences and variability of [eNOS](br) between normo- and hypotensive animals, and between and within hypotensive animals suggests the potential utility of its measurement for investigations of cerebrovascular physiology and that [eNOS](br) itself could be an important factor in cerebrovascular regulation.

Sensing cisplatin-induced permeation of single live human bladder cancer cells by scanning electrochemical microscopy. Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer agent, which was believed to trigger apoptosis of cancer cells by forming DNA adducts. However, recent studies evidenced a cisplatin-induced extrinsic apoptotic pathway through interaction with plasma membranes. We present quantitative time-course imaging of cisplatin-induced permeation of ferrocenemethanol to single live human bladder cancer cells (T24) using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Simultaneous quantification of cellular topography and membrane permeability was realized by running SECM in the depth scan mode. It was demonstrated that the acute addition of cisplatin to the outer environment of T24 cells immediately induced membrane permeability change in 5 min, which indicated a loosened structure of the cellular membrane upon cisplatin dosage. The cisplatin-induced permeation of T24 cells might be a one-step action, an extrinsic mechanism, since the cell response was quick, and no continuous increase in the membrane permeability was observed. The time-lapse SECM depth scan method provided a simple and facile way of monitoring cisplatin-induced membrane permeability changes. Our study is anticipated to lead to a methodology of screening anti-cancer drugs through their interactions with live cells. 


Novel cataract mouse model using ddY strain: hereditary and histological characteristics.

Autotaxin and Endotoxin-Induced Acute Lung Injury. Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a life-threatening, diffuse heterogeneous lung injury characterized by acute onset, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a common cause of both direct and indirect lung injury and when administered to a mouse induces a lung phenotype exhibiting some of the clinical characteristics of human ALI. Here, we report that LPS inhalation in mice results in increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of Autotaxin (ATX, Enpp2), a lysophospholipase D largely responsible for the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in biological fluids and chronically inflamed sites. In agreement, gradual increases were also detected in BALF LPA levels, following inflammation and pulmonary edema. However, genetic or pharmacologic targeting of ATX had minor effects in ALI severity, suggesting no major involvement of the ATX/LPA axis in acute inflammation. Moreover, systemic, chronic exposure to increased ATX/LPA levels was shown to predispose to and/or to promote acute inflammation and ALI unlike chronic inflammatory pathophysiological situations, further suggesting a differential involvement of the ATX/LPA axis in acute versus chronic pulmonary inflammation. 

Experimental detection of subcutaneous contrast extravasation using radio frequency permittivity sensing. A new method for early detection of extravasations during contrast-enhanced computed tomographic procedures is evaluated. The new method uses radio frequency permittivity-based sensing to detect the onset of an extravasation with high sensitivity and specificity. There were 66 subcutaneous injections performed at the antecubital fossa in 35 volunteers to evaluate the new method. Sensitivity was found to be 98.8% (95% confidence interval, 97.6%-100%), whereas specificity was found to be 99.97% (95% confidence interval, 99.90%-100%).

Racial differences in pelvic organ prolapse. To compare the estimated prevalence of, risk factors for, and level of bother associated with subjectively reported and objectively measured pelvic organ prolapse in a racially diverse cohort. The Reproductive Risks for Incontinence Study at Kaiser 2 is a population-based cohort study of 2,270 middle-aged and older women. Symptomatic prolapse was self-reported, and bother was assessed on a five-point scale. In 1,137 women, prolapse was measured with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent association of prolapse and race while controlling for risk factors. The participants' mean (standard deviation) age was 55 (9) years, and 44% were white, 20% were African American, 18% were Asian American, and 18% were Latina or other race. Seventy-four women (3%) reported symptomatic prolapse. In multivariable analysis, the risk of symptomatic prolapse was higher in white (prevalence ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-15.12) and Latina (prevalence ratio 4.89, 95% CI 1.64-14.58) compared with African-American women. Race was not associated with report of moderate to severe bother. Degree of prolapse by POP-Q stage was similar across all racial groups; however, the risk of the leading edge of prolapse at or beyond the hymen was higher in white (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.92) compared with African-American women. Compared with African-American women, Latina and white women had four to five times higher risk of symptomatic prolapse, and white women had 1.4-fold higher risk of objective prolapse with leading edge of prolapse at or beyond the hymen.

Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance. Activated protein C (APC) proteolytically inactivates factors Va (FVa) and VIIIa (FVIIIa), which in turn control two key steps of the coagulation cascade. The pathophysiological importance of this anticoagulant mechanism is illustrated by the severe prothrombotic diathesis associated with the congenital deficiencies of protein C and its cofactor protein S. A poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC (APC resistance) was first described in a thrombotic patient in 1993 and soon recognized as the most common risk factor for venous thrombosis. The underlying genetic defect was identified one year later as the FV Arg506Gln mutation (FV Leiden), which abolishes one of the APC-cleavage sites on FVa. These ground-breaking discoveries have stimulated numerous researches into the workings of the protein C pathway, the molecular mechanisms of APC resistance in carriers and noncarriers of FV Leiden, and the clinical significance of APC resistance. This chapter reviews the most important findings, summarizes the state of the art, and discusses new developments in this rapidly evolving research area.

Screening for personality disorders among adults seeking speech treatment for stuttering. Stuttering is frequently associated with negative consequences which typically begin in early childhood. Despite this, no previous studies have investigated the presence of personality disorders among adults who stutter. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to screen for personality disorders among adults who stutter, and to compare these screening estimates with matched controls from a national population sample. Using a matched case-control design, participants were 94 adults seeking treatment for stuttering, 92 of whom completed the International Personality Disorders Examination Questionnaire (IPDEQ) as a first-stage screener, and 920 age- and gender-matched controls from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (ANSMHWB). A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for the primary outcome: first-stage presence of any personality disorder; as well as specific personality disorders. Based on first-stage screening, the presence of any personality disorder was significantly higher for adults in the stuttering group than matched controls, demonstrating almost threefold increased odds. This difference between groups remained significant for all specific personality disorders, with four- to sevenfold increased odds found for Dissocial, Anxious, Borderline, Dependent and Paranoid personality disorders, and two- to threefold increased odds found for Histrionic, Impulsive, Schizoid and Anankastic personality disorders. In conclusion, stuttering appears to be associated with a heightened risk for the development of personality disorders. These results highlight the need for research regarding the assessment and treatment of personality disorders among adults who stutter. The reader will be able to: (1) describe the nature of personality disorders, including factors thought to contribute to their development; (2) identify some of the negative consequences associated with stuttering which may contribute to the development of personality disorders among adults who stutter; (3) describe the process involved in screening for personality disorders, including various methods of scoring; and (4) summarize findings regarding the first-stage presence of personality disorders among adults seeking speech treatment for stuttering in the present sample in comparison with age- and gender-matched controls from a national population sample.

Molecular epidemiology of glanders, Pakistan. We collected epidemiologic and molecular data from Burkholderia mallei isolates from equines in Punjab, Pakistan from 1999 through 2007. We show that recent outbreaks are genetically distinct from available whole genome sequences and that these genotypes are persistent and ubiquitous in Punjab, probably due to human-mediated movement of equines.


Gene structure variation in segmental duplication block C of human chromosome 7q 11.23 during primate evolution.

Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fracture: a case report in soccer playing adolescent twins. A case of anterior inferior iliac spine fracture in 13-year-old twins is reported. Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fracture in adolescent remains a little known entity. We report identical fractures sustained 1 year apart in twin brothers with the same mechanism. Both recovered fully after conservative treatment. A review of the literature retrieved only a few reports of cases. Of interest were the delay between both the fractures and the difference in height between the two individuals. This lesion is likely to be multifactorial with different factors among which are genetics, age, and skeletal maturation, repeat bone stress along with acute indirect trauma.

A study of vertebrobasilar artery dissection with subarachnoid hemorrhage. We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics of 368 patients with cerebral artery dissections who were diagnosed in 172 Japanese hospitals. Of these patients, 130 (35%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 217 (59%) with cerebral infarctions, and 21 (6%) with transient ischemic attacks. We analyzed 109 (84%) subarachnoid hemorrhage cases caused by vertebrobasilar artery dissection to evaluate conservative and surgical treatment from the viewpoint of postoperative rerupture and infarction.Subsequent ruptures were observed in 14% of the 21 cases with nonsurgical treatment. For the preventive purpose of rerupture, 88 patients received surgical interventions: 68 trappings, 13 proximal occlusions, 6 aneurysmal sac occlusions and 1 stenting. Rerupture was experienced in 33% of the aneurysmal sac occlusion patients while not occurring in the other three surgical interventions. In the group without vascular anastomosis, postoperative cerebral infarction was observed in 25% of the trapping, none of the proximal occlusion and 33% of the aneurysmal sac occlusion cases.In this study, aneurysmal sac occlusion treatments were more frequently complicated by rerupture or cerebral infarction postoperatively than the other treatment methods. It was difficult to determine which surgical treatment can achieve better surgical outcome among the proximal occlusion and trapping with or without vascular anastomosis.

Prognostic factors of locally invasive well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea. To report our experience with tracheal invasive thyroid carcinoma with emphasis on clinical characteristics and treatment modalities, and to identify the prognostic factors for tracheal invasive thyroid carcinoma. Totally 1919 patients underwent surgical extirpation of thyroid cancer from 1990 to 2010. Among them, 65 patients had well-differentiated thyroid cancer with tracheal invasion. The incidence was higher in male and older patients. Patients were treated with tracheal shave excision (n = 18), tracheal resection (n = 37) and total laryngectomy (n = 10). Locoregional recurrence occurred in 39 patients, and metastasis occurred in 25 patients. Simultaneous involvement of the trachea and the esophagus was associated with locoregional recurrence (p = 0.039) in univariate analysis, but not confirmed by multivariate analysis. There was significant difference in the disease-specific survival (DSS) according to laryngeal involvement (p = 0.002). All the patient in the shave excision group survived until the end of the study period. Although it is categorized in same classification of T4a, simultaneous involvement of the trachea and the esophagus showed higher locoregional recurrence and laryngeal involvement showed lower DSS. Despite the invasion of thyroid cancer into the adjacent aerodigestive tract, many patients showed long survival when they underwent appropriate surgery. 

Fetal R-wave detection from multichannel abdominal ECG recordings in low SNR. Abdominal recordings of fetal ECG (fECG) have lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as compared with invasive procedures. In this paper we have combined two previously proposed methods, one for extracting fECG, called piCA and the other, a transformation based on Hilbert transform to enhance the R-peaks. The combination of these methods seems to work well in situations of noisy data and fetal repositioning. Also a comparison is done by using ICA in order to extract the fetal signals. Performance of both methods is studied separately. Results show that applying the transformation on the components extracted with the use of piCA (after maternal ECG cancellation), had a very good performance. Also, as piCA ranks the components according to their resemblance to maternal ECG, it could be used in automatic fetal ECG extraction algorithms.

Access and care issues in urban urgent care clinic patients. Although primary care should be the cornerstone of medical practice, inappropriate use of urgent care for non-urgent patients is a growing problem that has significant economic and healthcare consequences. The characteristics of patients who choose the urgent care setting, as well as the reasoning behind their decisions, is not well established. The purpose of this study was to determine the motivation behind, and characteristics of, adult patients who choose to access health care in our urgent care clinic. The relevance of understanding the motivation driving this patient population is especially pertinent given recent trends towards universal healthcare and the unclear impact it may have on the demands of urgent care. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients seeking care at an urgent care clinic (UCC) within a large acute care safety-net urban hospital over a six-week period. Survey data included demographics, social and economic information, reasons that patients chose a UCC, previous primary care exposure, reasons for delaying care, and preventive care needs. A total of 1, 006 patients were randomly surveyed. Twenty-five percent of patients identified Spanish as their preferred language. Fifty-four percent of patients reported choosing the UCC due to not having to make an appointment, 51.2% because it was convenient, 43.9% because of same day test results, 42.7% because of ability to get same-day medications and 15.1% because co-payment was not mandatory. Lack of a regular physician was reported by 67.9% of patients and 57.2% lacked a regular source of care. Patients reported delaying access to care for a variety of reasons. Despite a common belief that patients seek care in the urgent care setting primarily for economic reasons, this study suggests that patients choose the urgent care setting based largely on convenience and more timely care. This information is especially applicable to the potential increase in urgent care volume in a universal healthcare system. Additionally, this study adds to the body of literature supporting the important role of timely primary care in healthcare maintenance.

Researchers find their Nemo. With its genome almost fully sequenced, the zebrafish has gone from bit player to rising star among model organisms. Its lower maintenance costs and the ease of tissue imaging in live zebrafish are among the benefits that have cast this organism as an emerging player in disease research and drug screening.

Is the inverse relation between blood pressure and mortality normalized in 'low-risk' dialysis patients? SBP is a potent predictor of mortality. However, in hemodialysis populations, the relation between SBP and mortality is a matter of debate. In hemodialysis patients, low SBP rather than high SBP has been related to mortality. It has been suggested that this inverse relationship is 'normalized' in dialysis patients with a low mortality risk and that short-term and long-term effects of SBP might differ. We analyzed the relationship of mortality and SBP in 1111 incident hemodialysis patients participating in the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD) cohort. Long-term and short-term effects were studied in patients with (n = 452) and without (n = 659) cardiovascular comorbidity. Maximal follow-up was 7.5 years; 477 patients died. Two-year mortality rate was 44 and 20% in the groups with and without cardiovascular comorbidity, respectively. Both in the whole group and in both subpopulations, low SBP was associated with an increased mortality. The increased mortality risk associated with low SBP was especially observed as a short-term effect (6 months). In neither group did we observe a significant long-term effect between SBP and mortality. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the inverse relation between SBP and mortality is 'normalized' in a dialysis population with a low absolute mortality risk. Neither do our data support the hypothesis that elevated SBP increases mortality risk in the long-term.

[Planning of monitoring points for agricultural products security based on integrated weighted clustering method]. Integrated weighted clustering method was applied to plan the monitoring points for agricultural products security. Definite amounts of key monitoring sampling points were mined out from enormous monitoring objects to make the fewer monitoring sampling points cover the product categories, yields, and regions as more as possible. Among the 10172 agricultural products security enterprises all over the China, 2.46% of them were selected. The tested categories, yields, and regions of agricultural safety products covered 32.71%, 44.29%, and 75% of the total, and their coverage increased by 2.80%, 10.85%, 5.56%, respectively, compared with that by using conventional monitoring and management methods, which suggested that it could be more effective to apply integrated weighted clustering method in setting the monitoring points for agricultural products security.

Probabilistic prediction of the human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism sites. This article briefly introduces the results of in silico prediction of the most probable metabolism sites for the human cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. Ligand-based QSAR models have been developed using a novel GALAS modeling approach, and provide probabilities of being a target of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 for any atom in a molecule. The GALAS-model development methodology allows evaluation of the reliability of predictions in the form of estimated prediction Reliability Indices (RIs). For all the models considered in this study, the number of misclassifications and inconclusive results was reduced significantly when only predictions of high quality (RI>0.5) were taken into account, demonstrating that RI reflects accuracy of prediction. The applicability domain of regioselectivity models is shown to be easily expandable to cover compound classes of interest to the user. The results obtained so far show promising perspectives for the utilization of the GALAS modeling in the analysis of regioselectivity for other important biotransformation enzymes--a work currently in progress.


Pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are more effective than pyridoxine in rescuing folding-defective variants of human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase causing primary hyperoxaluria type I.

Direct proteasome binding and subsequent degradation of unspliced XBP-1 prevent its intracellular aggregation. The non-canonical splicing of XBP-1 mRNA is a hallmark of the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR). The proteasomal degradation of unspliced XBP-1 (XBP-1u) facilitates the termination of the UPR. Thus, understanding the mechanism of XBP-1u degradation may allow control over UPR duration and intensity. We show that XBP-1u interacts with purified 20S proteasomes through its unstructured C-terminus, which leads to its degradation in a manner that autonomously opens the proteasome gate. In living cells, the C-terminus of XBP-1u accumulates in aggresome structures in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. We propose that direct proteasomal degradation of XBP-1u prevents its intracellular aggregation.

Mesoamerican nephropathy: geographical distribution and time trends of chronic kidney disease mortality between 1970 and 2012 in Costa Rica. Mesoamerican nephropathy is an epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) unrelated to traditional causes, mostly observed in sugarcane workers. We analysed CKD mortality in Costa Rica to explore when and where the epidemic emerged, sex and age patterns, and relationship with altitude, climate and sugarcane production. SMRs for CKD deaths (1970-2012) among population aged ≥20 were computed for 7 provinces and 81 counties over 4 time periods. Time trends were assessed with age-standardised mortality rates. We qualitatively examined relations between mortality and data on altitude, climate and sugarcane production. During 1970-2012, age-adjusted mortality rates in the Guanacaste province increased among men from 4.4 to 38.5 per 100,000 vs. 3.6-8.4 in the rest of Costa Rica, and among women from 2.3 to 10.7 per 100,000 vs. 2.6-5.0 in the rest of Costa Rica. A significant moderate excess mortality was observed among men in Guanacaste already in the mid-1970s, steeply increasing thereafter; a similar female excess mortality appeared a decade later, remaining stable. Male age-specific rates were high in Guanacaste for age categories ≥30, and since the late 1990s also for age range 20-29. The male spatiotemporal patterns roughly followed sugarcane expansion in hot, dry lowlands with manual harvesting. Excess CKD mortality occurs primarily in Guanacaste lowlands and was already present 4 decades ago. The increasing rates among Guanacaste men in hot, dry lowland counties with sugarcane are consistent with an occupational component. Stable moderate increases among women, and among men in counties without sugarcane, suggest coexisting environmental risk factors.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific T cells activated in the absence of IFN-gamma express alternative effector functions but are not protective against genital HSV-2 infection. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) is important for immune resistance to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. To examine the influence of IFNgamma on the development of HSV-specific immune responses and test for IFNgamma-independent adaptive immune mechanisms of protection, IFNgamma-deficient mice (IFNgamma(-/-)) were immunized with thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-2 (HSV-2 333tk(-)). HSV-specific cellular and humoral responses were elicited in immunized IFNgamma(-/-) mice resulting in increased resistance relative to non-immune C57BL/6J (B6) mice following challenge with fully virulent HSV-2. CD8(+) T cells from IFNgamma(-/-) mice displayed cytotoxic activity and secreted TNFalpha. HSV-specific CD4(+) T cells from immunized IFNgamma(-/-) mice secreted IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-17, but unlike T cells from HSV-immune B6 mice, could not clear virus from genital tissue following adoptive transfer. HSV-immune IFNgamma(-/-) mice produced predominantly IgG(1) HSV-specific antibodies while immune B6 mice produced predominantly IgG(2c) antibodies. Transfer of equivalent amounts of HSV-specific antibodies from either strain to naïve mice imparted equivalent early resistance against infection of the genital epithelia. However, protection against neurological symptoms mediated by immune B6 antibodies was superior late in infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the limited resistance of HSV-immune IFNgamma(-/-) mice to HSV-2 infection resulted from the action of HSV-specific Ab rather than IFNgamma-independent effector functions of T cells. Further, protection against neurological manifestations of HSV-2 infection was superior in mice receiving Ab from immune B6 mice suggesting that Ab-mediated protective mechanisms involving IFNgamma-induced IgG subclasses were more effective once virus had spread to neural tissues.

The prognostic value of Ki67 is dependent on estrogen receptor status and histological grade in premenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of Ki67 in relation to established prognostic factors in lymph node-negative breast cancer, and furthermore, whether the prognostic impact was dependent on estrogen receptor (ER) status and histological grade. In 200 premenopausal patients, with 5 years of follow-up, Ki67 was determined on tissue microarrays. In univariate analysis, Ki67 (< or = 20 vs >20%) was a prognostic factor for distant disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.4, P=0.005) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 4.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.7-14, P=0.003). When stratifying for ER status and histological grade, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor for distant disease-free survival and overall survival only in the ER-positive group, and only in patients with histological grade 2, respectively. In multivariate analysis, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and age were independent prognostic factors for distant disease-free survival, whereas Ki67, histological grade, and tumor size were not. Ki67 was, however, an independent prognostic factor in the 87% of the patients who had not received adjuvant medical treatment. Agreement between the three readers was very good (kappa-values: 0.83-0.88). Furthermore, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor for all three investigators (hazard ratio: 2.7-3.2). This study shows that Ki67 is a prognostic factor in node-negative breast cancer. It is noteworthy that the prognostic information of Ki67 is restricted to ER-positive patients, and to patients with histological grade 2. Taken together, Ki67, as an easily assessed and reproducible proliferation factor, may be an alternative or complement to histological grade as a prognostic tool and for selection of adjuvant treatment.


ITGA2B and ITGA8 are predictive of prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.

The C-terminal sequence of RhoB directs protein degradation through an endo-lysosomal pathway. Protein degradation is essential for cell homeostasis. Targeting of proteins for degradation is often achieved by specific protein sequences or posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination. By using biochemical and genetic tools we have monitored the localization and degradation of endogenous and chimeric proteins in live primary cells by confocal microscopy and ultra-structural analysis. Here we identify an eight amino acid sequence from the C-terminus of the short-lived GTPase RhoB that directs the rapid degradation of both RhoB and chimeric proteins bearing this sequence through a lysosomal pathway. Elucidation of the RhoB degradation pathway unveils a mechanism dependent on protein isoprenylation and palmitoylation that involves sorting of the protein into multivesicular bodies, mediated by the ESCRT machinery. Moreover, RhoB sorting is regulated by late endosome specific lipid dynamics and is altered in human genetic lipid traffic disease. Our findings characterize a short-lived cytosolic protein that is degraded through a lysosomal pathway. In addition, we define a novel motif for protein sorting and rapid degradation, which allows controlling protein levels by means of clinically used drugs.

Altered expression of metabolic proteins and adipokines in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper cortical and lower motor neurons. ALS causes death within 2-5years of diagnosis. Diet and body mass index influence the clinical course of disease, however there is limited information about the expression of metabolic proteins and fat-derived cytokines (adipokines) in ALS. In healthy controls and subjects with ALS, we have measured levels of proteins and adipokines that influence metabolism. We find altered levels of active ghrelin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), lipocalin-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the plasma of ALS patients relative to controls. We also observe a positive correlation between the expression of plasma nerve growth factor (NGF) relative to disease duration, and an inverse correlation between plasma glucagon and the ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R). Further studies are required to determine whether altered expression of metabolic proteins and adipokines contribute to motor neuron vulnerability and how these factors act to modify the course of disease.


Expression and immunoprotective property of a 39-kDa PlpB protein of Pasteurella multocida.

Do intracranial neoplasms differ in Ollier disease and maffucci syndrome? An in-depth analysis of the literature. Ollier disease (OD) and Maffucci syndrome are closely related, very rare syndromes, that are both associated with multiple sites of chondrodysplasia. They differ primarily with the additional association of Maffucci syndrome with vascular abnormalities, including hemangiomas. Both are associated with chondrosarcomas and other nonsarcomatous neoplasms (NSN), but Maffucci syndrome is thought to have greater malignancy potential. We examined whether OD and Maffucci syndrome differ in the number, histology, in the location of intracranial malignancies, and in the demographics of such patients, as reported in the medical literature. Relevant cases were identified by electronic searches on PubMed, SciSearch, Scientific Commons, Springer Link, and Google. Translate DotNet and Babelfish were used to translate non-English text. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to compare OD and Maffucci syndrome, and chondrosarcoma and NSN patients for mean age; Pearson chi analysis was used for comparisons of gender distribution, geographical distribution (by continent), site of lesion, and for OD versus Maffucci syndrome, tumor type (chondrosarcoma versus NSN). Forty-six patients with 47 intracranial malignancies were identified: 24 with OD, including 6 with a chondrosarcoma and 18 with an NSN; and 22 with Maffucci syndrome, including 13 with a chondrosarcoma, 8 with an NSN, and 1 with both. The 2 syndromes were statistically different in the distribution of chondrosarcomas versus NSNs (P = 0.002). All chondrosarcomas originated at the base of the cranium. All 18 NSNs in OD were of glial cell origin, but only 5 of 9 NSNs in Maffucci syndrome were glial; other tumors included pituitary adenoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, malignant chordoma, and spindle cell hemangioendothelioma. Patients with OD were more than 10 years younger than their Maffucci syndrome counterparts (24.7 versus 34.9 years; P = 0.002), as were patients with OD and chondrosarcoma versus those with Maffucci syndrome and chondrosarcoma (24.7 versus 36.2 years; P = 0.035). The 2 syndromes did not differ in overall sex distribution. OD and Maffucci syndrome differed in geographical distribution, with 10 Maffucci syndrome but no OD patients with malignancy either in Asia (7 patients) or South America (3 patients). Among NSNs, OD and Maffucci syndrome did not differ as to site of lesion within the brain. OD and Maffucci syndrome differ with respect to the distribution of intracranial malignancies by histology, and geographical and age distribution of cases, with OD patients younger by approximately a decade, and Maffucci syndrome patients more likely to live in Asia or South America.

Undernutrition and obesity in indigenous children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment. Over the past 50 years there has been a shift in nutritional problems amongst Indigenous children in developed countries from under-nutrition and growth faltering to overweight and obesity; the major exception is small numbers of Indigenous children predominately living in remote areas of Northern Australia. Nutritional problems reflect social disadvantage and occur with disproportionately high incidence in all disadvantaged subgroups. There is limited evidence of benefit from any strategies to prevent or treat undernutrition and obesity; there are a limited number of individual studies with generalizable high grade evidence of benefit. Potential solutions require a whole of society approach.


Activity of tacrolimus: an immunosuppressant, in pyloric ligation-induced peptic ulcer in the rat.

Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (ORL) tumor presentation in a case of systemic AA amyloidosis. A 64-year-old male with no underlying disease presented with the development of multiple skin nodules, loss of sensation in the extremities, hoarseness, macroglossia, and pain in the oral cavity. Direct laryngoscopy showed nodules involving the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic region, and vocal cords. Biopsy from skin nodules showed amyloid deposits staining with Congo red. Immunohistochemical staining was used for AA protein and was positive. Biopsy from the oral floor was also positive for amyloid. Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (ORL) involvement has been reported in approximately 40 percent of AL amyloidosis patients, but does not appear to be frequent in AA amyloidosis. Cutaneous manifestations in AA amyloidosis are rare, although cases with lesions presenting as purpura are reported occasionally; we are not aware of other cases of ORL nodular involvement in systemic AA.

Using the concept of ideal cardiovascular health to measure population health: a review. This article describes the recent literature from January 2014 to March 2015 examining the cardiovascular health of populations using the concept of ideal cardiovascular health with a particular focus on cardiovascular health in different countries and the association with subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relatively new concept of ideal cardiovascular health, based on the presence of seven healthy behaviours and factors including nonsmoking, active physical activity, healthy diet, low body mass index, low blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol, can be used to assess a population's health status and develop an understanding of how cardiovascular health is associated with biological disease processes and clinical outcomes such as CVD incidence and mortality. Recent studies have adapted the American Heart Association definition of ideal cardiovascular health to fit the available data in different countries and have shown that the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health is low in populations worldwide, including North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Recent studies have also uncovered strong associations between ideal cardiovascular health metrics and subclinical markers for CVD such as coronary artery calcification, carotid intima-media thickness, and pulse wave velocity. A number of studies have demonstrated the low prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health in several countries and a strong relationship with subclinical CVD and biomarkers. The association with subclinical markers for CVD provides some evidence of the intermediary biological pathways through which ideal cardiovascular health results in a lower incidence of CVD and highlights the importance of improving cardiovascular health metrics in the general population.

The impact of health insurance status on the survival of patients with head and neck cancer. In 2006, it was estimated that 47 million people in the United States are without insurance. Studies have shown that patients who are uninsured or are insured by Medicaid are more likely to present with more advanced cancer. The objective of this study was to examine whether cancer recurrence and mortality of patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are associated with insurance status, after adjusting for known cancer risk factors. The main outcome measures were overall survival and relapse-free survival. Retrospective cohort of patients with a biopsy-proven primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx diagnosed or treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between 1998 and 2007. Patients were stratified by their insurance status, including private insurance, uninsured/Medicaid, Medicare disability (Medicare under age 65), and Medicare 65 years + . Covariates included age, gender, race, smoking status, alcohol consumption, anatomic tumor site, treatment, stage at diagnosis, and occupational prestige score. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect of insurance status on overall survival, relapse-free survival, tumor stage, and lymph node involvement. A total of 1231 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with Medicaid/uninsured (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.11) and Medicare disability (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16-2.48) had significantly lower overall survival compared with patients with private insurance; the result was independent of variables known to affect outcome, such as alcohol and tobacco use. For all squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cancer sites, Medicaid and uninsured patients were significantly more likely to present with an advanced stage tumor at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.72-5.01) and to present with at least 1 positive lymph node (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.16-2.90) compared with patients with private insurance. Patients with Medicaid/uninsured and Medicare disability were at increased risk of death after a diagnosis of SCCHN when compared with patients with private insurance, after adjustment for age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol use, site, socioeconomic status, treatment, and cancer stage.

Effects of ear-canal pressurization on middle-ear bone- and air-conduction responses. In extremely loud noise environments, it is important to not only protect one's hearing against noise transmitted through the air-conduction (AC) pathway, but also through the bone-conduction (BC) pathways. Much of the energy transmitted through the BC pathways is concentrated in the mid-frequency range around 1.5-2 kHz, which is likely due to the structural resonance of the middle ear. One potential approach for mitigating this mid-frequency BC noise transmission is to introduce a positive or negative static pressure in the ear canal, which is known to reduce BC as well as AC hearing sensitivity. In the present study, middle-ear ossicular velocities at the umbo and stapes were measured using human cadaver temporal bones in response to both BC and AC excitations, while static air pressures of +/-400 mm H(2)O were applied in the ear canal. For the maximum negative pressure of -400 mm H(2)O, mean BC stapes-velocity reductions of about 5-8 dB were observed in the frequency range from 0.8 to 2.5 kHz, with a peak reduction of 8.6(+/-4.7)dB at 1.6 kHz. Finite-element analysis indicates that the peak BC-response reduction tends to be in the mid-frequency range because the middle-ear BC resonance, which is typically around 1.5-2 kHz, is suppressed by the pressure-induced stiffening of the middle-ear structure. The measured data also show that the BC responses are reduced more for negative static pressures than for positive static pressures. This may be attributable to a difference in the distribution of the stiffening among the middle-ear components depending on the polarity of the static pressure. The characteristics of the BC-response reductions are found to be largely consistent with the available psychoacoustic data, and are therefore indicative of the relative importance of the middle-ear mechanism in BC hearing.

GPU accelerated fuzzy connected image segmentation by using CUDA. Image segmentation techniques using fuzzy connectedness principles have shown their effectiveness in segmenting a variety of objects in several large applications in recent years. However, one problem of these algorithms has been their excessive computational requirements when processing large image datasets. Nowadays commodity graphics hardware provides high parallel computing power. In this paper, we present a parallel fuzzy connected image segmentation algorithm on Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform for segmenting large medical image data sets. Our experiments based on three data sets with small, medium, and large data size demonstrate the efficiency of the parallel algorithm, which achieves a speed-up factor of 7.2x, 7.3x, and 14.4x, correspondingly, for the three data sets over the sequential implementation of fuzzy connected image segmentation algorithm on CPU.

Effects of olive leaf extract and its main component oleuroepin on acute ultraviolet B irradiation-induced skin changes in C57BL/6J mice. Olive (Olea europaea L.) leaves have long been used in folk medicine and herbal tea in Europe and the Mediterranean area. The Mediterranean climate is characterized by high temperatures, and by strong ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causing the skin to age, increasing wrinkling, pigmentation and skin thickness. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an olive leaf extract and its component oleuropein on skin damage caused by acute UVB irradiation in C57BL/6J mice. The extract (300 or 1000 mg/kg) and oleuropein (25 or 85 mg/kg) were administered orally twice daily for 14 days. UVB was administered daily at a dose of 120 mJ/cm(2) for the first 5 days and then every other day for 9 days. Both treatments inhibited the increases in skin thickness induced by radiation. They also inhibited increases in the Ki-67- and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cell numbers, melanin granule area and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression. These preventive effects on UVB-induced skin damage might be caused in part by inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrixes in the corium, and by the proliferation of epidermal cells through the inhibition of increases in MMP-13 levels and reactive oxygen species induced by irradiation.

Escherichia coli ribonuclease III activity is downregulated by osmotic stress: consequences for the degradation of bdm mRNA in biofilm formation. During the course of experiments aimed at identifying genes with ribonuclease III (RNase III)-dependent expression in Escherichia coli, we found that steady state levels of bdm mRNA were dependent on cellular concentrations of RNase III. The half-lives of adventitiously overexpressed bdm mRNA and the activities of a transcriptional bdm'-'cat fusion were observed to be dependent on cellular concentrations of RNase III, indicating the existence of cis-acting elements in bdm mRNA responsive to RNase III. In vitro and in vivo cleavage analyses of bdm mRNA identified two RNase III cleavage motifs, one in the 5'-untranslated region and the other in the coding region of bdm mRNA, and indicated that RNase III cleavages in the coding region constitute a rate-determining step for bdm mRNA degradation. We also discovered that downregulation of the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase III is required for the sustained elevation of RcsB-induced bdm mRNA levels during osmotic stress and that cells overexpressing bdm form biofilms more efficiently. These findings indicate that the Rcs signalling system has an additional regulatory pathway that functions to modulate bdm expression and consequently, adapt E. coli cells to osmotic stress.

Educating leaders in hospital management: a new model in Sub-Saharan Africa. QUALITY ISSUE: The vast majority of health system capacity-building efforts have focused on enhancing medical and public health skills; less attention has been directed at developing hospital managers despite their central role in improving the functioning and quality of health-care systems. Initial ASSESSMENT AND CHOICE OF INTERVENTION: Initial assessment of hospital management systems demonstrated weak functioning in several management areas. In response, we developed with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH) a novel Master of Hospital Administration (MHA) program, reflecting a collaborative effort of the MoH, the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, Jimma University and Yale University. The MHA is a 2-year executive style educational program to develop a new cadre of hospital leaders, comprising 5% classroom learning and 85% executive practice. The MHA has been implemented with 55 hospital leaders in the position of chief executive officer within the MoH, with courses taught in collaboration by faculty of the North and the South universities. The program has enrolled two cohorts of hospital leaders and is working in more than half of the government hospitals in Ethiopia. Lessons learned include the need to: (i) balance education in applied, technical skills with more abstract thinking and problem solving, (ii) recognize the interplay between management education and policy reform, (iii) remain flexible as policy changes have direct impact on the project, (iv) be realistic about resource constraints in low-income settings, particularly information technology limitations, and (v) manage the transfer of knowledge for longer term sustainability.

Effect of increase in birth weight in a newborn on hip ultrasonography. Exposure to the pressure experienced by higher birth weight babies during the intrauterine period might cause hip dysplasia. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of birth weight in newborns on hip ultrasonography when the paternal and maternal risk factors are excluded. A total of 701 babies born at 38-42 gestational weeks were included in the study. Hip ultrasonography was performed within 7 days following birth using the Graf technique in the babies without risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip. Images obtained were controlled with respect to conformity to the Graf method and angular measurements were performed. According to the α and β angle values obtained, type 1A and 1B hips were categorized as mature; type 2A hips were categorized as immature; and type 2C, D, 3A, 3B, and 4 hips were categorized as pathological hips. The results obtained were analyzed for the effect of birth weight on the angular values and hip typing. The birth weight of the babies was 338,488 ± 48,241 g (2030-6124 g). It was determined that the birth weight had no effect on the values of α and β angles in the male babies (P=0.21, 0.76). It was determined that increasing birth weight decreased the α angle value (P=0.001) and caused no difference in the β angle value (P=0.057) in the female babies. It was found that birth weight had no effect on hip typing in both female and male babies (P=0.060, 0.22). Increases in birth weights caused decreases in ultrasonographic α angles only in female babies.

[Stress hyperglycemia and its control with insulin in critically ill patients: current evidence]. To analyze the current evidence on glycemic control with insulin therapy in the critically ill. Stress hyperglycemia in critically ill patients has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that glucose variability has a predictive value for hospital mortality. Initially, the Leuven studies showed that intensive insulin therapy was capable of reducing the mortality among surgical and medical ICU patients. Nevertheless, this strategy significantly increases the incidence of severe hypoglycemia. Three important trials on glucose control have been published recently: the VISEP, the Glucontrol study and the NICE-SUGAR. They have shown that strict control of glycemia is associated with a higher incidence of mortality and severe hypoglycemia. Furthermore, according to a recent meta-analysis, intensive insulin therapy may be beneficial for patients admitted to a surgical ICU. Further studies should be able to address some queries about these results on glycemic control in the critically ill.

Ribavirin for Chronic Hepatitis Prevention among Patients with Hematologic Malignancies. Findings among a cohort of 26 patients who had hematologic malignancies and hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection support that HEV can induce chronic hepatitis. However, a 3-month course of ribavirin can induce a rapid viral clearance, reducing the risk for chronic hepatitis and enabling continuation of cytotoxic treatments for underlying malignancies. 

Cyano metabolite as a biomarker of nitrofurazone in channel catfish. The use of nitrofuran drugs in food-producing animals continues to attract international concern as a food safety issue. Methods for monitoring nitrofuran residues have been directed to the intact side chain of tissue-bound metabolites. Semicarbazide, the side chain of nitrofurazone (NFZ), can enter food products from non-NFZ sources, suggesting the need for an alternative biomarker for confirmatory purposes. We characterized a cyano derivative as a major metabolite of NFZ in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). The depletion of cyano metabolite was examined in the muscle of channel catfish after oral dosing (10 mg of NFZ/kg of body weight). Parent NFZ was rapidly eliminated in muscle, with a half-life of 6.3 h. The cyano metabolite was detected for up to 2 weeks, with an elimination half-life of 81 h. The cyano metabolite represents an alternative biomarker for confirming the use of NFZ in channel catfish.

Structure and dynamics of NBD1 from CFTR characterized using crystallography and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The DeltaF508 mutation in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the predominant cause of cystic fibrosis. Previous biophysical studies on human F508 and DeltaF508 domains showed only local structural changes restricted to residues 509-511 and only minor differences in folding rate and stability. These results were remarkable because DeltaF508 was widely assumed to perturb domain folding based on the fact that it prevents trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the previously reported crystal structures did not come from matched F508 and DeltaF508 constructs, and the DeltaF508 structure contained additional mutations that were required to obtain sufficient protein solubility. In this article, we present additional biophysical studies of NBD1 designed to address these ambiguities. Mass spectral measurements of backbone amide (1)H/(2)H exchange rates in matched F508 and DeltaF508 constructs reveal that DeltaF508 increases backbone dynamics at residues 509-511 and the adjacent protein segments but not elsewhere in NBD1. These measurements also confirm a high level of flexibility in the protein segments exhibiting variable conformations in the crystal structures. We additionally present crystal structures of a broader set of human NBD1 constructs, including one harboring the native F508 residue and others harboring the DeltaF508 mutation in the presence of fewer and different solubilizing mutations. The only consistent conformational difference is observed at residues 509-511. The side chain of residue V510 in this loop is mostly buried in all non-DeltaF508 structures but completely solvent exposed in all DeltaF508 structures. These results reinforce the importance of the perturbation DeltaF508 causes in the surface topography of NBD1 in a region likely to mediate contact with the transmembrane domains of CFTR. However, they also suggest that increased exposure of the 509-511 loop and increased dynamics in its vicinity could promote aggregation in vitro and aberrant intermolecular interactions that impede trafficking in vivo.

Transfection efficiency of lipoplexes for site-directed delivery. Targeted gene delivery is a promising strategy to cure disease on its basic level at the site of interest. The ultrastructure, internalization, and transfection efficiency of lipoplexes was investigated. We found that at a charge ratio (rho) of 4.0 lipoplexes had optimum characteristics for gene delivery in vitro. To decrease the size of lipoplexes, we used a method of continuous-flow microfluidics. PEGylation of lipoplexes did not hinder internalization, but was found to hamper transfection. To discriminate between uptake and transfection efficiency of lipoplexes, we used fluorescence-based approaches: microscopy and FACS. To this end, GFP plasmid was labeled with Alexa 594, and, in parallel experiments, GFP plasmid was combined with rhodamine-labeled lipid. Our studies confirm that cellular uptake does not imply transfection efficiency, and that hurdles in cellular processing have to be taken before targeted gene delivery becomes an established therapeutic option.

Bone mineral and body composition alterations in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients. With the increased life span of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, CF-related bone diseases could have an increased prevalence and morbidity in this group. In children, previous retrospective and prospective studies have yielded conflicting results on bone mineralization. To monitor body composition and bone mineral status of children with CF. We reviewed the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data of 161 children with CF (age 10 +/- 4.8 years). Total body bone mineral content (BMCt), total lean tissue mass (LTMt) and total fat mass (FMt) were measured and compared to expected data calculated from ideal weight for height (Wi; e.g. BMCti, LTMti, FMti). The bt (BMCt/BMCti), lt (LTMt/LTMti) and ft (FMt/FMti) ratios were used as quantitative variables. Low bt ratio was found at all ages (mean bt ratio 0.94 +/- 0.10; P < 0.001), even in children <6 years of age. However, the children's BMCt was satisfactorily adapted to their weight. lt and ft ratios were not constant across age groups. Children <10 years had 8% reduction of their lt ratio, maintaining normal levels thereafter. The opposite trend was found for ft ratio. Poor clinical, nutritional status and vitamin A levels were correlated with bt and lt ratios. Our results indicate that children with CF could have early alterations in their bone status and that lt and ft ratios did not have constant values across ages. Interpreting DXA data using this approach is suitable in children with CF.

Metabolic bioactivation and drug-related adverse effects: current status and future directions from a pharmaceutical research perspective. Retrospective studies indicate that many drugs that cause clinical adverse reactions, such as hepatotoxicity, undergo metabolic bioactivation, resulting in the formation of electrophilic intermediates capable of covalently modifying biological macromolecules. A logical extension of these findings is a working hypothesis that compounds with reduced levels of bioactivation should be inherently safer drug molecules and thus have a greater likelihood of success in drug development. Whereas some research-based pharmaceutical companies have adopted a strategy of addressing metabolic bioactivation early in drug discovery, much skepticism remains on whether such an approach would enable the industry to reach the desired objectives. The debate is centered on the question of whether there is a quantitative correlation between bioactivation and the severity of drug-treatment-related toxicity, and whether covalent protein modification represents only one of several possible mechanisms underlying observed tissue injury. This communication is intended to briefly review the current understanding of drug-induced hepatotoxicity and to discuss the controversy and future directions with respect to the effort of minimizing the probability of clinical adverse reactions.

Development, implementation, and results of the ASN in-training examination for fellows. The American Society of Nephrology and the fellowship training program directors in conjunction with the National Board of Medical Examiners developed a comprehensive assessment of medical knowledge for nephrology fellows in-training. This in-training examination (ITE) consisted of 150 multiple-choice items covering 11 broad content areas in a blueprint similar to the American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination for nephrology. Questions consisted of case vignettes to simulate real-life clinical experience. The first examination was given in April 2009 to 682 fellows and six training program directors. Examinees felt that the examination was well structured and relevant to their training experience Longitudinal performance on the examination will be helpful in allowing training programs to utilize results from content areas in identifying deficits in medical knowledge as well as assessing the results of any curriculum changes.


Nucleic acid-passivated semiconductor nanocrystals: biomolecular templating of form and function.

A list-based method for fast generation of molecular surfaces. In this paper we present a fast and reliable method for generation of molecular surfaces. While the method is readily applicable to van der Waals surface generation, we shall be focusing on solvent-accessible surfaces (SAS) and solvent-excluded surfaces (SES) of a molecule. A list-based method is utilized to represent and generate the union of multiple spheres with arbitrary radii, with which we are able to produce the SAS and SES of a molecule in a very efficient way. The surface generated is represented by a quadrilateral mesh, which can be easily converted into a triangular mesh if needed. Some results will be provided to demonstrate the speed and quality of our mesh generation algorithms.

Paucity of skeletal manifestations in Hispanic families with FBN1 mutations. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant condition with pleiotropic manifestations involving the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. The diagnosis is based primarily on clinical involvement of these and other systems, referred to as the Ghent criteria. We have identified three Hispanic families from Mexico with cardiovascular and ocular manifestations due to novel FBN1 mutations but with paucity of skeletal features. The largest family, hMFS001, had a frameshift mutation in exon 24 (3075delC) identified as the cause of aortic disease in the family. Assessment of eight affected adults revealed no major skeletal manifestation of MFS. Family hMFS002 had a missense mutation (R1530C) in exon 37. Four members fulfilled the criteria for ocular and cardiovascular phenotype but lacked skeletal manifestations. Family hMFS003 had two consecutive missense FBN1 mutations (C515W and R516G) in exon 12. Eight members fulfilled the ocular criteria for MFS and two members had major cardiovascular manifestations, however none of them met criteria for skeletal system. These data suggest that individuals of Hispanic descent with FBN1 mutations may not manifest skeletal features of the MFS to the same extent as Caucasians. We recommend that echocardiogram, ocular examination and FBN1 molecular testing be considered for any patients with possible MFS even in the absence of skeletal features, including Hispanic patients.


A rare case of cerebral cortical dysplasia with arterial vascular dysplasia.

Modulation of masseteric reflexes by simulated mastication. It is well-known that limb muscle reflexes are modulated during human movements. However, little is known about the existence of equivalent masticatory muscle reflex modulation. We hypothesized that masticatory reflexes would be modulated during chewing so that smooth masticatory movements occur. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the modulation of inhibitory reflexes evoked by periodontal mechanoreceptor activation and of excitatory reflexes evoked by muscle spindle activation during simulated mastication. In 28 participants, 1- and 2-N mechanical taps were delivered to the incisor. Reflex responses to these taps were examined in the average masseteric electromyogram. To differentiate between periodontal mechanoreceptor- and muscle-spindle-mediated reflex components, we performed experiments prior to, and in the presence of, periodontal anesthesia. Both periodontal mechanoreceptor and muscle spindle reflexes were reduced during simulated masticatory movements.

MRI in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis: An Update. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most powerful tool for the early (differential) diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been part of the International Panel criteria (2001, 2005, 2010) for more than 10 years. The role of brain and spinal cord MRI in the diagnosis of MS is well established. New MR techniques and markers will further improve the diagnostic value in a research and clinical routine setting. In addition to diagnosis, MRI is widely used for prognostic evaluation as well as treatment efficacy and safety monitoring. This field has gained importance with the introduction of new MS therapeutics. Therefore, the scope of MRI-guided MS disease monitoring has been widened to include rigorous treatment monitoring aiming at "no evidence of disease activity (NEDA)". Next, safety monitoring of treated MS patients has become major concern to enable early detection of opportunistic infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Driven by these new developments, recently published expert panel guidelines stressed the need for standardized imaging protocols and targeted specialized imaging markers for MS diagnosis and disease monitoring. This review article aims to give an update on the role of MRI in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS with particular emphasis to treatment efficacy and safety, both in clinical practice and in research. 

A randomised controlled feasibility trial of alcohol consumption and the ability to appropriately use a firearm. To show the feasibility of using a controlled trial to investigate the effect of alcohol on firearm use. Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in the Firearm Usage and Safety Experiments (FUSE) Lab. Treatment subjects (male, 21-40-year-old, non-habitual drinkers, with no professional firearms training) received alcohol; control subjects received placebo alcohol. The AIS PRISim Firearm Simulator, including real pistols retrofitted to discharge compressed air cartridges that simulate firearm recoil and sound, was used to measure firearm performance. Accuracy and speed for target shooting, reaction time scenarios, and scenarios requiring judgement about when to use a gun were measured. 12 subjects enrolled in the trial, completing 160 training scenarios. All subjects in the alcohol arm reached target alcohol level. 33% of placebo subjects reported alcohol consumption. Mechanical malfunction of the simulator occurred in 9 of 160 (5.6%) scenarios. Intoxicated subjects were less accurate, slower to fire in reaction time scenarios, and quicker to fire in scenarios requiring judgement relative to controls. The feasibility of a randomised, controlled trial exploring the relationship between alcohol consumption and firearm use was shown. The hypothesis that alcohol consumption worsens accuracy and retards judgement about when to use a gun should be tested. Larger trials could inform policies regarding firearm use while intoxicated.

Measuring nursing advocacy in procedural pain care--development and validation of an instrument. Nursing advocacy has been defined in several ways, but its structure has not been operationalized. Therefore, different theoretical aspects of advocacy have not been able to be verified empirically. Our aim was to validate the content and structure of the concept of nursing advocacy within procedural pain care from the point of view of both patients and nurses. The concept of nursing advocacy was outlined first by integrative literature review and then delineated with data of semi-structured interviews among adult internal medicine and surgical patients and nurses (phases I-II). Then, the instrument was developed with facet-design approach, and the content and construct validity of it established in two subsamples within otolaryngeal surgical care (phases III-V). These descriptive and explorative studies were conducted from 2003 to 2007 in a total of 12 Finnish hospitals. The findings supported the validity of both the concept and the instrument. Pearson correlations and Cronbach alphas supported the conceptual dimensions of advocacy operationalized in this instrument. Internal consistency validity of the instrument scales were supported by subscale CVI, which ranged from 0.97 to 0.99, and item CVI, which ranged from 0.93 to 1.00. The instrument structure was strengthened with exploratory factor analysis, which explained 65% (sample of patients) or 57% (sample of nurses) of the variance in antecedents, 75% or 74% of the variance in activities, and 60% or 56% of the variance in the consequences of advocacy. This four-part 56-item (58-item for nurses) instrument promises to measure the dimensions of nursing advocacy. However, the instrument needs further validation in different settings.

Dietary trans-fat combined with monosodium glutamate induces dyslipidemia and impairs spatial memory. Recent evidence suggests that intake of excessive dietary fat, particularly saturated fat and trans-hydrogenated oils (trans-fatty acids: TFA) can impair learning and memory. Central obesity, which can be induced by neonatal injections of monosodium Glutamate (MSG), also impairs learning and memory. To further clarify the effects of dietary fat and MSG, we treated C57BL/6J mice with either a TFA-enriched diet, dietary MSG, or a combination of both and examined serum lipid profile and spatial memory compared to mice fed standard chow. Spatial learning was assessed at 6, 16 and 32 weeks of age in a Morris Water Maze (MWM). The subjects were given four days of training to find a hidden platform and a fifth day of reversal learning, in which the platform was moved to a new location. The TFA+MSG combination caused a central adiposity that was accompanied by impairment in locating the hidden platform in the MWM. Females in the TFA+MSG group showed a greater impairment compared to the other diet groups, and also showed elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C and T-CHOL:HDL-C ratio, together with the lowest levels of HDL-C. Similarly, males in the TFA+MSG diet group were less successful than control mice at locating the hidden platform and had the highest level of abdominal adiposity and elevated levels of fasting serum LDL-C. Dietary trans-fat combined with MSG increased central adiposity, promoted dyslipidemia and impaired spatial learning.

Corticosteroids for acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease: variation in use and association with length of stay and readmission. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) causes significant morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease. The role of corticosteroids is unclear. The objectives of our study were to examine the variation between hospitals in their use of corticosteroids for ACS, describe characteristics associated with corticosteroids, and investigate the association between corticosteroids, length of stay, and readmission. We performed a retrospective examination of 5,247 hospitalizations for ACS between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2008, at 32 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We used multivariate regression to examine the variability in the use of corticosteroids adjusting for hospital case mix, identify factors associated with corticosteroid use, and evaluate the association of corticosteroids with length of stay and 3-day readmission rates controlling for propensity score. Corticosteroid use varied greatly by hospital (10-86% among all patients, 18-92% in patients with asthma). Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with comorbid asthma (OR 3.9, 95% CI: 3.2-4.8), inhaled steroids (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7), bronchodilators (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 2.5-4.2), nitric oxide (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0), oxygen (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-2.9), ICU (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3-2.3), ventilation (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-2.8), APR-DRG severity level (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6), and discharge year (OR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92). Corticosteroids were associated with an increased length of stay (25%, 95% CI: 14-38%) and a higher 3-day readmission rate (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.4), adjusted for confounding. Hospitals vary greatly in the use of corticosteroids for ACS, even in patients with asthma. Clear evidence of the efficacy and toxicity of corticosteroid treatment in ACS may reduce variation in care.

A porohyperelastic finite element model of the eye: the influence of stiffness and permeability on intraocular pressure and optic nerve head biomechanics. Progressively deteriorating visual field is a characteristic feature of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and the biomechanics of optic nerve head (ONH) is believed to be important in its onset. We used porohyperelasticity to model the complex porous behavior of ocular tissues to better understand the effect variations in ocular material properties can have on ONH biomechanics. An axisymmetric model of the human eye was constructed to parametrically study how changes in the permeabilities of retina-Bruch's-choroid complex (k(RBC)), sclera k(sclera), uveoscleral pathway (k(UVSC)) and trabecular meshwork k(TM) as well as how changes in the stiffness of the lamina cribrosa (LC) and sclera affect IOP, LC strains, and translaminar interstitial pressure gradients (TLIPG). Decreasing k(RBC) from 5 × 10(- 12) to 5 × 10(- 13) m/s increased IOP and LC strains by 17%, and TLIPG by 21%. LC strains increased by 13% and 9% when the scleral and LC moduli were decreased by 48% and 50%, respectively. In addition to the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathway, the retina-Bruch's-choroid complex had an important effect on IOP, LC strains, and TLIPG. Changes in k(RBC) and scleral modulus resulted in nonlinear changes in the IOP, and LC strains especially at the lowest k(TM) and k(UVSC). This study demonstrates that porohyperelastic modeling provides a novel method for computationally studying the biomechanical environment of the ONH. Porohyperelastic simulations of ocular tissues may help provide further insight into the complex biomechanical environment of posterior ocular tissues in POAG.

Synthesis and cytotoxic activities of chloropyridylimineplatinum(II) and chloropyridyliminecopper(II) surface-functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers. The preparations of novel platinum and copper metallodendrimers are reported. Surface modified first generation (G0) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendritic Schiff base, prepared via a condensation reaction was coordinated with platinum chloride and copper chloride yielding [G0-Py(4)-[PtCl(2)](4)] (4D) and [G0-Py(4)-[CuCl(2)](7)] (7E) respectively. These functionalized hyper-branched complexes were characterized by IR spectroscopy and CHN analysis. 4D was further characterized through (1)H and (13)C spectroscopy, while 7E was characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) Mass Spectrometer. The cytotoxic effects of the compounds against cells of neoplastic origin (MOLT-4, MCF-7) and cells of benign origin (Chang Liver) were studied. Their cytotoxicities were then compared to their mono-nuclear analogues, [(MeCONHCH(2)CH(2)NCHPy)(PtCl(2))] (1D) and [(MeCONHCH(2)CH(2)NCHPy)(CuCl(2))] (1E). The multi-nuclear complexes showed increased cytotoxic activities as compared to their respective mono-nuclear compounds. Most notably, significant inhibitions were observed for 7E on all cell lines, in which its IC(50) values were 11.1+/-0.6, 10.2+/-1.5 and 8.7+/-0.7microM against MOLT-4, MCF-7 and Chang Liver cells respectively. The multi-nuclear copper-based complexes (7E) are therefore most effective against a cancer cell line (MOLT-4) and a cisplatin-resistant cell line (MCF-7).

Relative contributions of modifiable risk factors to erectile dysfunction: results from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey. The objective of this study was to determine the relative contribution of modifiable risk factors (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) to inter-subject variation in erectile dysfunction (ED). The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey used a multistage stratified random sample to recruit 2301 men age 30-79 years from the city of Boston between 2002 and 2005. ED was assessed using the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Multiple linear regression models and R(2) were used to determine the proportion of the variance explained by modifiable risk factors. In unadjusted analyses, lifestyle factors accounted for 12.2% of the inter-subject variability in IIEF-5 scores, comparable to the proportion explained by comorbid conditions (14.7%) and socioeconomic status (9%). Lifestyle factors were also significantly associated with age, comorbid conditions and socioeconomic status (SES). A multivariate model including all covariates associated with ED explained 29% of the variance, with lifestyle factors accounting for 0.9% over and above all other covariates in the model. Analyses repeated in a subgroup of 1215 men without comorbid conditions show lifestyle factors accounting for 2.5% of the variance after accounting for all other variables in the model. Results of the present study demonstrate the contribution of modifiable lifestyle factors to the prevalence of ED. These results suggest a role for behavior modification in the prevention of ED.

Preliminary results of training with gravity compensation of the arm in chronic stroke survivors. After stroke, arm function can be limited by a reduction in the selectivity of movements, due to involuntary coupling of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion, limiting the ability to reach. Gravity compensation of the arm reduces the required active shoulder abduction torques, which results in a larger range of motion instantaneously. Integration of a motivating rehabilitation game in the training program stimulates motor relearning processes during training. During 6 weeks, 8 chronic stroke survivors received 3 sessions of 30 minutes gravity compensated reach training per week using a rehabilitation game, which was evaluated by assessing motor status and a circle drawing task before and after training. After gravity compensation training, Fugl Meyer scores and the range of motion obtained from the circle drawing task had improved in a seven of the eight chronic stroke survivors. The present findings indicate that gravity compensation in combination with rehab games can be a valuable training modality for stroke rehabilitation.

Mean leukocyte telomere length and risk of incident colorectal carcinoma in women: a prospective, nested case-control study. To date, no prospective epidemiological data are available, particularly in women, on mean leukocyte telomere length as a risk predictor. Using leukocyte DNA samples collected at baseline in a prospective cohort of over 28,000 initially healthy women, we examined the relationship between mean leukocyte telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number (TSR) in 134 incident cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and 357 matched controls; all were Caucasian. The observed log(e)-transformed TSRs were similar between cases and controls (p=0.79). Using an adjusted analysis, we found no evidence for an association of the log(e)-TSRs with CRC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.943, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.647-1.376, p=0.762]. Stratified analysis by median follow-up time, or postmenopausal status also showed similar null findings. In concordance with our previous findings in Caucasian men, the present study in Caucasian women found no evidence for an association of mean leukocyte telomere length with risk of incident CRC, further suggesting that leukocyte telomere length may not be a useful indicator for risk assessment.

Whole-genome analysis of an oxacillin-susceptible CC80 mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate: insights into the mechanisms of cryptic methicillin resistance. The mec and bla systems, among other genetic factors, are critical in regulating the expression of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. We examined by WGS a naturally occurring oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive S. aureus isolate to identify the mechanism conferring oxacillin susceptibility. The mecA-positive oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate GR2 (penicillin and oxacillin MICs 0.094 and 1 mg/L, respectively), belonging to clonal complex 80, was characterized. DNA fragment libraries were sequenced on Roche 454 and Illumina MiSeq sequencers and de novo assembly of the genome was generated using SeqMan NGen software. Plasmid curing was conducted by SDS treatment. Expression of mecA was quantified without/with β-lactam pressure. The genome of GR2 consisted of a 2 792 802 bp chromosome and plasmids pGR2A (28 895 bp) and pGR2B (2473 bp). GR2 carried SCCmec type IV, with a truncated/non-functional mecR1 gene and no mecI. A single copy of the bla system, with an organization unique for S. aureus, was found, harboured by plasmid pGR2A. Particularly, the blaZ gene was orientated like its regulatory genes, blaI and blaR1, and a gene encoding transposase IS66 was integrated between blaZ and the regulatory genes deleting the 5'-end of blaR1; blaI, encoding blaZ/mecA repressor, was intact. After plasmid loss, GR2 became penicillin and oxacillin resistant (MICs 0.5 and 6 mg/L, respectively). We can conclude that after exposure to β-lactams, the non-functional BlaR1 does not cleave the mecA repressor BlaI, derepression does not occur and mecA is not efficiently expressed. Removal of the bla system after curing of pGR2A allows constitutive expression of mecA, resulting in oxacillin and penicillin resistance.

Theoretical studies on pyrimidine substituent derivatives as dual inhibitors of AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Theoretical studies on the three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and mechanisms of action of a series of pyrimidine substituent derivatives as dual inhibitors of AP-1 and NF-kappaB were carried out using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and docking methods. The established 3D-QSAR model exhibits a satisfying statistical quality and prediction ability. Docking results show somewhat lower average values of the flexible and rigid energy scores in the chosen binding sites. The docking analysis offers appropriate orientations and conformations of these compounds at the binding sites to both AP-1 and NF-kappaB in good agreement with the 3D-QSAR model from CoMFA. The combined CoMFA and docking study suggests the following substituent selections: substituent R(2) should be a kind of H-N-thienyl or CH(3)-N-thienyl group; substituent R(5) should be a kind of COO-tBu or COOEt group; and substituent R(4) should be a CH(2)CH(3) or 2-thienyl group. The docking analysis also shows that the binding sites fall just at the joint regions between AP-1 (or NF-kappaB) and DNA, where these compounds can effectively prevent free AP-1 and NF-kappaB from binding to DNA, and this may be the reason that derivatives with pyrimidine substituents have an inhibition function. In addition, a very interesting finding was that the binding sites of both AP-1 and NF-kappaB have a common structural characteristic, thereby providing a reasonable explanation for the dual inhibition functions of these compounds towards both AP-1 and NF-kappaB. These theoretical results help to deepen our understanding of the inhibition mechanism of these pyrimidine substituent derivatives, and will aid in directing further drug-molecular design.

Membrane bound pyrophosphatase and P-type adenosine triphosphatase of Leishmania donovani as possible chemotherapeutic targets: similarities and differences in inhibitor sensitivities. The activities of inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were studied in the plasma membrane of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes. It was shown that the specific activity of PPase was greater than that of ATPase in the promastigote plasma membrane. We characterized H+-PPase present in the plasma membrane of L. donovani and investigated its possible role in the survival of promastigote and amastigote. PPase activity was stimulated by K+ and sodium orthovanadate and inhibited by pyrophosphate analogs (imidodiphosphate and alendronate), KF, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), thiol reagents (p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMBS), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and phenylarsine oxide (PAO)), the ABC superfamily transport modulator verapamil, and also by the F(1)F(o)-ATPase inhibitor quercetin. ATPase activity was stimulated by K+ and verapamil, inhibited by DCCD, PCMBS, NEM, sodium azide, sodium orthovanadate, and quercetin, and was unaffected by PAO. We conclude that there are significant differences within promastigote, amastigote, and mammalian host in cytosolic pH homeostasis to merit the inclusion of PPase transporter as a putative target for rational drug design.

Gene disruption and characterization of a class V chitin synthase in Botrytis cinerea. Cell-wall chitin biosynthesis in the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea involves 7 classes of chitin synthases. In this study, we disrupted a gene encoding a chitin synthase with a myosin-like motor domain (BcchsV) through Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. The resulting mutant was not significantly affected in either growth characteristics or pathogenicity on tomato leaves. Surprisingly, the BcchsV mutant exhibited a 31% (m/m) increase in its chitin content compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, the BcchsV mutant showed increased sensitivity to Calcofluor White and slightly enhanced tolerance to cell-wall disturbing substances and osmosis regulators, including SDS, sorbitol, and NaCl. These results suggest that Bcchs does not play an essential role in the synthesis of cell-wall chitin in B. cinerea. However, disruption of this gene provoked a compensatory mechanism regulating the cellular response to cell-wall damage.

Determinants of hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking women and children: a multicountry study of secondhand smoke exposure in homes. The main purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate determinants of hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking women and children exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke at home. Hair samples were collected from nonsmoking women (n = 852) and from children (n = 1,017) <11 years of age living in households (n = 1,095) with smokers from 31 countries from July 2005 to October 2006. Participants' ages, activity patterns and socioeconomic characteristics including education and employment status, and hair treatment information were collected. Multilevel linear regression modeling was used to identify the main determinants of hair nicotine concentration measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Increased indoor air nicotine concentration at home were associated with increased hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking women and children. This association was not changed after controlling for other explanatory variables. After controlling for age, length of exposure, and socioeconomic characteristics, hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking children and women were estimated to be increased by 3% and 1%, respectively, for a 1 microg/m(3) increase in air nicotine concentration. The association between children's exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke at home and hair nicotine concentration was stronger among younger children and children with longer exposure at home.

Alcohol consumption-associated breast cancer incidence and potential effect modifiers: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Epidemiological studies have evaluated whether the impact of alcohol intake on breast cancer risk is modified by use of exogenous estrogens, folate intake, body weight and smoking status, but results have been inconsistent. Further, effect modification by intake of isoflavones and alcohol-induced facial flushing, which are prevalent in Asian populations, have not been investigated. We investigated the association between alcohol intake and breast cancer risk and whether the association is modified by these factors among 50,757 premenopausal and postmenopausal women (aged 40-69 years) in the population-based Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Alcohol consumption and other related factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Through to the end of 2006, 572 patients were identified. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by hazard ratios derived from Cox proportional hazards regression models. Compared with never-drinkers, regular alcohol drinkers (>150 g of ethanol/week) had a higher risk of the development of breast cancer; the multivariable-adjusted RRs were 1.75 (95% CI = 1.16-2.65; p(trend) = 0.035) for overall, 1.78 (95% CI = 1.09-2.90) for premenopausal and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.53-2.75) for postmenopausal women. There was no statistical evidence for effect modification by menopausal status, use of exogenous estrogens, intakes of isoflavone and folate, body weight, alcohol-induced facial flushing or smoking (All p(interactions) > or = 0.15). Excessive alcohol intake was associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer in this population. There was no statistical evidence for effect modification.


Development of hand rehabilitation system for paralysis patient - universal design using wire-driven mechanism.

In vitro delivery of budesonide from 30 jet nebulizer/compressor combinations using infant and child breathing patterns. An aerosol of budesonide inhalation suspension is delivered when used with various jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations. The constant introduction of new nebulizer/compressor combinations raises the question of whether the performance of these match the performance of existing devices. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro the inhaled mass and aerosol characteristics of budesonide inhalation suspension from a selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations presently marketed in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The in vitro characterization was performed using standardized and published methods. Each nebulizer was charged with 1 vial (2 mL) of budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg/mL (0.5 mg budesonide) and run until end of aerosol formation. Droplet size and distribution was determined using a cooled impactor at air flow of 15 L/min. The inhaled mass of budesonide (ie, mass on the inhalation filter) was collected using a breathing simulator that mimicked the breathing patterns of an infant and a child. The aerosol was collected on filters placed between the nebulizer mouthpiece and the breathing simulator. Budesonide was quantified via standard high-performance liquid chromatography. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol measured with the cooled impactor ranged between 4.8 mum and 9.9 mum, and the geometric standard deviation ranged between 1.7 mum and 2.1 mum. The inhaled mass of budesonide expressed as a percentage of the nebulizer charge ranged from 1% to 9% (infant) and from 4% to 20% (child). The in vitro budesonide mass collected on the inhalation filter and delivery characteristics differed considerably between the 30 nebulizer/compressor combinations. The present in vitro characterization of jet nebulizers can be used as a guidance for selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations for delivery of the budesonide nebulization suspension in the home-care setting. Further investigations of new nebulizer/compressor combinations are warranted.


Diagnosis of a large splenic tumor in a dog: computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging.

Recurrence rates in Ontario physicians monitored for major depression and bipolar disorder. Physicians with recurrent conditions that may affect job performance are sometimes referred for monitoring to help ensure compliance with treatment, ongoing remission of illness, and patient safety. Little is known about recurrence rates among doctors monitored for mood disorders. Our primary objective was to describe recurrence rates among Ontario physicians monitored for recurrent unipolar depression and bipolar disorder (BD). Our secondary objective was to explore predictors of recurrence. We used a retrospective cohort design to describe the time to recurrence, defined as either stopping work owing to symptoms or any re-emergence of symptoms meeting a pre-established clinical threshold. Our exploratory analysis of recurrence predictors included age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, psychiatric comorbidity, medical comorbidity, number of past episodes, past hospitalizations, and family history of psychiatric disorder. During a median observation of 24 months, 36% (18 of 50) of physicians stopped work owing to recurrence of symptoms, with the median time to stopping work being 11 months. As well, 52% (26 of 50) had a re-emergence of clinical symptoms, with the median time to any level of symptom re-emergence being 13 months. Physicians with psychiatric comorbidity stopped work sooner (hazard ratio [HR] 3.53; 95% CI 1.24 to 10.03, P = 0.01) and had more rapid symptom re-emergence (HR 2.96; 95% CI 1.34 to 6.52, P = 0.004) than those without comorbidity. The most common psychiatric comorbidity was a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, anxiety disorder. Recurrence rates are high among Ontario physicians referred for formal monitoring of recurrent unipolar depression and BD, and are markedly hastened by the presence of psychiatric comorbidity.

Bisecting the mental number line in near and far space.

Antibody-dependent transplacental transfer of malaria blood-stage antigen using a human ex vivo placental perfusion model. Prenatal exposure to allergens or antigens released by infections during pregnancy can stimulate an immune response or induce immunoregulatory networks in the fetus affecting susceptibility to infection and disease later in life. How antigen crosses from the maternal to fetal environment is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that transplacental antigen transfer occurs as immune complexes, via receptor-mediated transport across the syncytiotrophoblastic membrane and endothelium of vessels in fetal villi. This hypothesis has never been directly tested. Here we studied Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) that is released upon erythrocyte invasion. We found MSP1 in cord blood from a third of newborns of malaria-infected women and in >90% following treatment with acid dissociation demonstrating MSP1 immune complexes. Using an ex vivo human placental model that dually perfuses a placental cotyledon with independent maternal and fetal circuits, immune-complexed MSP1 transferred from maternal to fetal circulation. MSP1 alone or with non-immune plasma did not transfer; pre-incubation with human plasma containing anti-MSP1 was required. MSP1 bound to IgG was detected in the fetal perfusate. Laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated MSP1 in the fetal villous stroma, predominantly in fetal endothelial cells. MSP1 co-localized with IgG in endothelial cells, but not with placental macrophages. Thus we show, for the first time, antibody-dependent transplacental transfer of an antigen in the form of immune complexes. These studies imply frequent exposure of the fetus to certain antigens with implications for management of maternal infections during pregnancy and novel approaches to deliver vaccines or drugs to the fetus.

New multiplex PCR-based protocol allowing indirect diagnosis of FSHD on single cells: can PGD be offered despite high risk of recombination? Molecular pathophysiology of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) involves the heterozygous contraction of the number of tandemly repeated D4Z4 units at chromosome 4q35.2. FSHD is associated with a range of 1-10 D4Z4 units instead of 11-150 in normal controls. Several factors complicate FSHD molecular diagnosis, especially the cis-segregation of D4Z4 contraction with a 4qA allele, whereas D4Z4 shortening is silent both on alleles 4qB and 10q. Discrimination of pathogenic 4q-D4Z4 alleles from highly homologous 10q-D4Z4 arrays requires the use of the conventional Southern blot, which is not suitable at the single-cell level. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a frequent request from FSHD families with several affected relatives. We aimed to develop a rapid and sensitive PCR-based multiplex approach on single cells to perform an indirect familial segregation study of pathogenic alleles. Among several available polymorphic markers at 4q35.2, the four most proximal (D4S2390, D4S1652, D4S2930 and D4S1523, <1.23 Mb) showing the highest heterozygote frequencies (67-91%) were selected. Five recombination events in the D4S2390-D4S1523 interval were observed among 144 meioses. In the D4S2390-D4Z4 interval, no recombination event occurred among 28 FSHD meioses. Instead, a particular haplotype segregated with both clinical and molecular status, allowing the characterization of an at-risk allele in each tested FSHD family (maximal LOD score 2.98 for theta=0.0). This indirect protocol can easily complement conventional techniques in prenatal diagnosis. Although our multiplex PCR-based approach technically fulfils guidelines for single-cell analysis, the relatively high recombination risk hampers its application to PGD.


Pros and cons of using biomarkers versus clinical decisions in start and stop decisions for antibiotics in the critical care setting.


Structural hierarchy of regulatory elements in the folding and transport of an intestinal multidomain protein.

Axonal transport proteomics reveals mobilization of translation machinery to the lesion site in injured sciatic nerve. Investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to nerve injury have highlighted the importance of axonal transport systems. To obtain a comprehensive view of the protein ensembles associated with axonal transport in injured axons, we analyzed the protein compositions of axoplasm concentrated at ligatures following crush injury of rat sciatic nerve. LC-MS/MS analyses of iTRAQ-labeled peptides from axoplasm distal and proximal to the ligation sites revealed protein ensembles transported in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Variability of replicates did not allow straightforward assignment of proteins to functional transport categories; hence, we performed principal component analysis and factor analysis with subsequent clustering to determine the most prominent injury-related transported proteins. This strategy circumvented experimental variability and allowed the extraction of biologically meaningful information from the quantitative neuroproteomics experiments. 299 proteins were highlighted by principal component analysis and factor analysis, 145 of which correlate with retrograde and 154 of which correlate with anterograde transport after injury. The analyses reveal extensive changes in both anterograde and retrograde transport proteomes in injured peripheral axons and emphasize the importance of RNA binding and translational machineries in the axonal response to injury.

Inter-DRG resource dynamics in a prospective payment system: a stochastic kernel approach. This paper empirically investigates the resource distribution dynamics across Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) of elective surgery patients, in a continuing Prospective Payment System (PPS). Existing econometric literature has mainly focussed on the impact of PPS on average Length of Stay (LOS) concluding that the average LOS has declined post PPS. There is little literature on the distribution of this decline across DRGs, in a PPS. The present paper helps fill this gap. It models the evolution over time of the empirical distribution of LOS across DRGs. The empirical distributions are estimated using a non parametric "stochastic kernel approach" based on Markov Chain theory. The results for inlier episodes suggest that resource redistribution will increase capacity and expected number of admissions for DRGs having increasing waiting times. In addition, adjustments in relative cost weights are perceived as price signals by hospitals leading to a change in their casemix. The results for high outlier patients reveal that improved quality of care is one of the factors causing reduction in high outlier episodes.

[Affects of different bioreactors in process of Salvia miltiorrhiza adventitious root culture]. To study the affects of the different bioreactors on the Salvia miltiorrhiza adventitious root culture. Adventitious roots of S. miltiorrhiza were induced and in vitro cultured in bioreactors. The type of bioreactors was optimized and the kinetics of root growth, accumulation of the active ingredients was also investigated by HPLC. It showed that the 3-1 conical bubble bioreactor (CNBB) with 60 degrees taper favors achieved the highest active compounds accumulation in adventitious roots. The growth curve and secondary metabolites accumulation curve looks like "S" in CNBB bioreactor. The maximum adventitious roots biomass of 16.24 g x L(-1) (fresh weight) was obtained at 35 day. The highest content of tanshinone IIA (TA) and protocatechuic aldehyde (PA) reached 0.23 mg x g(-1) DW and 0.51 mg x g(-1) DW at 40 day, respectively. The 3-1 conical bubble bioreactor (CNBB) with 60 degrees taper favors was the best bioreactors for the accumulation of active compounds.

Alpha-lipoic acid protects against potassium cyanide-induced seizures and mortality. This study was proposed to investigate the potential protective effect of alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) against potassium cyanide (KCN)-induced seizures and lethality in mice. The intraperitoneal ED(50) value of KCN, as measured by induction of clonic and tonic seizures was increased by pretreatment of mice with α-LA (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the intraperitoneal LD(50) value of KCN, based on 24h mortality, was increased by pretreatment with α-LA in a dose-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal injection of the estimated ED(50) of KCN (4.8 mg/kg) into mice increased, 1h later, nitric oxide (NO) production and brain glutamate and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The estimated ED(50) of KCN also decreased brain intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in these animals. Administration of the estimated LD(50) of KCN (6 mg/kg) produced, 24h later, similar marked biochemical alterations in surviving animals. Pretreatment of mice with α-LA inhibited; dose-dependently KCN (ED(50) and LD(50))-induced an increase in NO production and brain MDA level as well as a decrease in brain intracellular GSH level and GSH-Px activity. The elevation induced by KCN in brain glutamate level was not inhibited by α-LA. It can be concluded that the protective effect of α-LA against KCN-induced seizures and lethality may be due to inhibition of NO overproduction and maintenance of intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms.


Initial cytoplasmic and phagosomal consequences of human neutrophil exposure to Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The effects of feeding diets containing corn distillers dried grains with solubles, and withdrawal period of distillers dried grains with solubles, on growth performance and pork quality in grower-finisher pigs. A study was conducted to determine the quantitative effects of feeding amount and withdrawal period of corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from the diet on growth performance, carcass quality, and pork fat fatty acid profile. A total of 432 pigs (29.8 +/- 0.2 kg of BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 9 dietary treatments in a completely randomized arrangement. The 9 treatments were the control (D0), D15-0 wk, D15-3 wk, D15-6 wk, D15-9 wk, D30-0 wk, D30-3 wk, D30-6 wk, and D30-9 wk, where D0, D15, and D30 indicate the dietary content of DDGS (0, 15, and 30%, respectively) and 0 wk, 3 wk, 6 wk, and 9 wk indicate the withdrawal period of DDGS from the diets before slaughter (0, 3, 6, and 9 wk, respectively). A dietary DDGS inclusion rate of 15 or 30%, without or with a withdrawal period, had no effect (P = 0.76) on ADG, ADFI, and G:F, except for a slight reduction (0.87 vs. 0.92 kg/d; P < 0.05) in ADG when pigs received the D30-0 wk treatment compared with the D0 treatment. Carcass quality, LM quality, and Japanese fat color scores for backfat and belly fat were not affected by dietary DDGS content (backfat, P = 0.47; belly fat, P = 0.17) or withdrawal period (backfat, P = 0.33; belly fat, P = 0.95). Compared with pigs fed the D0 diet, a smaller belly firmness score was observed (P = 0.04) in pigs that received the D30-0 wk treatment, but belly firmness in pigs fed the other treatments was not different (P = 0.26) from that of pigs fed the D0 diet. Linoleic acid content (C18:2; P < 0.001) and iodine value (IV; P < 0.001) of belly fat increased with increasing dietary DDGS content. Withdrawal of DDGS from the diet for 0 to 9 wk before slaughter resulted in a linear reduction in C18:2 content and the IV of belly fat in pigs fed the D15 diets (C18:2 content: 14.6, 13.3, 12.6, and 10.9%; P = 0.001; IV: 67.3, 64.4, 64.1, and 62.7; P = 0.02; for 0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-wk withdrawal, respectively) and the D30 diets (C18:2 content: 17.3, 16.1, 14.2, and 12.4%; P < 0.001; IV: 71.2, 68.2, 64.5, and 62.7; P < 0.001; for 0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-wk withdrawal, respectively). These results indicate that an inclusion rate of DDGS up to 30% in grower-finisher diets has minor effects on growth performance and that the desired effect of reducing the C18:2 content and IV of pork fat could be elicited in as little as 3 wk after withdrawing DDGS from the diet before slaughter.

MAPK signal transduction underlying brain inflammation and gliosis as therapeutic target. A majority, if not all, acute and progressive neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by local microglia-mediated inflammation, astrogliosis, infiltration of immune cells, and activation of the adaptive immunity. These processes progress by the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteases, and other inflammation mediators. In response to brain injury or infection, intracellular signaling pathways are activated in microglia, which turn on inflammatory and antigen-presenting cell functions. Different extrinsic signals shape microglial activation toward neuroprotective or neurotoxic phenotype under pathological conditions. This review discusses recent advances regarding molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signal transduction in neurological disorders and in in vitro models of inflammation/gliosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases responsible for most cellular responses to cytokines and external stress signals and crucial for regulation of the production of inflammation mediators. Increased activity of MAPKs in activated microglia and astrocytes, and their regulatory role in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines mediators, make them potential targets for novel therapeutics. MAPK inhibitors emerge as attractive anti-inflammatory drugs, because they are capable of reducing both the synthesis of inflammation mediators at multiple levels and are effective in blocking inflammatory cytokine signaling. Small molecule inhibitors targeting of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways have been developed and offer a great potential as potent modulators of brain inflammation and gliosis in neurological disorders, where cytokine overproduction contributes to disease progression. Many of the pharmacological MAPK inhibitors can be administered orally and initial results show therapeutic benefits in preclinical animal models.

pH induced polychromatic UV treatment for the removal of a mixture of SMX, OTC and CIP from water. Water and wastewater effluents contain a vast range of chemicals in mixtures that have different chemical structures and characteristics. This study presents a treatment technology for the removal of mixtures of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), oxytetracycline (OTC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP)) from contaminated water. The treatment combines pH modification of the water to an optimal value, followed by a photolytic treatment using direct polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) irradiation by medium pressure UV lamp. The pH adjustment of the treated water leads to structural modifications of the pollutant's molecule thus may enhance direct photolysis by UV light. Results showed that an increase of water pH from 5 to 7 leads to a decrease in degradation rate of SMX and an increase in degradation rate of OTC and CIP, when studied separately and not in a mixture. Thus, the optimal pH values for UV photodegradation in a mixture, involve initial photolysis at pH 5 and then gradually changing the pH from 5 to 7 during the UV exposure. For example, this resulted in 99% degradation of SMX at pH 5 and enhanced degradation of OTC and CIP from 54% and 26% to 91% and 96% respectively when pH was increased from 5 to 7. Thus the pH induced photolytic treatment has a potential in improving treatment of antibiotics in mixtures.

Epidermal Smad4 deletion results in aberrant wound healing. In the present study, we assessed the role of Smad4, a component of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, in cutaneous wound repair. Interestingly, when Smad4 was deleted in the epidermis, several defects in wound healing were observed in non-keratinocyte compartments. In comparison with wounded wild-type mouse skin, Smad4-deficient wounds had delayed wound closure and remodeling. Increased angiogenesis and inflammation were found in Smad4-deficient skin; these effects were exacerbated throughout the entire wound healing process. In addition, increased numbers of myofibroblasts but reduced collagen levels were found in Smad4-deficient wounds in comparison with wild-type wounds. Since Smad4 is not a secreted protein, we assessed if the above non-cell autonomous alterations were the result of molecular alterations in Smad4-deficient keratinocytes, which exert paracrine effects on wound stroma. Smad4-deficient skin and wounds had elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta1, which have been shown to induce similar phenotypes, as well as of several transforming growth factor-beta1 target genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5. Furthermore, the above pathological and molecular alterations were exacerbated in skin cancer lesions that spontaneously developed from Smad4-deficient skin. Therefore, loss of Smad4 in the epidermis appears to significantly affect the microenvironment during wound healing and carcinogenesis.

Autoimmune hypophysitis: a single centre experience. Autoimmune hypophysitis (AH) is a rare primary autoimmune inflammatory disorder involving the pituitary gland. A retrospective analysis of the clinical features and outcome of patients diagnosed with AH between 1988 and 2006, was carried out. 15 patients (14 females and one male) with AH were identified. Three patients presented in the peripartum period. Headache, vomiting and visual field defects, suggestive of an expanding sellar mass, were the most common presenting symptoms (67 percent). The most common deficient hormone was adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (67 percent), followed by thyroid stimulating hormone (53 percent) and gonadotropins (40 percent). Imaging revealed a definite, enhancing sellar mass in 87 percent of the patients and stalk thickening in 33 percent of the patients. Three patients underwent surgery. On serial monitoring, the sellar mass regressed or disappeared spontaneously without any immunosuppressive treatment in the other ten patients with a definite sellar mass. We report a higher female to male ratio and a lower incidence of peripartum cases in our series. Symptoms of mass effect were the most common presentation, while ACTH was the most commonly-deficient hormone. Surgery was rarely needed, and most patients experienced a spontaneous resolution of the mass.

Plasmid replication initiator interactions with origin 13-mers and polymerase subunits contribute to strand-specific replisome assembly. Although the molecular basis for replisome activity has been extensively investigated, it is not clear what the exact mechanism for de novo assembly of the replication complex at the replication origin is, or how the directionality of replication is determined. Here, using the plasmid RK2 replicon, we analyze the protein interactions required for Escherichia coli polymerase III (Pol III) holoenzyme association at the replication origin. Our investigations revealed that in E. coli, replisome formation at the plasmid origin involves interactions of the RK2 plasmid replication initiation protein (TrfA) with both the polymerase β- and α-subunits. In the presence of other replication proteins, including DnaA, helicase, primase and the clamp loader, TrfA interaction with the β-clamp contributes to the formation of the β-clamp nucleoprotein complex on origin DNA. By reconstituting in vitro the replication reaction on ssDNA templates, we demonstrate that TrfA interaction with the β-clamp and sequence-specific TrfA interaction with one strand of the plasmid origin DNA unwinding element (DUE) contribute to strand-specific replisome assembly. Wild-type TrfA, but not the TrfA QLSLF mutant (which does not interact with the β-clamp), in the presence of primase, helicase, Pol III core, clamp loader, and β-clamp initiates DNA synthesis on ssDNA template containing 13-mers of the bottom strand, but not the top strand, of DUE. Results presented in this work uncovered requirements for anchoring polymerase at the plasmid replication origin and bring insights of how the directionality of DNA replication is determined. 

Effects of growth hormone treatment on growth in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Several therapeutic trials have been conducted over the past decade to evaluate the role of exogenous growth hormone (GH) as a means of correcting the growth deficiency seen in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Early studies showed the benefit of GH treatment with respect to final height in patients with JIA. Of 13 patients receiving GH, 84% (11 patients) achieved a final height within their target range compared with only 22% (4 of 18 patients) of untreated patients. There are, however, factors that may limit the statural gains achieved with GH therapy including severe inflammation, severe statural deficiency at GH therapy initiation, long disease duration and delayed puberty. Data on the efficacy of GH replacement therapy in children with JIA and factors that influence the statural growth response will be reviewed. Results from therapeutic trials show that treatment with GH can decrease the statural deficit that occurs during the active phase of JIA, producing an adult height that is close to the genetically determined target height.

Priming the holiday spirit: persistent activation due to extraexperimental experiences. The concept of activation is a critical component of many models of cognition. A key characteristic of activation is that recent experience with a concept or stimulus increases the accessibility of the corresponding representation. The extent to which increases in accessibility occur as a result of experiences outside of laboratory settings has not been extensively explored. In the present study, we presented lexical stimuli associated with different holidays and festivities over the course of a year in a lexical decision task. When stimulus meaning and time of testing were congruent (e.g., leprechaun in March), response times were faster and accuracy greater than when meaning and time of test were incongruent (e.g., leprechaun in November). Congruency also benefited performance on a surprise free recall task of the items presented earlier in the lexical decision task. The discussion focuses on potential theoretical accounts of this heightened accessibility of time-of-the-year-relevant concepts.

Ontogeny of the enhanced fetal-ethanol-induced behavioral and neurophysiologic olfactory response to ethanol odor. Studies report a fundamental relationship between chemosensory function and the responsiveness to ethanol, its component orosensory qualities, and its odor as a consequence of fetal ethanol exposure. Regarding odor, fetal exposed rats display enhanced olfactory neural and behavioral responses to ethanol odor at postnatal (P) day 15. Although these consequences are absent in adults (P90), the behavioral effect has been shown to persist into adolescence (P37). Given the developmental timing of these observations, we explored the decay in the response to ethanol odor by examining ages between P37 and young adulthood. Moreover, we sought to determine whether the P15 neurophysiologic effect persists, at least, to P40. Behavioral and olfactory epithelial (OE) responses of fetal ethanol exposed and control rats were tested at P40, P50, P60, or P70. Whole-body plethysmography was used to quantify each animal's innate behavioral response to ethanol odor. We then mapped the odorant-induced activity across the OE in response to different odorants, including ethanol, using optical recording methods. Relative to controls, ethanol exposed animals showed an enhanced behavioral response to ethanol odor that, while significant at each age, decreased in magnitude. These results, in conjunction with previous findings, permitted the development of an ontologic odor response model of fetal exposure. The fitted model exemplifies that odor-mediated effects exist at birth, peak in adolescence and then decline, becoming absent by P90. There was no evidence of an effect on the odor response of the OE at any age tested. Fetal exposure yields an enhanced behavioral response to ethanol odor that peaks in adolescence and wanes through young adulthood. This occurs absent an enhanced response of the OE. This latter finding suggests that by P40 the OE returns to an ethanol "neutral" status and that central mechanisms, such as ethanol-induced alterations in olfactory bulb circuitry, underlie the enhanced behavioral response. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ontogeny of fetal-ethanol-induced olfactory functional plasticity and the behavioral response to ethanol odor.

Angiotensin II-activated protein kinase D mediates acute aldosterone secretion. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin II (AngII)-aldosterone system can contribute to cardiovascular disease, such that an understanding of this system is critical. Diacylglycerol-sensitive serine/threonine protein kinase D (PKD) is activated by AngII in several systems, including the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI H295R, where this enzyme enhances chronic (24h) AngII-evoked aldosterone secretion. However, the role of PKD in acute AngII-elicited aldosterone secretion has not been previously examined. In primary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, which secrete detectable quantities of aldosterone in response to secretagogues within minutes, PKD was activated in response to AngII, but not an elevated potassium concentration or adrenocorticotrophic hormone. This activation was time- and dose-dependent and occurred through the AT1, but not the AT2, receptor. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active PKD resulted in enhanced AngII-induced aldosterone secretion; whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative PKD construct decreased AngII-stimulated aldosterone secretion. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that PKD mediates acute AngII-induced aldosterone secretion.

Effect of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative pain and tramadol consumption after minilap open cholecystectomy: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. To evaluate the efficacy of a single preoperative dose of 600 mg of gabapentin for reducing postoperative pain and tramadol consumption after minilap open cholecystectomy. A total of 120 adult patients of either sex were randomly assigned to receive 600 mg of gabapentin or a matched placebo orally 2 h before operation in a double-blind manner. All the patients received gabapentin using the same technique. Postoperative analgesia was provided with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol using a 50-mg initial bolus dose, 20-mg incremental dose, 15-min lockout interval and 4-h limit of 240 mg. Patients were assessed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after operation for verbal analogue pain scores at rest and at movement. Consumption of tramadol on first and second postoperative days and any adverse effects were also recorded. Verbal analogue pain scores were significantly lower on first postoperative day at all times of observation both at rest and at movement in gabapentin group than in placebo group (P<0.01). Tramadol consumption was also reduced by 33% in gabapentin group. But pain scores and tramadol consumption were similar in two groups on second postoperative day. Sedation was common but the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in gabapentin group. Preoperative administration of 600 mg of gabapentin resulted in significant reduction in postoperative verbal analogue pain scores at rest and at movement as well as tramadol consumption compared with placebo on first postoperative day. Lower incidence of nausea and vomiting was an additional advantage. Sedation was the commonest side effect.

Incidence, diversity, and molecular epidemiology of sapoviruses in swine across Europe. Porcine sapovirus is an enteric calicivirus in domestic pigs that belongs to the family Caliciviridae. Some porcine sapoviruses are genetically related to human caliciviruses, which has raised public health concerns over animal reservoirs and the potential cross-species transmission of sapoviruses. We report on the incidence, genetic diversity, and molecular epidemiology of sapoviruses detected in domestic pigs in a comprehensive study conducted in six European countries (Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain) between 2004 and 2007. A total of 1,050 swine fecal samples from 88 pig farms were collected and tested by reverse transcription-PCR for sapoviruses, and positive findings were confirmed by sequencing. Sapoviruses were detected in 80 (7.6%) samples collected on 39 (44.3%) farms and in every country. The highest prevalence was seen among piglets aged 2 to 8 weeks, and there was no significant difference in the proportion of sapovirus-positive findings for healthy animals and animals with diarrhea in Spain and Denmark (the only countries where both healthy animals and animals with diarrhea were tested). On the basis of the sequence of the RNA polymerase region, highly heterogeneous populations of viruses representing six different genogroups (genogroups III, VI, VII, and VIII, including potential new genogroups IX and X) were identified, with a predominance of genogroup GIII (50.6%). Genogroup VIII, found in five of the six countries, had the highest degree of homology (up to 66% at the amino acid level) to human sapovirus strains. Sapoviruses are commonly circulating and endemic agents in swine herds throughout Europe. Highly heterogeneous and potential new genogroups of sapoviruses were found in pigs; however, no "human-like" sapoviruses were detected.

Neurotalk: improving the communication of neuroscience research. There is increasing pressure for neuroscientists to communicate their research and the societal implications of their findings to the public. Communicating science is challenging, and the transformation of communication by digital and interactive media increases the complexity of the challenge. To facilitate dialogue with the public in this new media landscape, we suggest three courses of action for the neuroscience community: a cultural shift that explicitly recognizes and rewards public outreach, the identification and development of neuroscience communication experts, and ongoing empirical research on the public communication of neuroscience.

Ultra Deep Sequencing of a Baculovirus Population Reveals Widespread Genomic Variations.

An autoinhibitory tyrosine motif in the cell-cycle-regulated Nek7 kinase is released through binding of Nek9. Mitosis is controlled by multiple protein kinases, many of which are abnormally expressed in human cancers. Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 are NIMA-related kinases essential for proper mitotic progression. We determined the atomic structure of Nek7 and discovered an autoinhibited conformation that suggests a regulatory mechanism not previously described in kinases. Additionally, Nek2 adopts the same conformation when bound to a drug-like molecule. In both structures, a tyrosine side chain points into the active site, interacts with the activation loop, and blocks the alphaC helix. Tyrosine mutants of Nek7 and the related kinase Nek6 are constitutively active. The activity of Nek6 and Nek7, but not the tyrosine mutant, is increased by interaction with the Nek9 noncatalytic C-terminal domain, suggesting a mechanism in which the tyrosine is released from its autoinhibitory position. The autoinhibitory conformation is common to three Neks and provides a potential target for selective kinase inhibitors.

Synaptic activity induces dramatic changes in the geometry of the cell nucleus: interplay between nuclear structure, histone H3 phosphorylation, and nuclear calcium signaling. Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurons. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and slice preparations. Using a recently developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei from hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally sized nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldings are dynamic structures, which can radically transform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential bursting causing synaptic NMDA receptor activation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the ERK-MAP kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic NMDA receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclear infoldings. Compared with near-spherical nuclei, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients are larger in small nuclear compartments than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more efficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in the theta frequency range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signaling events into changes in nuclear geometry facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nucleus, may lead to the formation of nuclear signaling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated transcription.

Visual sensory processing deficits in patients with bipolar disorder revealed through high-density electrical mapping. Etiological commonalities are apparent between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. For example, it is becoming clear that both populations show similar electrophysiological deficits in the auditory domain. Recent studies have also shown robust visual sensory processing deficits in patients with schizophrenia using the event-related potential technique, but this has not been formally tested in those with bipolar disorder. Our goal here was to assess whether early visual sensory processing in patients with bipolar disorder, as indexed by decreased amplitude of the P1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP), would show a similar deficit to that seen in those with schizophrenia. Since the P1 deficit has already been established as an endophenotype in schizophrenia, a finding of commonality between disorders would raise the possibility that it represents a measure of common genetic liability. We visually presented isolated-check stimuli to euthymic patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and age-matched healthy controls within a simple go/no-go task and recorded VEPs using high-density (72-channel) electroencephalography. The P1 VEP amplitude was substantially reduced in patients with bipolar disorder, with an effect size of f = 0.56 (large according to Cohen's criteria). Our sample size was relatively small and as such, did not allow for an examination of potential relations between the physiologic measures and clinical measures. This reduction in P1 amplitude among patients with bipolar disorder represents a dysfunction in early visual processing that is highly similar to that found repeatedly in patients with schizophrenia and their healthy first-degree relatives. Since the P1 deficit has been related to susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, our results raise the possibility that the deficit may in fact be more broadly related to the development of psychosis and that it merits further investigation as a candidate endophenotype for bipolar disorder.

Effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis against Plasmodium falciparum infection in UK travellers: retrospective observational data. What is already known on this topic. Malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease, and cases of imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria have increased among UK travellers over the past 20 years, although declining steadily in recent years. The HPA Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACMP) UK Traveller guidelines recommend doxycycline, mefloquine, or combination atovaquone plus proguanil for prophylaxis in travellers to P. falciparum endemic regions, and with the exception of Lambeth Primary Care Trust, malaria chemoprophylaxis is not reimbursed by the NHS. There are limited data on the comparative effectiveness of the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis drugs for P. falciparum. What this study adds. The effectiveness of combination atovaquone plus proguanil may provide greater protection against imported P. falciparum malaria in UK travellers as compared with doxycycline and mefloquine. More research is needed on the effectiveness of different chemoprophylactic regimens. Further work is required to ascertain whether ease of use and compliance may be important factors in the outcomes associated with malaria chemoprophylaxis.

Inflammatory cytokines during liver transplantation: prospective randomized trial comparing conventional and piggyback techniques. Cytokines have a significant role in the response to injury following liver transplantation, but the origin and course of such molecules are not completely known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the production and liver metabolism of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), comparing the conventional and the piggyback methods. We performed a study of 30 patients who underwent elective OLT and were randomized for the conventional or piggyback techniques at the beginning of the operation. The amount of cytokines and their hepatic metabolism were calculated based on plasma concentrations and vascular blood flow at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after revascularization. The amount of IL-11 in portal blood was higher in patients who underwent surgery using the conventional technique (estimate interest = 63,783.9 +/-16,586.1 pg/min, versus 11,979.6 +/-16,585.7 pg/min in the piggyback group, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences between the two operative's methods for IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production. The hepatic metabolism of cytokines was not different between groups. Although all the curves showed higher amounts of cytokines with the conventional technique, these were not statistically significant. The study shows the similarity between the two techniques concerning the stimuli for the production of inflammatory molecules.

Comparison of immune response in sheep immunized with DNA vaccine encoding Toxoplasma gondii GRA7 antigen in different adjuvant formulations. Immunization with plasmid DNA, a relatively novel technique, is a promising vaccination technique. To improve the immune response by DNA vaccination various methods have been used, such as chemical adjuvants or immunomodulatory molecules formulated into microparticles or liposomes. The aim of this research is to evaluate the immune responses of sheep immunized with DNA plasmids encoding Toxoplasma gondii dense granule antigen GRA7 formulated into three different adjuvant formulations. Sixty sheep were injected intramuscularly with the DNA plasmids. Twelve received the liposome-formulated plasmid pVAXIgGRA7, 12 Emulsigen P formulated plasmid pVAXIgGRA7 and 12 Emulsigen D formulated plasmid pVAXIgGRA7. Twelve animals were used as a control and received the vector alone. All the animals were inoculated at week 0, and week 4. Immunization of the sheep with plasmids encoding GRA7, with the different adjuvant formulations, effectively primed the immune response. After the first inoculation, moderate to high antibody responses were observed with the three different adjuvant formulations. A significantly elevated specific IgG2 response was observed in the sheep immunized with liposomes and Emulsigen D as adjuvants. In the group immunized with Emulsigen P as an adjuvant, lower IgG1 and IgG2 antibody levels were developed compared to the other treatment groups. In all the immunized groups, DNA immunization stimulated a IFN-gamma response. No antibody or IFN-gamma responses were detected in the control group immunized with an empty plasmid or not immunized. These results indicate that intramuscular immunization of sheep with a DNA vaccine with the adjuvants liposomes and Emulsigen D induce a significant immune response against T. gondii.

[The expression of substance P in airway mucosa of guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by hydrochloric acid]. To observe the expression of substance P (SP) in the airway mucosa of guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by hydrochloric acid (HCL). Twenty adult guinea pigs were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 10 each): (1) The HCL model group: On the day of experimentation, guinea pigs were maintained under ketamine anesthesia. A 5F catheter was inserted orally into the lumen of the middle and lower esophagus. The esophagus of each animal was perfused with HCl-P for 20 min/d for 14 d. (2) The PBS control group: The esophagus of each animal was perfused with PBS instead. The bronchial responsiveness to Ach given intravenously with increasing doses (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 microg/kg) was measured after the last perfusion. The left lung was isolated for pathological examination. Lung sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and other sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against SP. In response to increasing doses of ACh, all guinea pigs showed dose-dependent increases in R(L). However, when the dose of ACh was increased to 25 microg/kg, the airway responsiveness increased significantly in the HCl-P model animals compared with the PBS control group (t values = 43.057, 51.410, 57.359 respectively, all P<0.01). The mean gray values of SP decreased significantly in the tracheal epithelia and the distal airway walls of the model group compared with the PBS control group (t values = 3.44, 2.16 respectively, all P<0.01). There was airway neurogenic inflammation in guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by HCL, which maybe closely related to the pathogenesis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

Characterization of [4Fe-4S]-containing and cluster-free forms of Streptomyces WhiD. WhiD, a member of the WhiB-like (Wbl) family of iron-sulfur proteins found exclusively within the actinomycetes, is required for the late stages of sporulation in Streptomyces coelicolor. Like all other Wbl proteins, WhiD has not so far been purified in a soluble form that contains a significant amount of cluster, and characterization has relied on cluster-reconstituted protein. Thus, a major goal in Wbl research is to obtain and characterize native protein containing iron-sulfur clusters. Here we report the analysis of S. coelicolor WhiD purified anaerobically from Escherichia coli as a soluble protein containing a single [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster ligated by four cysteines. Upon exposure to oxygen, spectral features associated with the [4Fe-4S] cluster were lost in a slow reaction that unusually yielded apo-WhiD directly without significant concentrations of cluster intermediates. This process was found to be highly pH dependent with an optimal stability observed between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0. Low molecular weight thiols, including a mycothiol analogue and thioredoxin, exerted a small but significant protective effect against WhiD cluster loss, an activity that could be of physiological importance. [4Fe-4S](2+) WhiD was found to react much more rapidly with superoxide than with either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, which may also be of physiological significance. Loss of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to form apoprotein destabilized the protein fold significantly but did not lead to complete unfolding. Finally, apo-WhiD exhibited negligible activity in an insulin-based disulfide reductase assay, demonstrating that it does not function as a general protein disulfide reductase.

Aquaporin 9 expression in the developing rat epididymis is modulated by steroid hormones. Fluid and solute transport across the epithelium of the male excurrent duct is important for sperm maturation and storage. Aquaporin 9 (AQP9), which allows permeation of water and neutral solutes, is abundant throughout the male reproductive tract, where it is expressed at the apical membrane of rat epididymal principal cells as early as at 1 week of age. We evaluated the effect of neonatal exposure to: 1) a GNRH antagonist (GNRHa); 2) diethylstilbestrol (DES); 3) ethinyl estradiol (EE); 4) DES plus testosterone (DES+TE); and 5) the anti-androgen flutamide on AQP9 expression in the epididymis of peripubertal rats. Control groups received the vehicle alone. In 25-day-old rats, quantification of the mean pixel intensity of immunofluorescence-stained sections showed a significant decrease in AQP9 staining in the apical membrane of epididymal principal cells after treatments with GNRHa, DES, or flutamide, compared to controls. These results were confirmed by western blotting. While EE induced a marked decrease in AQP9 levels by western blotting, the decrease in AQP9-associated fluorescence was not significant compared to controls. DES+TE-treated rats showed levels of AQP9 protein similar to controls, indicating maintenance of AQP9 expression by testosterone treatment in the presence of DES. Our data show that expression of AQP9 in the developing rat epididymis is downregulated by neonatal DES, GNRHa, EE, and flutamide, and that the effects mediated by estrogens can be prevented by testosterone administration.

Changes in regional blood flow induced by unilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) were investigated in 7 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 4 men and 3 women (mean age 62.3 +/- 8.1 years), who underwent rCBF measurement by N-isopropyl-p-(iodine-123)-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography at rest before and after unilateral STN DBS preoperatively in the on-drug condition, and postoperatively in the on-drug and on-stimulation condition. Statistical parametric mapping was used to identify significant changes in rCBF from the preoperative to the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingulate cortices and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bilateral medial frontal cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilateral STN DBS produced rCBF changes in the bilateral cingulate cortices, cerebellar hemispheres, and medial frontal cortices. These findings indicate that unilateral STN DBS affects rCBF in both hemispheres.

HIV infection among injection-drug users - 34 states, 2004-2007. Injection-drug users (IDUs) acquire human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by sharing drug equipment with HIV-infected persons and by engaging in risky sexual behavior. In 2007, injection-drug use was the third most frequently reported risk factor for HIV infection in the United States, after male-to-male sexual contact and high-risk heterosexual contact. To characterize HIV-infected IDUs aged >or=13 years in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the national notifiable disease reporting system for 2004-2007 from the 34 states that had conducted confidential, name-based HIV surveillance since at least 2003. The results of that analysis indicated that, during 2004-2007, 62.2% of IDUs with a new diagnosis of HIV infection were males, 57.5% were blacks or African Americans, and 74.8% lived in urban areas at the time of their HIV diagnosis. In addition, during 2004-2006, approximately 40% of HIV-infected IDUs received late HIV diagnoses (i.e., diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] <12 months after the date of HIV diagnosis). To reduce the prevalence of HIV infection and late HIV diagnosis among IDUs, HIV prevention programs serving IDUs should have comprehensive approaches that incorporate access to HIV testing as part of community-based outreach, drug abuse treatment, and syringe exchange programs.

siDirect 2.0: updated software for designing functional siRNA with reduced seed-dependent off-target effect. RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by 21-nucleotide (nt)-length small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a powerful tool not only for studying gene function but also for therapeutic applications. RNAi, requiring perfect complementarity between the siRNA guide strand and the target mRNA, was believed to be extremely specific. However, a recent growing body of evidence has suggested that siRNA could down-regulate unintended genes whose transcripts possess complementarity to the 7-nt siRNA seed region. This off-target gene silencing may often provide incongruous results obtained from knockdown experiments, leading to misinterpretation. Thus, an efficient algorithm for designing functional siRNAs with minimal off-target effect based on the mechanistic features is considered of value. We present siDirect 2.0, an update of our web-based software siDirect, which provides functional and off-target minimized siRNA design for mammalian RNAi. The previous version of our software designed functional siRNAs by considering the relationship between siRNA sequence and RNAi activity, and provided them along with the enumeration of potential off-target gene candidates by using a fast and sensitive homology search algorithm. In the new version, the siRNA design algorithm is extensively updated to eliminate off-target effects by reflecting our recent finding that the capability of siRNA to induce off-target effect is highly correlated to the thermodynamic stability, or the melting temperature (Tm), of the seed-target duplex, which is formed between the nucleotides positioned at 2-8 from the 5' end of the siRNA guide strand and its target mRNA. Selection of siRNAs with lower seed-target duplex stabilities (benchmark Tm < 21.5 degrees C) followed by the elimination of unrelated transcripts with nearly perfect match should minimize the off-target effects. siDirect 2.0 provides functional, target-specific siRNA design with the updated algorithm which significantly reduces off-target silencing. When the candidate functional siRNAs could form seed-target duplexes with Tm values below 21.5 degrees C, and their 19-nt regions spanning positions 2-20 of both strands have at least two mismatches to any other non-targeted transcripts, siDirect 2.0 can design at least one qualified siRNA for >94% of human mRNA sequences in RefSeq. siDirect 2.0 is available at http://siDirect2.RNAi.jp/.

Chronic dietary kudzu isoflavones improve components of metabolic syndrome in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. The present study tested the long-term effects of dietary kudzu root extract supplementation on the regulation of arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and circulating cholesterol in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SP-SHR). Female SP-SHR were maintained for 2 months on a polyphenol-free diet, with or without the addition of 0.2% kudzu root extract. Half of the rats in each diet group were ovariectomized, whereas the other half remained intact. Following 2 months on the diets, the 0.2% kudzu root extract supplementation (compared to control diet) significantly lowered arterial pressure (11-15 mmHg), plasma cholesterol, fasting blood glucose (20-30%), and fasting plasma insulin in both the ovariectomized and intact SP-SHR. These results indicate that long-term dietary kudzu root extract supplementation can improve glucose, lipid, and blood pressure control in intact and ovariectomized SP-SHR.

[Effects of Astragalus membranaceus on cytokine secretion of peripheral dendritic cells in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura in the acute phase]. To explore the effects of Astragalus membranaceus (AM) on the cytokines secretion of peripheral dendritic cells (DC), including interleukin-10, -12, and -18 (IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18), in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) in the acute phase; and to study the immunological regulation mechanism of AM. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 28 children with acute HSP by density gradient centrifugation, and each sample was divided into two parts, one untreated and one treated with AM. All cells were developed to mature DC through treating with recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Expression of CD83 in the surface of mature DC was detected by flow cytometry, and levels of IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18 in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. The supernatant level of IL-12 was higher [(141.58 +/- 100.19) ng/L vs (96.18 +/- 76.65) ng/L, t = 3.90, P<0.01], while levels of IL-10 and IL-18 were lower (t = 2.70, P<0.05; t = 4.07, P<0.01) in AM treated PBMCs than those in the untreated ones. AM can correct the immunologic dysfunction of HSP children through increasing the IL-12, and decreasing the IL-10 and IL-18 secretions of PBMCs.

Live birth after polar body array comparative genomic hybridization prediction of embryo ploidy-the future of IVF? To ascertain meiotic aneuploidy of the human egg using array comparative genomic hybridization to evaluate the 23-paired chromosome copy number of first polar body as an objective prognosticator of embryo viability for embryo transfer in the same cycle. Case report. Independent-sector IVF program. A 41-year-old woman with a history of 13 failed cycles of IVF. Polar body biopsy of metaphase II eggs. Birth. Two of the nine eggs were euploid, and the resulting embryos, although morphologically inferior to sibling embryos, were selected for transfer to the uterus, resulting in the birth of a normal healthy baby. Selection of euploid eggs, as an objective parameter of subsequent embryo viability and with the opportunity to transfer embryos in the same cycle could maximise the opportunity for live birth after IVF even in cases with poor prognosis.

Human health benefits of vaccenic acid. The health risks associated with consumption of diets high in trans fats from industrially produced hydrogenated fats are well documented. However, trans fatty acids are not a homogeneous group of molecules, and less is known about the health effects of consuming diets containing vaccenic acid (VA), a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid, the predominant trans isomer in ruminant fats. The presence of VA in industrial trans fats has raised the question of whether VA produces the same adverse health effects as industrially produced trans fats. VA is also the major trans fat in ruminant fats, and questions have arisen as to whether consuming this trans fat has the same effects on health risk. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the published studies in humans, animals, and cell lines. Epidemiological, but not rodent, studies suggest that VA intake or serum concentrations may be associated with increased cancer risk. However, epidemiological, clinical, and rodent studies to date have not demonstrated a relationship with heart or cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, or inflammation. VA is the only known dietary precursor of c9,t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), but recent data suggest that consumption of this trans fat may impart health benefits beyond those associated with CLA.

Coarse-grained red blood cell model with accurate mechanical properties, rheology and dynamics. We present a coarse-grained red blood cell (RBC) model with accurate and realistic mechanical properties, rheology and dynamics. The modeled membrane is represented by a triangular mesh which incorporates shear inplane energy, bending energy, and area and volume conservation constraints. The macroscopic membrane elastic properties are imposed through semi-analytic theory, and are matched with those obtained in optical tweezers stretching experiments. Rheological measurements characterized by time-dependent complex modulus are extracted from the membrane thermal fluctuations, and compared with those obtained from the optical magnetic twisting cytometry results. The results allow us to define a meaningful characteristic time of the membrane. The dynamics of RBCs observed in shear flow suggests that a purely elastic model for the RBC membrane is not appropriate, and therefore a viscoelastic model is required. The set of proposed analyses and numerical tests can be used as a complete model testbed in order to calibrate the modeled viscoelastic membranes to accurately represent RBCs in health and disease.

Risk factors for adverse cardiac events in hip fracture patients: an analysis of NSQIP data.

Unique and conserved genome regions in Vibrio harveyi and related species in comparison with the shrimp pathogen Vibrio harveyi CAIM 1792. Vibrio harveyi CAIM 1792 is a marine bacterial strain that causes mortality in farmed shrimp in north-west Mexico, and the identification of virulence genes in this strain is important for understanding its pathogenicity. The aim of this work was to compare the V. harveyi CAIM 1792 genome with related genome sequences to determine their phylogenic relationship and explore unique regions in silico that differentiate this strain from other V. harveyi strains. Twenty-one newly sequenced genomes were compared in silico against the CAIM 1792 genome at nucleotidic and predicted proteome levels. The proteome of CAIM 1792 had higher similarity to those of other V. harveyi strains (78%) than to those of the other closely related species Vibrio owensii (67%), Vibrio rotiferianus (63%) and Vibrio campbellii (59%). Pan-genome ORFans trees showed the best fit with the accepted phylogeny based on DNA-DNA hybridization and multi-locus sequence analysis of 11 concatenated housekeeping genes. SNP analysis clustered 34/38 genomes within their accepted species. The pangenomic and SNP trees showed that V. harveyi is the most conserved of the four species studied and V. campbellii may be divided into at least three subspecies, supported by intergenomic distance analysis. blastp atlases were created to identify unique regions among the genomes most related to V. harveyi CAIM 1792; these regions included genes encoding glycosyltransferases, specific type restriction modification systems and a transcriptional regulator, LysR, reported to be involved in virulence, metabolism, quorum sensing and motility.

Pulmonary function analysis of Japanese athletes: possibly even more asthmatics in the field. The prevalence of bronchial asthma (BA) in youth is increasing in Japan, but very few athletes are reported to be affected with BA. The aim of this study is to analyze pulmonary function test (PFT) in athletes from the aspect of BA retrospectively. Medical history questionnaires of 2111 athletes (male: 1549, female: 562) were reviewed. All athletes participated in the institute's athletic test for the first time, from April 2003 through March 2006. Athletes were categorized into three groups; current-BA confirmed and treated by the physician, possible-BA according to the allergic history and/or BA symptoms, and non-BA that is neither of the above two groups. The PFT data were then analyzed. There were 24 current-BA (1.1%), 137 possible-BA (6.5%), and 183 cases with a past history of BA (PH; 8.7%). Percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) and of predicted peak expiratory flow rate (%PEF) in current-BA (86.2+/-17.7% and 81.6+/-19.1%, respectively) and possible-BA (84.7+/-14.6% and 81.2+/-17.3%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in non-BA (93.9+/-13.7% and 93.8+/-19.8%, respectively), without any significant difference between current-BA and possible-BA. Athletes with PH show impaired obstructive indices; even in non-BA with PH showed lower %FEV1 (91.3+/-13.9%, p<0.05) and %PEF (86.8+/-17.8%, p<0.001) than non-BA without PH (94.0+/-13.7% and 94.2+/-19.9%, respectively). The incidence of BA in Japanese athletes may be higher than currently recognized. More intervention is encouraged for the diagnosis of BA, to avoid any fatal asthma during sports by initiating preventive therapy.


Endoscopic definition of esophagogastric junction for diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus: importance of systematic education and training.

Expression of CD44s in incidental prostate cancer is more strongly associated with Gleason scores on subsequent radical prostatectomies than conventional prognostic parameters. Incidental prostate cancer (IPC) has a substantially variable clinical course which cannot be predicted by conventional histopathologic examination of transurethral resection specimens of the prostate (TURP chips). Therefore, efforts should be directed towards defining the natural history of individual IPC. Recently, expression of CD44s (standard isoform), a transmembranous glycoprotein, has been linked to prognostic outcome in prostate cancer, but its prognostic role in IPC has been neglected so far. We present a multicentre study which evaluates immunohistochemically the largest cohort of IPC patients to date, aiming to correlate CD44s expression in the TURP chips with histopathologic outcome parameters (Gleason scores and histologic staging) performed on subsequent radical prostatectomies (RPs) in a cohort of 54 patients who underwent prostatectomy due to IPC. CD44s expression recorded in the TURP chips showed a stronger (inverse) association with Gleason scores performed on the corresponding RPs than did other conventional prognostic variables and, therefore, might become a valuable adjunct to better predict outcome in IPC prior to radical prostatectomy. Advanced prospective studies should aim to define cut-point values of CD44s expression for separating aggressive tumours from their indolent counterparts, and should also assess possible associations with clinical follow-up data (e.g. progression-free survival) in IPC.

Insect biodiversity and conservation in Australasia. Australasia, which consists of Australia and the adjacent islands of the southwestern Pacific Ocean, has an insect diversity approximately proportional to the land mass. This diversity is distinctive, with some major groups missing and others having radiated. Iconic species are familiar to most people living in Australia and New Zealand, and a range of insects once contributed to Aboriginal Australian culture and diet. Conservation of Australasian entomological biodiversity is an increasing challenge for contemporary scientists. Examples are provided of insect conservation schemes from New Guinea, New Zealand, and Australia. Funding for insect biodiversity studies beyond flagship species is needed.

Pronociceptive effects of remifentanil in a mouse model of postsurgical pain: effect of a second surgery. Remifentanil anesthesia enhances postoperative pain in animals and humans. The authors evaluated the impact of the dose (microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and duration of remifentanil infusion, and the effects of a second surgery on postoperative pain sensitization. Mice received different doses of remifentanil over 30 or 60 min. The authors assessed thermal (Hargreaves) and mechanical hyperalgesia (von Frey) at 2, 4, 7, and 10 days. In other experiments, mice had a plantar incision during sevoflurane with or without remifentanil anesthesia that was repeated 27 days later, when nociceptive thresholds returned to baseline. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis. Remifentanil induced dose-dependent pronociceptive effects with calculated ED(50)s of 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.1) and 1.26 (1.0-1.6) microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, respectively, which lasted longer with higher doses (P < 0.001). The duration of infusion did not alter the pronociceptive effects of remifentanil when administered at a constant dose of infusion. When given during surgery, high (2.66 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or low (0.66 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) remifentanil increased the extent (P < 0.05) and duration (P < 0.01) of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. The latter was further enhanced after a second surgery performed in the same experimental conditions (P < 0.05). Surgery or remifentanil infusion, each one individually, induced significant mechanical hyperalgesia, which was greater when repeated (P < 0.05). In this model of incisional pain, remifentanil induces pronociceptive effects, which are dose dependent but unaltered by the duration of administration. A second surgery performed on the same site and experimental conditions induces greater postoperative hyperalgesia that is enhanced when remifentanil is used as an anesthetic.

An arithmetic rule for spatial summation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in pyramidal neurons. Dendritic integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is critical for neuronal computation, but the underlying rules remain to be elucidated. Based on realistic modeling and experiments in rat hippocampal slices, we derived a simple arithmetic rule for spatial summation of concurrent excitatory glutamatergic inputs (E) and inhibitory GABAergic inputs (I). The somatic response can be well approximated as the sum of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), and a nonlinear term proportional to their product (k*EPSP*IPSP), where the coefficient k reflects the strength of shunting effect. The k value shows a pronounced asymmetry in its dependence on E and I locations. For I on the dendritic trunk, k decays rapidly with E-I distance for proximal Es, but remains largely constant for distal Es, indicating a uniformly high shunting efficacy for all distal Es. For I on an oblique branch, the shunting effect is restricted mainly within the branch, with the same proximal/distal asymmetry. This asymmetry can be largely attributed to cable properties of the dendrite. Further modeling studies showed that this rule also applies to the integration of multiple coincident Es and Is. Thus, this arithmetic rule offers a simple analytical tool for studying E-I integration in pyramidal neurons that incorporates the location specificity of GABAergic shunting inhibition.

Laser as a therapy for dry mouth symptoms in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome: a case report. This clinical case study reports on dry mouth symptoms in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome (SS) who was treated with laser phototherapy (LPT). A 60-year-old woman diagnosed with SS was referred to the laboratory for lasers in dentistry to treat her severe xerostomia. A diode laser (780 nm, 3.8 J/cm2, 15 mW) was used to irradiate the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands, three times per week, for a period of 8 months. The salivary flow rate and xerostomia symptoms were measured before, during, and after LPT. Dry mouth symptoms improved during LPT. After LPT, the parotid salivary gland pain and swelling were no longer present. Treatment with LPT was an effective method to improve the quality of life of this patient with SS.

Sound localization cues in the marmoset monkey. The most important acoustic cues available to the brain for sound localization are produced by the interaction of sound with the animal's head and external ears. As a first step in understanding the relation between these cues and their neural representation in a vocal new-world primate, we measured head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) across frequency for a wide range of sound locations in three anesthetized marmoset monkeys. The HRTF magnitude spectrum has a broad resonance peak at 6-12 kHz that coincides with the frequency range of the major call types of this species. A prominent first spectral notch (FN) in the HRTF magnitude above this resonance was observed at most source locations. The center frequency of the FN increased monotonically from approximately 12 to 26 kHz with increases in elevation in the lateral field. In the frontal field FN frequency changed in a less orderly fashion with source position. From the HRTFs we derived interaural time (ITDs) and level differences (ILDs). ITDs and ILDs (below 12 kHz) varied as a function of azimuth between +/-250 micros and +/-20dB, respectively. A reflexive orienting behavioral paradigm was used to confirm that marmosets can orient to sound sources.

Directed information measure for quantifying the information flow in the brain.

LifeShirt acquisition system to monitor ECG from ambulatory swine and the implementation of an arrhythmia detection algorithm. A wearable cardiopulmonary monitoring system, a LifeShirt, was used to acquire continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) from ambulatory swine. The animals received intracoronary injections of autologous mesenchymal stem cells, and the LifeShirt was used for long-duration ECG monitoring in pre-defined periods post cell infusion. The system used here was developed for measurements from non-human primates and canines; however, we demonstrated that it could be used to non-invasively measure ECGs from swine without creating undue stress or restricting movement. A MATLAB-based analysis algorithm was developed to automatically detect premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that arose 8-10 hours after cell delivery with spontaneous resolution 2-3 days post-infusion. Template based cross-correlation was used to detect the PVCs and identify regions of consecutive ventricular rhythm. The final algorithm was highly specific and sensitive when tested on records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The algorithm was subsequently used to automatically identify and quantify PVCs from over 200 hours of ECG data obtained from nine ambulatory swine.

Customizing deep brain stimulation to the patient using computational models. Bilateral subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in improving the cardinal motor signs of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD); however declines in cognitive function have been associated with this procedure. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive-motor performance of 10 PD patients implanted with STN DBS systems during either clinically determined stimulation settings or settings derived from a computational model. Cicerone DBS software was used to define the model parameters such that current spread to non-motor areas of the STN was minimized. Clinically determined and model defined parameters were equally effective in improving motor scores on the traditional clinical rating scale (UPDRS-III). Under modest dual-task conditions, cognitive-motor performance was worse with clinically determined compared to model derived parameters. In addition, the model parameters provided a 66% reduction in power consumption. These results indicate that the cognitive-motor declines associated with bilateral STN can be mitigated, without compromising motor benefits, utilizing stimulation parameters that minimize current spread into non-motor regions of the STN.

Trans-oral cricomyotomy using a flexible endoscope: technique and clinical outcomes. Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) is a rare upper esophageal pathology that is most prevalent in the sixth and seventh decade. Three different therapeutical options are available: (1) open trans-cervical approach, (2) rigid endoscopy and (3) flexible endoscopy. Our hypothesis is that a flexible endoscopic cricomyotomy represents a safe and effective treatment of ZD as well as cricopharyngeal spasm. A retrospective analysis of all patients that underwent a flexible endoscopic cricomyotomy at our institution between October 2008 and May 2014 was performed. Preoperative and postoperative (1 month and long-term follow-up) symptom scores and clinical outcomes were collected. Briefly, the ZD is carefully identified endoscopically and the common wall is divided using needle knife cautery with the help of an endoscopic cap. Clips are used to close the mucosal defect starting with the apex. Twenty-six patients underwent a flexible endoscopic myotomy for a ZD. Of 26 patients, five (19.2 %) had a history of previous open or stapled trans-oral myotomy and four (15.4 %) underwent a concomitant foregut procedure. Mean length of stay was 1.5 days (range 1-11). Mean operative time was 68 min (range 28-149). One patient presented with a postoperative leak, and one patient presented with a retained clip. Both were treated endoscopically. Recurrent weekly dysphagia was present in 3/26 (11.5 %). One patient (3.8 %) underwent an endoscopic bougie dilatation postoperatively. With regard to clinical outcomes, there was a statistically significant improvement in both short-term (1 month) and long-term (median follow-up 21.8 months; range 1-68.2 months) dysphagia (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), regurgitation (p = 0.001; p = 0.017), cough (p = 0.006; p = 0.025) and aspiration (p = 0.013; p = 0.013). Flexible endoscopic cricomyotomy offers durable relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, cough and aspiration in ZD patients. It appears to have a good safety profile with symptomatic recurrence occurring in up to 11.5 % of cases.

[Microflora of the small intestine in patients with perforating duodenal ulcers]. The toxic phase of peritonitis in patients with perforating duodenal ulcers is accompanied with the development of syndrome of redundant bacterial colonization of the small intestine. However, it is less pronounced than in other forms of intra-abdominal infection. The greatest quantitative growth in all the patients is observed among the species of the family of enterobacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacilli, the bacterial species dominating in the upper part of the intestine in health being the leading etiological agents of intra-abdominal infection in patients with perforating duodenal ulcers. Unlike peritonitis of other etiology strict anaerobic bacteria are found in the small intestine much rarer.

Alignment of gold clusters on DNA via a DNA-recognizing zinc finger-metallothionein fusion protein. The complementary recognition of base pairs (bp) is the major strategy in the "DNA lithography" of gold (Au)clusters or nanoparticles, where single-stranded DNAs sulfurized at their termini are generally used to bind Au clusters or nanoparticles. In this report, we discuss a new material that can be used to locate Au clusters on the desired positions of DNA. For this purpose, we combined a two-domain zinc finger (ZF) and the analogue of R domain of rat's liver metallothionein (MT) to utilize the DNA-recognizing ability of ZF motifs and the heavy metal binding ability of MTs, and prepared an artificial fusion protein, ZFZF-MTalpha (1). Titration experiments monitored by absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopies, as well as an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and quantification using 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), clarified that (1) the ZF domain traps two divalent metal ions to fold in a ZF structure with M(Cys)2(His)2 (M = Co, Zn, and Cd) coordination units, (2) the MT domain traps metal ions to form clusters (Cd2+ particularly forms a Cd4(Cys)9 cluster) without interfering with the folding of the ZF domain, and (3) 1 recognizes the 5'-GGGGGG-3' (G6) bp sequence in the presence of Zn2+ based on the amino acid sequence encoded in the ZF domain. The titration of Au11(PPh3)8Cl3 (Au11) into the solution of 1 in the presence of Zn2+ revealed that the MT domain strongly binds the Au11 cluster with a 1:1 ratio, and a Au11-containing conjugate, ZF(Zn)ZF(Zn)-MTalpha(Au11) was obtained. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that this conjugate maintains an Au11 core in the form of Au11(PPh3)4(S-Cys)6 without disturbing the folding nature of the ZF domain. ZF(Zn)ZF(Zn)-MTR(Au11) recognizes the bp sequence G6 with K(d1) = 450 nM, while simultaneously forming a dimer on the DNA with K(d2) = 200 nM. TEM experiments showed that the conjugates form parallelograms or triangles (defective parallelograms) on a double crossover (dx) DNA, according to the positions of G6 encoded in the dx DNA.

Overexpression of Toll-like receptor 2/4 on monocytes modulates the activities of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The significance of TLR expression and Tregs in HBV infection has not been clearly described. In this report, flow cytometry was performed to assess TLR2/4 expression on monocytes and circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low/-) Tregs frequency of 16 acute hepatitis B (AHB), 42 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 22 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC), and 20 normal controls (NC). We found that TLR2 and TLR4 were overexpressed on CD14(+) monocytes in HBV-infected patients as compared with NCs. Upregulation of TLR2 in NCs and TLR4 in CHBs was observed following HBeAg incubation. However, TLR2 and TLR4 expression decreased after HBcAg stimulation. The difference in the proportion of Tregs between NCs and CHBs was significant. Both Pam3Csk4 (TLR2 agonist)- and lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 agonist)-activated CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs showed enhanced suppression function in CHBs. These results suggest that overexpression of TLR2 and TLR4 may modulate the suppressive function of Tregs, which contribute to the immunotolerance of chronic HBV infection.

A mixed methods study of the factors that influence whether intervention research has policy and practice impacts: perceptions of Australian researchers. To investigate researchers' perceptions about the factors that influenced the policy and practice impacts (or lack of impact) of one of their own funded intervention research studies. Mixed method, cross-sectional study. Intervention research conducted in Australia and funded by Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council between 2003 and 2007. The chief investigators from 50 funded intervention research studies were interviewed to determine if their study had achieved policy and practice impacts, how and why these impacts had (or had not) occurred and the approach to dissemination they had employed. We found that statistically significant intervention effects and publication of results influenced whether there were policy and practice impacts, along with factors related to the nature of the intervention itself, the researchers' experience and connections, their dissemination and translation efforts, and the postresearch context. This study indicates that sophisticated approaches to intervention development, dissemination actions and translational efforts are actually widespread among experienced researches, and can achieve policy and practice impacts. However, it was the links between the intervention results, further dissemination actions by researchers and a variety of postresearch contextual factors that ultimately determined whether a study had policy and practice impacts. Given the complicated interplay between the various factors, there appears to be no simple formula for determining which intervention studies should be funded in order to achieve optimal policy and practice impacts.


[Chromosome 13q deletion detected by interphase FISH in multiple myeloma: a study of 100 cases in China].

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first-line treatment in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Classic activating mutations in the form of deletions in exon 19 or a missense mutation L858R in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) predict dramatic responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. We review here the clinical benefits of targeted therapy with erlotinib and gefitinib in white and Asian nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients. Two separate analyses of pooled data from small phase II prospective studies show that therapy with gefitinib and erlotinib induces responses in over 70% of nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients harboring classic EGFR mutations, with progression-free survival ranging from 9 to 13 months and median survival of around 23 months. Two separate studies in white and Asian patients have recently confirmed that these subgroups of patients attain response rates of 70% with erlotinib and gefitinib, including complete responses, progression-free survival of up to 14 months, and median survival of up to 27 months. The serial monitoring of EGFR mutations in the blood will permit the assessment of molecular responses and be an important tool for the surveillance of clinical progression. Nonsmall-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations constitute a new entity with a unique opportunity for further refinement of different genetic subgroups among patients with EGFR mutations, requiring different personalized treatment strategies. Despite the impressive outcomes attained with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, patients with EGFR mutations at present require continuous treatment, and only a fraction of these patients will reach sustainable long-term survival.

Megakaryocyte-bone cell interactions. Emerging data show that megakaryocytes (MKs) play a role in the replication and development of bone cells. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence now show that MKs can have significant effects on cells of the osteoclast (OC) and osteoblast (OB) lineage, with obvious manifestations on bone phenotype, and probable significance for human pathology.There are currently four mouse models in which increases in MK number lead to a specific bone pathology of markedly increased bone volume. While these models all achieve megakaryocytosis by different mechanisms, the resultant osteosclerotic phenotype observed is consistent across all models.In vitro data suggest that MKs play a role in OC and OB proliferation and differentiation. While MKs express receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a prerequisite for osteoclastogenesis, they also express many factors known to inhibit OC development, and co-cultures of MKs with OCs show a significant decrease in osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, MKs express several proteins with a known critical role in osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, and co-cultures of these two lineages result in up to a six-fold increase in OB proliferation and alterations in OB differentiation.This research demonstrates the complex regulatory interactions at play between MKs and bone cells, and opens up potential targets for therapeutic intervention.


[Sphingosine kinase 1 promotes glioma cell proliferation under hypoxia via calcium signaling].

Element contents in organs and tissues of Chinese adult men. This study was undertaken to provide reference values for relevant parameters of Chinese Reference Man. Eighteen kinds of major organ or tissue samples, including muscle, rib, liver, and so on, were obtained from autopsies of 68 healthy adult men living in four areas of China with different dietary patterns (Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi or Jiangsu provinces, including Shanghai City) who had just encountered sudden deaths. At the same time, whole blood samples were collected from 10 volunteers living in each of these areas. The concentrations of 60 elements in these samples were detected by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), neutron activation analysis (NAA), fluorometry (FL), graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS) techniques and necessary quality control (QC) measures. Based on obtained concentrations and reference values of these organ or tissue weights for Chinese Reference Man, the elemental burdens in these organs or tissues were estimated. As a summary report of a series of research studies for Chinese Reference Man, which included three steps (from 1996 to 2006), the concentrations of 60 elements in 18 main organs or tissues were determined and their elemental burdens in the organs or tissues and whole body were estimated. Furthermore, the organ or tissue distributions of some important elements for radiation protection were discussed. These results may provide more reliable and better representative bases than before for establishing related reference values of Chinese Reference Man and revising current reference values of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Reference Man. These basic data will also be very valuable for many other applications in radiation protection and other scientific fields.

Alteration in volumetric bone mineralization density gradation patterns in mandibular distraction osteogenesis following radiation therapy. The use of mandibular distraction osteogenesis for tissue replacement after oncologic resection or for deformations secondary to radiotherapy could have immense therapeutic ramifications. Radiotherapy, however, drastically impairs bone healing, potentially precluding the use of mandibular distraction osteogenesis as a durable reconstructive option. The authors have previously demonstrated significantly decreased mechanical and histologic metrics of the mandibular distraction osteogenesis regenerate after 36 Gy. The authors' goal is to now investigate the effect of these same radiation dosages on bone densitometrics using micro-computed tomographic scanning. Six Sprague-Dawley rats received 36-Gy fractionated radiotherapy sessions to the left mandible; six received none. All animals had external fixators placed, creation of osteotomies, distraction, and consolidation. Mandibles were scanned with micro-computed tomographic scanning. Volumetric density and microdensitometric measurements were analyzed. There was a significant difference in volumetric bone mineralization patterns in irradiated animals. Bone volume fraction and bone mineral density, however, demonstrated no significant differences. The authors discovered a significant increase of low mineralized, immature bone and a significant decrease of highly mineralized, mature bone in the irradiated regenerate. These findings corroborate the authors' hypothesis that radiation induces a diminution in cell function, impairing optimal bone regeneration. Overall densitometrics, however, were unchanged according to micro-computed tomographic measurements, despite documented significant changes in biomechanical and histologic metrics. An optimal radiation dose must now be sought that demonstrates a higher degree of reproducible degradation, but not irreversible destruction, in all three outcomes. Such an approach will allow formulation of therapeutic interventions designed to enhance mandibular distraction osteogenesis so that it may be used as a viable reconstructive option.

Environmental and genetic factors associated with congenital microtia: a case-control study in Jiangsu, China, 2004 to 2007.

Viability and growth characteristics of Lactobacillus in soymilk supplemented with B-vitamins. Ten strains of Lactobacillus were evaluated for their viability in soymilk. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314, L. acidophilus FTDC 8833, L. acidophilus FTDC 8633 and L. gasseri FTDC 8131 displayed higher viability in soymilk and were thus selected to be evaluated for viability and growth characteristics in soymilk supplemented with B-vitamins. Pour plate analyses showed that the supplementation of all B-vitamins studied promoted the growth of lactobacilli to a viable count exceeding 7 log CFU/ml. alpha-Galactosidase specific activity of lactobacilli as determined spectrophotometrically showed an increase upon supplementation of B-vitamins. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that this led to increased hydrolysis of soy oligosaccharides and subsequently higher utilization of simple sugars. Production of organic acids as determined via high-performance liquid chromatography also showed an increase, accompanied by a decrease in pH of soymilk. Additionally, the supplementation of B-vitamins also promoted the synthesis of riboflavin and folic acid by lactobacilli in soymilk. Our results indicated that B-vitamin-supplemented soymilk is a good proliferation medium for strains of lactobacilli.

A rare case of pulmonary cryptococcal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. In a recent outbreak in British Columbia (BC), Canada, Cryptococcus gattii, a rare species of Cryptococcus, was noted to affect primarily immunocompetent hosts and cause limited pulmonary or CNS disease. We herein report a rare case of a pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor caused by a Cryptococcus infection, presumed to be of the gattii species, in a 20-year-old immunocompetent college student from Vancouver, BC who presented with a large lung mass. The diagnosis was first made on the fine needle aspirate (FNA) material and was confirmed on the concurrent histologic core biopsy. Cryptococcal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors have been reported, but neither in the lung nor in the setting of an immunocompetent host. Pulmonary cryptococcosis should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of a lung mass, even in an immunocompetent host, especially if the clinical history reveals recent travel to British Columbia where Cryptococcus gattii is endemic.

Contrasting species-environment relationships in communities of testate amoebae, bryophytes and vascular plants along the fen-bog gradient. We studied the vegetation, testate amoebae and abiotic variables (depth of the water table, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca and Mg concentrations of water extracted from mosses) along the bog to extremely rich fen gradient in sub-alpine peatlands of the Upper Engadine (Swiss Alps). Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate amoebae and in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bog but for vascular plants in extremely rich fen. Multiple factor and redundancy analyses (RDA) revealed a stronger correlation of testate amoebae than of vegetation to water table and hydrochemical variables and relatively strong correlation between testate amoeba and moss community data. In RDA, hydrochemical variables explained a higher proportion of the testate amoeba and moss data than water table depth. Abiotic variables explained a higher percentage of the species data for testate amoebae (30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than for mosses (13.4%) and vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) vascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently to ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate amoebae are more strongly related than vascular plants to the abiotic factors at the mire surface. These differences are related to vertical trophic gradients and associated niche differentiation.

Physical dating aggression growth during adolescence. The development of Physical Dating Aggression from the age of 16 to 18 years was investigated in relation to time-invariant predictors (gender, parental education, family composition, number of partners) and to time-varying effects of delinquent behavior and perception of victimization by the partner. The sample consisted of 181 adolescents with a current or past dating relationship. Results showed an average trend of decrease from 16 to 18 years with significant inter-individual variability in intra-individual change across time, suggesting that different trajectories of Physical Dating Aggression among the population can be found. Inter-individual variability can be explained by background variables representing a distal risk on Dating Aggression at 16 years (mother's education, precocious dating experience), and by time-varying effect of delinquent behavior and perception of partner perpetration. These latter variables can act as snares (Moffitt 1993), representing mechanisms responsible for prolonging the otherwise normative pattern of decrease of Physical Dating Aggression.

Cytosine DNA methylation (mC) is a genome modification that can regulate the expression of coding and non-coding genetic elements. However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly DCL3a-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in Arabidopsis revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress. 


Effect of temperature and cultivar on polyphenol retention and mass transfer during osmotic dehydration of apples.

Src kinase participates in LPS-induced activation of NADPH oxidase. The production of superoxide from NADPH oxidase by macrophages in response to endotoxin (LPS) is an important innate immune response, yet it is not clear how LPS signals the activation of NADPH oxidase. The hypothesis is that LPS-induced src kinase and PI3 kinase (PI3K) facilitates the activation of p47(phox), the regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase. In mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, inhibition of src tyrosine family kinases inhibited LPS-induced activation of NADPH oxidase, phosphorylation of p47(phox), activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of the TLR4. Moreover, inhibition of LPS-induced increases in intracellular calcium blunted src kinase activation, PI3K association with TLR4, as well as PI3 kinase activation. These data suggest that both src kinase and PI3 kinase are involved in LPS-induced NADPH oxidase activation. Importantly, these data suggest that LPS-induced src kinase activation is critical for PI3 kinase activation as well as TLR4 phosphorylation and is dependent upon LPS-induced increase in intracellular calcium. These signaling events fill critical gaps in our understanding of LPS-induced free radical production as well as may potentially responsible for the mechanism of innate immune tolerance or desensitization caused by steroids or ethanol.

Integrated proteomic analysis of human cancer cells and plasma from tumor bearing mice for ovarian cancer biomarker discovery. The complexity of the human plasma proteome represents a substantial challenge for biomarker discovery. Proteomic analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and isolated cancer cells and cell lines provide alternative methods for identification of potential cancer markers that would be detectable in human blood using sensitive assays. The goal of this work is to evaluate the utility of an integrative strategy using these two approaches for biomarker discovery. We investigated a strategy that combined quantitative plasma proteomics of an ovarian cancer mouse model with analysis of proteins secreted or shed by human ovarian cancer cells. Of 106 plasma proteins identified with increased levels in tumor bearing mice, 58 were also secreted or shed from ovarian cancer cells. The remainder consisted primarily of host-response proteins. Of 25 proteins identified in the study that were assayed, 8 mostly secreted proteins common to mouse plasma and human cancer cells were significantly upregulated in a set of plasmas from ovarian cancer patients. Five of the eight proteins were confirmed to be upregulated in a second independent set of ovarian cancer plasmas, including in early stage disease. Integrated proteomic analysis of cancer mouse models and human cancer cell populations provides an effective approach to identify potential circulating protein biomarkers.

Last-observation-carried-forward imputation method in clinical efficacy trials: review of 352 antidepressant studies.

Variability of action potential duration in pharmacologically induced long QT syndrome type 1. Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a congenital disorder associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. LQT1, a type of LQTS affecting the slow delayed rectifier potassium current, shows a higher incidence of arrhythmia associated with sympathetic stimulation than other types of LQTS. LQT1 patients show increased variability of repolarization with epinephrine infusion, as measured from the 12-lead ECG. We investigate the variability of repolarization measured as action potential duration (APD) in the rabbit left ventricle: how APD variability is affected by pacing rate, transmural location, LQT1 induced by chromanol 293b, and epinephrine infusion. Chromanol preferentially changes APD variability in the midwall. Infusing epinephrine returns the variability to near-control levels. These results differ substantially from clinical studies and show the need for further study.

Identification of Riemerella anatipestifer genes differentially expressed in infected duck livers by the selective capture of transcribed sequences technique. Riemerella anatipestifer is the causative agent of duck septicaemia. Determination of R. anatipestifer virulence mechanisms will help us to effectively control this contagious agent. The differentially expressed gene profile of R. anatipestifer in infected duck livers was therefore identified and compared with in vitro cultures by selective capture of transcribed sequences analysis. A total of 48 genes were identified, of which 43 were genes that encode enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, intermediary metabolism, and energy metabolism, or proteins for regulatory adaptive responses, general microbial stress response, transport proteins and secreted proteinases. Five were unknown, novel genes. Eight genes representing the categories were randomly chosen and verified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. All were upregulated by R. anatipestifer in infected duck livers, with changes ranging from 1.44-fold to 4.62-fold compared with in vitro cultures. The results from the present study revealed a gene expression profile of R. anatipestifer in infected duck livers. The unknown but novel genes may be potential novel virulence factors for R. anatipestifer. In conclusion, the data from this study will provide a molecular basis for further study of R. anatipestifer pathogenesis.

Erwinia iniecta sp. nov., isolated from Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia). Short, Gram-negative-staining, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from crushed bodies of Russian wheat aphid [Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)] and artificial diets after Russian wheat aphid feeding. Based on multilocus sequence analysis involving the 16S rRNA, atpD, infB, gyrB and rpoB genes, these bacterial isolates constitute a novel clade in the genus Erwinia, and were most closely related to Erwinia toletana. Representative distinct strains within this clade were used for comparisons with related species of Erwinia. Phenotypic comparisons using four distinct strains and average nucleotide identity (ANI) measurements using two distinct draft genomes revealed that these strains form a novel species within the genus Erwinia. The name Erwinia iniecta sp. nov. is proposed, and strain B120T ( = CFBP 8182T = NCCB 100485T) was designated the type strain. Erwinia iniecta sp. nov. was not pathogenic to plants. However, virulence to the Russian wheat aphid was observed.

Ten-year time course of risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness: the Hoorn Study. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) is a measure of atherosclerosis. Levels of vascular risk factors that are associated with increased IMT change over time. This study aimed to examine the time course of vascular risk factors in older persons with 'high' versus 'low' IMT over a 10-year period. The Hoorn Study is a population-based cohort study on glucose metabolism and vascular disease initiated in 1989. Carotid IMT was assessed in 2000-2001 (n = 581) and in 2005-2007 (n = 261). The time course of vascular risk factors from 1989 to 2000-2001 of the group with the highest tertile of IMT in 2000-2001 was compared with the group with the lowest tertile of IMT with linear mixed models, adjusted for age, sex, and medication use. A similar analysis was performed for change in IMT between the 2000-2001 and 2005-2007 examinations. Persons in the highest tertile of IMT at follow-up (2000-2001) had a higher waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels at baseline (1989) than persons in the lowest tertile. Both groups showed a similar increase in weight, blood pressure and glucose levels over time, but persons in the highest tertile of IMT showed a greater decrease in lipid levels. None of the risk factors were associated with change in IMT over 5 years. Persons with increased carotid IMT had an unfavourable risk factor profile throughout the preceding decade. This provides a window of opportunity for early prevention of atherosclerosis.


Statistical design for a small serial dilution series.

Identification of high-affinity VEGFR3-binding peptides through a phage-displayed random peptide library. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) interaction with its receptor, VEGFR-3/Flt-4, regulates lymphangiogenesis. VEGFR-3/Flt-4 expression in cancer cells has been correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and lymphatic invasion. The objective of this study is to identify a VEGFR-3/Flt-4-interacting peptide that could be used to inhibit VEGFR-3 for ovarian cancer therapy. The extracellular fragment of recombinant human VEGFR-3/Flt-4 (rhVEGFR-3/Flt-4) fused with coat protein pIII was screened against a phage-displayed random peptide library. Using affinity enrichment and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening, positive clones of phages were amplified. Three phage clones were selected after four rounds of biopanning, and the specific binding of the peptides to rhVEGFR-3 was detected by ELISA and compared with that of VEGF-D. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses of ovarian cancer tissue sections was undertaken to demonstrate the specificity of the peptides. After four rounds of biopanning, ELISA confirmed the specificity of the enriched bound phage clones for rhVEGFR-3. Sequencing and translation identified three different peptides. Non-competitive ELISA revealed that peptides I, II, and III had binding affinities for VEGFR-3 with K(aff) (affinity constant) of 16.4±8.6 μg/mL (n=3), 9.2±2.1 μg/mL (n=3), and 174.8±31.1 μg/mL (n=3), respectively. In ovarian carcinoma tissue sections, peptide III (WHWLPNLRHYAS), which had the greatest binding affinity, also co-localized with VEGFR-3 in endothelial cells lining lymphatic vessels; its labeling of ovarian tumors in vivo was also confirmed. These finding showed that peptide III has high specificity and activity and, therefore, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to target VEGF-VEGFR-3 signaling for the treatment or diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

Microfluidic in vivo screen identifies compounds enhancing neuronal regeneration. Compound screening is a powerful tool to identify new therapeutic targets, drug leads, and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of biological processes. We report here the results of the first in vivo small-molecule screens for compounds enhancing neuronal regeneration. These screens are enabled by the microfluidic devices we have developed for C. elegans. The devices enable rapid and repeatable animal immobilization which allows high-throughput and precise surgery. Following surgery, animals are exposed to the contents of a small-molecule library and assayed for neuronal regeneration. Using this screening method we have identified several compounds that enhance neural regeneration in vivo.

[Bilateral hydatid bilio-bronchial fistula]. Bilio-bronchial fistula of hydatid origin is a rare but serious complication of hepatic hydatid cyst, the treatment of which is now well established. We report a case of bilateral bilio-bronchial fistula, successfully managed by bilateral thoracotomy with an interval of one week, and complicated by dyspnoea that resolved quickly. If the indication for thoracotomy is indisputable in case of unilateral bilio bronchial fistula, an initial laparotomy should be considered in the case of bilateral bilio-bronchial fistula.

[Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients]. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is associated with mineral and bone disorders and with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite standard treatment, adequate control of all biochemical targets for CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) remains suboptimal and is accomplished only in a minority of patients receiving hemodialysis. New insights into the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the development of new therapeutic agents are offering new possibilities to improve the treatment of this condition in patients with CKD. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of secondary hyperparathyroidism and evidence supporting strategies for its treatment, which is complex and requires multiple interventions. The ''modern'' treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients consists of free-calcium and aluminium phosphate binders, vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs), and calcimimetics, even though calcium- and aluminum-based phosphate binders and calcitriol are not without complications. Additional data are needed to determine the optimal combination of phosphate binders, VDRAs and calcimimetics, and to establish how such therapeutic tools impact on cardiovascular events and survival and whether there are differences between VDRAs and calcimimetics in this respect.


Effect of catalyst shape and etchant composition on etching direction in metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon to fabricate 3D nanostructures.

Modeling posture-dependent leg actuation in sagittal plane locomotion. The spring loaded inverted pendulum template has been shown to accurately model the steady locomotion dynamics of a variety of running animals, and has served as the inspiration for an entire class of dynamic running robots. While the template models the leg dynamics by an energy-conserving spring, insects and animals have structures that dissipate, store and produce energy during a stance phase. Recent investigations into the spring-like properties of limbs, as well as animal response to drop-step perturbations, suggest that animals use their legs to manage energy storage and dissipation, and that this management is important for gait stability. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis of control of the spring loaded inverted pendulum template via changes in the leg touch-down angle to include energy variations during the stance phase. Energy variations are incorporated through leg actuation that varies the force-free leg length during the stance phase, yet maintains qualitatively correct force and velocity profiles. In contrast to the partially asymptotically stable gaits identified in previous analyses, incorporating energy and leg angle variations in this manner produces complete asymptotic stability. Drop-step perturbation simulations reveal that the control strategy is rather robust, with gaits recovering from drops of up to 30% of the nominal hip height.

Estradiol-induced estrogen receptor-alpha trafficking. Estradiol has rapid actions in the CNS that are mediated by membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) and activate cell signaling pathways through interaction with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Membrane-initiated estradiol signaling increases the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that stimulates the synthesis of neuroprogesterone in astrocytes. We used surface biotinylation to demonstrate that ERalpha has an extracellular portion. In addition to the full-length ERalpha [apparent molecular weight (MW), 66 kDa], surface biotinylation labeled an ERalpha-immunoreactive protein (MW, approximately 52 kDa) identified by both COOH- and NH(2)-directed antibodies. Estradiol treatment regulated membrane levels of both proteins in parallel: within 5 min, estradiol significantly increased membrane levels of the 66 and 52 kDa ERalpha. Internalization, a measure of membrane receptor activation, was also increased by estradiol with a similar time course. Continuous treatment with estradiol for 24-48 h reduced ERalpha levels, suggesting receptor downregulation. Estradiol also increased mGluR1a trafficking and internalization, consistent with the proposed ERalpha-mGluR1a interaction. Blocking ER with ICI 182,780 or mGluR1a with LY 367385 prevented ERalpha trafficking to and from the membrane. Estradiol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) flux was also significantly increased at the time of peak ERalpha activation/internalization. These results demonstrate that ERalpha is present in the membrane and has an extracellular portion. Furthermore, membrane levels and internalization of ERalpha are regulated by estradiol and mGluR1a ligands. The pattern of trafficking into and out of the membrane suggests that the changing concentration of estradiol during the estrous cycle regulates ERalpha to augment and then terminate membrane-initiated signaling.

The ageing B cell population: composition and function. Age-related changes in the structure and function of the immune system, collectively termed immunosenescence, result in poor responses to infections, increased susceptibility to cancers and increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. The humoral immune response, maintained by the B cell compartment, has a key role in an effective immune system-not only in producing high affinity antibodies that are crucial for vaccination strategies, but in assisting other components of the immune system in their function. Hence an understanding of B cell immunosenescence in particular is vital in designing strategies to combat the effects of age on immune function. Numerous studies have been undertaken using small animal models in order to understand immunosenescence, and these have contributed greatly to our understanding of the events that underpin impaired immune responses. However, there are key differences between the human and the mouse and a clear understanding of these differences is required when extrapolating from one species to the other. In this article we present an overview of B cell development and summarise current data on age-related B cell changes, at both the population level and at the individual mechanistic level. Areas of similarity and difference between human and mouse models are highlighted.


Reconstruction of hepatic veins by anastomosis with suprahepatic IVC in the posterior mediastinum in living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Peroxiredoxin 6 promotes lung cancer cell invasion by inducing urokinase-type plasminogen activator via p38 kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt. The peroxiredoxin family of peroxidase has six mammalian members (Prx 1-6). Considering their frequent up-regulation in cancer cells, Prxs may contribute to cancer cells' survival in face of oxidative stress. Here, we show that Prx 6 promotes the invasiveness of lung cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the phosphorylation of p38 kinase and Akt, and the protein levels of uPA. Functional studies reveal that these components support Prx 6-induced invasion in the sequence p38 kinase/PI3K, Akt, and uPA. The findings provide a new understanding of the action of Prx 6 in cancer.

[Clinical characteristics and prognosis of very young patients with breast cancer in the southern of China]. Even though most breast cancers occur in postmenopausal women in western countries, age <35 is one of the prognostic factors. This study was to compare the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis between premenopausal breast cancer patients aged of <35 and > or =35 in south China, and to explore the prognostic factors. A total of 905 consecutive premenopausal patients were evaluated, with first diagnosis of breast cancer referred to surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from October 2003 to December 2006. The clinicopathologic factors and the survival rates between the very young group(aged of <35 at diagnosis) and the non-young group(aged of > or =35 at diagnosis) were retrospectively compared. The overall median follow-up time was 27.77 months. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lower (78.0% vs. 89.1%, P<0.001) and the 3-year survival rate relatively lower(94.3% vs. 96.8%, P=0.10) in the very young group than in the non-young group. In addition, the 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were significantly lower in the very young group with HR (hormone receptor)-positive than in the non-young group (P<0.05). The univariate and multivariate analysis of clinicopathologic characteristics between two groups showed that age <35 at diagnosis, axillary lymph node involvement, presence of vascular invasion, and high expression of Ki67 were risk factors for recurrence. Compared with non-young premenopausal patients, very young breast patients with HR-positive cancer have a worse outcome.

Metadata and annotations for multi-scale electrophysiological data. The increasing use of high-frequency (kHz), long-duration (days) intracranial monitoring from multiple electrodes during pre-surgical evaluation for epilepsy produces large amounts of data that are challenging to store and maintain. Descriptive metadata and clinical annotations of these large data sets also pose challenges to simple, often manual, methods of data analysis. The problems of reliable communication of metadata and annotations between programs, the maintenance of the meanings within that information over long time periods, and the flexibility to re-sort data for analysis place differing demands on data structures and algorithms. Solutions to these individual problem domains (communication, storage and analysis) can be configured to provide easy translation and clarity across the domains. The Multi-scale Annotation Format (MAF) provides an integrated metadata and annotation environment that maximizes code reuse, minimizes error probability and encourages future changes by reducing the tendency to over-fit information technology solutions to current problems. An example of a graphical utility for generating and evaluating metadata and annotations for "big data" files is presented.

Lower extremity muscle function after strength or power training in older adults. It is unclear whether strength training (ST) or power training (PT) is the more effective intervention at improving muscle strength and power and physical function in older adults. The authors compared the effects of lower extremity PT with those of ST on muscle strength and power in 45 older adults (74.8 +/- 5.7 yr) with self-reported difficulty in common daily activities. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: PT, ST, or wait-list control. PT and ST trained 3 times/wk for 12 wk using knee-extension (KE) and leg-press (LP) machines at approximately 70% of 1-repetition maximum (1RM). For PT, the concentric phase of the KE and LP was completed "as fast as possible," whereas for ST the concentric phase was 2-3 s. Both PT and ST paused briefly at the midpoint of the movement and completed the eccentric phase of the movement in 2-3 s. PT and ST groups showed significant improvements in KE and LP 1RM compared with the control group. Maximum KE and LP power increased approximately twofold in PT compared with ST. At 12 wk, compared with control, maximum KE and LP power were significantly increased for the PT group but not for the ST group. In older adults with compromised function, PT leads to similar increases in strength and larger increases in power than ST.

Respiratory syncytial virus induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists in BALB/c mice. beta-Adrenergic agonists (beta-agonists) are commonly used to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis but are generally ineffective for unknown reasons. We have previously shown that RSV strain A2 inhibits bronchoalveolar epithelial responses to beta-agonists in a BALB/c mouse model by inducing heterologous keratinocyte cytokine (KC)/CXCR2-mediated desensitization of epithelial beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. The aim of the current study was to determine whether RSV also induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists. Total lung resistance (R) was measured in anesthetized female BALB/c mice undergoing mechanical ventilation on a flexiVent computer-controlled piston ventilator. Data were analyzed using the single-compartment model. Infection with RSV A2 did not induce airway hyperresponsiveness to increasing doses of the nebulized cholinergic agonist methacholine (MCh) at any time point after RSV infection. Prenebulization with the beta-agonist terbutaline (100 muM) significantly attenuated bronchoconstrictive responses to 20 and 50 mg/ml MCh in uninfected mice and in mice infected with RSV 4-8 days postinfection (d.p.i.). However, in mice infected with replication-competent, but not UV-inactivated, RSV for 2 days, significant terbutaline insensitivity was found. Terbutaline insensitivity at 2 d.p.i. could be reversed by systemic preinfection treatment with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 antibodies, which reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil counts but did not alter viral replication, BAL KC levels, or lung edema. Terbutaline insensitivity was also reversed by postinfection nebulization with neutralizing anti-KC or anti-CXCR2 antibodies and could be replicated in normal, uninfected mice by nebulization with recombinant KC. These data suggest that KC/CXCR2-mediated airway insensitivity to beta-agonists may underlie the modest utility of these drugs as bronchodilators in therapy for acute RSV bronchiolitis.

Gene expression profiling during early acute febrile stage of dengue infection can predict the disease outcome. We report the detailed development of biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome under dengue infection. Transcriptional signatures from purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were derived from whole-genome gene-expression microarray data, validated by quantitative PCR and tested in independent samples. The study was performed on patients of a well-characterized dengue cohort from Recife, Brazil. The samples analyzed were collected prospectively from acute febrile dengue patients who evolved with different degrees of disease severity: classic dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) samples were compared with similar samples from other non-dengue febrile illnesses. The DHF samples were collected 2-3 days before the presentation of the plasma leakage symptoms. Differentially-expressed genes were selected by univariate statistical tests as well as multivariate classification techniques. The results showed that at early stages of dengue infection, the genes involved in effector mechanisms of innate immune response presented a weaker activation on patients who later developed hemorrhagic fever, whereas the genes involved in apoptosis were expressed in higher levels. Some of the gene expression signatures displayed estimated accuracy rates of more than 95%, indicating that expression profiling with these signatures may provide a useful means of DHF prognosis at early stages of infection.


Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for glioblastoma multiforme: advantage of prolonged infusion of BPA-f.

Risk factors for clinical coronary heart disease in systemic lupus erythematosus: the lupus and atherosclerosis evaluation of risk (LASER) study. Accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) are recognized complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the exact etiology remains unclear and is likely to be multifactorial. We hypothesized that SLE patients with CHD have increased exposure to traditional risk factors as well as differing disease phenotype and therapy-related factors compared to SLE patients free of CHD. Our aim was to examine risk factors for development of clinical CHD in SLE in the clinical setting. In a UK-wide multicenter retrospective case-control study we recruited 53 SLE patients with verified clinical CHD (myocardial infarction or angina pectoris) and 96 SLE patients without clinical CHD. Controls were recruited from the same center as the case and matched by disease duration. Charts were reviewed up to time of event for cases, or the same "dummy-date" in controls. SLE patients with clinical CHD were older at the time of event [mean (SD) 53 (10) vs 42 (10) yrs; p < 0.001], more likely to be male [11 (20%) vs 3 (7%); p < 0.001], and had more exposure to all classic CHD risk factors compared to SLE patients without clinical CHD. They were also more likely to have been treated with corticosteroids (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.03, 5.88) and azathioprine (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.16, 4.67) and to have evidence of damage on the pre-event SLICC damage index (SDI) (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.09, 4.44). There was no difference between groups with regard to clinical organ involvement or autoantibody profile. Our study highlights the need for clinical vigilance to identify modifiable risk factors in the clinical setting and in particular with male patients. The pattern of organ involvement did not differ in SLE patients with CHD events. However, the higher pre-event SDI, azathioprine exposure, and pattern of damage items (disease-related rather than therapy-related) in cases suggests that a persistent active lupus phenotype contributes to CHD risk. In this regard, corticosteroids and azathioprine may not control disease well enough to prevent CHD. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether classic risk factor modification will have a role in primary prevention of CHD in SLE patients and whether new therapies that control disease activity can better reduce CHD risk.

Digastric olecranon osteotomy: feasibility study of a new approach to the elbow. None of the multiple posterior approaches to the elbow simultaneously satisfies the following three properties: good articular surface exposure, attention to the extensor apparatus continuity and olecranon vascularization. This study aims to describe a new approach to the elbow: digastric olecranon osteotomy. Nine anatomical subjects were prepared. One-third underwent intra-articular digastric osteotomy, one-third extra-articular osteotomy and one-third a vascularization study using arteriography. Digastric olecranon osteotomy, notably intra-articular, offered excellent articular exposure. After restoration, digastric stability was excellent. Olecranon vascularization was preserved using the two variations of digastric olecranon osteotomy. Digastric olecranon osteotomy preserves the principal vascular supply of the olecranon and the continuity of the extensor apparatus. Articular surface exposure is excellent, and the natural coaptation of the digastric enables immediate mobilization without any theoretical risk of deconstruction.

Folate levels modulate oncogene-induced replication stress and tumorigenicity. Chromosomal instability in early cancer stages is caused by replication stress. One mechanism by which oncogene expression induces replication stress is to drive cell proliferation with insufficient nucleotide levels. Cancer development is driven by alterations in both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we investigated whether replication stress can be modulated by both genetic and non-genetic factors and whether the extent of replication stress affects the probability of neoplastic transformation. To do so, we studied the effect of folate, a micronutrient that is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis, on oncogene-induced tumorigenicity. We show that folate deficiency by itself leads to replication stress in a concentration-dependent manner. Folate deficiency significantly enhances oncogene-induced replication stress, leading to increased DNA damage and tumorigenicity in vitro. Importantly, oncogene-expressing cells, when grown under folate deficiency, exhibit a significantly increased frequency of tumor development in mice. These findings suggest that replication stress is a quantitative trait affected by both genetic and non-genetic factors and that the extent of replication stress plays an important role in cancer development.

Scaling up beyond 'pills and skills': preventing parent-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission and the public/private divide in southern India. This paper argues that current HIV/AIDS intervention models in southern India--in particular, those targeting the prevention of parent-to-child transmission (PPTCT)--underutilize the private sector and thereby compromise an efficient integration of HIV/AIDS humanitarian responses into India's health development system. While PPTCT is a critical strategy for curbing the HIV/AIDS epidemic-particularly in countries like India, where prevalence rates among young women are escalating-the cascade of prepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum PPTCT interventions are often difficult for women and spouses to access as a result of socio-cultural, structural and economic obstacles. Recognizing the complex ecologies within which PPTCT interventions must take place, qualitative analysis focussed on current PPTCT gaps in southern India and how healthcare providers and policymakers are moving to scale-up PPTCT by integrating into maternal, child and reproductive health services. Fieldwork highlighted a particularly stark gap in PPTCT delivery-the divide in scale-up efforts between public facilities and the private sector, which provides over 50% of national antenatal services. The private sector often serves as women's first point of healthcare contact, as they will avoid reputably poor-quality public facilities; vulnerable groups (e.g. rural and urban poor, tribal communities) are also seeking out subsidized private care, notably in faith-based facilities. Recognizing the need to revise the current humanitarian and health response, this paper details initial efforts to integrate into private care, with aim to present practitioners' successes, challenges and good practices for use in cross learning and a foundation for future research. This paper's analysis makes recommendations for key PPTCT providers and emphasizes the need to: (a) saturate PPTCT services in the private sector, and (b) strengthen mechanisms for integrating PPTCT across sector (private, public, and civil society) and decentralizing deeper into rural India to access vulnerable women, infants and spouses.


Metabolic conversion of zearalenone to alpha-zearalenol by goat tissues.

Role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in influenza H5N1 virus pneumonia. The severe and often fatal disease in humans and birds caused by H5N1 influenza viruses has been attributed to aberrant pulmonary inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine and a pivotal regulator of innate immunity, in H5N1 influenza virus pneumonia in murine model. We found increased MIF mRNA levels in the lungs and MIF protein levels in the serum of infected mice. Although the inhibition of MIF action by isoxazolone-1 (ISO-1) did not render mice more resistant to the lethality of infection, it caused a significant reduction in pulmonary inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alphalfa) and chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). These results indicate the involvement of MIF in inflammatory responses to H5N1 influenza virus infections by induction of pulmonary inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and suggest that pharmacotherapeutic approaches targeting MIF may hold promise for the treatment of H5N1 influenza virus pneumonia.

Neuronal caspase-3 signaling: not only cell death. Caspases are a family of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases that are highly conserved in multicellular organisms and function as central regulators of apoptosis. A member of this family, caspase-3, has been identified as a key mediator of apoptosis in neuronal cells. Recent studies in snail, fly and rat suggest that caspase-3 also functions as a regulatory molecule in neurogenesis and synaptic activity. In this study, in addition to providing an overview of the mechanism of caspase-3 activation, we review genetic and pharmacological studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic functions of caspase-3 and discuss the regulatory mechanism of caspase-3 for executing nonapoptotic functions in the central nervous system. Knowledge of biochemical pathway(s) for nonapoptotic activation and modulation of caspase-3 has potential implications for the understanding of synaptic failure in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Fine-tuning of caspase-3 lays down a new challenge in identifying pharmacological avenues for treatment of many neurological disorders.

Feasibility and effects of preventive home visits for at-risk older people: design of a randomized controlled trial.

Errors in imaging the pregnant patient with acute abdomen. Pregnant women with an acute abdomen present a critical issue due to the necessity for an immediate diagnosis and treatment; in fact, a diagnostic delay could worsen the outcome for both the mother and the fetus. There is evidence that emergencies during pregnancy are subject to mismanagement; however, the percentage of errors in the diagnosis of emergencies in pregnancy has not been studied in depth. The purpose of this article is to review the most common imaging error emergencies. The topics covered are divided into gynecological and non-gynecological entities and, for each pathology, possible errors have been dealt with in the diagnostic pathway, the possible technical errors in the exam execution, and finally the possible errors in the interpretation of the images. These last two entities are often connected owing to a substandard examination, which can cause errors in the interpretation. Consequently, the systemization of errors reduces the possibility of reoccurrences in the future by providing a valid approach in helping to learn from these errors.

The role of the metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 in melanoma angiogenesis. The tetraspan protein KAI1 (CD82) has been previously shown to have important roles in cell migration, invasion, and melanoma prognosis. In this study, we investigated the role of KAI1 regarding melanoma angiogenesis. KAI1 overexpression strongly suppressed the growth of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells and their tubular structure formation in vitro. Also, KAI1 was able to inhibit both interleukin-6 (IL-6) and VEGF at mRNA and protein levels. Using nude mice in the in vivo study, we showed that KAI1, through the regulation of ING4, inhibited blood vessel formation in matrigel plugs along with the downregulation of IL-6 and VEGF, and the recruitment of CD31-positive cells. Finally, we found that KAI1 was able to suppress the activity of a serine/threonine kinase Akt by suppressing Akt phosphorylation (Ser473). Taken together, our results suggested that KAI1 was able to suppress melanoma angiogenesis by downregulating IL-6 and VEGF expression, and the restoration of KAI1 functionality offered a new approach in human melanoma treatment. 

Relationship between boys' normative beliefs about aggression and their physical, verbal, and indirect aggressive behaviors. This study examined the contribution of general normative beliefs about aggression and specific normative beliefs about retaliatory aggression in predicting physical, verbal, and indirect aggressive behaviors. Two hundred and forty-nine Grade 4 and Grade 5 boys completed the Normative Beliefs about Aggression Scale (NOBAGS) and provided self-reports on the frequency of their physical, verbal, and indirect aggressive behaviors. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that general normative beliefs about aggression contributed significantly in predicting all three types of aggressive behaviors. When general normative beliefs about aggression were controlled for, specific normative beliefs about retaliatory aggression against males but not specific normative beliefs about retaliatory aggression against females, contributed significantly to predict physical, verbal, and indirect aggressive behaviors. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.

Analytical method, pattern and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the stone of the Temples of Agrigento (Italy). This study shows the extraction and analytical conditions for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the stone of archaeological and historical interest. The aim of this research was to determine the concentrations, distribution and the main sources of PAHs present in the surface layer of stone of the Temples of Agrigento. Together with PAHs, we analyzed sulphates and nitrates since it has been demonstrated that these are very destructive salts that play an important role in the deterioration of stones. Total PAHs at different sites of the Valley of Temples at Agrigento varied from 18 to 84 microg/kg. Analyses were performed by GC-MS. The relative abundance of molecular weight PAHs, together with the PAHs compound ratios and supported by the total index (by us proposed), demonstrate that the most samples in Hellenistic Agrigento historical buildings owe their PAHs to a predominant single mode of origin, i.e. anthropogenic combustion processes. The same origin of PAHs pollution was confirmed by the good correlations existing between total PAHs concentrations and the content of sulphates and nitrates of the analyzed samples.

An analysis of the palliative care education needs of RGNs and HCAs in nursing homes in Ireland. To identify the palliative care education needs of registered general nurses (RGNs) and health-care assistants (HCAs) working in care of the older person units (nursing homes). A questionnaire was sent to all RGNs and HCAs working in nursing homes run by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in one health-care region in Ireland. RGNs identified eight specific educational needs: understanding of the dying process; pain and symptom management; improved communication skills; nutritional assessment issues; practical skills; the appropriate use and management of syringe drivers; and the role of complementary therapies. HCAs identified a need to improve their communication skills and clarify their role. Both groups identified the need for support when caring for dying patients and the need to improve their understanding of palliative care and the role of specialist palliative care (SPC) services. There was a significant difference between the RGNs' and the HCAs' level of understanding of palliative care (P = 0.00). This study demonstrated that RGNs and HCAs working in care of the older person settings have palliative care educational needs. It also established a difference in the educational background and palliative care understanding of RGNs and HCAs. This study therefore identified the need to develop separate education programmes.

Update of HPV-associated female genital cancers in the United States, 1999-2004. In 2008, CDC published a supplement to the journal Cancer describing incidence patterns of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers prior to availability of an HPV vaccine. This report updates the information on HPV-associated female genital cancer incidence with more recent data, adds information on trends, and includes American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. We used combined data from two federal cancer surveillance programs, CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, covering 92% of the U.S. population from 1999 to 2004, to examine recent trends and incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma and vaginal and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Incidence of in situ vaginal and vulvar SCC are also presented. The average annual age-adjusted rate of cervical cancer among women of all races/ethnicities was 8.5/100,000. Annual cervical cancer incidence rates were highest but declined more rapidly among Hispanic and black women compared with non-Hispanic and white women. The rate of vulvar cancer among all women was 1.7/100,000 and was higher among white women than other racial groups. Vulvar cancer rates rose among black women (+2.9% per year) and were relatively stable among all other racial and ethnic groups over the 6-year period. Vaginal cancer was rare (rate 0.5/100,000); the rate was higher among black women than other racial groups and higher among Hispanic women than among non-Hispanic women. A significant decline of vaginal cancer was observed only among black women (-6.2% per year). This article confirms previous findings on racial disparities in HPV-associated female genital cancers. Any post-HPV vaccine declines in these cancers should be interpreted in light of current declines. Enhancing current cancer surveillance systems, combined with special studies to collect data on in situ or precancerous lesions of these cancers, will provide important information in determining the potential impact of the HPV vaccine.

Utero-adnexal damage in septic abortion. Histopathological study on 91 cases. Septic abortion represents the main causes of abortion-induced maternal death. Hysterectomy may represent a beneficial therapeutic solution for septic abortion, nevertheless with irreversible effects on a woman's reproductive condition. The study analyzes the anatomopathological damage found in ninety-one patients hospitalized for septic abortion. The patients were admitted to the "Dr. D. Popescu" Clinical Hospital, Timisoara, between 1980-1989 and 1999-2008; hysterectomy was performed in all the cases to eliminate uterine sepsis responsible for the emerging complications.

Purple nonsulfur bacteria diversity in activated sludge and its potential phosphorus-accumulating ability under different cultivation conditions. This study investigates the diversity and the potential phosphorus-accumulating ability among the purple nonsulfur (PNS) bacteria. Traditional methods and molecular biotechniques were applied. Microscopic visualization using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining as well as chemical analysis demonstrated that most of the isolated PNS bacteria presented different levels of phosphorus accumulation. Four of the pure cultures, denoted as Rhodopseudomonas palustris CC1, CC7, G11, and GE1, based on their differences in the PNS's pufM gene, exhibited higher internal phosphorus content compared to other isolated strains in this study. In addition, substantial polyphosphate accumulation was observed after the bacteria entered their stationary growth phase. Among them, the isolated R. palustris G11 could accumulate internal phosphorus up to 13%-15% of its cell dry weight under anaerobic illuminated incubation conditions. When the incubation status was switched from anaerobic to aerobic, the bacterial phosphorus content had a tendency to decrease slightly or remain about the same throughout the whole aerobic stage. The growth rate and biomass were higher when the PNS bacteria grew under photoheterotrophic conditions rather than the chemoheterotrophic ones. Furthermore, the environmental pH value could affect the contents of internal bacterial phosphate. Results of this study demonstrated that PNS bacteria are a group of the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, of which this ability had never been properly studied. The conditions that PNS bacteria accumulating polyphosphate presented from this study were unique and showed characteristics that were different from the well-known enhanced biological phosphorus removal model.

Relationship between cigarette smoking and human papilloma virus types 16 and 18 DNA load. Although cigarette smoking has been associated with increased human papilloma virus (HPV) detection, its impact on HPV DNA load is unknown. The study subjects were women who were positive for HPV16 and/or HPV18 at enrollment into the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance-Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study. Assessments of exposure to smoke and sexual behavior were based on self-report. Viral genome copies per nanogram of cellular DNA were measured by multiplex real-time PCR. Linear or logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between cigarette smoking and baseline viral load. Of the 1,050 women (752 with HPV16, 258 with HPV18, and 40 with both HPV16 and HPV18), 452 (43.0%) were current smokers and 101 (9.6%) were former smokers at enrollment. The baseline viral load was statistically significantly greater for current compared with never smokers (P = 0.03 for HPV16; P = 0.02 for HPV18) but not for former smokers. Among current smokers, neither HPV16 nor HPV18 DNA load seemed to vary appreciably by age at smoking initiation, smoking intensity, or smoking duration. The results remained similar when the analysis of smoking-related HPV16 DNA load was restricted to women without detectable cervical abnormality. Higher baseline HPV16 and HPV18 DNA load was associated with status as a current but not former smoker. A lack of dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and viral load may indicate a low threshold for the effect of smoking on HPV DNA load.

[Pharmacological activities of Z-ligustilide and metabolites in rats]. To study the metabolism of Z-ligustilide(Z-LIG) in vivo and in vitro in rats and the pharmacological activities of Z-LIG and metabolites in vitro. The biotransformation of Z-LIG in rats in vivo was tested. Z-LIG was also incubated with rat liver microsomes in vitro. The incubated product was extracted, separated and identified with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and UV. The effects of Z-LIG and its main metabolites on hydrogen peroxide (H1O2)-induced injuries were examined in cultured PC12 cells. The HPLC analysis of the metabolites of Z-LIG was obtained. Senkyunolide I (SYL) isolated from in vitro incubation was identified as the main metabolite of Z-LIG. Both Z-LIG and SYL showed significant and concentration-dependent protection against H2O2-induced injuries in PC12 cells. SYL is the main metabolite of Z-LIG in rats. Z-LIG and SYL exert similar protective effects against oxidative damage in cultured PC12 cells.

Effects of arginine vasotocin and mesotocin on the activation and development of amiloride-blockable short-circuit current across larval, adult, and cultured larval bullfrog skins. Amphibian skin has osmoregulatory functions, with Na(+) crossing from outside to inside. Na(+) transport can be measured as the short-circuit current (SCC). We investigated the short-term and long-term effects of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MT) (which modulate Na(+) transport) on the activation and development of an amiloride-blockable SCC (adult-type feature) in larval, adult, and corticoid-cultured larval bullfrog skins. We found: (1) AVT-receptor (AVT-R) and MT-receptor (MT-R) mRNAs could be detected in both larval and adult skins, (2) in the short term (within 60 min), the larval SCC (amiloride-stimulated SCC) was increased by AVT, forskolin, and MT, suggesting that AVT and MT did not activate the inactive ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) protein thought to be expressed in larval skin, (3) in the short term (within 90 min), AVT, forskolin, and MT stimulated the adult SCC (amiloride-blockable SCC), (4) AVT and MT increased both the larval and adult SCC via receptors insensitive to OPC-21268 (an antagonist of the V(1)-type receptor), OPC-31260 (an antagonist of the V(2)-type receptor), and ([d(CH(2))(5),Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Orn(8),des-Gly-NH (2) (9) ]VT) (an antagonist of the oxytocin receptor), (5) culturing EDTA-treated larval skin with corticoids supplemented with AVT (1 microM) or MT (1 microM) for 2 weeks (long-term effects of AVT and MT) did not alter the corticoid-induced development of an amiloride-blockable SCC (adult-type feature). AVT and MT thus have the potential to stimulate SCC though channels that are already expressed, but they may not influence the development of the amiloride-blockable SCC (an adult-type feature) in larval skin.

Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus in sub-Saharan Africa: The journey so far and what remains to be done. This review was carried out to provide a comprehensive overview of efforts toward elimination of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with respect to progress, challenges, and recommendations in 21 sub-Saharan African priority countries. We reviewed literature published from 2011 to April 2015 using 3 databases; PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as the 2014 Global Plan Progress Report. A total of 39 studies were included. Between 2009 and 2013, there was a 43% reduction in new HIV infections, the final MTCT rate was reduced from 28% to 18%, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage increased from 11% to 24%. Challenges included poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, poor linkage between mother-child pairs and post-natal healthcare services low early infant diagnosis coverage, low pediatric ART coverage, and high unmet needs for contraceptive services. Future recommendations include identification of key barriers, health system strengthening, strengthening community involvement, and international collaboration. There has been significant progress toward eliminating MTCT of HIV, but more effort is still needed.

[Sodium ferulate treatment and interventional mechanism reverse erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats]. To investigate the effect and mechanism of sodium ferulate (SF) on reversing erectile dysfunction in diabetes mellitus (DM) rats. Forty-four male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were induced for diabetes by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Then the successful models were randomly divided into DM + SF group and DM group (22 rats each respectively). The rats in DM +SF group were treated with sodium ferulate (100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) through a daily gastric lavage. At Week 12, the erectile function of all rats was evaluated and serum samples were harvested. The SOD, CAT, NOS, MDA and NO levels in corpus cavernosum and serum were all measured. The pathologic change in penile cavernous body was observed microscopically. The diabetic rat models were successfully established. The erectile function was much better in normal control group and DM + SF group than that in DM group. And the penile erection rates in three groups were 100%, 66% and 22% respectively. The activity levels of SOD, CAT and NOS were markedly decreased in DM group as compared to those in normal control group and DM + SF group (P < 0.01). The NO content was approximately equal in normal control group and DM + SF group (112 +/- 28) nmol/ml vs (137 +/- 25) nmol/ml. But both were much higher than that in DM group (56 +/- 10) nmol/ml, both P < 0.01. The MDA content was markedly increased in DM group as compared to those in normal control group and DM + SF group (both P < 0.01). Microscopically, muscle fibers in penile cavernous body arranged disorderly, muscular mantle damaged and desmoplasia scattered among muscle fibers in DM group. Sodium ferulate may play interventional roles in reversing diabetic erectile dysfunction through metabolic regulation of free radicals, antagonism of oxidative insults and enhancement of NO production.

Excessive Body Weight in Older Adults. The health challenges prompted by obesity in the older adult population are poorly recognized and understudied. A defined treatment of geriatric obesity is difficult to establish, as it must take into account biological heterogeneity, age-related comorbidities, and functional limitations (sarcopenia/dynapenia). This retrospective article highlights the current understanding of the optimal body mass index (BMI) in later life, addressing appropriate recommendations based on BMI category, age, and health history. The findings of randomized control trials of weight loss/maintenance interventions help one to move closer to evidence-based and appropriately individualized recommendations for body weight management in older adults.

Resveratrol down-regulates survivin and induces apoptosis in human multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/CDDP cells. We studied the effect of resveratrol treatment on multidrug-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Human multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/CDDP cells were treated with resveratrol at a concentration of 25, 50, or 100 microM in in vitro studies and nude mice were implanted with multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/and fed a special diet that included resveratrol at a dose of either 1 g/kg/day or 3 g/kg/day in in vivo studies. No adverse toxicological effects of resveratrol treatment were observed. The rate of cell proliferation, apoptosis ratio, cell cycle phase distribution, IC50 values of cisplatin, gefitinib, and paclitaxel, implanted tumour volume, and expression of survivin in resveratrol-treated and control mice were then determined. Resveratrol significantly inhibited the proliferation of SPC-A-1/CDDP cells, induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle phase between G0-G1 and S phase or at the G2/M phase, decreased the IC50 values of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, and showed anti-tumour effects in nude mice that had been implanted with SPC-A-1/CDDP cells. In additional, resveratrol affected the proliferation of SPC-A-1/CDDP cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Expression of survivin in SPC-A-1/CDDP cells decreased after they were treated with all concentrations of resveratrol and resveratrol was also found to have a dose-dependent effect on survivin expression. Resveratrol can induce apoptosis in multidrug-resistant human NSCLC SPC-A-1/CDDP cells by down-regulating the expression of survivin.

No perinatal HIV-1 transmission from women with effective antiretroviral therapy starting before conception. The efficacy of preventing perinatal transmission (PT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) depends on both viral load (VL) and treatment duration. The objective of this study was to determine whether initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) before conception has the potential to eliminate PT. A total of 8075 HIV-infected mother/infant pairs included from 2000 to 2011 in the national prospective multicenter French Perinatal Cohort (ANRS-EPF) received ART, delivered live-born children with determined HIV infection status, and did not breastfeed. PT was analyzed according to maternal VL at delivery and timing of ART initiation. The overall rate of PT was 0.7% (56 of 8075). No transmission occurred among 2651 infants born to women who were receiving ART before conception, continued ART throughout the pregnancy, and delivered with a plasma VL <50 copies/mL (upper 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1%). VL and timing of ART initiation were independently associated with PT in logistic regression. Regardless of VL, the PT rate increased from 0.2% (6 of 3505) for women starting ART before conception to 0.4% (3 of 709), 0.9% (24 of 2810), and 2.2% (23 of 1051) for those starting during the first, second, or third trimester (P < .001). Regardless of when ART was initiated, the PT rate was higher for women with VLs of 50-400 copies/mL near delivery than for those with <50 copies/mL (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.9-8.2). Perinatal HIV-1 transmission is virtually zero in mothers who start ART before conception and maintain suppression of plasma VL.

Histological changes in the cerebelli of adult wistar rats exposed to cigarette smoke. The different constituents of tobacco smoke have been linked to different diseased conditions. In this work, the histological effects of cigarette smoke on the cerebellum of adult male Wistar rats were studied. Sixteen Wistar rats with mean weight of 153.24 ± 4.12 g were grouped equally into four. The Control Group A was exposed to fresh air, while Groups B, C and D animals were each exposed to smoke from one, two and three sticks of cigarette respectively. Each stick of cigarette was completely consumed within an average duration of 11 minutes. Improvised smoking chambers were constructed and used for the exposure daily, while treatment lasted for 28 days. The animals were thereafter sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the cranium was exposed and the brain gently removed and weighed; the cerebellum was excised, weighed, and fixed in formol calcium, and subsequently processed for histological observation using the Haematoxylin and Eosin staining principle. Loss of weight and reduction in weight gain were noticed in the treatment groups, with corresponding reduction in cerebellar weights, in a dose-dependent pattern. Histology also revealed loss of white matter, reduction in thickness of cell layers and their cellular components. Increasing dosage of cigarette smoke could predispose to progressive compromise in the structural integrity and composition of the cerebellum, and this might result in cerebellar dysfunction.

Robust features for 2-DE gel image registration. Proteomics is a rapidly growing field of modern biology. Since quantitative data of proteins involved in dynamic processes of living organisms are essential for understanding the basics of life, techniques like 2-DE and related procedures for automatic data interpretation are at the heart of this research field. They are strongly required to enable analysis and interpretation of the emerging amount of available data. Analyzing and interpreting gel image data usually requires the comparison of gels from different experiments and, thus, a prior registration of gels. This can be accomplished using featureless, feature-based or hybrid registration approaches combining both techniques. Recently, the latter ones have shown high performance, and it is undoubtful that in general robust and reliable features are an essential ingredient and valuable source of information for high-quality image registration. In this paper we provide a thorough overview and elaborate analysis of the capabilities of available feature detectors for gel image registration. Particularly, a detailed and extensive comparative study is presented where common spot-specific detectors are included as well as image-content independent detectors that were not applied to the task of gel image registration until now. The study incorporates tests on several thousand synthetically deformed images from different experimental conditions. As a result it provides valuable quantitative data allowing for direct objective comparisons of various detectors, and is well suited to guide the design of new registration algorithms.

Intraspecies transmission of L-type-like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy detected in Japan. It has been assumed that the agent causing BSE in cattle is a uniform strain (classical BSE); however, different neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of BSE (atypical BSE) have been recently reported. We demonstrated the successful transmission of L-type-like atypical BSE detected in Japan (BSE/JP24 isolate) to cattle. Based on the incubation period, neuropathological hallmarks, and molecular properties of the abnormal host prion protein, the characteristics of BSE/JP24 prion were apparently distinguishable from the classical BSE prion and closely resemble those of bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy prion detected in Italy.

Intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction: the Robert Wood Johnson experience. Bupivacaine anesthetic is commonly used as a wetting solution additive in tumescent liposuction, but its routine use remains controversial because of a lack of evidence in the current literature. In accordance with local institutional review board regulations, a retrospective chart review was conducted of liposuction cases performed from 1997 to 2007 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The primary endpoint was adverse perioperative events. Secondary endpoints included length of postanesthesia care unit stay and length of total postoperative hospital stay. Eighty-seven cases were analyzed and two subsets of patients were identified. In group 1, 24 patients were compared who underwent liposuction as the primary procedure and received bupivacaine, lidocaine, or no additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events were encountered and the average length of stay was not significantly different. In group 2, 20 patients were compared who underwent abdominoplasty and liposuction and received bupivacaine or no additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events occurred and patients receiving bupivacaine had a significantly shorter average length of stay, 19 hours versus 36 hours, compared with controls (p = 0.015). A review of the experience at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital reveals that the intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction in 27 cases appeared to be as safe as other tumescent additives. There did not appear to be a significant difference in the incidence of adverse events or postoperative length of stay for patients who underwent liposuction with bupivacaine compared with other wetting solutions. Among a subset of patients who underwent concurrent abdominoplasty and liposuction procedures, patients who received bupivacaine spent significantly less time in the hospital postoperatively than those who did not receive it. Conducting future prospective studies involving larger samples among multiple centers is an essential next step to confirm these findings.

Noise induced hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in the guinea pig. This study analysed the acoustic and vestibular functional and morphological modifications in guinea pigs after acoustic trauma. Animals were exposed to noise (6 kHz, at 120 dB SPL for 60 minutes) and then auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) were measured at 6 hours, 1 day, 3, 7, and 21 days after noise. Western blotting and immunostaining for 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (4-HNE) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were performed in the cochlear and vestibular regions at 1 and 7 days after noise exposure. A significant decrease of VOR gain was observed on day 1 and the recovery was completed at day 21. ABR threshold values reached a level of 80 dB at day 1 after trauma reaching a value of about 50 dB SPL on day 21. 4-HNE expression, a marker of lipid peroxidation was strongly increased in the cochlea. In the vestibule, 4-HNE immunoreactivity was faint. However, VEGF was up-regulated both in the cochlea and vestibule. In conclusion, the expression of VEGF in both cochlear and vestibular structures suggests a reparative role with potentially therapeutic implications.

The t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1 translocation in MALT lymphomas contains templated nucleotide insertions and a major breakpoint region similar to follicular and mantle cell lymphoma. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) and the MALT1 gene is a recurrent abnormality in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. However, the nucleotide sequence of only one t(14;18)-positive MALT lymphoma has been reported so far. We here report the molecular characterization of the IGH-MALT1 fusion products in 5 new cases of t(14;18)-positive MALT lymphomas. Similar to the IGH-associated translocations in follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, the IGH-MALT1 junctions in MALT lymphoma showed all features of a recombination signal sequence-guided V(D)J-mediated translocation at the IGH locus. Furthermore, analogous to follicular and mantle cell lymphoma, templated nucleotides (T-nucleotides) were identified at the t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 breakpoint junctions. On chromosome 18, we identified a novel major breakpoint region in MALT1 upstream of its coding region. Moreover, the presence of duplications of MALT1 nucleotides in one case suggests an underlying staggered DNA-break process not consistent with V(D)J-mediated recombination. The molecular characteristics of the t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 resemble those found in the t(14;18)/IGH-BCL2 in follicular lymphoma and t(11;14)/CCND1-IGH in mantle cell lymphoma, suggesting that these translocations could be generated by common pathomechanisms involving illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination on IGH as well as new synthesis of T-nucleotides and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative NHEJ repair pathways on the IGH-translocation partner.

[Genetics of inherited cardiomyopathies]. Hereditary cardiomyopathy is a primitive disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of any other cause of cardiomyopathy. They are separated into four phenotypic groups, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the first identified at the molecular level and then the first to benefit of molecular testing. The molecular analyses were then extended the following years to the dilated cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was the latest to be analyzed at the molecular level because the identification of genes involved in that phenotype was published only in 2002 to 2006. The genetics analysis of these diseases has developed over the past decade and, although still complex, is now available in current hospital practice. The objectives of these tests are to confirm a diagnosis difficult to achieve by classic clinical approach and to perform predictive and presymptomatic diagnosis in families when the mutation was identified. This allows for appropriate care of patients at risk, and may respond to a request for prenatal diagnosis in particularly serious forms. These tests are framed in the context of genetic counselling consultation and patients are the subjects of a multidisciplinary care in reference centres.

The mast cell: an evolutionary perspective. This review article is an attempt to trace the evolution of mast cells (MCs). These immune cells have been identified in all vertebrate classes as single-lobed cells containing variable amounts of membrane-bound secretory granules which store a large series of mediators, namely histamine, proteases, cytokines and growth factors. Other MC features, at least in mammals, are the c-kit receptor for the stem cell factor and the high-affinity receptor, FcepsilonRI, for immunoglobulin E (IgE). The c-kit receptor also has been identified in fish MCs. The FcepsilonRI receptor seems to be a more recent acquisition in MC phylogenesis given that IgE originated in mammalian species. Tryptase and histamine have also been recognized in MCs of teleost fish. Thus, a cell population with the overall characteristics of higher vertebrate MCs is identifiable in the most evolutionarily advanced fish species. Two potential MC progenitors have been identified in ascidians (urochordates which appeared approximately 500 million years ago): the basophil/MC-like granular haemocyte and the test cell. Both contain histamine and heparin, and provide defensive functions. Some granular haemocytes in Arthropoda also closely approximate the ultrastructure of modern MCs. The origin of MCs is probably to be found in a leukocyte ancestor operating in the context of a primitive local innate immunity and involved in phagocytic and killing activity against pathogens. From this type of defensive cell, the MC phylogenetic progenitor evolved into a tissue regulatory and remodelling cell, which was incorporated into the networks of recombinase activating genes (RAG)-mediated adaptive immunity in the Cambrian era, some 550 million years ago. Early MCs probably appeared in the last common ancestor we shared with hagfish, lamprey and sharks about 450-500 million years ago.

Functional and radiological outcome after delayed fixation of femoral neck fractures in pediatric patients. Complications that develop after femoral neck fracture in children-especially osteonecrosis-have been retrospectively attributed to inadvertent delayed fixation and fracture type. Prospective evaluation of results after delayed fixation of femoral neck fractures in children beyond the first 24 h is not reported in the literature and requires evaluation to increase our understanding of the procedure and improve fixation methods. Also, the role of capsular decompression in initial management needs to be elucidated. Radiological and functional evaluation was done for delayed fixation (>24 h) of displaced fractures in the femoral neck in 21 children (21 hips) treated over 11 years. Mean patient age was 11.8 (median 12, range 5-15) years. Extraphyseal fixation was done using partially threaded cannulated cancellous screws after closed or open reduction. Patients were allowed full weight bearing after 12-18 weeks. Results were assessed on the basis of modified Ratliff criteria. Patients were followed for a mean of 81 (range 66-129) months. All fractures united at a mean duration of 12 (range 10.6-14) weeks. Three (14.3%) patients had osteonecrosis of the hip, which was significantly related to poor outcome (r = 0.495; P = 0.022). There was a significant correlation (r = 0.52) between development of osteonecrosis and delayed fracture fixation of >10 days (P = 0.016) and open reduction (P = 0.016). Outcome following temporal delay in fracture fixation of the femoral neck is primarily affected by osteonecrosis of the femoral head, whereas restriction of movements, shortening, and premature physeal closure has no significant influence. Osteonecrosis is primarily linked to delay and open reduction, whereas fracture type, age, and sex seem insignificant factors. Capsular decompression does not seem to affect the outcome in delayed presentations and may hinder definitive treatment.

Seat belt use in States and territories with primary and secondary laws--United States, 2006. Motor-vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States. In the event of a crash, seat belts are highly effective in preventing serious injury and death. Data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to calculate prevalence of seat belt use by state and territory and by type of state seat belt law (primary vs. secondary enforcement). In 2006, seat belt use among adults ranged from 58.3% to 91.9% in the states and territories. Seat belt use was 86.0% in states and territories with primary enforcement laws and 75.9% in states with secondary enforcement laws. Seat belt use continues to increase in the United States. Primary enforcement laws remain a more effective strategy than secondary enforcement laws in getting motor-vehicle occupants to wear their seat belts.

A role for PKCepsilon during C2C12 myogenic differentiation. In a previous report we have demonstrated that PLCgamma1 is involved in the differentiation process of C2C12 myoblasts, induced by insulin administration. In order to identify the downstream targets of PLCgamma1-dependent signalling, we have analyzed the expression of DAG-dependent PKC isoforms during muscle differentiation. We show that during myotube formation, there is a marked increase of PKCepsilon and eta expression, and that PKCepsilon is able to form a complex with PLCgamma1. The increase in PKCepsilon amount during myogenic differentiation is associated to an increase in PKCepsilon activity as well. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that in growing C2C12 cells both PLCgamma1 and PKCepsilon localize in the cytoplasm with a distinct perinuclear accumulation. In insulin-treated cells, the expression of PLCgamma1 and PKCepsilon increases and the two proteins are still distributed mainly in the perinuclear region of the myotubes. We show that PLCgamma1-PKCepsilon complex co-localizes with protein 58K, a specific Golgi marker. Moreover, our results indicate that the Golgi-associated PKCepsilon form, i.e. PKCepsilon phosphorylated at Ser 729, is increased in differentiated myoblasts. Since it has been previously demonstrated that in C2C12 cells after insulin administration cyclin D3 levels could be modulated by PLCgamma1, we analyzed the effect on cyclin D3 expression of either PKCepsilon overexpression or silencing, in order to investigate whether PKCepsilon could also affect cyclin D3 expression. The results showed that either a modification of PKCepsilon expression or a change in its catalytic activity determines a variation of cyclin D3 levels and muscle differentiation in terms of myogenin expression. These data support a role for PKCepsilon in regulating insulin inositide-dependent PLCgamma1 signalling in skeletal muscle differentiation.

Theoretical investigations of nitric oxide channeling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis truncated hemoglobin N. Mycobacterium tuberculosis group I truncated hemoglobin trHbN catalyzes the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrate with a second-order rate constant k approximately 745 microM(-1) s(-1) at 23 degrees C (nitric oxide dioxygenase reaction). It was proposed that this high efficiency is associated with the presence of hydrophobic tunnels inside trHbN structure that allow substrate diffusion to the distal heme pocket. In this work, we investigated the mechanisms of NO diffusion within trHbN tunnels in the context of the nitric oxide dioxygenase reaction using two independent approaches. Molecular dynamics simulations of trHbN were performed in the presence of explicit NO molecules. Successful NO diffusion from the bulk solvent to the distal heme pocket was observed in all simulations performed. The simulations revealed that NO interacts with trHbN at specific surface sites, composed of hydrophobic residues located at tunnel entrances. The entry and the internal diffusion of NO inside trHbN were performed using the Long, Short, and EH tunnels reported earlier. The Short tunnel was preferentially used by NO to reach the distal heme pocket. This preference is ascribed to its hydrophobic funnel-shape entrance, covering a large area extending far from the tunnel entrance. This funnel-shape entrance triggers the frequent formation of solvent-excluded cavities capable of hosting up to three NO molecules, thereby accelerating NO capture and entry. The importance of hydrophobicity of entrances for NO capture is highlighted by a comparison with a polar mutant for which residues at entrances were mutated with polar residues. A complete map of NO diffusion pathways inside trHbN matrix was calculated, and NO molecules were found to diffuse from Xe cavity to Xe cavity. This scheme was in perfect agreement with the three-dimensional free-energy distribution calculated using implicit ligand sampling. The trajectories showed that NO significantly alters the dynamics of the key amino acids of Phe(62)(E15), a residue proposed to act as a gate controlling ligand traffic inside the Long tunnel, and also of Ile(119)(H11), at the entrance of the Short tunnel. It is noteworthy that NO diffusion inside trHbN tunnels is much faster than that reported previously for myoglobin. The results presented in this work shed light on the diffusion mechanism of apolar gaseous substrates inside protein matrix.

What are the consistent predictors of generic and specific post-stroke health-related quality of life? In order to improve post-stroke health-related quality of life (HRQOL), it is crucial to focus scarce health care and research resources towards its consistent determinants. Disparities in reported determinants of post-stroke HRQOL may be due to the use of different instruments (generic or specific) in different populations. This is the first study to identify factors which consistently influenced both generic and specific post-stroke HRQOL in the same study population. One hundred consecutive consenting stroke survivors were assessed using the stroke levity scale (SLS), modified Rankin scale (mRS), SF-36 and HRQOL in stroke patients (HRQOLISP) measure. Employing multiple regression analysis (R(2) = 0.63), potential predictors were sought among age, gender, socioeconomic class (SEC), aphasia, post-stroke duration, side, type and number of strokes, SLS, mRS, social support and Likert scale-graded responses to laughter and negative-feeling frequency. Gender, SEC and stroke type had no significant impact on HRQOL. The consistent independent statistical predictors of several facets of generic and stroke-specific HRQOL were stroke severity, disability, laughter and negative-feeling frequencies. While stroke severity, a component of physical health, impaired psychological health, psychological dysfunction in turn negatively influenced physical and other domains of health, thereby creating a vicious cycle. These multidirectional interactions may involve neural, social and existential mechanisms which remain to be confirmed, elucidated and exploited.

Pros and cons of using biomarkers versus clinical decisions in start and stop decisions for antibiotics in the critical care setting. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently receive prolonged or even unnecessary antibiotic therapy, which selects for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Over the last decade there has been great interest in biomarkers, particularly procalcitonin, to reduce antibiotic exposure. In this narrative review, we discuss the value of biomarkers and provide additional information beyond clinical evaluation in order to be clinically useful and review the literature on sepsis biomarkers outside the neonatal period. Both benefits and limitations of biomarkers for clinical decision-making are reviewed. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the safety and efficacy of procalcitonin to discontinue antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. In contrast, there is limited utility of procalcitonin for treatment initiation or withholding therapy initially. In addition, an algorithm using procalcitonin for treatment escalation has been ineffective and is probably associated with poorer outcomes. Little data from interventional studies are available for other biomarkers for antibiotic stewardship, except for C-reactive protein (CRP), which was recently found to be similarly effective and safe as procalcitonin in a randomized controlled trial. We finally briefly discuss biomarker-unrelated approaches to reduce antibiotic duration in the ICU, which have shown that even without biomarker guidance, most patients with sepsis can be treated with relatively short antibiotic courses of approximately 7 days. In summary, there is an ongoing unmet need for biomarkers which can reliably and early on identify patients who require antibiotic therapy, distinguish between responders and non-responders and help to optimize antibiotic treatment decisions among critically ill patients. Available evidence needs to be better incorporated in clinical decision-making.

An acid-sensing channel sows fear and panic. The amygdala is a brain region that coordinates fear responses to a variety of threats. Ziemann et al. (2009) now show that acid-sensing channels in the amygdala mediate fear responses that accompany inhalation of carbon dioxide, suggesting that aberrant chemosensation may underlie anxiety disorders associated with a fear of suffocation.

Clinical and radiographic poland syndrome classification: a proposal. Many chest wall deformities have a characteristic radiologic appearance that can be the basis for a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, imaging techniques have fundamental roles in the detection, location, and characterization of these disorders. The authors propose a clinical and radiographic Poland syndrome (CRPS) classification system and possible treatment algorithm for the thoracic manifestations of Poland syndrome (PS) in women, based on both clinical examinations and imaging studies. A retrospective study was conducted of 28 female patients evaluated over 17 years in the 28th Infirmary, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division of the Hospital Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After clinical examination, all patients underwent radiographic examination with chest radiographs, conventional computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging and, in some cases, additional imaging studies. All clinical and radiologic variables were compiled in a database and used in the classification system, which included three levels of disease severity. Based on the CRPS classification of the 28 female patients, 10 patients had first-degree PS, 14 patients had second-degree PS, and four patients had third-degree PS. Eighteen patients underwent surgical correction; a total of 39 surgical procedures were performed using the CRPS algorithm. Identification of the severity of PS using the proposed classification system provided an accurate study of each patient and enabled better planning for the surgical correction of functional and aesthetic deformities.

Effect of ICU interventions on gastrointestinal motility. Early detection of gastrointestinal motility disturbances is a major goal to reduce the incidence of this potentially disastrous event by prophylactic managements and early goal-directed therapy in patients at risk. Gastroparesis frequently results in the inability to feed critically ill patients, aggravating problems such as bacterial translocation and stress-induced intestinal damage. Recently published data have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiologic background of gastroparesis, intestinal stress damage and the effect of early enteral nutrition on gastrointestinal function. New techniques, such as ultrasound and the capsule techniques, might help to assess intestinal function beyond the aspiration of gastric residual volumes and the passage of stool. Therapeutic options such as opioid antagonists and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 agonist prucalopride might help to restore intestinal function. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances are caused by a myriad of pathological processes. Moreover, bowel integrity is governed by comorbidity, impaired metabolic function and pharmacological interventions in critically ill patients. Restoring gastrointestinal function, therefore, requires a multimodal approach including prophylactic management strategies and the sensible use of substances with inhibitory effects on intestinal motility.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in outpatients, United States, 1999-2006. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a major problem in US hospitals already dealing with high levels of hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). Using antimicrobial drug susceptibility data for 1999-2006 from The Surveillance Network, we characterized the relationship between outpatient and inpatient levels of CA-MRSA nationally. In outpatients, the frequency of CA-MRSA isolates has increased >7 x during 1999-2006, which suggests that outpatients have become a major reservoir for CA-MRSA. However, contrary to results in other reports, although CA-MRSA increases are associated with decreases in the frequency of HA-MRSA in hospitals, the decreases are only modest. This finding suggests that instead of replacing HA-MRSA in the hospital, CA-MRSA is adding to the overall presence of MRSA already found within the hospital population.


Overcoming multidrug resistance by RNA interference.

Searching for a "hidden" prophage in a marine bacterium. Prophages are common in many bacterial genomes. Distinguishing putatively viable prophages from nonviable sequences can be a challenge, since some prophages are remnants of once-functional prophages that have been rendered inactive by mutational changes. In some cases, a putative prophage may be missed due to the lack of recognizable prophage loci. The genome of a marine roseobacter, Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM (hereinafter referred to as ISM), was recently sequenced and was reported to contain no intact prophage based on customary bioinformatic analysis. However, prophage induction experiments performed with this organism led to a different conclusion. In the laboratory, virus-like particles in the ISM culture increased more than 3 orders of magnitude following induction with mitomycin C. After careful examination of the ISM genome sequence, a putative prophage (ISM-pro1) was identified. Although this prophage contains only minimal phage-like genes, we demonstrated that this "hidden" prophage is inducible. Genomic analysis and reannotation showed that most of the ISM-pro1 open reading frames (ORFs) display the highest sequence similarity with Rhodobacterales bacterial genes and some ORFs are only distantly related to genes of other known phages or prophages. Comparative genomic analyses indicated that ISM-pro1-like prophages or prophage remnants are also present in other Rhodobacterales genomes. In addition, the lysis of ISM by this previously unrecognized prophage appeared to increase the production of gene transfer agents (GTAs). Our study suggests that a combination of in silico genomic analyses and experimental laboratory work is needed to fully understand the lysogenic features of a given bacterium.

Intestinal adaptation following massive ileocecal resection in 20-day-old weanling rats. Few infant animal models have been used to study infantile short bowel syndrome (SBS). Most SBS models involve removal of the proximal small bowel followed by jejunoileal anastomosis, which has unclear clinical relevance to human infantile SBS that often results from surgical treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis and involves removal of the ileum, ileocecal valve, and part of or the entire colon. Our objective was to develop a more appropriate SBS model in developing rats. Twenty-day-old weanling rats were divided into 2 surgery groups, ileocecal resection (ICR) and sham groups, and a control group that did not undergo surgery. All were fed a liquid diet ad libitum for 7 days after surgery or for 7 days in the controls, and body weight, food intake, and stool changes were recorded daily. The rats were then euthanized and intestinal lengths and weights were recorded. Samples of intestine from the distal jejunum and proximal colon were collected for histology. Mucosal samples from the middle, distal jejunum, and colon were collected for measurements of mucosal weights, DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Maltase activity was determined in the small intestine. Eighty-five percent of rats survived the ICR with subsequent development of diarrhea, hyperphagia, and poor growth. Adaptive responses to ICR, as compared with sham, were evidenced by increased intestinal and mucosal weights, DNA, RNA, and protein levels, increased maltase activity and villous thickness in distal jejunum, and increased mucosal thickness in the colon. This ICR model in weanling rats is appropriate for studying human infantile SBS.

Determination of and correlation between urine protein excretion and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio values during a 24-hour period in healthy horses and ponies. OBJECTIVE-To determine whether urine protein-to-creatinine (UP:C) ratio assessment provides an estimate of urine protein excretion (UPE) over a 24-hour period in horses and ponies, establish a preliminary UP:C ratio reference range, and determine UP:C ratio variation over time in healthy equids. ANIMALS-11 female horses and 6 female ponies. PROCEDURES-Urine was collected from all equids at 4-hour intervals for 24 hours. Total 24-hour UPE (mg of protein/kg of body weight) and UP:C ratio were determined; these variables were also assessed in aliquots of urine collected at 4-hour intervals. On 2 additional days, urine samples were also obtained from 6 horses (1 sample/horse/d) to determine day-to-day variation in UP:C ratio. Correlation between 4-hour or 24-hour UPE and UP:C ratio values was assessed. Reference ranges for 24-hour UPE, 24-hour UP:C ratio, and 4-hour UP:C ratios were calculated as central 95th percentiles of observed values. RESULTS-Mean 24-hour UPE (4.28 +/- 2.99 mg/kg) and 24-hour UP:C ratio (0.0 to 0.37) had excellent correlation (R = 0.826; P < 0.001) in both horses and ponies; analysis of 4-hour data also revealed good correlation (R = 0.782; P < 0.001) with these variables. Calculated UPE and UP:C ratio reference ranges were similar to established ranges in other species. Day-to-day variability in UP:C ratio was minimal, and all results were within the reference range calculated by use of the 24-hour urine samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Assessment of the UP:C ratio appears to be a reliable method for estimating 24-hour UPE in horses and ponies.


Pilot study of a family physical activity planning intervention among parents and their children.

Local perceptions of causes of death in rural South Africa: a comparison of perceived and verbal autopsy causes of death. Understanding how lay people perceive the causes of mortality and their associated risk factors is important for public health. In resource-limited settings, where verbal autopsy (VA) is used as the most expedient method of determining cause of death, it is important to understand how pre-existing concepts of cause of death among VA-informants may influence their VA-responses and the consequential impact on cause of death assessment. This study describes the agreement between VA-derived causes of death and informant-perceived causes and associated influential factors, which also reflects lay health literacy in this setting. Using 20 years of VA data (n=11,228) from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site in rural South Africa, we explored the agreement between the causes of death perceived by the VA-informants and those assigned by the automated Inter-VA tool. Kappa statistics and concordance correlation coefficients were applied to measure agreement at individual and population levels, respectively. Multivariable regression models were used to explore factors associated with recognised lay perceptions of causes of mortality. Agreement between informant-perceived and VA-derived causes of death at the individual level was limited, but varied substantially by cause of death. However, agreement at the population level, comparing cause-specific mortality fractions was higher, with the notable exception of bewitchment as a cause. More recent deaths, those in adults aged 15-49 years, deaths outside the home, and those associated with external causes showed higher concordance with InterVA. Overall, informant perception of causes of death was limited, but depended on informant characteristics and causes of death, and to some extent involved non-biomedical constructs. Understanding discordance between perceived and recognised causes of death is important for public health planning; low community understanding of causes of death may be detrimental to public health. These findings also illustrate the importance of using rigorous and standardised VA methods rather than relying on informants' reported causes of death.


Development of Framework for Assessing Influenza Virus Pandemic Risk.

Novel binding between pre-membrane protein and claudin-1 is required for efficient dengue virus entry. Flavivirus pre-membrane (prM) protein is important for proper folding and secretion of envelope (E) protein. However, other functions of prM protein in relation to virus life-cycle are poorly characterized. In this study, we aimed to elucidate if dengue virus (DENV) prM protein interacts with host proteins and contributes to viral pathogenesis by screening human liver cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. Our study identified claudin-1 as a novel interacting partner of DENV prM protein. Virus production was significantly attenuated in claudin-1 knock-down cells. We showed that claudin-1 expression is up-regulated at the early phase of infection to facilitate DENV entry and down-regulated at the late stage of infection probably to prevent super-infection. Our study also demonstrated that DENV C protein played an important role in down-regulating claudin-1 expression during DENV infection.

Multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment in India.

Redox thermodynamics of lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO) are important constituents of the innate immune system of mammals. These heme enzymes belong to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily and catalyze the oxidation of thiocyanate, bromide and nitrite to hypothiocyanate, hypobromous acid and nitrogen dioxide that are toxic for invading pathogens. In order to gain a better understanding of the observed differences in substrate specificity and oxidation capacity in relation to heme and protein structure, a comprehensive spectro-electrochemical investigation was performed. The reduction potential (E degrees ') of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of EPO and LPO was determined to be -126mV and -176mV, respectively (25 degrees C, pH 7.0). Variable temperature experiments show that EPO and LPO feature different reduction thermodynamics. In particular, reduction of ferric EPO is enthalpically and entropically disfavored, whereas in LPO the entropic term, which selectively stabilizes the oxidized form, prevails on the enthalpic term that favors reduction of Fe(III). The data are discussed with respect to the architecture of the heme cavity and the substrate channel. Comparison with published data for myeloperoxidase demonstrates the effect of heme to protein linkages and heme distortion on the redox chemistry of mammalian peroxidases and in consequence on the enzymatic properties of these physiologically important oxidoreductases.

An empirical study of the effects of social security reforms on benefit claiming behavior and receipt using public-use administrative microdata. In the past few years, the Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefit system in the United States has undergone some of the most significant changes since its inception. In a short period of time, we have seen the implementation of the phased increase in the full retirement age (FRA) with the resulting increase in the penalty for claiming benefits early, the elimination of the earnings test for those above the FRA, and the incremental increase in the delayed retirement credit (DRC) for those claiming benefits after the FRA. Because these changes have taken place only recently, there is relatively little research using household-level data that analyzes the consequences of all these changes. Using the public-use microdata extract from the Master Beneficiary Record, we are able to uncover a number of interesting trends in benefit claiming behavior and level of benefit receipt, which can help us understand how the changes in the system are shaping the retirement benefit claiming behavior of older Americans. We find evidence of substantial effects of the removal of the earnings test and the increase in the FRA, but evidence of very small effects as a result of the increases in the DRC.

Demographics and attitudes of chronic-pain patients who seek online pain-related medical information: implications for healthcare providers. To identify the demographics, search characteristics, and attitudes of chronic-pain patients who access online pain-related medical information. This is a cross-sectional survey study. Ninety percent of patients had access to the Internet; 63% of patients used the Internet to obtain online pain-related medical information, of which 57% and 55% believed that the information was "useful" and "credible," respectively. Ninety-five percent of current online pain-related medical information users and 52% of nonusers planned to use the Internet in the future to obtain online pain-related medical information. Only half of our subjects ever shared the information found on Internet with their treating healthcare provider. A large proportion of chronic-pain patients use the Internet to obtain online pain-related medical information. This behavior was found to show significant correlation with patients' level of education. Despite multiple previous studies suggesting inaccurate and low quality of online medical information, most of the patients felt confident in the credibility of online pain-related medical information obtained. Furthermore, many patients choose not to share this information with their healthcare providers. Healthcare providers must acknowledge the growing importance of Internet-based health information, be prepared to entertain questions and assist patients in evaluating the quality of online pain-related medical information, and possibly proactively suggest quality third-party pain-related websites.

Characterization of 1,3-alternate calix[4]arene-silica bonded stationary phases and their comparison to selected commercial columns by using principal component analysis. Twelve calix[4]arene stationary phases in 1,3-alternate conformation, synthesized in the authors' laboratory, were characterized in terms of their surface coverage, hydrophobic selectivity, aromatic selectivity, shape selectivity, hydrogen bonding capacity and ion-exchange capacity. The set of tests commonly used for evaluation of commercially available stationary phases was applied to assess fundamental chromatographic properties of the calixarene phases. The new calixarene phases were compared to each other, to Caltrex and LiChrosorb C-18 columns. Principal component analysis has been used to provide comparison between 1,3-alternate calix[4]arene phases and commercially available phenyl, fluorophenyl and fluoroalkyl columns.

[Experimental study on cytochrome P450 enzymes after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus]. To study the effect of ferment powder caterpillar fungus on cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. The methods of Cocktail probe drugs were used. The rats were randomly divided into two groups. One group were given ferment powder caterpillar fungus once daily orally for ten days. Another group received orally normal saline one daily as the blank control. After ten days of treatment, the rats were given probe drugs of coffine, dapsone and chlorzoxazone and the blood was taken out by femoral catheterization. The plasma concentration of probe drugs were determined by HPLC. Data of plasma drug level-time were disposed with DAS Ver 2.0. The metabolism of caffeine and dapsone speeded up after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fungus, but the metabolism of chlorzoxazone was hardly changed. It suggested that ferment powder caterpillar fungus tended to be the inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. But the CYP2E1 was hardly affected.


New psycho-pedagogic approach to obesity treatment: a 5-year follow-up.

Influence of puberty and antral follicle count on calving day in crossbred beef heifers. Lifetime productivity and longevity are greater in beef cows that give birth early in their first calving season. The ability of heifers to conceive early in the breeding season is traditionally thought to be a function of pubertal status; however, recent evidence suggests that antral follicle count is positively associated with calving day in pubertal beef heifers. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that the total number of ovarian follicles may alter response to hormonal synchronization protocols. The objectives of this study were to confirm the beneficial influence of antral follicle count on calving day in beef heifers and to determine whether response to PGF2α is associated with differences in antral follicle counts. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment was designed to investigate the interaction between calving period (early vs. late) and PGF2α (control vs. PGF) on calving day and antral follicle count in yearling beef heifers (n = 95). As intended, calving day was less in the early calving period compared to the late calving period (P < 0.01). There were no differences in calving day in response to treatment with PGF2α (P > 0.05). There was a significant interaction between calving period and PGF2α on age at first calving (P < 0.01), such that heifers treated with PGF2α that gave birth early were younger than heifers treated with saline that gave birth early. Calf weaning weights were greater in the early calving group than in the late calving group (P < 0.01). Heifers that gave birth in the early calving group possessed more antral follicles at prebreeding ultrasonographic examination than heifers that gave birth in the late calving group (P = 0.05). These findings confirm that antral follicle counts are associated with calving day in pubertal beef heifers. The use of antral follicle counts as a prebreeding phenotype provides additional utility to reproductive tract scoring for commercial production because of its association with calving day. As a prebreeding ovarian phenotype, antral follicle counts may hold additional applicability for organic beef producers looking to reduce the length of their calving season without increasing the total number of replacement heifers retained.

[A multi-center clinical study of the reference value of serum glycated albumin]. To set up the reference value of serum glycated albumin (GA) in Chinese for using in clinical practice through a multi-center clinical trial. Three hundred and eighty individuals with normal weight and normal glucose regulation, including 183 males and 197 females ranging from 20 to 69 years, were recruited from 10 hospitals in China Serum GA levels were measured with liquid enzymatic method. (1) The GA level of the 380 subjects was (14.5 +/- 1.9)%. When dividing these subjects by age into 3 subgroups, there was no difference in the GA levels among the 3 subgroups (P > 0.05). Compared with the women, the men had higher GA level in the first subgroup aging from 20 to 39 (P = 0.028). However, no significant difference was detected after adjusting with BMI as confounder. (2) When dividing those subjects by BMI into 3 subgroups, with BMI ranging from 18.5-20.9 kg/m2 21.0-22.9 kg/m2 and 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 respectively, we came to the following results: for men, there was no difference in the GA levels among the 3 subgroups (P > 0.05), but for women, the GA level of the first subgroup was higher than that of the second subgroup (P = 0.024). (3) The level of GA in the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile was 10.8%-17.1%. (4) Sixty normal subjects were chosen to repeat evaluation of GA levels after 2-3 weeks and the GA levels were of no difference (P > 0.05). The normal range of serum GA for the Chinese population could be suggested at 11%-17%.

Probiotics for prevention of atopic diseases in infants: systematic review and meta-analysis. Growing evidence underlines the pivotal role of infant gut colonization in the development of the immune system. The possibility to modify gut colonization through probiotic supplementation in childhood might prevent atopic diseases. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing atopic diseases. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of probiotics during pregnancy or early infancy for prevention of allergic diseases. Fixed-effect models were used, and random-effects models where significant heterogeneity was present. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Seventeen studies, reporting data from 4755 children (2381 in the probiotic group and 2374 in the control group), were included in the meta-analysis. Infants treated with probiotics had a significantly lower RR for eczema compared to controls (RR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.69-0.89], P = 0.0003), especially those supplemented with a mixture of probiotics (RR 0.54 [95% CI: 0.43-0.68], P < 0.00001). No significant difference in terms of prevention of asthma (RR 0.99 [95% CI: 0.77-1.27], P = 0.95), wheezing (RR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.89-1.17], P = 0.76) or rhinoconjunctivitis (RR 0.91 [95% CI: 0.67-1.23], P = 0.53) was documented. The results of the present meta-analysis show that probiotic supplementation prevents infantile eczema, thus suggesting a new potential indication for probiotic use in pregnancy and infancy.

A motion sequence fusion technique based on PCA for activity analysis in body sensor networks. Human movement analysis by means of mobile sensory platforms is an ever-growing area with promise to revolutionize delivery of healthcare services. An effective data fusion technique is essential for understanding the inertial information obtained from distributed sensor nodes. In this paper, we develop a data fusion model based on the concept of principal component analysis. Unlike traditional fusion techniques which deal with statistical feature space, our model operates on motion transcripts, where each movement is represented as a sequence of basic building blocks called primitives. We describe how our model transforms transcripts of different nodes into a unified transcript by integrating the most relevant primitives of movements. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our transcript fusion model for action recognition using real data collected from three subjects.


Simvastatin Enhances Spatial Memory and Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal CA1 via Upregulation of α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor.

Distinct roles for Robo2 in the regulation of axon and dendrite growth by retinal ganglion cells. Guidance factors act on the tip of a growing axon to direct it to its target. What role these molecules play, however, in the control of the dendrites that extend from that axon's cell body is poorly understood. Slits, through their Robo receptors, guide many types of axons, including those of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here we assess and contrast the role of Slit/Robo signalling in the growth and guidance of the axon and dendrites extended by RGCs in Xenopus laevis. As Xenopus RGCs extend dendrites, they express robo2 and robo3, while slit1 and slit2 are expressed in RGCs and in the adjacent inner nuclear layer. Interestingly, our functional data with antisense knockdown and dominant negative forms of Robo2 (dnRobo2) and Robo3 (dnRobo3) indicate that Slit/Robo signalling has no role in RGC dendrite guidance, and instead is necessary to stimulate dendrite branching, primarily via Robo2. Our in vitro culture data argue that Slits are the ligands involved. In contrast, both dnRobo2 and dnRobo3 inhibited the extension of axons and caused the misrouting of some axons. Based on these data, we propose that Robo signalling can have distinct functions in the axon and dendrites of the same cell, and that the specific combinations of Robo receptors could underlie these differences. Slit acts via Robo2 in dendrites as a branching/growth factor but not in guidance, while Robo2 and Robo3 function in concert in axons to mediate axonal interactions and respond to Slits as guidance factors. These data underscore the likelihood that a limited number of extrinsic factors regulate the distinct morphologies of axons and dendrites.

Syphilis screening among female sex workers in Bangalore, India: comparison of point-of-care testing and traditional serological approaches. We undertook a prospective evaluation of the Qualpro Syphicheck-WB rapid syphilis test to measure its diagnostic performance and utility as a point-of-care (POC) screening test among female sex workers (FSWs) in Bangalore, India. From August 2008 to May 2009, FSWs without a laboratory-confirmed history of syphilis attending STI clinics in Bangalore underwent POC syphilis screening using finger-prick whole blood, with onsite treatment if indicated. Serum samples were collected for local laboratory offsite rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing and reference laboratory RPR, Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA), and rapid syphilis testing. FSWs who participated in standard offsite RPR screening from August 2007 to May 2008 in the same clinics formed the comparison group for treatment coverage. Of the 1617 women who underwent POC syphilis testing, 7.4% had laboratory evidence of active syphilis with reactive RPR and TPHA, and 3.7% had an RPR titre > or = 1:8. Compared with the reference RPR and TPHA, the sensitivity and specificity of the POC syphilis test were 70.8% (95% CI 62.7 to 79.0) and 97.8% (95% CI 97.1 to 98.5). Because of the low rate of women returning for their test results after offsite RPR screening, the proportion of women with active syphilis who were appropriately treated rose from 44.8% to 68.3% with the use of POC syphilis screening (p=0.003). The Syphicheck-WB test utilising finger-prick whole blood has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting active syphilis. However, among hard-to-reach populations who may not return for follow-up treatment, POC screening with this assay could still confer an advantage over offsite RPR testing with respect to treatment coverage.

Predictors of knowledge, attitudes, use and future use of evidence-based practice among baccalaureate nursing students at two universities. Nursing students are strategically positioned to influence adoption of evidence-based practice within the nursing profession. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors of knowledge, attitudes, use and future use of evidence-based practice among baccalaureate nursing students at two universities. A cross-sectional survey design was used to study a convenience sample of 436 nursing students (response rate of 63.3%) enrolled at two baccalaureate nursing programs at the beginning of 2007 fall semester in the United States. The surveys included demographic questionnaire and knowledge, attitudes and behaviors questionnaire for evidence-based practice. EBP Knowledge, Attitudes toward EBP and Future Use of EBP subscales demonstrated statistically significant increase in mean scores with advancing academic levels. Confidence in clinical decision-making and clinical preparedness had moderate positive correlation with EBP Use and Future use of EBP. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses indicated that the clinical preparedness and confidence in clinical decision-making were statistically significant predictor variables for EBP use and Future use of EBP. Clinically well-prepared nursing students with high confidence in clinical decision-making are most likely to use evidence-based practice, both in the present and the future.

Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the thymus with trisomy 18. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) of the thymus is rare and little is known about its karyotype abnormality. MALT lymphoma in general shows a good prognosis, but some reports suggest that the presence of trisomy 18 predicts recurrence. Here, we report a patient with MALT lymphoma of the thymus and the left parotid gland accompanied by Sjogren's syndrome. The karyotype analysis revealed that this is the first case of thymic MALT lymphoma with trisomy 18, which we believe is worth reporting. We also review cases with thymic MALT lymphoma previously reported in the literature.

Childhood tonsillectomy: who is referred and what treatment choices are made? Baseline findings from the North of England and Scotland Study of Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy in Children (NESSTAC). Tonsillectomies are frequently performed, yet variations exist in tonsillectomy rates. Clinicians use guidelines, but complex psychosocial influences on childhood tonsillectomy include anecdotal evidence of parental enthusiasm. Studies indicate that undergoing preferred treatment improves outcome. Despite the enthusiasm with which tonsillectomy is offered and sought, there is little evidence of efficacy. This resulted in a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy in children with recurrent sore throats. To compare characteristics of children entering the randomised trial with those recruited to a parallel, non-randomised study, to establish trends in referral and patient preferences for treatment. Baseline data from a randomised controlled trial with parallel non-randomised preference study, comparing surgical intervention with medical treatment in children aged 4-15 years with recurrent sore throat referred to five secondary care otolaryngology departments located in the north of England or west central Scotland. Centres assessed 1546 children; 21% were not eligible for tonsillectomy. Among older children (8-15 years), girls were significantly more likely to be referred to secondary care. Of 1015 eligible children, 268 (28.2%) agreed to be randomised, while 461 (45.4%) agreed to the parallel, non-randomised preference study, with a strong preference for tonsillectomy. Participants reporting that progress at school had been impeded or with more experience of persistent sore throat were more likely to seek tonsillectomy. Referred boys were more likely than girls to opt for medical treatment. Socio-economic data showed no effect. Preference for tonsillectomy reflects educational impact and recent experience, rather than age or socio-economic status.

Dual Receptor-Targeted Theranostic Nanoparticles for Localized Delivery and Activation of Photodynamic Therapy Drug in Glioblastomas. Targeting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with two or more receptor binding peptides has been proposed to address intratumoral heterogeneity of glioblastomas that overexpress multiple cell surface receptors to ultimately improve therapeutic efficacy. AuNPs conjugated with peptides against both the epidermal growth factor and transferrin receptors and loaded with the photosensitizer phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) have been designed and compared with monotargeted AuNPs for in vitro and in vivo studies. The (EGFpep+Tfpep)-AuNPs-Pc 4 with a particle size of ∼41 nm improved both specificity and worked synergistically to decrease time of maximal accumulation in human glioma cells that overexpressed two cell surface receptors as compared to cells that overexpressed only one. Enhanced cellular association and increased cytotoxicity were achieved. In vivo studies show notable accumulation of these agents in the brain tumor regions. 


Aging-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase response to dietary supplementation: the French paradox revisited.

Production and sorting of transgenic, modified human parathyroid hormone in vivo in rat salivary glands. Polarized salivary epithelial cells can sort secretory proteins towards either the basolateral or apical pole. Transgenic human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) exclusively sorts apically in rat submandibular glands. To help understand this specific process we modified the hPTH cDNA sequence and delivered the cDNAs to glands in vivo using adenoviral (Ad) vectors. The Ad vectors encoded: (1) the native form of hPTH (Ad.pre-pro-hPTH1-84), (2) the native sequence, but with the pro-segment deleted (Ad.pre-hPTH1-84), and (3) a sequence containing the pre-segment followed by the first 34 amino acids of hPTH (Ad.pre-hPTH1-34). hPTH production and sorting were studied after two days. All constructs were effectively transcribed in targeted glands. However, the pre-hPTH1-84 modification led to reduced hPTH secretion and production, while no immunoreactive hPTH resulted from pre-hPTH1-34 cDNA infusion. The pre-hPTH1-84 modification had no effect on apical sorting. These in vivo results show that the signal responsible for hPTH's apical sorting does not reside in the pro-segment and that deleting both the pro-segment and the carboxyl-terminal region severely impairs post-translational processing of hPTH.

Automatic actuator control by leg load signal of active AFO for Achilles tendon ruptures. This paper describes automatic actuator control hardware for an active ankle foot orthosis (AAFO) for a ruptured Achilles tendon. The sole of the AAFO is equipped with a servomotor. The actuator can switch the upright and the forward stepping posture of the patient. To control the actuator automatically during a gate cycle, 1: joint kinematics were analyzed that consisted of both stick pictures and EMG signals from the affected limb when the patient was walking on a treadmill. The cross-correlation coefficient between the ankle angle and the EMG signal of the lower limb (tibialis anterior) was small when the patient was wearing the AAFO. 2: An air pressure sensor and a film sensor were compared experimentally to measure the leg load. A prototype AAFO with automatic control was realized by using the leg load signal provided by an air pressure sensor to realize actuator control.

Larvicidal activity of mosquito sterol carrier protein-2 inhibitors to the insecticide-resistant mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae). AeSCP-2 inhibitors (SCPIs) compete with cholesterol for binding to a mosquito sterol carrier protein-2 (AeSCP-2) known to aid in the uptake of cholesterol in mosquito cells. The larvicidal activities of AeSCP-2 inhibitor-1 (SCPI-1) and inhibitor-2 (SCPI-2) against Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) were therefore examined in insecticide-resistant Culex mosquitoes HAmCq(G9), MAmCq(G2), and BAmCq(G0). All of the resistant Culex mosquito strains exhibited similar sensitivity to SCPI-1 and SCPI-2 inhibitors compared with a susceptible S-Lab strain. When an AeSCP-2 inhibitor was applied simultaneously with permethrin, the toxicity of permethrin to the second-instar larvae of all four strains of Culex mosquitoes increased, suggesting a synergistic effect of AeSCP-2 inhibitors on the toxicity of permethrin against Culex mosquitoes. Both SCPI-1 and SCPI-2 inhibitors caused a 2.4- to 3-fold reduction in the level of permethrin resistance in the highly resistant strain HAmCq(G9). This result suggests that the mode of action of the AeSCP-2 inhibitors, which reduces the uptake of cholesterol by inhibiting the function of AeSCP-2 in mosquito cells, may interfere with the mechanisms or ability that govern permethrin resistance in the HAmCq(G9) mosquito strain.

PKC-alpha controls MYD88-dependent TLR/IL-1R signaling and cytokine production in mouse and human dendritic cells. Conventional PKC (cPKC)-alpha regulates TRIF-dependent IFN response factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated gene transcription, but its role in MyD88-dependent TLR signaling remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that PKC-alpha is induced by several MyD88-dependent TLR/IL-1R ligands and regulates cytokine expression in human and murine DC. First, inhibition of cPKC activity in human DC by cPKC-specific inhibitors, Gö6976 or HBDDe, downregulated the production of classical inflammatory/immunomodulatory cytokines induced by TLR2, TLR5 or IL-1R but not by TLR3 stimulation. Similarly, dominant negative PKC-alpha repressed Pam(3)CSK(4) induced NF-kappaB- and AP-1-driven promoter activities in TLR2-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. Dominant negative PKC-alpha inhibited NF-kappaB reporter activity mediated by overexpression of MyD88 but not TRIF. Unexpectedly, BM-derived DC from PKC-alpha(-/-) mice exhibited decreased TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 production induced by both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent ligands. Furthermore, PKC-alpha is coupled to TLR2 signaling proximal to MyD88 since MAPK and IkappaB kinase-alpha/beta phosphorylations and IkappaBalpha degradation were inhibited in PKC-alpha(-/-) BM-derived DC. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PKC-alpha physically interacts with Pam(3)CSK(4) activated TLR2 in WT but not in MyD88(-/-) DC. Collectively this study identifies a species-specific role of PKC-alpha as a key component that controls MyD88-dependent cytokine gene expression in human and mouse but differentially regulates production of TRIF-dependent cytokines.

Age-dependent changes in fecal 17beta-estradiol and progesterone concentrations in female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). The objective of this study was to investigate whether sex steroids decreased with age in female black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). Fecal concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and progesterone (five samples/wk) and the number of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles were compared between adult (n=3) and aged females (n=2). All animals (regardless of age) had higher 17beta-estradiol concentrations during the fertile than the nonfertile phases. However, during the fertile phase, concentrations of this hormone were significantly higher in adult females. Conversely, progesterone concentrations varied normally throughout the menstrual cycle in both adult and aged animals, with no significant difference between age classes. Similarly, there was no significant effect of age on the number of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. In conclusion, we inferred that the aged female spider monkeys did not reach menopause, instead they remained in a perimenopausal period characterized by changes in fecal concentrations of ovarian steroids and hypothalamus-hypophysis-ovary axis activity, as well as irregular menstrual flows, for prolonged intervals.

Symptomatic hypocalcemia in primary hyperaldosteronism: a case report. The metabolic alterations caused by hyperaldosteronism are being increasingly recognized and have generated considerable interest among the medical fraternity. Hyperaldosteronism is suspected to have a pivotal role in the patho-physiology of congestive cardiac failure where it has been studied extensively. But its effects on calcium metabolism, parathyroid metabolism and renal handling of calcium are less well described. Recent experimental models have shed light into the roles played by previously unknown mechanisms in causing these metabolic alterations. We hereby report a case of primary hyperaldosteronism due to adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome) who presented with a myriad of clinical features including symptomatic hypocalcemia, significant weight loss along with uncontrolled hypertension for a prolonged period before eventually detected to have primary hyperaldosteronism. Surgical removal of the causative tumor resulted in prompt disappearance of all the symptoms and signs and regain of lost weight.

[Identification and determination of major constituents in Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. by high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-ion trap-time-of-flight mass spectrometry]. A facile method using high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-ion trap-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-IT-TOF MS) has been established for the analysis of multiple constituents in Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. Six chemical standards including emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, rhein, aloe-emodin and polydatin were studied systematically and their fragmentation pathways were concluded. The methanol extract of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. was separated and analyzed by HPLC/ESI-QIT-TOF MS system in negative ion mode. A total of 10 constituents were identified or tentatively characterized with supporting results on the fragmentation pathways of 6 chemical standards and relative references. These constituents are mainly anthraquinones, stilbenes, torachryson and their derivatives, including resveratroloside, polydatin, emodin-8-O-glucoside, resveratrol, torachryson-8-O-glucoside, emodin-1-O-glucoside, torachryson-8-O-(6'-acetyl)glucoside (newly discovered), physcion-8-O-glucoside, physcion-8-O-(6'-acetyl)glucoside (newly discovered) and emodin. It is an extremely simple way by using HPLC/ESI-IT-TOF MS to provide chemical information concerning the constituents in herbal medicines and making the identification results more convinced.

Prevalence of antibodies against avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among Cullers and poultry workers in Ho Chi Minh City, 2005. Between 2003 and 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses caused large scale outbreaks in poultry in the Ho Chi Minh City area in Vietnam. We studied the prevalence of antibodies against H5N1 in poultry workers and cullers who were active in the program in Ho Chi Minh City in 2004 and 2005. Single sera from 500 poultry workers and poultry cullers exposed to infected birds were tested for antibodies to avian influenza H5N1, using microneutralization assays and hemagglutination inhibition assay with horse blood. All sera tested negative using microneutralization tests. Three samples showed a 1ratio80 titer in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. This study provides additional support for the low transmissibility of clade 1 H5N1 to humans, but limited transmission to highly exposed persons cannot be excluded given the presence of low antibody titers in some individuals.

Phylogeny and biogeography of the eastern Asian-North American disjunct wild-rice genus (Zizania L., Poaceae). The wild-rice genus Zizania includes four species disjunctly distributed in eastern Asia and North America, with three species (Z. aquatica, Z. palustris, and Z. texana) in North America and one (Z. latifolia) in eastern Asia. The phylogeny of Zizania was constructed using sequences of seven DNA fragments (atpB-rbcL, matK, rps16, trnL-F, trnH-psbA, nad1, and Adh1a) from chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes. Zizania is shown to be monophyletic with the North American species forming a clade and the eastern Asian Z. latifolia sister to the North American clade. The divergence between the eastern Asian Z. latifolia and the North American clade was dated to be 3.74 (95% HPD: 1.04-7.23) million years ago (mya) using the Bayesian dating method with the combined atpB-rbcL, matK, rps16, trnL-F, and nad1 data. Biogeographic analyses using a likelihood method suggest the North American origin of Zizania and its migration into eastern Asia via the Bering land bridge. Among the three North American species, the organellar data and the haplotype network of the nuclear Adh1a gene show a close relationship between Z. palustris and the narrowly distributed endangered species Z. texana. Bayesian dating estimated the divergence of North American Zizania to be 0.71 (95% HPD: 0.12-1.54) mya in the Pleistocene. The non-monophyly of Z. palustris and Z. aquatica in the organellar and nuclear data is most likely caused by incomplete lineage sorting, yet low-frequency unidirectional introgression of Z. palustris into Z. aquatica is present in the nuclear data as well.

[Association between polymorphisms in pigment epithelium-derived factor gene promoter region and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus]. To investigate the association of serum pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) level and polymorphisms in PEDF gene promoter region -358G→A with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of Han Nationality in Fujian Province. A total of 282 T2DM patients with NAFLD (DM1 group) and 170 age- and gender-matched T2DM patients without NAFLD (DM2 group) were examined for PEDF gene SNP-358G→A polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Serum pigment epithelium-derived factor(PEDF) level, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also measured. The patients in DM1 group showed a significantly higher mean level of serum PEDF than those in DM2 group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that PEDF level was an independent risk factor for NAFLD in T2DM. The frequencies of PEDF gene -358G→A genotypes (GG, GA, and AA) and alleles (G/A) differed significanly between DM1 and DM2 groups (P<0.05). In terms of PEDF gene SNP -358G→A alleles, the GA genotype carriers had a 2.032 times higher risk of developing NAFLD compared with the GG genotype carriers, and the risk increased to 2.068 times in the carriers of the A allele (GA and AA genotypes; P<0.05). Serum PEDF level is an independent risk factor of NAFLD in T2DM. Elevated serum PEDF level is a protective factor against insulin resistance. In T2DM patients, PEDF gene promoter region -358G→A polymorphism is associated with NAFLD, and the A allele contributes to an increased risk of NAFLD.

A virtual approach to evaluate therapies for management of multiple myeloma induced bone disease. Multiple myeloma bone disease is devastating for patients and a major cause of morbidity. The disease leads to bone destruction by inhibiting osteoblast activity while stimulating osteoclast activity. Recent advances in multiple myeloma research have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma-induced bone disease and suggest several potential therapeutic strategies. However, the effectiveness of some potential therapeutic strategies still requires further investigation and optimization. In this paper, a recently developed mathematical model is extended to mimic and then evaluate three therapies of the disease, namely: bisphosphonates, bortezomib and TGF-β inhibition. The model suggests that bisphosphonates and bortezomib treatments not only inhibit bone destruction, but also reduce the viability of myeloma cells. This contributes to the current debate as to whether bisphosphonate therapy has an anti-tumour effect. On the other hand, the analyses indicate that treatments designed to inhibit TGF-β do not reduce bone destruction, although it appears that they might reduce the viability of myeloma cells, which again contributes to the current controversy regarding the efficacy of TGF-β inhibition in multiple myeloma-induced bone disease.

The hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale uses complexation with nitrogen and oxygen donor ligands for Ni transport and storage. The Kotodesh genotype of the nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale was examined to determine the compartmentalization and internal speciation of Ni, and other elements, in an effort to ascertain the mechanism used by this plant to tolerate extremely high shoot (stem and leaf) Ni concentrations. Plants were grown either hydroponically or in Ni enriched soils from an area surrounding an historic Ni refinery in Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada. Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and synchrotron based micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-SXRF) spectroscopy were used to determine the metal distribution and co-localization and synchrotron X-ray and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopies were used to determine the Ni speciation in plant parts and extracted sap. Nickel is concentrated in the dermal leaf and stem tissues of A. murale bound primarily to malate along with other low molecular weight organic ligands and possibly counter anions (e.g., sulfate). Ni is present in the plant sap and vasculature bound to histidine, malate and other low molecular weight compounds. The data presented herein supports a model in which Ni is transported from the roots to the shoots complexed with histidine and stored within the plant leaf dermal tissues complexed with malate, and other low molecular weight organic acids or counter-ions.


Biomimetic image processing for retinal prostheses: peripheral saliency cues.

New approach for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation using bacterial spores entrapped in chitosan beads. Spores of Bacillus subtilis LAMI008 were entrapped in 3-mm chitosan beads and cross-linked with 0.3% glutaraldehyde for n-hexadecane biodegradation and biosurfactant recovery. When exposed to nutrients, the spores generated vegetative cells without morphological alterations as revealed by atomic force microscopy. The entrapped cells degraded almost 100% of 1% of n-hexadecane in medium supplemented with 1% glucose and produce biosurfactant within 48 h, as well as free cells. The number of viable cells inside the beads was maintained throughout the n-hexadecane degradation process and the released biosurfactant was not used as a carbon source. Entrapment of bacterial spores in chitosan beads overcomes problems with stability, storage, and long term cell viability encountered with vegetative cells. This approach can potentially be utilized for biodegradation of complex compounds by entrapping spores of different species of bacteria.

Nonlinear model of single hippocampal neurons with dynamical thresholds. Neurons transform a series of presynaptic spikes into a series of postsynaptic spikes through a number of nonlinear mechanisms. A nonlinear model with a dynamical threshold was built using a Volterra Laguerre kernel method to characterize the spike train to spike train transformations of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Inputs of the model were broadband Poisson random impulse trains with a 2 Hz mean frequency, and outputs of the model were the corresponding evoked post-synaptic potential (PSP) and spike train data recorded from CA1 cell bodies using a whole-cell recording technique. The model consists of four major components, i.e., feedforward kernels representing the transformation of presynaptic spikes to PSPs; a dynamical threshold kernel determining threshold value based on output inter-spike-intervals (ISIs); a spike detector; and a feedback kernel representing the spike-triggered after-potentials.

Guarding the frontiers: the biology of type III interferons. Type III interferons (IFNs) or IFN-λs regulate a similar set of genes as type I IFNs, but whereas type I IFNs act globally, IFN-λs primarily target mucosal epithelial cells and protect them against the frequent viral attacks that are typical for barrier tissues. IFN-λs thereby help to maintain healthy mucosal surfaces through immune protection, without the significant immune-related pathogenic risk associated with type I IFN responses. Type III IFNs also target the human liver, with dual effects: they induce an antiviral state in hepatocytes, but specific IFN-λ4 action impairs the clearance of hepatitis C virus and could influence inflammatory responses. This constitutes a paradox that has yet to be resolved. 

Ligand-enabled reactivity and selectivity in a synthetically versatile aryl C-H olefination. The Mizoroki-Heck reaction, which couples aryl halides with olefins, has been widely used to stitch together the carbogenic cores of numerous complex organic molecules. Given that the position-selective introduction of a halide onto an arene is not always straightforward, direct olefination of aryl carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds would obviate the inefficiencies associated with generating halide precursors or their equivalents. However, methods for carrying out such a reaction have suffered from narrow substrate scope and low positional selectivity. We report an operationally simple, atom-economical, carboxylate-directed Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H olefination reaction with phenylacetic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid substrates, using oxygen at atmospheric pressure as the oxidant. The positional selectivity can be tuned by introducing amino acid derivatives as ligands. We demonstrate the versatility of the method through direct elaboration of commercial drug scaffolds and efficient syntheses of 2-tetralone and naphthoic acid natural product cores.

[Determination of diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in greasy wool by accelerated solvent extraction technique and high performance liquid chromatography]. A method for the determination of diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in greasy wool was developed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). The diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues were extracted with acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane at 80 degrees C and 10.34 MPa. The extract was pretreated by a series of procedures such as freezing-lipid filtration, concentration and purification by solid-phase extraction prior to the determination with HPLC. The target analytes were separated on a Waters Atlants dC18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), gradiently eluted with acetonitrile and water as the mobile phases and detected by a photodiode array detector (DAD) at 254 nm. The linear ranges were 0.1 - 10.0 mg/L. There were good linearity between the peak areas and concentrations in the linear range for the analytes, and the correlation coefficients of diflubenzuron and triflumuron were higher than 0.9999. The limits of quantification for diflubenzuron and triflumuron were 0.05 and 0.04 mg/kg (S/N > or = 10), respectively. The method is simple, rapid, sensitive and suitable for preliminary screening of diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in greasy wool.

New architectures for Tet-on and Tet-off regulation in Staphylococcus aureus. Inducible expression is a valuable approach for the elucidation of gene functions. Here, we present new configurations of the tetracycline-dependent gene regulation (tet) system for Staphylococcus aureus. To provide improved and expanded modes of control, strains and plasmids were constructed for the constitutive expression of tetR or a variant allele, rev-tetR(r2). The encoded regulators respond differently to the effector anhydrotetracycline (ATc), which causes target gene expression to be induced with TetR or repressed with rev-TetR. To quantify and compare regulation mediated by episomal or chromosomal (rev-)tetR constructs, expression from a chromosomal P(xyl/tet)-gfpmut2 fusion was measured. Chromosomally encoded TetR showed tight repression and allowed high levels of dose-dependent gene expression in response to ATc. Regulatory abilities were further verified using a strain in which a native S. aureus gene (zwf) was put under tet control in its native chromosomal location. Tight repression was reflected by transcript amounts, which were barely detectable under repressed conditions and high in ATc-treated cells. In reporter gene assays, this type of control, termed Tet-on, was more efficient than Tet-off regulation, in which addition of ATc causes downregulation of a target gene. The latter was achieved and quantified by direct rev-TetR control of P(xyl/tet)-gfpmut2. Additionally, TetR was used in trans to control the expression of antisense RNA for posttranscriptional gene silencing. Induction of antisense RNA expression of the fabI gene caused pronounced growth retardation lasting several hours. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the new tet systems and their flexible use for different purposes.

Employment change and the role of the medical home for married and single-mother families with children with special health care needs. One in five U.S. households with children has at least one child with a special health care need (USDHHS, 2004). Like most parents, those with children with special health care needs struggle to balance child-rearing responsibilities with employment demands. This research examines factors affecting married parents' and single-mother's employment change decisions focusing specifically on whether having a medical home influences these decisions. This study includes 38,569 children with special health care needs from birth through age 17 surveyed in the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. The employment model is estimated using multinomial logistic regression with the choice of a parent to maintain their current level of employment, reduce work hours, or stop working as the dependent variable. Independent variables are those characterizing the needs of the child, the resources of the family, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the family. Components of the medical home variable include: 1) having a usual source of care; 2) care provided is "family centered"; 3) receipt of care coordination services; and 4) receipt of needed referrals. Half of the children in our sample met criteria in all four facets. If the child has a medical home, the relative risk of a parent choosing to cut hours rather than not change hours decreases by 51%. The relative risk of choosing to stop working rather than not change hours decreases by an estimated 64%. Care coordination services significantly reduce the odds of changing employment status. Our results suggest that the medical home is a moderating factor in parental decisions concerning change in employment status.

[Influenza a (H1N1) virus infection in humans: review to 30th October 2009].

Assessment of the quality of fall detection and management in primary care in the Netherlands based on the ACOVE quality indicators. We determined adherence to nine fall-related ACOVE quality indicators to investigate the quality of management of falls in the elderly population by general practitioners in the Netherlands. Our findings demonstrate overall low adherence to these indicators, possibly indicating insufficiency in the quality of fall management. Most indicators showed a positive association between increased risk for functional decline and adherence, four of which with statistical significance. This study aims to investigate the quality of detection and management of falls in the elderly population by general practitioners in the Netherlands, using the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE) quality indicators. Community-dwelling persons aged 70 years or above, registered in participating general practices, were asked to fill in a questionnaire designed to determine general practitioner (GP) adherence to fall-related indicators. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between increased risk for functional decline-quantified by the Identification of Seniors At Risk for Primary Care score-and adherence. We then cross-validated the self-reported falls with medical records. Of the 950 elders responding to our questionnaire, only 10.6 % reported that their GP proactively asked them about falls. Of the 160 patients who reported two or more falls, or one fall for which they visited the GP, only 23.1 % had fall documentation in their records. Adherence ranged between 13.6 and 48.6 %. There was a significant positive association between the ISAR-PC scores and adherence in four QIs. Documentation of falls was highest (36.7 %) in patients whom the GP had proactively asked about falls. Based on patient self-reports, adherence to the ACOVE fall-related indicators was poor, suggesting that the quality of evaluation and management of falls in community-dwelling older persons in the Netherlands is poor. The documentation of falls and fall-related risk factors was also poor. However, for most QIs, adherence to them increased with the increase in the risk of functional decline.

Clinical features, management and in-hospital outcome of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in young adults under 40 years of age. This study was designed to evaluate the demographic and clinical findings and in-hospital management and outcome in patients with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). By review of the Cardiovascular Tehran Heart Center Registry (CVDTHCR), 2028 patients were found to have the acute STEMI. We compared the patients' characteristics in 109 (5.4%) subjects < or = 40 and 1919 subjects > 40-years-old. The young patients had less diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and history of MI or prior revascularization, and were more likely to be male (92.7% vs. 74%), smoker (58.7% vs. 31.7%) and have family history of CVD (50.5% vs. 23.4%). The young patients had higher prevalence of angiographically normal coronary artery (13.7% vs. 0.9%; p<0.001). The young patients were more likely to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (38.5% vs. 18.6%), whereas coronary artery bypass grafting was more common in the old ones (p<0.001). In-hospital death was markedly different among young and old patients (0.9% and 6.1%, respectively; p<0.01). In STEMI population, the risk profile, clinical findings and severity of coronary disease of the young differ substantially from the elderly counterparts. Young patients with STEMI have a favorable outcome compared with that in older patients.

Clinical features and linkage analysis for a Chinese family with autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy. A Chinese family with autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) was identified. The purpose of this study was to collect the clinical findings from the family and to identify the genetic entity by linkage analysis. Forty-three individuals from 3 generations of the family underwent ophthalmologic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, examination of the anterior segments, and inspection of the ocular fundus after pharmacologic mydriasis. Affected family members further underwent color vision test, color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, automated perimetry, and electroretinography. The family was followed up for 30 months. Peripheral venous blood or buccal swabs were collected from each family member and genomic DNA was extracted. Linkage analysis was performed for candidate genes or loci using microsatellite markers. Seven family members in 3 continuous generations were diagnosed as having autosomal dominant CACD. The family showed progressive development of the disease, affecting both male and female. Age of onset of visual disturbances varied between 11 and 50 years. Phenotypic variability among affected individuals was apparent and ranged from relatively normal-appearing fundus with mild parafoveal pigment mottling to geographic atrophy of the macula. Fluorescein angiography showed hyperfluorescent parafoveal changes in early stage or well-demarcated area of chorioretinal atrophy with enhanced visibility of the residual underlying choroidal vessels in the late stage. Peripheral retina and visual fields were normal in affected individuals. Electroretinogram showed normal or mild reduction in the photopic amplitude. Eight candidate genes (STGD4, RCD1, peripherin/RDS, GUCA1A, RIMS1, UNC119, GUCY2D, and AIPL1) and two genetic loci (4p15.2 - 16.3, and 17p13) were excluded to be responsible for the disease by linkage analysis. The clinical findings of this Chinese family with CACD shared similarities with previously reported families of other ethnicities. Linkage analysis excluded the known genes and genetic loci, indicating genetic heterogeneity of the disease.

Identification and confirmation of biomarkers using an integrated platform for quantitative analysis of glycoproteins and their glycosylations. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. However, accurate diagnosis can be difficult as most of the patients who develop this tumor have symptoms similar to those caused by longstanding liver disease. Herein we developed an integrated platform to discover the glycoprotein biomarkers in early HCC. At first, lectin arrays were applied to investigate the differences in glycan structures on serum glycoproteins from HCC and cirrhosis patients. The intensity for AAL and LCA was significantly higher in HCC, indicating an elevation of fucosylation level. Then serum from 10 HCC samples and 10 cirrhosis samples were used to screen the altered fucosylated proteins by a combination of Exactag labeling, lectin extraction and LC-MS/MS. Finally, 27 HCC and 27 cirrhosis serum samples were used for lectin-antibody arrays to confirm the change of these fucosylated proteins. C3, CE, HRG, CD14 and HGF were found to be biomarker candidates for distinguishing early HCC from cirrhosis, with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 79%. Our work gives insight to the detection of early HCC, and the application of this comprehensive strategy has the potential to facilitate biomarker discovery on a large scale.

Universal mass vaccination against rotavirus gastroenteritis: impact on hospitalization rates in austrian children. Since July 2007, rotavirus vaccinations have been subsidized in Austria for all children from the seventh week up to the sixth month of life. Vaccination coverage over the whole period was 72% with an increase to 87% in 2008. In a sentinel network including 11 pediatric hospital wards in Austria, data of children up to 15 years of age and hospitalized due to rotavirus gastroenteritis between January 2001 and December 2008 have been collected. The hospitalization rates of children up to 12 months of age with rotavirus gastroenteritis were 2066 x 10(-5) between 2001 and 2006 and decreased to 631 x 10(-5) in 2008. For children between 12 and 24 months of age the hospitalization rate decreased from 1822 x 10(-5) (2001-2006) to 1456 x 10(-5) in 2008. In children aged 2 to less than 5 years, incidence rates were 436 x10(-5) (2001-2006) and 461 x 10(-5) in 2008. In older children, the hospitalization rates remained unchanged. In the target population for the RV-vaccine, a decrease of hospitalization rates due to rotavirus gastroenteritis of 74% was observed compared to the era before the introduction of the vaccine. The field effectiveness of the vaccine was estimated between 61% and 98%, depending on assumptions about the vaccination status. Within 18 months, the universal mass vaccination program against rotavirus led to a substantial decrease in the hospitalization rates of the target cohort of the immunization program in Austria.

Effect of honey versus intergel in intraperitoneal adhesion prevention and colonic anastomotic healing: a randomized controlled study in rats. Intra-abdominal adhesion formation and reformation after surgery are still an unavoidable event in spite of modern surgical techniques and are a cause of significant morbidity, resulting in infertility, pain and intestinal obstruction. To investigate the effect of honey in adhesion prevention and colonic anastomotic healing in rats. In the present study, 75 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used and divided into 3 groups for study: [25 rats for each], the intergel, honey and control groups. After the scheduled two-week's post-operative period, all survived rats were reopened for second-look laparotomy to detect the following parameters: a - adhesion, b - manometric study, c - histopathological study. The author found that the total adhesion score, the manometric values and the histopathological study among the three studied groups showed statistically significant difference and in favor of the honey-treated rats. Honey surpasses the intergel for the healing power and adhesion prevention.

[Complicated hydatid cysts of the lung]. Hydatid disease which is caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosis is one of the most important helminthic diseases. The parasitic infection is endemic in many areas worldwide, including the Mediterranean region. The lung is the second most common involved organ. In the present study, we review cases of complicated pulmonary hydatidosis, discussing pathophysiological mechanisms and the clinical, radiological features, as well as natural history and therapeutic options. A retrospective study was conducted in the adult pulmonary department of The Tunis Chest Diseases and Surgery Training Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital for pulmonary diseases in Tunisia. 52 cases (mean age=34.6 years) were evaluated between 1998 and 2008. Rupture of the hydatid cyst occurred into the bronchi in the majority of cases (86.5%) and into the pleura in 9.6%. Extrathoracic involvement was found in 17.3% of the cases. Diagnosis of pulmonary hydatidosis was based on a consistent clinical and radiological presentation. Recourse to CT scan of the chest was helpful for diagnosis in 28% of the patients. Fibre-optic bronchoscopy (performed in 64.5% of cases) confirmed the diagnosis in 4 patients with total endoscopic extraction of hydatid cyst membrane in 2 cases. Surgical treatment was performed in 44 cases; resection of lung parenchyma was necessary in 8 patients (18.2%). Medical treatment was associated in 2 cases. Outcome revealed recurrence of pulmonary hydatidosis in 3 patients, and the death of 1 patient with chronic pulmonary hypertension due to chronic hydatid pulmonary embolism. Complicated pulmonary hydatidosis may present some diagnostic difficulties, even in endemic regions. Management may be difficult, costly, and may require pulmonary resections.

Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) regulates adipocyte differentiation via forkhead box O1. The serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is an inducible kinase the physiological function of which has been characterized primarily in the kidney. Here we show that SGK1 is expressed in white adipose tissue and that its levels are induced in the conversion of preadipocytes into fat cells. Adipocyte differentiation is significantly diminished via small interfering RNA inhibition of endogenous SGK1 expression, whereas ectopic expression of SGK1 in mesenchymal precursor cells promotes adipogenesis. The SGK1-mediated phenotypic effects on differentiation parallel changes in the mRNA levels for critical regulators and markers of adipogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, and fatty acid binding protein aP2. We demonstrate that SGK1 affects differentiation by direct phosphorylation of Foxo1, thereby changing its cellular localization from the nucleus to the cytosol. In addition we show that SGK1-/- cells are unable to relocalize Foxo1 to the cytosol in response to dexamethasone. Together these results show that SGK1 influences adipocyte differentiation by regulating Foxo1 phosphorylation and reveal a potentially important function for this kinase in the control of fat mass and function.


Effect of atorvastatin on platelet thromboxane A(2) synthesis in aspirin-treated patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Genetic structure of tree and shrubby species among anthropogenic edges, natural edges, and interior of an atlantic forest fragment. Two species, Psychotria tenuinervis (shrub, Rubiaceae) and Guarea guidonia (tree, Meliaceae), were used as models to compare the genetic structure of tree and shrubby species among natural edges, anthropogenic edges, and a fragment interior. There were significant differences between two genetic markers. For isozymes, P. tenuinervis presented greater heterozygosity (expected and observed) and a higher percentage of polymorphic loci and median number of alleles than G. guidonia. For microsatellites, there was no difference in genetic variability between the species. Only P. tenuinervis, for isozymes, showed differences in genetic variability among the three habitats. There was no genetic structure (F (ST) < 0.05) among habitats in both plant species for both genetic markers. Isozymes showed great endogamy for both plant species, but not microsatellites. The forest fragmentation may have negative effects on both spatial (among edges and interior) and temporal genetic variability.

Attachment stability and the emergence of unresolved representations during adolescence. This 15-year longitudinal study examined the stability of attachment representations from infancy to adolescence and investigated the emergence of unresolved representations during adolescence in a sample of 47 16-year-olds. Attachment was assessed at 12 months using the Strange Situation Procedure, at 4 years using the modified Strange Situation Procedure, and again at 16 years with the Adult Attachment Projective (AAP). The emergence of unresolved classifications in adolescence (AAP) was associated with higher rates of negative life events, low levels of early mother-child relationship security (an aggregate measure of the 12-month and 4-year measures), negative teacher-child relationship experiences in middle childhood, and low early adolescent friendship quality. The results support the growing body of evidence suggesting that changes in attachment are lawful, while adding to the growing understanding of the emergence of unresolved attachment representations.

Ethnic differences in the prevalence of general and central obesity among the Sami and Norwegian populations: the SAMINOR study. To estimate the prevalence of general (body mass index) and central (waist circumference and waist/hip ratio) obesity in an area with a mixed Sami and Norwegian population. A cross-sectional population-based study carried out in 2003- 2004, the SAMINOR study. The attendance rate was 60.6%. A total of 7,301 men and 7,841 women, aged 36-79, were included in the analyses. Height, weight, waist and hip circumference were measured, body mass index (BMI) calculated and information concerning lifestyle was collected by questionnaire. The prevalence of general obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2)) in participants who had Sami as their home language for three generations (Sami I) and Norwegian participants was 38.7% and 24.3% for women respectively; and for men 26.9% and 23.4% respectively. More than 40% of the women had central obesity (waist circumference > or = 88 cm), and the highest prevalence was found in Sami I women (45%). The highest prevalence of central obesity (waist circumference > or = 102 cm) was found in Norwegian men (24.2%). The ethnic differences persisted after adjustment for age, education, physical activity in leisure time, and smoking habits. The prevalence of obesity was high in this population and central obesity was most pronounced in women, particularly in Sami women. Sami men were less obese than Norwegian men. Further studies are necessary to examine a possible explanation for these findings, especially to elaborate on the impact of diet.

Do robotic and non-robotic arm movement training drive motor recovery after stroke by a common neural mechanism? Experimental evidence and a computational model. Different dose-matched, upper extremity rehabilitation training techniques, including robotic and non-robotic techniques, can result in similar improvement in movement ability after stroke, suggesting they may elicit a common drive for recovery. Here we report experimental results that support the hypothesis of a common drive, and develop a computational model of a putative neural mechanism for the common drive. We compared weekly motor control recovery during robotic and unassisted movement training techniques after chronic stroke (n = 27), as assessed with quantitative measures of strength, speed, and coordination. The results showed that recovery in both groups followed an exponential time course with a time constant of about 4-5 weeks. Despite the greater range and speed of movement practiced by the robot group, motor recovery was very similar between the groups. The premise of the computational model is that improvements in motor control are caused by improvements in the ability to activate spared portions of the damaged corticospinal system, as learned by a biologically plausible search algorithm. Robot-assisted and unassisted training would in theory equally drive this search process.

Molecular cloning and expression of a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin gene in the crustacean Eurypanopeus depressus induced by acute hypo-osmotic stress. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a family of ubiquitous proteins that help minimize the harmful effects of oxidative stress by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides to less harmful forms. A full-length cDNA corresponding to a 2-Cys Prx gene was isolated from the flatback mud crab Eurypanopeus depressus and designated as EdPrx-1 (GenBank accession no. EU684547). EdPrx-1 has a major open-reading frame of 594 bp and is capable of encoding a polypeptide of 198 amino acid residues. Like other 2-Cys Prxs, EdPrx-1 protein possesses two conserved cysteine residues that play an essential role for the antioxidant activity of the proteins. The EdPrx-1 protein, as deduced from the cDNA sequence, shows a high level (74-93%) of sequence similarity to the 2-Cys Prxs from other crustaceans as well as those from many arthropod species (73-76% similarity). It shares about 70% sequence similarity with homologs from mammalian species. EdPrx-1 gene is expressed at low level in the gill, hypodermis, and hepatopancreas tissues of the crab under non-stressed condition; however, its expression is elevated about three-fold in the gills under hypo-osmotic stress. This suggests a possible role in protecting against oxidative stress caused by the increased metabolic activities associated with hyperosmoregulation.

Atorvastatin inhibits gp91phox circulating levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The inhibition of oxidative stress is among the most relevant pleiotropic effects of statins. The mechanism by which statins exert their antioxidant effect in vivo is still undefined. NADPH oxidase is among the most important sources of reactive oxygen species involved in atherosclerotic disease. Methods/Results- We developed an ELISA to evaluate serum levels of soluble-gp91(phox), the catalytic core of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In a cross-sectional study performed in 30 hypercholesterolemic patients and in 20 controls, serum soluble-gp91(phox) and urinary isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were measured. The 2 variables were also measured in hypercholesterolemic patients, randomized to diet (n=15), or diet plus atorvastatin (10 mg daily, n=15) and followed for 30 days. Compared to controls, hypercholesterolemic patients had higher and significantly correlated (R=0.71; P<0.001) serum soluble-gp91(phox) (P<0.001) and urinary isoprostanes (P<0.001). After follow-up, the statin-allocated group showed a significant reduction of soluble-gp91(phox) (-33%, P<0.01), that paralleled that of isoprostanes (-37%, P<0.01) and cholesterol (-25%, P<0.01). The diet-allocated group showed only a weak reduction of cholesterol. Our study demonstrates that statins exert an antioxidant effect via inhibition of soluble gp91(phox) expression.


Cerebrospinal fluid progranulin levels in patients with different multiple sclerosis subtypes.

Seizure prediction using cost-sensitive support vector machine. Approximately 300,000 Americans suffer from epilepsy but no treatment currently exists. A device that could predict a seizure and notify the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. A patient-specific classification algorithm is proposed to distinguish between preictal and interictal features extracted from EEG recordings. It demonstrates that the classifier based on a Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machine (CSVM) can distinguish preictal from interictal with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, when applied to linear features of power spectrum in 9 different frequency bands. The proposed algorithm was applied to EEG recordings of 9 patients in the Freiburg EEG database, totaling 45 seizures and 219-hour-long interictal, and it produced sensitivity of 77.8% (35 of 45 seizures) and the zero false positive rate using 5-minute-long window of preictal via double-cross validation. This approach is advantageous, for it can help an implantable device for seizure prediction consume less power by real-time analysis based on extraction of linear features and by offline optimization, which may be computationally intensive and by real-time analysis.

Coi-wiz: An interactive computer wizard for analyzing cardiac optical signals. A number of revolutionary techniques have been developed for cardiac electrophysiology research to better study the various arrhythmia mechanisms that can enhance ablating strategies for cardiac arrhythmias. Once the three-dimensional high resolution cardiac optical imaging data is acquired, it is time consuming to manually go through them and try to identify the patterns associated with various arrhythmia symptoms. In this paper, we present an interactive computer wizard that helps cardiac electrophysiology researchers to visualize and analyze the high resolution cardiac optical imaging data. The wizard provides a file interface that accommodates different file formats. A series of analysis algorithms output waveforms, activation and action potential maps after spatial and temporal filtering, velocity field and heterogeneity measure.

The immunoregulatory role of vitamins A, D and E in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the immunomodulating role of fat-soluble vitamins in 25 patients with primary SS (pSS) and 15 healthy individuals. Plasma levels of vitamins A, D and E were determined by HPLC. Peripheral NK, NK T cells, T-cell subsets, B cells, IL-10 producing Tr1 cells, CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells and Th17 were determined by flow cytometry. Various Th1- and Th2-soluble cytokines were assessed by ELISA, whereas intracytoplasmic cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, -10 and -17) were measured by flow cytometry. Correlation was assessed between vitamin levels and immunological and clinical parameters. Vitamin A levels did not differ between patients and controls, yet in patients with extraglandular manifestations (EGMs) a significant decrease in vitamin A levels was apparent compared with pSS patients without EGMs (P = 0.005). Vitamin E levels were increased in patients compared with controls (P = 0.004), whereas vitamin D levels were similar in pSS and control subjects. In patients, vitamin A showed a positive correlation with both NK cell (P = 0.038) and Th17 cell (P = 0.025), and a negative correlation with Schirmer's test values (P = 0.035). Positive correlation was found between vitamin E and NK cells (P = 0.043), Th1 cells (P = 0.049) and the Th1/Th2 ratio (P = 0.043). In the control group, we found correlation between vitamin E and serum IL-10 levels (P = 0.003). Our data suggest that fat-soluble vitamins may be important in immunoregulatory processes in patients with pSS.

Bronchial compression as adverse effect of left pulmonary artery stenting in a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. A 5-year-old child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was noted to have left pulmonary artery stenosis after Glenn shunt placement. Therefore, a stent was implanted into the left pulmonary artery to relieve stenosis. After redilatation of the pulmonary artery stent, wheezing, fatigue, asymmetric bronchial sound, and desaturation was noted. Computed tomography, bronchoscopy, and bronchography confirmed critical left main bronchus compression as a consequence of the mass effect of the dilated stent. Balloon plasty of the left bronchus successfully relieved bronchial stenosis. Tracheobronchial obstruction is a possible adverse effect of vascular stenting in children with congenital heart defects. Balloon plasty seems to be a safe and efficient therapeutic option in those cases.

[Factors associated with maintenance of teeth in adults in the State of São Paulo, Brazil]. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between the presence of 20 or more teeth and sociodemographic and economic variables, use of dental care, and self-perceived oral health in adults. The sample consisted of 1,612 individuals aged 35 to 44 years, representative of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. In addition to the dental examination, subjects answered a questionnaire. Analysis in this study was limited to dentate individuals, divided into two groups (1 to 19 versus 20 or more teeth). The chi-square test and logistic regression were used (p < 0.05). Most individuals (72.1%) had more than 20 teeth. Less schooling was heavily associated with tooth loss, as were female gender, older age, rural residence, 5 or more people in the same household, low income, seeking treatment in the public health system, and seeking care due to toothache.

Epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), or secondary hypogonadism, is a clinical condition due to an impairment of the pituitary function, characterized by low testosterone plasma levels associated with normal or low FSH and LH plasma levels. An impairment of gonadotropin secretion and, therefore, a reduced efficiency of spermatogenesis was reported to be frequently associated to conditions different from the classical causes of secondary hypogonadism. These conditions (metabolic, endocrine and eating disorders, physical exercise etc.) have been associated with a non-classical form of HH that could be called "functional" HH (FHH). FHH differs from the classical one by the evidence that gonadotropin levels are in the low-normal range, but are inadequate for the testosterone levels, that often are also in the low-normal range. This commentary aims at reviewing knowledge on the forms of male HH in order to indicate and discuss clinical context, diagnostic and therapeutic approach in the less known non-classical form, i.e. FHH.

Incremental prognostic values of serum tenascin-C levels with blood B-type natriuretic peptide testing at discharge in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. This study investigates the predictive value of serum tenascin-C (TN-C), which is observed at the active sites of ongoing tissue remodeling, for cardiac events of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this trial, 110 consecutive patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) resulting from DCM underwent assessments of serum TN-C and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at discharge and were followed up for 22.4 months. Cardiac function and hemodynamics were assessed invasively in 60 of these patients at discharge. There were 19 cardiac events (14 rehospitalizations, 3 deaths from refractory HF, and 2 sudden deaths) during follow-up. The average levels of TN-C and BNP were 73 +/- 38 ng/mL and 279 +/- 414 pg/mL, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for serum TN-C levels predicted cardiac events were >or=78.4 ng/mL, whereas BNP levels were >or=219 pg/mL. Patients with levels higher than this had significantly higher cardiac events and serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL had an incremental predictive power with BNP for cardiac events. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly larger, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated in patients with serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL. The combined index of serum levels for TN-C and BNP at discharge predicts cardiac events from decompensated HF. Additionally, elevated serum TN-C levels reflect left ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling in DCM patients.

Multiple mechanisms mediate motor neuron migration in the zebrafish hindbrain. The transmembrane protein Van gogh-like 2 (Vangl2) is a component of the noncanonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, and is required for tangential migration of facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) from rhombomere 4 (r4) to r5-r7 in the vertebrate hindbrain. Since vangl2 is expressed throughout the zebrafish hindbrain, it might also regulate motor neuron migration in other rhombomeres. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether migration of motor neurons out of r2 following ectopic hoxb1b expression was affected in vangl2(-) (trilobite) mutants. Hoxb1b specifies r4 identity, and when ectopically expressed transforms r2 to an "r4-like" compartment. Using time-lapse imaging, we show that GFP-expressing motor neurons in the r2/r3 region of a hoxb1b-overexpressing wild-type embryo migrate along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Furthermore, these cells express prickle1b (pk1b), a Wnt/PCP gene that is specifically expressed in FBMNs and is essential for their migration. Importantly, GFP-expressing motor neurons in the r2/r3 region of hoxb1b-overexpressing trilobite mutants and pk1b morphants often migrate, even though FBMNs in r4 of the same embryos fail to migrate longitudinally (tangentially) into r6 and r7. These observations suggest that tangentially migrating motor neurons in the anterior hindbrain (r1-r3) can use mechanisms that are independent of vangl2 and pk1b functions. Interestingly, analysis of tri; val double mutants also suggests a role for vangl2-independent factors in neuronal migration, since the valentino mutation partially suppresses the trilobite mutant migration defect. Together, the hoxb1b and val experiments suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate motor neuron migration along the AP axis of the zebrafish hindbrain.

AIP1 functions as Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate TLR4 signaling. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is unique among the Toll-like receptors in its ability to utilize TLR/IL1R-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), which recruits TLR4-MyD88 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2))-rich sites on the plasma membrane, to activate NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. Here, we show that AIP1 disrupts formation of the TLR4- TIRAP-MyD88 complex without directly binding to any of the complex components. AIP1 via its pleckstrin homology and C2 domains binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid precursor of PIP(2). Knock-out of AIP1 in cells increases and overexpression of AIP1 reduces cellular PIP(2) levels. We further show that AIP1 is a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6, a small GTPase regulating cellular PIP(2) production and formation of the TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 complex. Thus, deletion of the GAP domain on AIP1 results in a loss of its ability to mediate the inhibition of Arf6- and TLR4-induced signaling events. We conclude that AIP1 functions as a novel Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate PIP(2)-dependent TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 signaling.

Comparison of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thinning and Retinal Ganglion Cell Loss After Optic Nerve Transection in Adult Albino Rats. We compared the time-course and magnitude of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning with that of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss after intraorbital optic nerve transection (IONT) in adult rats. At 3, 7, 12, or 21 days, or 1, 2, or 4 months after ONT, the retinas were imaged with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using the circular-peripapillary scan and volume scan raster pattern (61 horizontal sections equally spaced) both centered in the optic nerve. In all sections, the RNFL and retinal thickness were measured to obtain the total values of the peripapillary scan and the values of three concentric sectors (400, 1200, and 2400 μm in diameter) from the volume scan. After SD-OCT, retinas were dissected and immunoreacted for Brn3a and neurofilaments (pNFH) to identify RGCs and their intraretinal axons, respectively. Total numbers of RGCs were quantified. Thinning of the RNFL was first observed at 12 days in peripapillary scan (10% decrease) and progressed up to 4 months (72% decrease). The volume scan showed transient RNFL swelling in central and medial sectors at 3, 7, and 12 days followed by progressive significant thinning first observed at 21 days (central sector, 30%; medial sector, 40%) and 12 days (peripheral sector, 15%), respectively. Following IONT, Brn3a+ RGCs decreased to approximately 80%, 52%, 17%, 9%, 5%, 3%, and 2% at 3, 7, 12, 21 days, and at 1, 2, and 4 months, respectively. Retinal ganglion cell axon immunodetection decreased from 12 days onwards. After IONT, RGC death is more severe and precedes thinning of the RNFL.

Bioavailability of xenobiotics in the soil environment. It is often presumed that all chemicals in soil are available to microorganisms, plant roots, and soil fauna via dermal exposure. Subsequent bioaccumulation through the food chain may then result in exposure to higher organisms. Using the presumption of total availability, national governments reduce environmental threshold levels of regulated chemicals by increasing guideline safety margins. However, evidence shows that chemical residues in the soil environment are not always bioavailable. Hence, actual chemical exposure levels of biota are much less than concentrations present in soil would suggest. Because "bioavailability" conveys meaning that combines implications of chemical sol persistency, efficacy, and toxicity, insights on the magnitude of a chemicals soil bioavailability is valuable. however, soil bioavailability of chemicals is a complex topic, and is affected by chemical properties, soil properties, species exposed, climate, and interaction processes. In this review, the state-of-art scientific basis for bioavailability is addressed. Key points covered include: definition, factors affecting bioavailability, equations governing key transport and distributive kinetics, and primary methods for estimating bioavailability. Primary transport mechanisms in living organisms, critical to an understanding of bioavailability, also presage the review. Transport of lipophilic chemicals occurs mainly by passive diffusion for all microorganisms, plants, and soil fauna. Therefore, the distribution of a chemical between organisms and soil (bioavailable proportion) follows partition equilibrium theory. However, a chemical's bioavailability does not always follow partition equilibrium theory because of other interactions with soil, such as soil sorption, hysteretic desorption, effects of surfactants in pore water, formation of "bound residue", etc. Bioassays for estimating chemical bioavailability have been introduced with several targeted endpoints: microbial degradation, uptake by higher plants and soil fauna, and toxicity to organisms. However, there bioassays are often time consuming and laborious. Thus, mild extraction methods have been employed to estimate bioavailability of chemicals. Mild methods include sequential extraction using alcohols, hexane/water, supercritical fluids (carbon dioxide), aqueous hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin extraction, polymeric TENAX beads extraction, and poly(dimethylsiloxane)-coated solid-phase microextraction. It should be noted that mild extraction methods may predict bioavailability at the moment when measurements are carried out, but not the changes in bioavailability that may occur over time. Simulation models are needed to estimate better bioavailability as a function of exposure time. In the past, models have progressed significantly by addressing each group of organisms separately: microbial degradation, plant uptake via evapotranspiration processes, and uptake of soil fauna in their habitat. This approach has been used primarily because of wide differences in the physiology and behaviors of such disparate organisms. However, improvement of models is badly needed, Particularly to describe uptake processes by plant and animals that impinge on bioavailability. Although models are required to describe all important factors that may affect chemical bioavailability to individual organisms over time (e.g., sorption/desorption to soil/sediment, volatilization, dissolution, aging, "bound residue" formation, biodegradation, etc.), these models should be simplified, when possible, to limit the number of parameters to the practical minimum. Although significant scientific progress has been made in understanding the complexities in specific methodologies dedicated to determining bioavailability, no method has yet emerged to characterized bioavailability across a wide range of chemicals, organisms, and soils/sediments. The primary aim in studying bioavailability is to define options for addressing bioremediation or environmental toxicity (risk assessment), and that is unlikely to change. Because of its importance in estimating research is needed to more comprehensively address the key environmental issue of "bioavailability of chemicals in soil/sediment."

Labour intensity of guidelines may have a greater effect on adherence than GPs' workload. Physicians' heavy workload is often thought to jeopardise the quality of care and to be a barrier to improving quality. The relationship between these has, however, rarely been investigated. In this study quality of care is defined as care 'in accordance with professional guidelines'. In this study we investigated whether GPs with a higher workload adhere less to guidelines than those with a lower workload and whether guideline recommendations that require a greater time investment are less adhered to than those that can save time. Data were used from the Second Dutch National survey of General Practice (DNSGP-2). This nationwide study was carried out between April 2000 and January 2002.A multilevel logistic-regression analysis was conducted of 170,677 decisions made by GPs, referring to 41 Guideline Adherence Indicators (GAIs), which were derived from 32 different guidelines. Data were used from 130 GPs, working in 83 practices with 98,577 patients. GP-characteristics as well as guideline characteristics were used as independent variables. Measures include workload (number of contacts), hours spent on continuing medical education, satisfaction with available time, practice characteristics and patient characteristics. Outcome measure is an indicator score, which is 1 when a decision is in accordance with professional guidelines or 0 when the decision deviates from guidelines. On average, 66% of the decisions GPs made were in accordance with guidelines. No relationship was found between the objective workload of GPs and their adherence to guidelines. Subjective workload (measured on a five point scale) was negatively related to guideline adherence (OR = 0.95). After controlling for all other variables, the variation between GPs in adherence to guideline recommendations showed a range of less than 10%.84% of the variation in guideline adherence was located at the GAI-level. Which means that the differences in adherence levels between guidelines are much larger than differences between GPs. Guideline recommendations that require an extra time investment during the same consultation are significantly less adhered to: (OR = 0.46), while those that can save time have much higher adherence levels: OR = 1.55). Recommendations that reduce the likelihood of a follow-up consultation for the same problem are also more often adhered to compared to those that have no influence on this (OR = 3.13). No significant relationship was found between the objective workload of GPs and adherence to guidelines. However, guideline recommendations that require an extra time investment are significantly less well adhered to while those that can save time are significantly more often adhered to.

Association of TGFBR2 polymorphism with risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with coronary artery disease. Transforming growth factor ss (TGFss) signaling has been shown to promote myocardial fibrosis and remodeling with coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous studies show a major role for fibrosis in the initiation of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFss pathway genes may be associated with SCA. We examined the association of common SNPs among 12 candidate genes in the TGFss pathway with the risk of SCA. SNPs (n = 617) were genotyped in a case-control study comparing 89 patients with CAD and SCA caused by VA to 520 healthy control subjects. Nineteen SNPs among 5 genes (TGFB2, TGFBR2, SMAD1, SMAD3, SMAD6) were associated with SCA after adjustment for age and sex. After permutation analysis to account for multiple testing, a single SNP in TGFBR2 (rs9838682) was associated with SCA (odds ratio: 1.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 2.54, P = .02). We show an association between a common TGFBR2 polymorphism and risk of SCA caused by VA in the setting of CAD. If validated, these findings support the role of genetic variation in TGFss signaling in SCA susceptibility.

A highly sensitive nonenzymatic glucose sensor based on CuO nanoparticles-modified carbon nanotube electrode. In this report, a novel type of cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) array electrode for sensitive nonenzymatic glucose detection has been fabricated. The morphology of the nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical performance of the CuO/MWCNTs electrode for detection of glucose was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode showed much higher electrocatalytic activity and lower overvoltage than the bare MWCNTs electrode towards oxidation of glucose. At an applied potential of +0.40 V, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode presented a high sensitivity of 2596 microA mM(-1) cm(-2) to glucose. In addition, linear range was obtained over a concentration up to 1.2 mM with a detection limit of 0.2 microM (signal/noise=3). The response time is about 1s with addition of 0.10 mM glucose. More importantly, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode is also highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion, and the interference from the oxidation of common interfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and carbohydrate compounds is effectively avoided. In addition, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode was also used to analyze glucose concentration in human serum samples. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic property, low working potential, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability, and fast amperometric sensing towards oxidation of glucose, thus is promising for the future development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.

Decolorization of anthraquinone Vat Blue 4 by the free cells of an autochthonous bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. Uncontaminated soil, Vat Blue 4 contaminated soil and Vat Blue 4 effluent were screened for heterotrophic bacterial population and the bacterial density were found to be 19.3 x 10(4) Colony Forming Units (CFU)/gm, 5.5 x 10(4) CFU/gm and 1.1 x 10(4) CFU/ml respectively. Student's 't' test analysis affirmed that significant variation prevailed between the three set of 't' tests conducted (P<0.001 to 0.002). The heterotrophic bacterial population of dye contaminated soil comprised of 32.5% of Pseudomonas spp. followed by 27.5% of Bacillus spp., 15.0% of Aeromonas spp., 12.5% of Micrococcus spp. and 12.5% of Achromobacter spp. The optimum inoculums load, pH and temperature were found to be 5% (10 x 10(4) counts), 10 and 35 degrees C respectively. Free cells of B. subtilis decolorized Vat Blue 4 up to 92.30% after 24 hours of treatment. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD(5)) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were reduced up to 50.00, 79.60 and 75.40% respectively.

Risk of differentiated thyroid cancer in relation to adult weight, height and body shape over life: the French E3N cohort. The increasing incidence rate of thyroid cancer warrants investigation of potentially modifiable factors, especially overweightness. Few prospective studies have investigated anthropometry from childhood to adulthood in relation to thyroid cancer. We analyzed data from 91,909 women of the E3N study, a cohort of French women insured by a national health scheme mostly covering teachers with the age of 40-65 years at inclusion in 1990. Risk estimates of first primary differentiated thyroid cancer (n = 317) were computed using Cox proportional hazards models. There was a significant dose-effect relationship between thyroid cancer risk and weight or body mass index (BMI) but not height. Compared with women whose BMI was 18.5-22 kg/m(2), women with BMI 22-25 and those with BMI over 30 had a 39% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7-81] and 76% (12-176) higher risk of thyroid cancer, respectively, with a 21% (5-39) increased risk per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A large body shape from age 35-40 was significantly associated with an increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer when compared with a lean one, while earlier body shapes were not. The highest risk was observed in women whose body shape increased from lean to large between menarche and adulthood, with a HR of 2.17 (95% CI 1.04-4.53) when compared with women who were lean at both periods. Our study adds to the existing evidence in relation to excess weight to the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in women whose body shape increased from menarche to adult age.

The prevalence of radiographic vertebral fractures in Mexican men. The prevalence of radiographically ascertained vertebral fractures in a random sample of 413 in Mexican men is 9.7% (95% CI 6.85-12.55). Increase of vertebral fracture rises with age from 2.0% in the youngest group (50-59 years) to 21.4% in the oldest group (80 years and over). This is the first population-based study of vertebral fractures in Mexican men using a standardized methodology reported in other studies. The presence of radiographic vertebral fractures increases with age. This same pattern was found in Mexican women with steady age increments, but the higher prevalence of fractures in women starts at age 70, whereas in men, the higher prevalence starts a decade later (80 years and over). The standardized prevalence per 1,000 men 50 years and over in the Mexican population for the year 2005 is 65.8 (95% CI 29.9-105.5), and it is 68.6 (95% CI 32.2-108.7) in the US population for the year 2000.

Bioavailability of ibuprofen following oral administration of standard ibuprofen, sodium ibuprofen or ibuprofen acid incorporating poloxamer in healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of sodium ibuprofen and ibuprofen acid incorporating poloxamer with standard ibuprofen acid tablets. Twenty-two healthy volunteers were enrolled into this randomised, single-dose, 3-way crossover, open-label, single-centre, pharmacokinetic study. After 14 hours' fasting, participants received a single dose of 2x200 mg ibuprofen acid tablets (standard ibuprofen), 2x256 mg ibuprofen sodium dihydrate tablets (sodium ibuprofen; each equivalent to 200 mg ibuprofen acid) and 2x200 mg ibuprofen acid incorporating 60 mg poloxamer 407 (ibuprofen/poloxamer). A washout period of 2-7 days separated consecutive dosing days. On each of the 3 treatment days, blood samples were collected post dose for pharmacokinetic analyses and any adverse events recorded. Plasma concentration of ibuprofen was assessed using a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry procedure in negative ion mode. A standard statistical ANOVA model, appropriate for bioequivalence studies, was used and ratios of 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Tmax for sodium ibuprofen was less than half that of standard ibuprofen (median 35 min vs 90 min, respectively; P=0.0002) and Cmax was significantly higher (41.47 microg/mL vs 31.88 microg/mL; ratio test/reference=130.06%, 90% CI 118.86-142.32%). Ibuprofen/poloxamer was bioequivalent to the standard ibuprofen formulation, despite its Tmax being on average 20 minutes shorter than standard ibuprofen (median 75 mins vs 90 mins, respectively; P=0.1913), as the ratio of test/reference=110.48% (CI 100.96-120.89%), which fell within the 80-125% limit of the CPMP and FDA guidelines for bioequivalence. The overall extent of absorption was similar for the three formulations, which were all well tolerated. In terms of Tmax, ibuprofen formulated as a sodium salt was absorbed twice as quickly as from standard ibuprofen acid. The addition of poloxamer to ibuprofen acid did not significantly affect absorption.

Toward functional neurobehavioral assessment of mood and anxiety. Mood and anxiety disorders confer marked personal and fiscal cost. Current therapeutic efforts show only moderate efficacy, and little is known about the characteristics of those who respond to specific treatment regimens. The lack of objective descriptors of symptom severity and reliable predictors of illness outcome contributes to limited diagnostic and treatment success. Here, we have begun to develop a normative neurobehavioral database of responses to affective stimuli by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with comprehensive behavioral assessment and quantitative analyses of neural responses to standard emotional cues. These data reveal robust and distinct neural patterns between two groups with similar low self-reported depression and anxiety, and one group with high depression and anxiety scores. This and related strategies may be used to identify covert phenotypes associated with psychiatric illness and resilience.

Identification of complexes formed by ceruloplasmin with matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 12. Marked sensitivity to proteolytic degradation results in the loss of multiple antioxidant properties of ceruloplasmin (CP), the multicopper oxidase of mammalian plasma. In this study, gel filtration of virtually pure CP (purity 99.7%) yielded complexes of this protein. Subjecting the complexes to SDS-free PAGE revealed other proteins along with CP. These were identified as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-12) by means of tryptic fragment mass spectrometry. Electrophoretic bands corresponding to MMP-2 (72 and 67 kDa) and MMP-12 (22 kDa) displayed gelatinase activity. The identified proteinases contained heparin-binding motifs inherent in the complex-forming partners of CP, such as lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, and serprocidines. Therefore, admixtures of MMPs can be efficiently eliminated from CP preparations by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose as proposed previously.

Effects of cryoprotectant on the embryos of banded coral shrimp (Stenopus hispidus); preliminary studies to establish freezing protocols. The addition of cryoprotectants is a necessary step in cryopreservation procedures because they can minimize cellular injury during cryopreservation. Toxicity of cryoprotectant depends on the type, concentration, temperature and exposure period. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxicity of cryoprotectant to embryos of banded coral shrimp (Stenopus hispidus) in order to inform the development of a cryopreservation protocol. Three stages of embryonic development (eye-formation, heart beat and pre-hatch stage) embryos were selected and exposed to different concentration of cryoprotectants (0.25M-5M) for an equilibration period of 10, 20 or 30 min at room temperature. Hatching percentage indicated that the toxicity of tested cryoprotectants increased in the order of methanol, ethylene glycol (EG), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), glycerol and dimethylacetamide (DMA). The No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) for eye-formation stage embryos were 1M, 0.25M, 0.25M, 0.25M and 0.25M respectively after 10 min incubation whilst the NOECs for heart beat and pre-hatch stage embryos were 1M, 0.5M, 0.5M, 0.5M and 0.25M respectively. Pre-hatch stage embryos appeared to be more tolerant to cryoprotectant toxicity than eye-formation and heart beat stage embryos.

Unique sequence features of the Human adenovirus 31 complete genomic sequence are conserved in clinical isolates. Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are causing a broad spectrum of diseases. One of the most severe forms of adenovirus infection is a disseminated disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Several reports in recent years have identified HAdV-31 from species A (HAdV-A31) as a cause of disseminated disease in children following haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (hSCT) and liver transplantation. We sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of the HAdV-A31 prototype strain to uncover unique sequence motifs associated with its high virulence. Moreover, we sequenced coding regions known to be essential for tropism and virulence (early transcription units E1A, E3, E4, the fiber knob and the penton base) of HAdV-A31 clinical isolates from patients with disseminated disease. The genome size of HAdV-A31 is 33763 base pairs (bp) in length with a GC content of 46.36%. Nucleotide alignment to the closely related HAdV-A12 revealed an overall homology of 84.2%. The genome organization into early, intermediate and late regions is similar to HAdV-A12. Sequence analysis of the prototype strain showed unique sequence features such as an immunoglobulin-like domain in the species A specific gene product E3 CR1 beta and a potentially integrin binding RGD motif in the C-terminal region of the protein IX. These features were conserved in all analyzed clinical isolates. Overall, amino acid sequences of clinical isolates were highly conserved compared to the prototype (99.2 to 100%), but a synonymous/non synonymous ratio (S/N) of 2.36 in E3 CR1 beta suggested positive selection. Unique sequence features of HAdV-A31 may enhance its ability to escape the host's immune surveillance and may facilitate a promiscuous tropism for various tissues. Moderate evolution of clinical isolates did not indicate the emergence of new HAdV-A31 subtypes in the recent years.

Postal questionnaire to all histopathologists in 11 hospital trusts in Yorkshire. Liver biopsies represent about 0.5% histopathology requests in Yorkshire, with more medical than tumour biopsies. Pathologists often discuss these biopsies with each other and clinicians; a third had done liver continuing professional development (CPD) in the last 3 years, and 70% would like to do more. Overall, around 5% liver biopsies are reviewed in the hepatology centre, and most responders thought this about right. For primary reporting of liver biopsies, local pathologists need good communication with the responsible clinician, access to relevant CPD in liver pathology and a biopsy referral pathway for cases which are clinically or pathologically challenging.

The codon 72 polymorphism of the TP53 gene and endometriosis risk: a meta-analysis. Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory and common gynaecological disease. This study investigated the association between TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and the risk of endometriosis. A search for relevant articles was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu databases and Google Scholar. The strength of the relationships between TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and the risk of endometriosis was assessed by odds ratios (OR) and with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sixteen case-control studies in 15 articles were included. Significant association was found in the dominant model (CC + GC versus GG) with an OR of 1.38 and 95% CI (1.14, 1.67). The results suggested that individuals who carried CC homozygote and heterozygote GC might have a 38% increased endometriosis risk when compared with the homozygote GG. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risk was observed among Asians (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.18-2.23, P = 0.003) and Latin Americans (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.16-2.03, P = 0.002) but not in Caucasians (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.80-1.30) for the dominant model. The current meta-analysis suggested that TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with the endometriosis risk, especially in Asians and Latin Americans.

Feasibility of introducing genetic services in the National Family Welfare Programme in India. Genetic factors could play an important role in the outcome of pregnancy. This study was carried out to identify risk factors that result in adverse pregnancy outcome and to develop a system of screening and referral to a tertiary hospital equipped with facilities for diagnosis and management of such high risk pregnancies. District level hospitals close to the participating centers e.g. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, BJ Medical College, Pune, St. John Medical College, Bangalore and Genetic Research Center, (ICMR), Mumbai, were selected. Pregnant women < 28 wk gestation attending antenatal OPD of selected district hospitals were included. All eligible women who gave consent for participation in the study, were screened using a predesigned proforma based on family history, past pregnancy history, history of genetic disease/ congenital malformation in previous child and history of present pregnancy. Pregnancy outcome was noted. There was statistically significant difference in the outcome of pregnancy in the following groups: (i) past pregnancy history of 3 or more spontaneous abortions (RR= 3.9; CI=1.17-9.02); (ii) still birth (RR= 2.5; CI= 1.41-4.48); (iii) previous child with neurol tube defect (NTD) (RR=2.3; CI= 1.22- 4.60); and (iv) previous child with congenital malformation (RR=2.2; CI = 1.11- 4.35). A sample questionnaire may be used for screening of pregnant women at risk of having and adverse outcome. Also screening of pregnant women for thalassaemia carrier state and maternal serum a-foetoprotein (AFP) for NTD may be useful.

Cognitive Profile of C9orf72 in Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This review article focuses on the cognitive profile associated with the C9orf72 gene with GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansions that is commonly found in both familial and sporadic forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in order to aid clinicians in the screening process. In this growing clinical continuum between FTD and ALS, understanding and recognizing a neurocognitive profile is important for diagnosis. Key features of this profile include executive dysfunction with memory impairment and language deficits as the disease progresses. Behaviorally, patients are prone to disinhibition, apathy, and psychosis. With the discovery of this mutation, studies have begun to characterize the different phenotypes associated with this mutation in terms of epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging, and pathology. Greater awareness and increased surveillance for this mutation will benefit patients and their families in terms of access to genetic counseling, research studies, and improved understanding of the disease process.

Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance To Diagnose Hazardous Chemicals in Multiple Contaminated Aquatic Systems. Aquatic ecosystems are often contaminated with large numbers of chemicals, which cannot be sufficiently addressed by chemical target analyses. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) enables the identification of toxicants in complex contaminated environmental samples. This study suggests pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) as a confirmation tool for EDA to identify contaminants which actually impact on local communities. The effects of three phytotoxic compounds local periphyton communities, cultivated at a reference (R-site) and a polluted site (P-site), were assessed to confirm the findings of a former EDA study on sediments. The sensitivities of R- and P-communities to prometryn, tributyltin (TBT) and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine (PNA) were quantified in short-term toxicity tests and exposure concentrations were determined. Prometryn and PNA concentrations were significantly higher at the P-site, whereas TBT concentrations were in the same range at both sites. Periphyton communities differed in biomass, but algal class composition and diatom diversity were similar. Community tolerance of P-communities was significantly enhanced for prometryn, but not for PNA and TBT, confirming site-specific effects on local periphyton for prometryn only. Thus, PICT enables in situ effect confirmation of phytotoxic compounds at the community level and seems to be suitable to support confirmation and enhance ecological realism of EDA.

Partitioning of acidic, basic and neutral amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In this paper, partitioning behaviors of typical neutral (Alanine), acidic (Glutamic acid) and basic (Lysine) amino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids [C(4)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][PF(6)], [C(8)mim][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][BF(4)] and [C(8)mim][BF(4)] as extracting solvents were examined. [C(6)mim][BF(4)] showed the best efficiency for partitioning of amino acids. The partition coefficients of amino acids in ionic liquids were found to depend strongly on pH of the aqueous solution, amino acid and ionic liquid chemical structures. Different chemical forms of amino acids in aqueous solutions were pH dependent, so the pH value of the aqueous phase was a determining factor for extraction of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Both water content of ionic liquids and charge densities of their anionic and cationic parts were important factors for partitioning of cationic and anionic forms of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Extracted amino acids were back extracted into phosphate buffer solutions adjusted on appropriate pH values. The results showed that ionic liquids could be used as suitable modifiers on the stationary phase of an HPLC column for efficient separation of acidic, basic, and neutral amino acids.

Dietary fish oil inhibits the early stage of recovery of atrophied soleus muscle in rats via Akt-p70s6k signaling and PGF2α. Skeletal muscle recovery from disuse atrophy requires the recruitment of insulin signaling for muscle growth, which is driven by protein synthesis. Dietary fish oil, which is rich in long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is known to enhance insulin signaling and protein metabolism. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate whether dietary fish oil facilitates muscle recovery during remobilization after disuse atrophy. Ten days of immobilization, followed by 3 or 13 days of remobilization, were applied to the hindlimbs of rats fed corn oil [corn oil diet group as control (CO)] or fish oil [fish oil diet group (FO)] as source of dietary fat. The immobilization-induced reductions in soleus muscle weight and myosin heavy-chain content were significantly restored by 3 days of remobilization in CO. However, in FO, these muscle recovery measurements did not significantly change until 13 days of remobilization. At 3 days of remobilization, both groups had significant elevations in p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70s6k) activation and at a greater extent in CO than in FO. The activation of Akt was also increased on Day 3, but it was not significant in FO. Throughout the remobilization period, levels of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were significantly augmented. However, FO had a lesser increase in PGF2α than CO until Day 13. These findings indicate that dietary fish oil inhibits the early stage of soleus muscle recovery after disuse atrophy by suppressing the activation of Akt-p70s6k signaling and PGF2α synthesis.

Exposure of petrol station attendants and auto mechanics to premium motor sprit fumes in Calabar, Nigeria. A population-based-cross-sectional survey was carried out to investigate the potential risk of exposure to premium motor spirit (PMS) fumes in Calabar, Nigeria, among Automobile Mechanics (AM), Petrol Station Attendants (PSA) and the general population. Structured questionnaire was administered on the randomly chosen subjects to elicit information on their exposure to PMS. Duration of exposure was taken as the length of work in their various occupations. Venous blood was taken for methaemoglobin (MetHb) and packed cells volume (PCV). Mean MetHb value was higher in AM (7.3%) and PSA (5.8%) than in the subjects from the general population (2.7%). PCV was lower in PSA (30.8%), than AM (33.3%) and the subjects from the general population (40.8%). MetHb level was directly proportional, and PCV inversely related, to the duration of exposure. The study suggested increased exposure to petrol fumes among AM, PSA, and MetHb as a useful biomarker in determining the level of exposure to benzene in petrol vapour.


Neuroendocrine consequences of anorexia nervosa in adolescents.

[Health-related quality of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis]. The need for assessing the quality of life in chronic rhinosinusitis is emphasised by the medical, social and economic importance of this pathological condition. Questionnaires have been employed in majority of studies while there are no available data that Q method has been used for quality of life research in chronic rhinosinusitis up to the present. The aim of this study was to identify, group and analyse subjective perception of the impact of the disease on health-related quality of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The study involved 36 consecutive patients of both sexes, older than 10 years of age, diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis in the tertiary health clinic in three successive weeks. They were selected for medicamentous treatment. Health-related quality of life was assessed by Q method. Through 34 representative statements, which were sorted by the examinees related to subjective priorities, 10 key quality of life domains were examined. The data were processed by factor analysis employing specialised software package PQMethod. Analysing individual opinions of the examinees, five different opinion-types (factors) on the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quality of life were demonstrated. They were marked numerically and descriptively according to dominant characteristics of the group: Factor 1--stable group (47.2% of individuals), Factor 2--symptomatic group (11.1% of individuals), Factor 3--mental group (5.6% of individuals), Factor 4--physical group (11.1% of individuals) and Factor 5--optimistic group (25.0% of individuals). Each group was systematically analysed. Majority of patients with chronic rhinosinusits (72.2%) were found to be satisfied with the quality of life, while just a small number (5.6%) heavily bore the illness which especially jeopardised their mental health. This study demonstrates the strength of Q method in analysing and categorizing subjectivity and offers quality practical information which enables a more comprehensive approach and more adequate intervention in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Relationship of polar bodies morphology to embryo quality and pregnancy outcome. The aim of this study was to explore whether the morphology of polar bodies (PBs) estimated at 16-18 h after insemination can be used as an additional marker for predicting human embryo quality or pregnancy outcome. The data from 355 patients who received standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation were recruited. Normal fertilized 3048 zygotes from 382 cycles were divided into two groups, PBs intact or fragmented, according to the morphology of PBs assessed at 16-18 h after insemination. Embryo quality and pregnancy outcome were compared between the two groups. It was shown that the day 3 (D3) good embryo rate, good quality blastocyst rate and available embryo rate of the PBs intact group were all significantly higher than that of the corresponding fragmented groups. However, no significant differences in pregnancy rate (PR) or implantation rate (IR) were observed between the intact and fragmented groups. Although PBs morphology estimated at 16-18 h after insemination had little effect on PR or IR in fresh embryo transfer cycles, a better embryo quality can be achieved in the PB-intact group, which is valuable for embryo selection. 

Human and mouse osteoprogenitor cells exhibit distinct patterns of osteogenesis in three-dimensional tissue engineering scaffolds. Understanding interspecies variation between animal models and humans is essential to develop tissue-engineered bone. The authors studied osteogenic and angiogenic marker expression in human and murine osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. Three human cells (human mesenchymal stem cells, multilineage progenitor cells, and normal human osteoblasts) and three murine cells (MC3T3-E1, C3H10T1/2, and M2-10B4) were used. Cells were seeded onto poly-lactide-glycolic acid-coated tissue culture plates or three-dimensional poly-lactide-glycolic acid scaffolds, incubated in osteogenic medium, and harvested at 1, 4, and 7 days. mRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and core-binding factor alpha-1, and angiogenic markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. All human cells had significantly increased expression of osteogenic markers in three dimensions compared with two dimensions (alkaline phosphatase by 220 percent, osteocalcin by 323 percent, bone sialoprotein by 534 percent, and core-binding factor alpha-1 by 357 percent). However, all murine cells exhibited significant decreases in the expression of osteogenic markers in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultures (alkaline phosphatase by 89 percent, osteocalcin by 64 percent, bone sialoprotein by 76 percent, and core-binding factor alpha-1 by 73 percent). In contrast, all human and murine cells showed markedly elevated expression of angiogenic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultures. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity confirmed this pattern of osteogenic differentiation. In three-dimensional versus two-dimensional cultures, osteogenesis increased significantly in human cells but decreased in murine cells; angiogenesis increased regardless of species. Since three-dimensional cultures represent in vivo conditions more closely, this species variation has important translational implications to tissue-engineered bone research.


Strip-based regression: a method to obtain comprehensive co-polymer architectures from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-mass spectrometry data.

Experimental diabetes mellitus exacerbates tau pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by a lack of insulin, insulin resistance, or both. There is increasing evidence that insulin also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it is involved in the metabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau, two proteins that form Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively, the hallmark lesions in AD. Here, we examined the effects of experimental DM on a pre-existing tau pathology in the pR5 transgenic mouse strain that is characterized by NFTs. pR5 mice express P301L mutant human tau that is associated with dementia. Experimental DM was induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which causes insulin deficiency. We determined phosphorylation of tau, using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Solubility of tau was determined upon extraction with sarkosyl and formic acid, and Gallyas silver staining was employed to reveal NFTs. Insulin depletion by STZ administration in six months-old non-transgenic mice causes increased tau phosphorylation, without its deposition or NFT formation. In contrast, in pR5 mice this results in massive deposition of hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau. Furthermore, they develop a pronounced tau-histopathology, including NFTs at this early age, while the pathology in sham-treated pR5 mice is moderate. Whereas experimental DM did not result in deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in non-transgenic mice, a predisposition to develop a tau pathology in young pR5 mice was both sufficient and necessary to exacerbate tau deposition and NFT formation. Hence, DM can accelerate onset and increase severity of disease in individuals with a predisposition to developing tau pathology.

Occupational chronic solvent encephalopathy in Finland 1995-2007: incidence and exposure. The aim of the study was to define the incidence of chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE) in Finland during 1995-2007, evaluate the duration and nature of exposure, and identify the work tasks where CSE is encountered. Data were from the register and patient records at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health. The Finnish Job-Exposure Matrix (FINJEM) and National Statistics were used to estimate the incidence of CSE in exposed workforce. CSE cases during 1995-2007 numbered 129. The annual incidence has decreased from 8.6 to 1.2/million employed, i.e. from 18 to 3 patients per year. The number of suspected patients has, however, remained constant (mean 38.6/year). The mean age at diagnosis was 52.8, the mean duration of exposure 28.4 years, and the mean occupational exposure limit years (OELY) 10.5. During 1995-2007, the mean age increased annually by 0.6 and years of exposure by 0.8, but OELY remained constant. In comparison to FINJEM, the highest incidence was in workers exposed to aromatic hydrocarbons. Relative to workforce in occupations with solvent exposure, CSE was most frequent in wooden surface finishers and in industrial, metal, or car painters followed by floor layers and lacquerers. The incidence of CSE has declined due to legislative, technical, and hygienic actions. CSE is most probable in spray painting tasks with main exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons, when occupational solvent exposure exceeds 20 years, and the age of the worker is above 45. Our results indicate slower CSE development at lower exposure levels.

Relationships between xylem vessel characteristics, calculated axial hydraulic conductance and size-controlling capacity of peach rootstocks. Previous studies indicate that the size-controlling capacity of peach rootstocks is associated with reductions of scion water potential during mid-day that are caused by the reduced hydraulic conductance of the rootstock. Thus, shoot growth appears to be reduced by decreases in stem water potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of reduced hydraulic conductance in size-controlling peach rootstocks. Anatomical measurements (diameter and frequency) of xylem vessels were determined in shoots, trunks and roots of three contrasting peach rootstocks grown as trees, each with different size-controlling characteristics: 'Nemaguard' (vigorous), 'P30-135' (intermediate vigour) and 'K146-43' (substantially dwarfing). Based on anatomical measurements, the theoretical axial xylem conductance of each tissue type and rootstock genotype was calculated via the Poiseuille-Hagen law. Larger vessel dimensions were found in the vigorous rootstock ('Nemaguard') than in the most dwarfing one ('K146-43') whereas vessels of 'P30-135' had intermediate dimensions. The density of vessels per xylem area in 'Nemaguard' was also less than in 'P30-135'and 'K146-43'. These characteristics resulted in different estimated hydraulic conductance among rootstocks: 'Nemaguard' had higher theoretical values followed by 'P30-135' and 'K146-43'. These data indicate that phenotypic differences in xylem anatomical characteristics of rootstock genotypes appear to influence hydraulic conductance capacity directly, and therefore may be the main determinant of dwarfing in these peach rootstocks.

[18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography for the assessment of histopathologic response and prognosis after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in esophageal cancer. To evaluate the potential of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) after the completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation for the assessment of histopathologic response and prognosis in the multimodality treatment of patients with esophageal cancer. Combined chemoradiation with and without surgery are widely accepted treatment options for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Evidence suggests that patients with response to chemoradiation have no additional benefit from surgery compared with definitive chemoradiation. However, there is still a great lack in noninvasive markers for response assessment in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing multimodality treatment. Interestingly, recent studies imply that FDG-PET significantly correlates with histopathologic response and survival in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Study patients were recruited from a prospective clinical observation trial on neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer between 1997 and 2006. The study included 119 (98 men, 21 women; median age, 59.4 years; squamous cell cancer: 66; adenocarcinoma: 53) patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (cT2- 4, N(x), M(0)). All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (cisplatin, 5-FU, 36 Gy) and subsequently underwent transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major histopathologic response when resected specimens contained less than 10% vital residual tumor cells (major response: 47 patients [39.5%]; minor response: 72 patients [60.5%]). FDG-PET was performed before and 2 to 3 weeks after the end of chemoradiation with assessment of the intratumoral FDG-uptake (pretreatment standardized uptake value; post-treatment standardized uptake value; percentage change). These variables were correlated with histopathologic response and survival. Major histomorphologic response was confirmed as an important prognostic factor (P = 0.005; log-rank test). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation led to a significant reduction of intratumoral FDG-uptake (P = 0.0001). A nonsignificant association was seen between major responders and FDG-PET results (P = 0.056). However, the receiver operating characteristic analysis could not identify a standardized uptake value threshold with a relevant predictive value for histomorphologic response. No significant association between metabolic imaging and prognosis was found. FDG-PET seems not to be an imaging system that effectively characterizes the groups of major and minor response as well as survival in patients with esophageal cancer after multimodality treatment.

Comparison of a human portable blood glucose meter, veterinary portable blood glucose meter, and automated chemistry analyzer for measurement of blood glucose concentrations in dogs. To compare blood glucose concentrations measured with 2 portable blood glucose meters (PBGMs) validated for use in dogs (PBGM-D) and humans (PBGM-H) and an automated chemistry analyzer. Validation study. 92 samples of fresh whole blood and plasma from 83 dogs with various diseases. Each PBGM was used to measure whole blood glucose concentration, and the automated analyzer was used to measure plasma glucose concentration. Passing-Bablok linear regression and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine correlations and bias between the PBGMs and the automated analyzer. Calculated acceptability limits based on combined inherent instrument imprecision were used with Bland-Altman plots to determine agreement. Clinical relevance was assessed via error grid analysis. Although correlation between results of both PBGMs and the standard analyzer was > 0.90, disagreement was greater than could be explained by instrument imprecision alone. Mean difference between PBGM-H and chemistry-analyzer values was -15.8 mg/dL. Mean difference between PBGM-D and chemistry-analyzer values was 2.4 mg/dL. Linear regression analysis revealed proportional bias of PBGM-H (greater disagreement at higher glucose concentrations); no proportional bias was detected for PBGM-D. No constant bias was detected for either PBGM. Error grid analysis revealed all measurements from both PBGMs were within zones without an anticipated effect on clinical outcome. Neither PBGM had exact agreement with the automated analyzer; however, the disagreement detected did not have serious clinical consequences. Our findings stressed the importance of using the same device for monitoring trends in dogs and using instrument-specific reference ranges.

[The challenge of improving evidence-based therapy adherence in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease: the next frontier of cardiac rehabilitation]. Non-adherence to prescribed drug regimens is an increasing medical problem affecting physicians and patients and contribute to negative outcomes, such as the increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Analysis of various patient populations shows that the choice of drug, its tolerability and the duration of treatment influence the non-adherence. Intervention is required toward patients and health-care providers to improve medication adherence. This review deals about the prevalence of non-adherence to therapy after medical and surgical cardiac event, the risk factors affecting non-adherence and the strategies to implement it. Interventions that may successfully improve adherence should include improved physician compliance with guidelines, patient education and patient reminders, frequent visits or telephone calls from staff, simplification of the patient's drug regimen by reducing the number of pills and daily doses. Since single interventions do not appear efficaceous, it is necessary to establish multiple interventions simultaneously addressing a number of barriers to adherence.

Long-term (5- to 20-year) patency of the radial artery for coronary bypass grafting. The aim of this study was to assess the angiographic results of the radial artery as a coronary bypass conduit at long term (>5 years). Radial artery grafts were controlled in 202 patients at 10.1 years by conventional angiography (n = 79) and computed tomography (n = 123). Clinical or paraclinical evidence of ischemia was noted in 81 patients, whereas 121 patients were asymptomatic. Some 520 conduits were controlled: radial artery (n = 230), left internal thoracic artery (n = 190), right internal thoracic artery (n = 30), and veins (n = 70). Radial arteries were anastomosed to the right coronary (24%), marginal (58%), diagonal (16%), and left anterior descending (<1%) arteries, whereas left internal thoracic arteries were primarily anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery (95%). The mean number of antithrombotic and anti-anginal medications was 1.2 and 1.9 per patient, respectively. The ejection fraction was slightly decreased compared with its preoperative value (54% +/- 11% vs 57% +/- 9%; P = .009). Nine reoperations were required at 10.5 years for valve replacement (n = 8) and isolated bypass (n = 1). Percutaneous intervention was performed in 48 patients (24%) at 7.6 years on a graft (28%) or a native coronary artery (72%). The 10-year patency of radial artery grafts was 83%, which was lower than the patency of left internal thoracic arteries (95%, P < .001) and similar to the patency of right internal thoracic arteries (87%, P = .66) and veins (81%, P = .50). No medication seemed to influence radial artery graft patency (aspirin: P = .26; calcium blockers: P = .36). All graft patency was lower when clinical or paraclinical evidence of ischemia was present than in asymptomatic cases (83% vs 90% P = .02). The patency of left anterior descending grafts was higher than that of non-left anterior descending grafts (96% vs 82% P < .001). The radial artery-to-coronary bypass conduit provided a low coronary reoperation rate with an excellent patency (83%) up to 20 years postoperatively.


Bias-dependent amino-acid-induced conductance changes in short semi-metallic carbon nanotubes.

Esophageal dilation in eosinophilic esophagitis: effectiveness, safety, and impact on the underlying inflammation. Esophageal dilation often leads to long-lasting relief of dysphagia in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The aim of this study was to define the effectiveness, safety, and patient acceptance of esophageal dilation in EoE. In addition, we examined the influence of dilation on the underlying esophageal inflammation. Two databases including 681 EoE patients were reviewed. Cohort 1 consisted of patients treated with dilation alone, whereas cohort 2 included patients treated with a combination of dilation and antieosinophilic medication. Patients from cohort 1 underwent a prospective histological reexamination and an evaluation using a questionnaire. In total, 207 EoE patients were treated with esophageal dilation, 63 in cohort 1 and 144 in cohort 2. Dilation led to a significant increase in esophageal diameter and to an improvement in dysphagia in both the cohorts (P<0.001). After dilation, dysphagia recurred after 23+/-22 months in cohort 1 and 20+/-14 months in cohort 2. No esophageal perforation or major bleeding occurred. Among the patients surveyed, 74% reported retrosternal pain after dilation; however, all were agreeable to repeated dilation if required. Eosinophil peak infiltration, eosinophil load, and EoE-associated histological signs were not significantly affected by esophageal dilation. Esophageal dilation is highly effective in providing long-lasting symptom relief and can be performed safely with a high degree of patient acceptance. However, dilation is associated with postprocedural pain in most patients and does not influence the underlying inflammatory process. Symptom improvement despite persistence of inflammation suggests that tissue remodeling contributes substantially to symptom generation in EoE.

The importance of the function of exercise in the relationship between obligatory exercise and eating and body image concerns. This study tested whether exercising in response to negative affect moderates the association between obligatory exercise and eating and body image psychopathology. Participants (n=226) completed the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), and a question assessing whether they ever exercise in response to negative affect. In total, 132 (58.4%) participants endorsed exercising in response to negative affect. Multiple regression analyses revealed significant main effects of negative affect motivated exercise, OEQ total scores, and gender on all four EDE-Q subscales and significant interactions of negative affect motivated exercise and OEQ scores on the Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern scales but not the Restraint scale of the EDE-Q. Obligatory exercisers may not demonstrate elevated eating and body image concerns in the absence of negative affect motivated exercise, providing further support of the importance of the function of exercise.

Galectin-3, a marker for vacuole lysis by invasive pathogens. Shigella bacteria invade macrophages and epithelial cells and following internalization lyse the phagosome and escape to the cytoplasm. Galectin-3, an abundant protein in macrophages and epithelial cells, belongs to a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins, the galectins, with many proposed functions in immune response, development, differentiation, cancer and infection. Galectins are synthesized as cytosolic proteins and following non-classical secretion bind extracellular beta-galactosides. Here we analysed the localization of galectin-3 following entry of Shigella into the cytosol and detected a striking phenomenon. Very shortly after bacterial invasion, intracellular galectin-3 accumulated in structures in vicinity to internalized bacteria. By using immuno-electron microscopy analysis we identified galectin-3 in membranes localized in the phagosome and in tubules and vesicles that derive from the endocytic pathway. We also demonstrated that the binding of galectin-3 to host N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycans, was required for forming the structures. Accumulation of the structures was a type three secretion system-dependent process. More specifically, existence of structures was strictly dependent upon lysis of the phagocytic vacuole and could be shown also by Gram-positive Listeria and Salmonella sifA mutant. We suggest that galectin-3-containing structures may serve as a potential novel tool to spot vacuole lysis.


Laboratory Medicine Education at U.S. Medical Schools: A 2014 Status Report.

Using A-weighting for psychoacoustic active noise control. Conventional adaptive active noise control (ANC) methods aim to attenuate the acoustic noise over the frequency band of interest indiscriminately using the sound pressure level (SPL) measurement (or the measurement of the residual error variance). However, SPL does not correctly reflect the human perception of attenuated noise due to the frequency selective sensitivity of human hearing system. A-weighting is a commonly used weighting filter for measuring the noise. This weighting filter quantifies frequency response of the human ears and hearing system. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of adaptive noise cancellation method from the psychoacoustic point of view by incorporating the A-weighting into the ANC system design. Loudness is used as the psychoacoustic criterion for evaluating the ANC system performance. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Early detection of apoptosis in living cells by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Early detection of apoptotic cells via caspase activity is demonstrated with fast response time. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is used to identify the presence of a cleaved fluorogenic probe based on the fluorescence of rhodamine 110 in Jurkat cells. FCS curves are shown to be markedly different for autofluorescent (non-apoptotic) cells, whereas cells with cleaved probe showed diffusion and molecular brightness characteristic of rhodamine 110. Using FCS measurements, cells were identified as apoptotic on the basis of the presence of autocorrelated fluorescence, average molecular brightness (eta), and molecular dwell time (tau (D)). Apoptotic cells identified in this manner were detected as early as 45 min after induction. Unlike other methods with similar identification times, such as western blotting and electron microscopy, cells remain viable for further analysis. This multi-parameter approach is rapid, flexible, and does not require transfection of the cells prior to analysis, enabling apoptosis to be identified early in a wide variety of cell types.


Spinal cord compression and extramedullary hematopoiesis in young Egyptian beta-thalassemia patients.

Defective respiratory rhythmogenesis and loss of central chemosensitivity in Phox2b mutants targeting retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a group of neurons in the rostral medulla, defined here as Phox2b-, Vglut2-, neurokinin1 receptor-, and Atoh1-expressing cells in the parafacial region, which have been proposed to function both as generators of respiratory rhythm and as central respiratory chemoreceptors. The present study was undertaken to assess these two putative functions using genetic tools. We generated two conditional Phox2b mutations, which target different subsets of Phox2b-expressing cells, but have in common a massive depletion of RTN neurons. In both conditional mutants as well as in the previously described Phox2b(27Ala) mutants, in which the RTN is also compromised, the respiratory-like rhythmic activity normally seen in the parafacial region of fetal brainstem preparations was completely abrogated. Rhythmic motor bursts were recorded from the phrenic nerve roots in the mutants, but their frequency was markedly reduced. Both the rhythmic activity in the RTN region and the phrenic nerve discharges responded to a low pH challenge in control, but not in the mutant embryos. Together, our results provide genetic evidence for the essential role of the Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons both in establishing a normal respiratory rhythm before birth and in providing chemosensory drive.

[Enhancing effect of tissue engineered bone on bone defect repair in rats].

Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver disease. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with cholestatic liver disease such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Some studies have suggested that cirrhosis can predispose patients to development of osteoporosis because of altered calcium and vitamin D homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic liver disease. One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients (43 with hepatitis C cirrhosis, 57 with hepatitis C but no cirrhosis, 18 with nonhepatitis C-related cirrhosis) attending the University of Tennessee Hepatology Clinic had their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measured. Severity of vitamin D deficiency was graded as mild (20-32 ng/ml), moderate (7-19 ng/ml) or severe (<7 ng/ml), normal being >32 ng/ml. Of patients, 109/118 (92.4%) had some degree of vitamin D deficiency. In the hepatitis C cirrhosis group, 16.3% (7/43) had mild, 48.8% (21/43) had moderate, and 30.2% (13/43) had severe vitamin D deficiency. In the hepatitis C noncirrhotic group, 22.8% (19/57) had mild, 52.6% (30/57) had moderate, and 14% (8/57) had severe vitamin D deficiency. In the nonhepatitis C-related cirrhosis group, 38.9% (7/18) had mild, 27.8% (5/18) had moderate, and 27.8% (5/18) had severe vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D deficiency (<7 ng/ml) was more common among patients with cirrhosis compared with noncirrhotics (29.5% versus 14.1%, P value=0.05). Female gender, African American race, and cirrhosis were independent predictors of severe vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver disease. Vitamin D deficiency is universal (92%) among patients with chronic liver disease, and at least one-third of them suffer from severe vitamin D deficiency. African American females are at highest risk of vitamin D deficiency.

[Overexpression of hSav1 promotes Mst1-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells]. To elucidate the effect of hSav1 expression on Mst1-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells. Plasmids pCMV-HA-hSav1 and pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were constructed and cotransfected into HeLa cells. Triple immunofluorescent labeling of hSav1, Mst1 and nucleus was performed to determine their subcellular localization. Plasmids pCMV-HA-hSav1 and/or pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were transfected into HeLa cells, and 36 hours later cisplatin (50 micromol/L) as a pro-apoptotic agent was added for 14 hours. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V/PI assay. Plasmids pCMV-HA-hSav1 and pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were constructed and the authenticity of constructs was verified by sequencing. The binding in vitro showed that hSav1 could be detect from the anti-Mst1 immunoprecipitation complex. The immunofluorescent labeling showed that hSav1 and Mst1 had the same localization in cells. Overexpressed protein hSav1 did not induce a significant cell apoptosis. However, co-expression of hSav1 with Mst1 resulted in a significant increase of apoptosis above the level seen with Mst1 alone (24.5% +/- 2.4% vs. 39.3% +/- 4.0%, P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that hSav1 is a newly identified protein that interacts with Mst1 and augments Mst1-mediated apoptosis.

Chronotropic response to vasodilator-stress in patients submitted to myocardial perfusion imaging: impact on the accuracy in detecting coronary stenosis. A lower heart rate response (HRR) during vasodilator MPI has been shown to have a relevant adverse prognostic impact. We sought to evaluate the interaction among individual HRR to vasodilator stress and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) accuracy in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease (IHD). One hundred and sixty-five consecutive patients were submitted to vasodilator-stress MPI on a cardiac camera equipped with cadmium-zinc-thelluride detectors and coronary angiography. A coronary stenosis >70 % was considered significant. In every patient, the summed difference score (SDS) was computed from MPI images. Patients were categorized according to the tertiles of the distribution of individual HRR during dipyridamole: "Group 1" (HRR < 8 bpm; lowest tertile); "Group 2" (8 ≤ HRR ≤ 12 bpm; middle tertile); "Group 3" (HRR >12 bpm; highest tertile). Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 102 (62 %) patients. In the overall population, MPI showed a significant accuracy (AUC: 0.81, 95 % CI 0.74-0.86; p < 0.001) in unmasking the presence of significant coronary stenosis. Interestingly, in patients with a blunted HRR during dipyridamole ("Group 1") MPI showed a significantly lower sensitivity (68 %) in detecting CAD than in those with a higher HRR ("Group 3") (91 %, p = 0.007), despite a preserved specificity (76 % vs 77 %, P=NS). Similarly, the correlation among CAD extent and post-stress LV functional stunning was limited to "Group 3" patients, while it disappeared in those with blunted HRR. In patients with suspected IHD, MPI sensitivity is strongly influenced by the magnitude of patient heart rate increase to the pharmacologic stressor, suggesting an interaction among blunted HRR and lower accuracy in unmasking CAD.

Evolving Grounded Theory Methodology: towards a discursive approach. Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) is a widely cited research approach based upon symbolic interaction with a focus on interaction, action and processes. Relatively recently, Discursive Psychology; a language-based interaction research approach also based on symbolic interaction, emerged. At present Discursive Psychology is principally cited in the social sciences literature. Given Discursive Psychology's symbolic interaction foundations, what relevance does this approach have for evolving GTM? A number of methodological challenges were posed by a study looking at humour in Clinical Nurse Specialist-patient interactions. This paper will use the phenomenon of spontaneous humour in healthcare interactions to illustrate the potential for a new form of GTM drawing on discursive approaches; Discursive GTM. First, the challenges presented by a study looking at spontaneous humour in Clinical Nurse Specialist-patient interactions are presented. Second, the research approach adopted to meet these challenges - Discursive GTM (DGTM) - is explicated and the results of the study are outlined. Third, the different GTM approaches and Discursive Psychology are compared and contrasted in relation to the DGTM approach adopted. Finally, the challenges and tensions of using DGTM as well as the opportunities afforded by the use of naturally occurring data are reviewed. The authors contend that a DGTM approach may be appropriate in analyzing certain phenomena. In particular, we highlight the potential contribution of naturally occurring data as an adjunct to researcher-elicited data. Thus, when exploring particular phenomena, a DGTM approach may address the potentially under-developed symbolic interaction tenet of language.

[Foreign Body in Esophagus]. An esophageal foreign body is the term for a foreign body in the esophagus. The 2 age groups most prone to this condition are children age 9 and under (and especially toddlers age 4 and under) and elderly individuals age 70 and over. A foreign body often lodges where the esophagus is most constricted. In toddlers, the foreign body is often currency or coins or a toy. In adults, the body is often a piece of fish, dentures, a piece of meat, a pin or needle, or a drug in its blister pack packaging. In children, an esophageal foreign body is treated by fluoroscopically guided removal of the body with a balloon catheter or magnetic catheter or removal of the body via endoscopy or direct esophagoscopy under general anesthesia. In adults, the best choice for treating an esophageal foreign body is removing the body with an endoscope but there are instances where surgery is performed because the body is hard to remove endoscopically, a puncture has occurred, or empyema or mediastinitis has developed. This paper reviews the diagnosis and treatment of an esophageal foreign body.

Reach and throw movement analysis with support vector machines in early diagnosis of autism. Movement disturbances play an intrinsic part in autism. Upper limb movements like reach-and-throw seem to be helpful in early identification of children affected by autism. Nevertheless few works investigate the application of classifying methods to upper limb movements. In this study we used a machine learning approach Support Vector Machine (SVM) for identifying peculiar features in reach-and-throw movements. 10 pre-scholar age children with autism and 10 control subjects performing the same exercises were analyzed. The SVM algorithm proved to be able to separate the two groups: accuracy of 100% was achieved with a soft margin algorithm, and accuracy of 92.5% with a more conservative one. These results were obtained with a radial basis function kernel, suggesting that a non-linear analysis is possibly required.

Pretreatment with ascorbic acid prevents lethal gastrointestinal syndrome in mice receiving a massive amount of radiation. While bone marrow or stem cell transplantation can rescue bone marrow aplasia in patients accidentally exposed to a lethal radiation dose, radiation-induced irreversible gastrointestinal damage (GI syndrome) is fatal. We investigated the effects of ascorbic acid on radiation-induced GI syndrome in mice. Ascorbic acid (150 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to mice for 3 days, and then the mice underwent whole body irradiation (WBI). Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 24 h after irradiation rescued mice receiving a WBI dose of less than 12 Gy. No mice receiving 14 Gy-WBI survived, because of radiation-induced GI syndrome, even if they received BMT. However, pretreatment with ascorbic acid significantly suppressed radiation-induced DNA damage in the crypt cells and prevented denudation of intestinal mucosa; therefore, ascorbic acid in combination with BMT rescued mice after 14 Gy-WBI. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that irradiation up-regulated expressions of apoptosis-related genes in the small intestine, including those related to the caspase-9-mediated intrinsic pathway as well as the caspase-8-mediated extrinsic pathway, and down-regulated expressions of these genes in ascorbic acid-pretreated mice. Thus, pretreatment with ascorbic acid may effectively prevent radiation-induced GI syndrome.


[Population-based case-control family study on risk factors of esophageal cancer in high incidence area].

High species richness of Chironomidae (Diptera) in temporary flooded wetlands associated with high species turn-over rates. Species richness and species turn-over of Chironomidae was studied in irregularly flooded wetlands of the River Dalälven flood-plains in central Sweden. The chironomid fauna, sampled with emergence traps in six wetlands over six summers, contained as much as 135 species, and the cumulative species curves indicated that the regional species pool contain several more species. Recurrent irregular floods may have induced this high chironomid species richness and the high species turn-over in the temporary wetlands, as the dominance between terrestrial and aquatic species shifted between years. Half of the wetlands were treated with Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) against larvae of the flood-water mosquito Aedes sticticus. These treatments had no significant effect on chironomid species richness, but there was a higher species turn-over between years of primarily low abundance species in the treated wetlands. The cumulative number of species was also higher in the Bti-treated experimental wetlands than in the untreated reference wetlands. Thus, Bti treatment against mosquito larvae seemed to have only small effects on chironomid species richness but seemed to increase the colonisation-extinction dynamics.

Validation of a novel three-dimensional electrode array within auditory cortex. Three-dimensional electrode arrays have a variety of potential applications in the fields of both intracortical mapping as well as basic research studies designed to characterize and understand the physiology of the brain. While higher channels counts are desired in brain-machine interface applications, the ability to analyze synchronous data from multiple cortical locations, including various depths is pivotal to fully mapping the underlying neurophysiology of sensory cortices. Within this study, we present a proof of concept validation of a 3D probe technology consisting of 16 silicon shanks in a 4x4 grid arrangement with four electrode sites per shank. This 3D array has been implanted in a rat primary auditory cortex and electrophysiological data are presented showing the utility of electrode sites spanning multilateral cortical space as well as cortical depth.

Topical treatment in pain medicine: from ancient remedies to modern usage. Over several millennia, substances have been applied to the skin for treatment of pain. Some ingredients are in current use; others have been discontinued. Mechanisms of action include interactions with nociceptive neural networks and inflammatory processes. Substances must penetrate the stratum corneum barrier and vehicles that enhance penetration have been developed. Topical drugs with links to the past include menthol, capsaicin, some opioids, local anesthetic agents and NSAIDs. Mandragora is also described as an example of a herbal remedy that has been discontinued due to its toxicity. The future for topical drugs is promising, with the advent of new drugs tailored for specific pain mechanisms and the development of both penetration enhancers and sterile preparation methods.

Live weight related changes in the sperm production capacity of white fulani (Bos indicus) cattle I: testicular histomorphometry. The study investigated live weight related changes in testicular histomorphmery of White Fulani (WF) bulls of live weight range 171-320 kg under the traditional extensive system of management in Ibadan, Nigeria. Fifty-two WF bulls were randomly selected from local Fulani herds around Ibadan and placed in Giant Star grass paddocks with water available free choice for one week prior to slaughter. Morhpometric measurements were taken on the scrotum before and on the testes immediately after slaughter. Histometric measurements were taken on the testicular parenchyma tissue after histological processes. From their weight at slaughter, the bulls were grouped into four live weight groups of 171-200, 201-230, 231-260 and 261-320 kg for group I, II, III and IV, respectively. Mean values of group IV bulls were significantly (p<0.05) higher in all scrotal and testicular morphometric measurements than all other groups, which did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from one another. The gonadal index (relative weight of testes to live weight) did not differ (p>0.05) between groups except that group IV value was significantly (p<0.05) higher than all other groups. The relative proportion of paired epididymal weight to live weight did not differ between groups, while the relative proportion of tunica albuginea to the testes weight decreased insignificantly from group I to IV. The seminiferous tubule diameter did not significantly (p>0.05) differ between groups, while the stages in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium also appeared stable between the different live weight groups. The volume proportion of the lumen in the semiferuos epithelium was significantly higher in group I bulls than group IV bulls while none of the testicular elements differed significantly (p>0.05) between groups in volume proportions. However, absolute weights of all the testicular elements were significantly higher in the group IV bulls than all the other groups, which did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from one another. It was concluded that the live weight range 171-320 kg corresponds to a physiologically stable state in White Fulani bulls extensively managed in Ibadan, a humid tropical environment in Nigeria.

The Validity of Self-reported Recent Smoking in Head and Neck Cancer Surgical Patients. In cancer patients, cigarette smoking causes poorer response to treatment, treatment toxicity, increased risk of recurrence, higher surgical complication rates, and poorer overall survival. As such a significant determinant of patient prognosis, accurate classification of current smoking status is important. Self-reported smoking status may lead to misclassification if patients conceal their true status. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of self-reported tobacco use during the previous 48 hours in head and neck cancer patients on the day of surgery. Cross-sectional. Two academic medical centers in the southeastern United States. On the day of surgery, 108 head and neck cancer patients completed a survey asking about tobacco use during the past 48 hours and had semi-quantitative levels of urinary cotinine measured to biochemically validate self-reported recent smoking. Self-reported smoking yielded a sensitivity of 60.9% (95% CI, 45.4%-74.9%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 91.3%-100.0%). The sensitivity increased to 76.1% (95% CI, 61.2%-87.4%) when allowing for the possibility that exposure to secondhand smoke or use of nicotine-containing products could have caused a positive cotinine test. In this patient population, self-reported recent smoking yielded a high (39%) proportion of false-negatives, and even 24% remained false-negatives after allowing for other sources of nicotine exposure. This magnitude of underreporting combined with the importance of tobacco use to patient prognosis supports the need for routinely biochemically verifying recent tobacco use in self-reported nonsmokers within the clinical setting.

Thyrotropin secretion in mild and severe primary hypothyroidism is distinguished by amplified burst mass and Basal secretion with increased spikiness and approximate entropy. Twenty-four-hour TSH secretion profiles in primary hypothyroidism have been analyzed with methods no longer in use. The insights afforded by earlier methods are limited. We studied TSH secretion in patients with primary hypothyroidism (eight patients with severe and eight patients with mild hypothyroidism) with up-to-date analytical tools and compared the results with outcomes in 38 healthy controls. Patients and controls underwent a 24-h study with 10-min blood sampling. TSH data were analyzed with a newly developed automated deconvolution program, approximate entropy, spikiness assessment, and cosinor regression. Both basal and pulsatile TSH secretion rates were increased in hypothyroid patients, the latter by increased burst mass with unchanged frequency. Secretory regularity (approximate entropy) was diminished, and spikiness was increased only in patients with severe hypothyroidism. A diurnal TSH rhythm was present in all but two patients, although with an earlier acrophase in severe hypothyroidism. The estimated slow component of the TSH half-life was shortened in all patients. Increased TSH concentrations in hypothyroidism are mediated by amplification of basal secretion and burst size. Secretory abnormalities quantitated by approximate entropy and spikiness were only present in patients with severe disease and thus are possibly related to the increased thyrotrope cell mass.

Development of hypothalamic neural networks controlling appetite. The hypothalamus plays an essential role in controlling appetite during adult life. It undergoes tremendous growth beginning early in gestation and continuing during the postnatal period. During this developmental period, a variety of processes shape the hypothalamic nuclei involved in the control of eating. These include the birth of new cells that populate these areas (neurogenesis), the migration of these cells to their final destinations, selective neuronal death, and, finally, the development of functional neural connections. Each of these developmental processes represents an important period of vulnerability during which alterations of the pre- (intrauterine) and early postnatal environments may have long-term and potentially irreversible consequences on hypothalamic development and function. Metabolic hormones, including the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, have recently emerged as likely mediators of the environmental nutrient-sensing apparatus that directs hypothalamic programming.

Might Pelvic Surgeons Be Unaware of Their Surgical Failures? Patient Reporting and Perceptions After Failed Incontinence or Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery. : Prior studies suggest that pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) may recur following surgery in 20% or more of patients. Despite these numbers, we have anecdotally found that some surgeons performing pelvic floor reconstruction feel their success rates exceed these figures. Based on our experience, we hypothesized that significant numbers of patients with recurrent POP or SUI following prior surgery do not return or notify their original surgeon of their recurrence. We also aimed to identify reasons why the patient was seeking care elsewhere. We investigated patients presenting to a tertiary referral center urogynecologic practice with recurrence after prior POP or SUI surgery over a 2-year period. Data were collected using an institutional review board-approved 15-item questionnaire and after 2 years were analyzed. We found that 16 (31%) of 51 patients did not notify their primary surgeon of surgical failure. Of these patients, roughly half (9/16) did not return because of moving to a different area of the country, changing their insurance, or their prior physician retiring. Despite the surgical failures, of all patients presenting to our clinic, very few stated they had a poor relationship with their prior surgeon (6%); however, a large majority (63%) did not think that their primary surgeon could fix their problem. Roughly one third of patients who suffer from recurrence after POP or SUI surgery do not notify their original surgeon. This may artificially inflate a clinician's perceived success rate of pelvic floor repair.

Sex differences in attainment of independent funding by career development awardees. Concerns have been raised about the career pipeline in academic medicine, including whether women with a demonstrated commitment to research succeed at the same rate as male colleagues. To determine the subsequent academic success of recipients of National Institutes of Health (NIH) career development awards. United States. 2784 of 2799 (99.5%) recipients of K08 and K23 awards for whom sex could be ascertained from the NIH Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects database and other publicly available sources. Actuarial rates at which recipients of K08 and K23 awards from 1997 to 2003 went on to receive R01 awards. Sex-specific rates of R01 award attainment were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and sex differences were assessed by using a Cox proportional hazards model. Overall, 31.4% of the 1919 K08 awardees and 43.7% of the 865 K23 awardees were female (P < 0.001). Women were less likely than men to receive an R01 award (P < 0.001). The actuarial rate of R01 award attainment at 5 years was 22.7% overall, 18.8% among women, and 24.8% among men. At 10 years, the rate was 42.5% overall, 36.2% among women, and 45.6% among men. Sex persisted as an independent significant predictor of R01 award attainment (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.92]; P = 0.002) in multivariate analysis controlling for K award type, year of award, funding institute, institution, and specialty. Whether the lower rate of R01 award achievement among women is due to lower rates of application or lower rates of success in application could not be determined. Only a minority of K awardees studied achieved R01 award funding during the period assessed, and a significant sex disparity was evident.

Functional analysis of platelet-activating factor in the retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal endothelial cells. To investigate the function of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in cultured retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and choroidal endothelial (CE) cells. The in vitro and in vivo expression of PAF-receptors (PAF-R) on both these cells was determined. The production of PAF by RPE cells was also determined. The effect of PAF on the proliferation, migration, permeability, and apoptosis of CE cells was examined, and the modulation of PAF on the VEGF level in RPE cells was assessed. PAF-R was present in both types of cells in vitro, as well as in RPE and choroid in vivo. Cultured RPE cells synthesized PAF. PAF stimulated CE cell migration and permeability but not the proliferation. PAF also increased the VEGF level in RPE cells. Similar to VEGF, PAF stimulates CE cell migration and permeability. It also up-regulates VEGF level in RPE cells. PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization.

Pioglitazone suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammatory factors in mouse macrophages by inactivating NF-kappaB. TZDs (thiazolidinediones) are prescribed as anti-Type II diabetes drugs, but little is known regarding whether TZDs regulate the expression of sPLA2 (secretory phospholipase A2) in macrophages. We have investigated the effects of pioglitazone on LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced production of TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha), sPLA2-V and -X (groups V and X sPLA2) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. TNF-alpha, sPLA2-V and -X mRNA and protein expression were determined by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The activity of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) was determined by Western blot and confocal microscopy. LPS induced TNF-alpha, sPLA2-V and sPLA2-X mRNA and protein expression. Pretreatment with 10 mumol/l pioglitazone significantly suppressed LPS-induced TNF-alpha, sPLA2-V and sPLA2-X mRNA and protein expression. LPS induced NF-kappaB expression and translocation in the nucleus, but the inductive effects were inhibited by pioglitazone. Our findings indicate that pioglitazone inhibits production of inflammatory factors induced by LPS in murine macrophage cells by inactivating NF-kappaB. Pioglitazone appears to play an anti-inflammatory role in the atherosclerotic process.

Modulation and Functional Role of the Orientations of the N- and P-Domains of Cu+ -Transporting ATPase along the Ion Transport Cycle. Ion transport of different P-type ATPases is regulated similarly through the interplay of multiple protein domains. In the presence of ATP, binding of a cation to the ion binding site in the transmembrane helices leads to the phosphorylation of the P-domain, allowing ion transfer across the membrane. The details of the mechanism, however, are not clear. Here, we report the modulation of the orientation between the N- and P-domains of Cu(+)-transporting ATPase along the ion transport cycle using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in solution. On the basis of residual dipolar coupling measurements, it is found that the interdomain orientation (relative openness) of the N- and P-domains is distinctly modulated depending on the specific state of the N- and P-domains along the ion translocation cycle. The two domains' relative position in the apo state is semiopen, whereas it becomes closed upon binding of ATP to the N-domain. After phosphorylation of the P-domain and the release of ADP, the opening, however, becomes the widest among all the states. We reason such wide opening resulting from the departure of ADP prepares the N- and P-domains to accommodate the A-domain for interaction and, hence, promote ion transport and allow dephosphorylation of the P-domain. Such wide interdomain opening is abolished when an Asn to Asp mutation is introduced into the conserved DXXK motif located in the hinge region of the N- and P-domains of Cu(+)-ATPase, suggesting the indispensible role of the N- and P-interdomain orientation during ion transportation. Our results shed new light on the structural and mechanistic details of P-type ATPase function at large. 

Severe complications limit long-term clinical success of self-expanding metal stents in patients with obstructive colorectal cancer. Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are increasingly being used to treat malignant colorectal obstruction. However, complications have been reported in up to 50% of patients. There is limited information on long-term outcomes of these patients. The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the long-term clinical success of SEMS in patients with malignant colorectal obstruction in a single tertiary center and to identify possible predictive factors of developing complications. A total of 47 attempts to insert colorectal SEMS were made in 47 patients during a 5-year period. Stents of 9-cm length were placed under endoscopic and radiologic monitoring. After 24 h, all patients underwent abdominal X-ray to verify correct positioning of the stent. Patients were followed at the outpatient clinic. Insertion success was achieved in 44 (94%) patients. Acceptable initial colonic decompression was observed in 44 out of 47 (94%) attempts and in all (100%) successfully inserted stents. The stents were placed in the rectum (n=7, 15%), sigmoid (n=33, 70%), left colon (n=4, 9%), or anastomosis (n=3, 6%). The majority of patients had stage IV disease (n=40, 85%). SEMS served as a bridge to scheduled surgery in 9 (20%) patients and as a palliative definitive treatment in 38 (80%) cases. Three patients were lost to follow-up, so the outcome was evaluated in 41 patients. Long-term clinical failure occurred in 21 (51%) patients and was due to complications such as: migration (n=9, 22%), obstruction (n=7, 17%), perforation (n=3, 7%), and tenesmus (n=2, 5%). Perforations occurred 3, 4, and 34 days after insertion, and all patients died. In the bridge-to-surgery group, primary anastomosis was possible in only four of nine patients (44%). Clinical failure was not associated with any tumor-related factor. However, eight of nine patients with stent migration and two of three patients with perforation had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Placement of SEMS does not seem to be as effective as suggested because of late complications. For patients with potentially curable lesions, the use of colonic stents for malignant obstruction should only be considered when surgery is scheduled shortly after the stent insertion. Moreover, in patients with incurable obstructing colorectal cancer eligible for chemotherapy and a long life expectancy, palliative treatments other than SEMS should be considered.

Analysis of 55 autoimmune disease and type II diabetes loci: further confirmation of chromosomes 4q27, 12q13.2 and 12q24.13 as type I diabetes loci, and support for a new locus, 12q13.3-q14.1. A candidate gene study was conducted on 10 established type II diabetes genes and 45 genes associated with autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes (T1D), in a maximum of 1410 affected sib-pair families assembled by the Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium. Associations at P values <10(-3) were found for three known T1D regions at chromosomes 4q27, 12q13.2 and 12q24.13 (http://www.T1DBase.org). Support was obtained for a newly identified T1D candidate locus on chromosome 12q13.3-12q14.1 (rs1678536/KIF5A: P=8.1 x 10(-3); relative risk (RR) for minor allele=0.89, 95% CI=0.82-0.97), which has a separate association from the previously reported T1D candidate locus ERBB3/12q13.2-q13.3. Our new evidence adds to that previously published for the same gene region in a T1D case-control study (rs1678542; P=3.0 x 10(-4); odds ratio (OR)=0.92, 95% CI=0.88-0.96). This region, which contains many genes, has also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

Radiosurgery in the treatment of spinal metastases: tumor control, survival, and quality of life after helical tomotherapy.

Anatomical dissection and modified Sihler stain of the lower branches of the facial nerve. The cervical branch of the facial nerve and the muscles it supplies play a role in perioral function and neck aesthetics. Paralysis of the cervical branch in some patients may result in lip depressor deficiency and an asymmetric smile. It is unclear whether this is the result of platysmal weakness alone, or attributable to coinnervation of the lip depressor muscles by the cervical and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed description of the anatomy and function of the cervical branch to assist surgeons operating in the face and neck. Anatomical dissection of the marginal mandibular and cervical branches was performed in 20 hemifacial human cadaver specimens. The modified Sihler stain was used to stain the extramuscular and intramuscular nerve branches in eight specimens. The course, branching patterns, and neuromuscular relationships of the cervical and marginal mandibular branches were examined. Multiple cervical branches were identified in 85 percent of specimens, and an anastomosis with the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve was documented consistently. A communication between the marginal mandibular and cervical branches was identified in seven specimens, and coinnervation of the depressor anguli oris by intramuscular cervical branch ramifications was seen in one. A detailed description of the anatomy of the cervical branch is provided. Coinnervation of the lower lip depressors by the cervical branch remains a plausible explanation for the lower lip deformity attributed to cervical branch paralysis in some patients.

Epidemiology of female urinary incontinence in the Greek population: EURIG study. We estimated the current prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) in the female Greek population, estimated the prevalence of the subtypes of UI, and assessed its impact on patients' quality of life. The study was performed by personal interview based on structured questionnaires, and 2,000 Greek women (from the whole of Greece) aged between 20 and 80 years old participated in the study. The prevalence of UI in a female Greek population comprising women aged between 20 and 80 years was 27%. The impact was proportional to the frequency and severity of the UI. UI had no effect or only a mild effect on patients' quality of life. Significant improvement is required in patient information about the nature of UI and its effects on life, and about available treatments (conservative and surgical), and their efficacy and complications.

Compartmentalized intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis during HIV infection - a model of chronic CNS inflammation? HIV infects the central nervous system (CNS) during primary infection and persists in resident macrophages. CNS infection initiates a strong local immune response that fails to control the virus but is responsible for by-stander lesions involved in neurocognitive disorders. Although highly active anti-retroviral therapy now offers an almost complete control of CNS viral proliferation, low-grade CNS inflammation persists. This review focuses on HIV-induced intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. Intrathecal Ig synthesis early occurs in more than three-quarters of patients in response to viral infection of the CNS and persists throughout the course of the disease. Viral antigens are targeted but this specific response accounts for <5% of the whole intrathecal synthesis. Although the nature and mechanisms leading to non-specific synthesis are unknown, this prominent proportion is comparable to that observed in various CNS viral infections. Cerebrospinal fluid-floating antibody-secreting cells account for a minority of the whole synthesis, which mainly takes place in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the CNS parenchyma. B-cell traffic and lineage across the blood-brain-barrier have not yet been described. We review common technical pitfalls and update the pending questions in the field. Moreover, since HIV infection is associated with an intrathecal chronic oligoclonal (and mostly non-specific) Ig synthesis and associates with low-grade axonal lesions, this could be an interesting model of the chronic intrathecal synthesis occurring during multiple sclerosis.

Correlates of Sexual Activity and Satisfaction in Midlife and Older Women. Sexual activity is an important component of quality of life for women across their lifespan. Prior studies show a decline in sexual activity with age, but these studies often fail to consider the role of sexual satisfaction. The aim of this study is to give updated prevalence estimates of sexual activity among women and to elucidate factors associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction. We report a cross-sectional analysis of the second wave of a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 28 to 84 years, the Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. The survey used self-administered questionnaires to assess demographic data, self-rated physical and mental health, medical problems and medication use, relationship factors, and sexual activity and satisfaction. Of 2,116 women who answered the questions regarding sexuality, 1,345 (61.8%) women were sexually active in the previous 6 months. The proportion of women who were sexually active decreased with advancing age. Women who were married or cohabitating had approximately 8 times higher odds of being sexually active (odds ratio = 7.91, 95% CI, 4.16-15.04; P <.001). Among women aged 60 years and older who were married or cohabitating, most (59.0%) were sexually active. Among women who were sexually active, higher relationship satisfaction (P <.001), better communication (P = .011), and higher importance of sex P = .040) were related to higher sexual satisfaction, but age was not (P = .79). A considerable proportion of midlife and older women remain sexually active if they have a partner available. Psychosocial factors (relationship satisfaction, communication with romantic partner, and importance of sex) matter more to sexual satisfaction than aging among midlife and older women.

NeuroRighter: closed-loop multielectrode stimulation and recording for freely moving animals and cell cultures. Closed-loop systems, where neural signals are used to control electrical stimulation, show promise as powerful experimental platforms and nuanced clinical therapies. To increase the availability, affordability, and usability of these devices, we have created a flexible open source system capable of simultaneous stimulation and recording from multiple electrodes. The system is versatile, functioning with both freely moving animals and in vitro preparations. Current- and voltage-controlled stimulation waveforms with 1 micros resolution can be delivered to any electrode of an array. Stimulation sequences can be preprogrammed or triggered by ongoing neural activity, such as action potentials (APs) or local field potentials (LFPs). Recovery from artifact is rapid, allowing the detection of APs within 1 ms of stimulus offset. Since the stimulation subsystem provides simultaneous current/voltage monitoring, electrode impedance spectra can be calculated in real time. A sample closed-loop experiment is presented wherein interictal spikes from epileptic animals are used to trigger microstimulation.

Transcriptional analysis of the jamaicamide gene cluster from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula and identification of possible regulatory proteins.

In vitro ectomycorrhizal specificity between the Asian red pine Pinus densiflora and Tricholoma matsutake and allied species from worldwide Pinaceae and Fagaceae forests. Tricholoma matsutake produces commercially valuable, yet uncultivable, mushrooms (matsutake) in association with pines in the Far East and Scandinavia and with both pines and oaks in the foothills of Tibet. Other matsutake mushrooms, such as Tricholoma anatolicum from the Mediterranean regions and Tricholoma magnivelare and Tricholoma sp. from the North Pacific Coast area of Canada and North America as well as Mexico, respectively, are associated with pines or oaks in their natural habitats. Tricholoma bakamatsutake and Tricholoma fulvocastaneum from Asia produce moderately valuable matsutake mushrooms and are solely associated with Fagaceae in nature. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that matsutake mushrooms from Scandinavia, Mediterranean regions, North America, and Tibet form ectomycorrhizae with Pinus densiflora similar to the Far East T. matsutake. In general, worldwide T. matsutake and the symbionts of Pinaceae colonize the rhizospheres of P. densiflora as well as T. matsutake isolated from the host plant. However, T. fulvocastaneum and T. bakamatsutake formed a discontinuous Hartig net and no Hartig net, respectively, and colonized to a lesser extent as compared to T. matsutake. The data suggest that conifer-associated matsutake mushrooms in their native habitat will associate symbiotically with the Asian red pine.

Comparison of gene expression profiles between human and mouse monocyte subsets. Blood of both humans and mice contains 2 main monocyte subsets. Here, we investigated the extent of their similarity using a microarray approach. Approximately 270 genes in humans and 550 genes in mice were differentially expressed between subsets by 2-fold or more. More than 130 of these gene expression differences were conserved between mouse and human monocyte subsets. We confirmed numerous of these differences at the cell surface protein level. Despite overall conservation, some molecules were conversely expressed between the 2 species' subsets, including CD36, CD9, and TREM-1. Other differences included a prominent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) signature in mouse monocytes, which is absent in humans, and strikingly opposed patterns of receptors involved in uptake of apoptotic cells and other phagocytic cargo between human and mouse monocyte subsets. Thus, whereas human and mouse monocyte subsets are far more broadly conserved than currently recognized, important differences between the species deserve consideration when models of human disease are studied in mice.

Economic evaluation of zoledronic acid for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors in the UK. Aromatase inhibitors are used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (BC) and are associated with accelerated bone loss. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss (AIBL) in postmenopausal women with BC. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL for prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women with BC. A Markov model was developed to project lifetime incidence of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as a function of bone mineral density (BMD) for women with early-stage BC receiving letrozole alone or with ZOL. Two strategies of ZOL therapy were compared with no treatment: starting ZOL treatment only when BMD levels decreased ('delayed ZOL') and starting ZOL simultaneously with letrozole therapy ('upfront ZOL'). Delayed ZOL therapy was estimated to cost 16,069 pounds per QALY, when compared with not administering bisphosphonates for AIBL prevention. The corresponding cost per QALY gained for upfront ZOL versus no treatment was estimated at 21,973 pounds. The cost-effectiveness ratio for upfront versus delayed therapy was estimated at 24,868 pounds per QALY gained. Both delayed and upfront therapy with ZOL for the prevention of AIBL and fractures in BC patients in the UK appear to result in highly acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios.

Development and application of a high-throughput platform for perfusion-based cell culture processes. A high-throughput (HT) cell culture model has been established for the support of perfusion-based cell culture processes operating at high cell densities. To mimic perfusion, the developed platform takes advantage of shake tubes and operates them in a batch-refeed mode with daily medium exchange to supply the cultures with nutrients and remove toxic byproducts. By adjusting the shaking parameters, such as the speed and setting angle, we have adapted the shake tubes to a semi-continuous production of a recombinant enzyme in a perfusion-like mode. We have demonstrated that the developed model can be used to select clones and cell culture media ahead of process optimization studies in bioreactors and confirmed the applicability of shake tubes to a perfusion-like cell culture reaching ∼50E6 viable cells/mL. Furthermore, through regular cell mass removal and periodic medium exchange we have successfully maintained satellite cultures of bench-top perfusion bioreactors, achieving a sustainable cell culture performance at ≥30E6 viable cells/mL and viabilities >80% for over 58 days. The established HT model is a unique and powerful tool that can be used for the development and screening of media formulations, or for testing selected process parameters during both process optimization and manufacturing support campaigns.

Sex-specific analysis of data in high-impact orthopaedic journals: how are we doing? In 2001, the Institute of Medicine released a report stating that sex must be considered in all aspects and at all levels of biomedical research. Knowledge of differences between males and females in responses to treatment serves to improve our ability to care for our patients. The purpose of our study was to determine (1) if there is an increase in the proportion of sex-specific reporting from 2000 to 2005 and to 2010; and (2) whether there is a proportional difference in such reporting based on journal type: subspecialty versus general orthopaedics. We hypothesize that assessment of the role of sex in outcomes has improved during the past 15 years and that the proportion of studies with of sex-specific analyses has increased with awareness of the role of sex in clinical outcomes and disease states. We additionally hypothesized that the reporting of sex would be similar between subspecialty and general orthopaedic journals. Five high-impact orthopaedic journals, consisting of two general and three subspecialty journals, were chosen for review. Issues from even-numbered months during three calendar years (2000, 2005, 2010) were critically assessed for the presence of sex-specific analyses and reporting by two separate reviewers. Retrospective and prospective clinical studies, with a minimum of 20 patients, were included for analysis. Cadaveric, biomechanical, and in vitro studies were excluded. Review articles and clinical studies with less than 20 patients were excluded. A total of 821 studies that met inclusion criteria were analyzed: 206 in 2000, 277 in 2005, and 338 in 2010. Overall, the proportion of sex-specific analyses increased during the three times studied (19%, 40/206, [95% CI, 0.14-0.25] of the studies in 2000; 27%, 77/277, [95% CI, 0.23-0.33] in 2005; and 30%, 102/338, [95% CI, 0.25-0.35] in 2010). The increase in the proportion of sex-specific analysis was significant between 2000 and 2005 (p = 0.033), but was not significant between 2005 and 2010 (p = 0.518). During each of the three specific years studied, general and subspecialty journals increased in the proportions that reported sex-based analyses, but specialty journals had significantly higher reporting rates only in 2000 (2000: 11.9%, 13/109, [95% CI, 0.06-0.18] and 27.8%, 27/97, [95% CI, 0.19-0.37], p = 0.004; 2005: 22.9%, 33/144, [95% CI, 0.16-0.30], and 33.1%, 44/133, [95% CI, 0.25-0.41], p = 0.059; 2010: 28.2%, 51/181, [95% CI, 0.22-0.35] and 32.5%, 51/157, [95% CI, 0.25-0.40], p = 0.390). Our findings indicate that inclusion of sex-specific analysis and reporting in the orthopaedic literature improved during our study period, but are present in less than 1/3 of the studies. Although subgroup analysis and reporting are required by NIH guidelines, it is important that such analyses be published in non-NIH-funded studies to generate hypotheses regarding sex differences for subsequent research. These data also are important as they can be used in systematic reviews where large independent studies may not be available in the literature. Where evaluating conditions that affect males and females, studies should be designed with sufficient sample size to allow for subgroup analysis by sex to be performed, and they should include sex-specific differences among the a priori research questions.

Metal artifact suppression from reformatted projections in multi-slice helical CT using dual-front active contours.

Rotational stress-induced increase in epinephrine levels delays cutaneous wound healing in mice. Stress impairs wound healing of cutaneous lesions; however, the mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rotational stress on cutaneous wound healing in mice and propose a mechanism. Male mice were spun at 45 rpm for 15 min every hour beginning 3 days before wounding until euthanasia. Control animals were not subjected to stress. To confirm that catecholamines participate in stress-induced delay of wound healing, mice were treated daily with propranolol. An excisional lesion was created and measured. Seven and 14 days later, animals were killed and lesions collected. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostained for alpha-smooth muscle actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activity, nitrite levels, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression were measured in the wounds. In addition, murine skin fibroblast cultures were treated with high levels of epinephrine and fibroblast activity was evaluated. Stressed mice exhibited reduced locomotor activity and increased normetanephrine plasma levels. Rotational stress was associated with decreased wound contraction, reduced re-epithelialization, reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation, but with strongly increased nitrite levels. Furthermore, inflammatory cell infiltration, TNF-alpha expression, myofibroblastic differentiation, and angiogenesis were all delayed in the stress group. Propranolol administration reversed the deleterious effects of stress on wound contraction and re-epithelialization. High epinephrine concentrations increased murine skin fibroblast proliferation and nitric oxide synthesis, and strongly inhibited skin fibroblast migration and both pro- and active MMP-2. In conclusion, rotational stress impairs cutaneous wound healing due to epinephrine increased levels.

Mechanisms of sibling socialization in normative family development. Siblings are important sources of social influence throughout childhood and adolescence. Nevertheless, the processes by which siblings influence one another remain relatively unexplored. We highlight two theories of sibling influence-sibling deidentification and social learning-that offer insights as to how and why siblings develop similar and different attributes, attitudes, and behaviors. Recognizing the need to move past post hoc explanations, we suggest several directions for how these two influence processes can be measured directly in future work. Research on sibling influence also can be improved by integrating these theories and attending to their domains of influence.

The pain receptor TRPV1 displays agonist-dependent activation stoichiometry. The receptor channel TRPV1 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1) is expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons of the pain pathway, where it functions as a sensor of noxious heat and various chemicals, including eicosanoids, capsaicin, protons and peptide toxins. Comprised of four identical subunits that organize into a non-selective cationic permeable channel, this receptor has a variety of binding sites responsible for detecting their respective agonists. Although its physiological role as a chemosensor has been described in detail, the stoichiometry of TRPV1 activation by its different ligands remains unknown. Here, we combined the use of concatemeric constructs harboring mutated binding sites with patch-clamp recordings in order to determine the stoichiometry for TRPV1 activation through the vanilloid binding site and the outer-pore domain by capsaicin and protons, respectively. We show that, while a single capsaicin-bound subunit was sufficient to achieve a maximal open-channel lifetime, all four proton-binding sites were required. Thus, our results demonstrate a distinct stoichiometry of TRPV1 activation through two of its different agonist-binding domains.

Primary malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of salivary glands. We evaluated the medical record of patients with salivary gland neoplasms diagnosed at Timisoara City Hospital from 2002 to 2009. A study has been carried out for seven years on 204 cases of salivary gland tumors and only two cases of salivary gland lymphomas were diagnosed. The two cases were females of 71- and 49-year-old, respectively. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were cut in 4 mum thick sections and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The primary monoclonal antibodies for the immunohistochemical analysis were the followings: LCA (2B11, Dako), CD20 (L26, Dako), cytokeratin (MNF116, Dako), p53 (DQ-7, Dako), and PCNA (PC-10, Dako). The histopathology and immunohistochemistry suggested in the first case a low-grade diffuse large B-cell mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and in the second case a high-grade extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.

Long term clinical outcomes after deployment of femoral vascular closure devices in coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. We evaluated the long term clinical outcomes of femoral vascular closure devices following its deployment in coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. From June 2000 to September 2004, 265 patients who received femoral vascular closure devices after coronary angiography and PCIs were enrolled into the study. Patients' medical records were reviewed and vascular complications within 1 year of follow-up period were recorded. Rutherford's categories of claudication were used to quantify different degrees of claudication and leg ischaemia. Duplex ultrasonography of both femoral arteries (using the nonaccessed site as control) was performed at 1 year after deployment of vascular closure devices. Vessel diameter and flow velocities for both common femoral arteries were obtained. There was no occurrence of late vascular complications like arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, surgical repair of access site complications, late groin bleeding and infection. By Rutherford categories of claudication, 99.2% of patients had grade 0 claudication while the remaining 0.8% was in grade 1. By arterial Duplex ultrasonography, the peak systolic velocity of the accessed femoral artery (predominantly right side) was nonsignificantly higher, 94.9 + or - 26.0 cm/s when compared to 91.5 + or - 24.8 cm/s in the control site (P = 0.12). As for vessel diameter, no significant difference was found in the mean end-diastolic vessel diameter 8.8 + or - 1.3 mm (puncture site) versus 8.7 + or - 4.4 mm (control site) (P = 0.72). We found that the use of femoral closure devices was safe and it was not associated with any adverse long term vascular complications.

Plasma matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines and angiogenic factors in moyamoya disease. To document the expression patterns of various matrixins, cytokines and angiogenic factors in plasma to assess their involvement in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease (MMD). This study included plasma samples from 20 MMD patients and nine healthy individuals. The plasma concentration of five matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, three interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and basic fibroblast growth factor was determined using multianalyte profiling systems. The concentration of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) was measured using ELISA. Gelatin zymography for MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also performed. MMD patients exhibited significantly higher plasma concentrations of MMP-9, MCP-1, IL-1beta, VEGF and PDGF-BB, and lower plasma concentrations of MMP-3, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 compared with healthy controls. Significant correlations were found among MMP-9, MCP-1, VEGF, PDGF-BB and TIMP-2 in MMD patients. There were distinctive expression patterns of matrixins, cytokines and angiogenic factors in MMD patients, which seemed to correlate with disease pathogenesis. The balance between MMPs and TIMPs was disrupted in MMD and correlated with disease pathogenesis. Increased plasma levels of MCP-1 and VEGF in MMD patients may play a role in the recruitment of vascular progenitor cells and in the formation of collateral vessels.

Partial mid-portion Achilles tendon ruptures: new sonographic findings helpful for diagnosis. Partial Achilles tendon ruptures are not always easy to diagnose. A history including a sudden onset of pain and/or relative weakness in plantar flexion force is an indicator. The most loaded side of the Achilles tendon is the dorsal side (skin side). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound (US) and colour Doppler (CD) findings in patients with a suspected partial rupture in the Achilles tendon. Seventeen patients (16 men and 1 woman) with a mean age of 36 years (range 23-71 years) were examined clinically and by US+CD because of mid-portion Achilles tendon pain. There was an acute onset in 14 of 17 patients, and all had painful weakness during tendon loading activity. In all patients, the US examination showed a partial Achilles tendon rupture, presented as a disrupted dorsal (skin side) tendon line and an irregular tendon structure mainly located in the dorsal and mid-tendon. The size of the rupture varied from 1/3 to 2/3 of the tendon thickness. In the dorsal part of the tendon, corresponding to the region with disrupted tendon line and irregular structure, CD examination showed high blood flow-most often of a longitudinal character. Six of the patients were surgically treated, and macroscopical examination verified the US findings showing disruption on the dorsal side and a partial rupture in the dorsal and mid-tendon. US and Doppler examination can be helpful tools to diagnose partial mid-portion Achilles tendon ruptures. The characteristic findings of a disrupted dorsal tendon line and high blood flow in the structurally abnormal dorsal tendon indicate a partial rupture.

Deconvolution in diffusion spectrum imaging. Diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) allows the estimation of the displacement probability density function (pdf) of water molecules, which contain valuable information about the microgeometry of the medium where the diffusion process occurs. It provides a more general approach to disentangle complex fiber structures in biological tissues because it does not assume any particular model of diffusion; even so, it has a number of limitations that remain unstudied. For instance, the theoretical model used to compute the displacement pdf is based on a Fourier transformation defined in the whole measurement space; however, in practice, it is computed using discrete signals with a finite support. As a consequence, the displacement pdf obtained from the experiments is the convolution between the true pdf and a point spread function (PSF) that completely depends on the experimental sampling scheme. In this work, a general framework to rectify and decontaminate the displacement pdf reconstructed from DSI is introduced. This framework is based on model-free deconvolution techniques that allow obtaining clearer and sharper DSI estimates. The method was tested in synthetic data as well as in real data measured from a healthy human volunteer. The results demonstrated that the angular resolution of DSI can be increased, potentially revealing new real fiber components and reducing both the artefactual peaks and the uncertainty of the local diffusion orientational distribution. Furthermore, the deconvolution process provides scalar maps of quantities derived from the propagator, such as the zero displacement probability, with higher tissue contrast.

An emerging role of mTOR in lipid biosynthesis. Lipid biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The lipids produced by cells (glycerolipids, fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids) are used as an energy source/reserve, as building blocks for membrane biosynthesis, as precursor molecules for the synthesis of various cellular products, and as signaling molecules. Defects in lipid synthesis or processing contribute to the development of many diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer. Studies published over the last few years have shown that the target of rapamycin (TOR), a conserved serine/threonine kinase with an important role in regulating cell growth, controls lipid biosynthesis through various mechanisms. Here, we review these findings and briefly discuss their potential relevance for human health and disease.

Regulation of T cell function by microRNA-720. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health burden. Functional exhaustion and numerical reduction of HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the liver and peripheral blood limit anti-HBV CTL activity in patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB). However, the ongoing anti-HBV CD8(+) T cell responses in the lymphoid organs are largely unknown due to the infeasibility of obtaining lymphoid organs from CHB patients. Here we demonstrate that the percentage of HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells is higher in the spleen of CHB patients than that from peripheral blood and liver. Although they do respond to TCR stimulation and produce IFNγ, the cells proliferate poorly. Furthermore, miR-720 expression is upregulated in HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Overexpression of miR-720 in primary human CD8(+) T cells inhibits TCR stimulation-induced proliferation. We also demonstrate that TGFβ sustains miR-720 upregulation after TCR stimulation, and blood TGFβ levels are associated with the outcome of type I interferon treatment of CHB patients. Thus, therapies targeting miR-720 may help restore impaired immunity in CHB patients. 


Significance of anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio in predicting hepatitis C viremia.

Outward electron transfer by Saccharomyces cerevisiae monitored with a bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell-type activity sensor. A Janus head-like bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell was constructed to monitor the electron transfer from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a woven carbon anode. The experiments were conducted during an ethanol cultivation of 170 g/l glucose in the presence and absence of yeast-peptone medium. First, using a basic fuel-cell type activity sensor, it was shown that yeast-peptone medium contains electroactive compounds. For this purpose, 1% solutions of soy peptone and yeast extract were subjected to oxidative conditions, using a microbial fuel cell set-up corresponding to a typical galvanic cell, consisting of culture medium in the anodic half-cell and 0.5 M K(3)Fe(CN)(6) in the cathodic half-cell. Second, using a bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell, it was shown that electrons were transferred from yeast cells to the carbon anode. The participation of electroactive compounds in the electron transport was separated as background current. This result was verified by applying medium-free conditions, where only glucose was fed, confirming that electrons are transferred from yeast cells to the woven carbon anode. Knowledge about the electron transfer through the cell membrane is of importance in amperometric online monitoring of yeast fermentations and for electricity production with microbial fuel cells.


Metabolic bioactivation and drug-related adverse effects: current status and future directions from a pharmaceutical research perspective.

[Effects of cadmium stress on fatty acid composition and lipid peroxidation of Malus hupehensis]. This paper studied the fatty acid composition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the leaves and roots of Malus hupehensis seedlings under effects of cadmium (Cd) stress. Noticeable changes were observed in the kinds and relative contents of fatty acids after treated with CdCl2 for 7-12 hours. The relative contents of unsaturated fatty acids in leaves and roots reached the maximum after treated for 7 hours, being 82. 82% and 72. 43% , respectively. The kinds of fatty acids in leaves increased from 11 to 14 after treated for 12 hours, while those in roots increased from 4 to 6 after treated for 17 hours. The O2* generation rate and the H2O2 content reached the maximum after treated for 3 and 7 hours, respectively, and the MDA content and LOX activity increased with treating time. Cd stress altered the fatty acid composition of Malus hupehensis via the inducement of reactive oxygen species and lipoxygenase, and induced lipid peroxidation, which was caused by both ROS and LOX within the first 12 hours of CdCl2 treatment and mainly by the increase of LOX activity since then.

iSBatch: a batch-processing platform for data analysis and exploration of live-cell single-molecule microscopy images and other hierarchical datasets. Recent technical advances have made it possible to visualize single molecules inside live cells. Microscopes with single-molecule sensitivity enable the imaging of low-abundance proteins, allowing for a quantitative characterization of molecular properties. Such data sets contain information on a wide spectrum of important molecular properties, with different aspects highlighted in different imaging strategies. The time-lapsed acquisition of images provides information on protein dynamics over long time scales, giving insight into expression dynamics and localization properties. Rapid burst imaging reveals properties of individual molecules in real-time, informing on their diffusion characteristics, binding dynamics and stoichiometries within complexes. This richness of information, however, adds significant complexity to analysis protocols. In general, large datasets of images must be collected and processed in order to produce statistically robust results and identify rare events. More importantly, as live-cell single-molecule measurements remain on the cutting edge of imaging, few protocols for analysis have been established and thus analysis strategies often need to be explored for each individual scenario. Existing analysis packages are geared towards either single-cell imaging data or in vitro single-molecule data and typically operate with highly specific algorithms developed for particular situations. Our tool, iSBatch, instead allows users to exploit the inherent flexibility of the popular open-source package ImageJ, providing a hierarchical framework in which existing plugins or custom macros may be executed over entire datasets or portions thereof. This strategy affords users freedom to explore new analysis protocols within large imaging datasets, while maintaining hierarchical relationships between experiments, samples, fields of view, cells, and individual molecules. 

[Effects of WWOX on ovarian cancer cell attachment in vitro]. To observe the effects of WWOX on cell attachment in ovarian cancer, and to explore its mechanisms of action. Attachment assay was used to assess the adhesion of wwox-transfected PEO1 cells and vector-transfected PEO1 cells that were constructed, as well as PEO1 parent cells. Alpha/beta integrin-mediated cell adhesion assays were designed to identify cells surface integrins in PEO1 clone cells. Integrin function blocking experiments were designed to further determine integrins in PEO1 clone cells according to the integrin that was selected in integrin expression profiling. FACS analysis was used to further detect the level of integrin alpha3 on the cell membrane. Attachment assay showed that adhesion of WWOX-transfected PEO1 cells to fibronectin was significantly slower than that in vector-transfected controls or PEO1 parent cells, cultured on the pre-coated fibronectin for 2 hours (P<0.01). The level of membranous integrins alpha2 and alpha3 in the WWOX-transfected PEO1 cells was significantly decreased, as compared with that in vector-transfected controls (P<0.05), but there was no association with the level of functioning integrins betal or beta2 in clone cells (P>0.05). The attachment assays were repeated after pre-incubating the cells with integrin alpha2 or alpha3 function-blocking antibodies. These results showed that blocking integrin alpha3 significantly reduced the binding to fibronectin of all the PEO1 clonal lines, as compared with cells pre-incubated with a non-specific IgG antibody (P<0.05). In contrast, preincubation with alpha2 blocking antibody had very little effect on fibronectin binding in these cells (P>0.05). FACS analysis showed that membranous integrin alpha3 expression revealed a marked reduction in WWOX-transfected cells than that in vector-transfected cells. WWOX acts as an ovarian tumor suppressor by modulating the interaction between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix, decreasing integrin activity and adhesion of tumor cells to fibronectin. This suggests an important role for loss of WWOX tumor suppressor in promoting attachment and adhesion of ovarian cancer cells on locoregional peritoneum, and further resulting in enhancing locoregional peritoneal tumor spread.

Have rates of erectile dysfunction improved within the past 17 years after radical prostatectomy? A systematic analysis of the control arms of prospective randomized trials on penile rehabilitation. Based on case series, potency rates after radical prostatectomy (RPE) differ substantially and - furthermore - it remains unclear whether they have improved in more recent surgical series. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether potency rates after RPE have improved over the years. A systematic analysis of the control arms of all randomized controlled trials (RCT; n = 11) on penile rehabilitation after RPE was carried out. In total, 2009 patients were included in these RCTs, 685 thereof in the respective control arms, who were either observed or received placebo. Assessment of erectile function in these studies was carried out by the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) or the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Eight trials used SEP3 as study endpoint. The rate of positive response to SEP3 (=erectile function sufficient for successful intercourse) in the control arms was 20% in 1997 (year of publication), 10% in 2003, 19% in 2004, 25% in 2008, 21% in 2010, 67% in 2011, 10% in 2013, and 22% in 2014. Eight RCTs assessed the IIEF-EF, yet results were not reported uniformly. In the control arms the IIEF-EF was 9.2 (year of publication 2003), 13.3 (2004), 8.8 (2008), 25% ≥22.0 (2008), 17.4 (2010), 58% ≥26.0 (2011), 9.3 (2013), and 11.6 (2014). Limitations of this analysis are a positive selection bias regarding patient recruitment, surgical approach, and the non-uniform inclusion and outcome criteria. This systematic analysis of the control arms of all RCTs on penile rehabilitation after nerve-sparing RPE shows (i) that the rate of undisturbed erectile function is in the range 20-25% in most studies and (ii) that these rates have not substantially improved or changed over the past 17 years. 

Proneurotrophin-3 is a neuronal apoptotic ligand: evidence for retrograde-directed cell killing. Although mature neurotrophins are well described trophic factors that elicit retrograde survival signaling, the precursor forms of neurotrophins (i.e., proneurotrophins) can function as high-affinity apoptotic ligands for selected neural populations. An outstanding question is whether target-derived proneurotrophins might affect neuronal survival/death decisions through a retrograde transport mechanism. Since neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is highly expressed in non-neural tissues that receive peripheral innervation, we investigated the localized actions of its precursor (proNT-3) on sympathetic neurons in the present study. Pharmacological inhibition of intracellular furin proteinase activity in 293T cells resulted in proNT-3 release instead of mature NT-3, whereas membrane depolarization in cerebellar granule neurons stimulated endogenous proNT-3 secretion, suggesting that proNT-3 is an inducible bona fide ligand in the nervous system. Our data also indicate that recombinant proNT-3 induced sympathetic neuron death that is p75(NTR)- and sortilin-dependent, with hallmark features of apoptosis including JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation and nuclear fragmentation. Using compartmentalized culture systems that segregate neuronal cell bodies from axons, proNT-3, acting within the distal axon compartment, elicited sympathetic neuron death and overrode the survival-promoting actions of NGF. Together, these results raise the intriguing possibility that dysregulation of proneurotrophin processing/release by innervated targets can be deleterious to the neurons projecting to these sites.

Positional cues in serial learning: the spin-list technique. To test the hypothesis that serial learning depends largely on the encoding and retrieval of position-to-item associations, we examined whether people can learn spin lists on which starting position is randomly varied across successive learning trials. By turning positional information from a reliable cue into a source of intertrial interference, we expected learning to be greatly impaired. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that participants were only slightly worse at serial learning under spin conditions and that this impairment reflects a substantial increase in initiation errors coupled with a small increase in intertrial forgetting. These data show that participants can effectively use nonpositional cues when positional cues are unreliable.


Comparison between gentamycin and exon skipping treatments to restore ryanodine receptor subtype 2 functions in mdx mouse duodenum myocytes.

Increases in frontostriatal connectivity are associated with response to dorsomedial repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in refractory binge/purge behaviors. Conventional treatments for eating disorders are associated with poor response rates and frequent relapse. Novel treatments are needed, in combination with markers to characterize and predict treatment response. Here, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to identify predictors and correlates of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) at 10 Hz for eating disorders with refractory binge/purge symptomatology. 28 subjects with anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype or bulimia nervosa underwent 20-30 sessions of 10 Hz dmPFC rTMS. rs-fMRI data were collected before and after rTMS. Subjects were stratified into responder and nonresponder groups using a criterion of ≥50% reduction in weekly binge/purge frequency. Neural predictors and correlates of response were identified using seed-based functional connectivity (FC), using the dmPFC and adjacent dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as regions of interest. 16 of 28 subjects met response criteria. Treatment responders had lower baseline FC from dmPFC to lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right posterior insula, and from dACC to right posterior insula and hippocampus. Responders had low baseline FC from the dACC to the ventral striatum and anterior insula; this connectivity increased over treatment. However, in nonresponders, frontostriatal FC was high at baseline, and dmPFC-rTMS suppressed FC in association with symptomatic worsening. Enhanced frontostriatal connectivity was associated with responders to dmPFC-rTMS for binge/purge behavior. rTMS caused paradoxical suppression of frontostriatal connectivity in nonresponders. rs-fMRI could prove critical for optimizing stimulation parameters in a future sham-controlled trial of rTMS in disordered eating.

[Birth defects mortality in five-year-old minors of age, Mexico, 1998-2006]. To analyze mortality due to birth defects from 1998-2006. To select municipalities with high mortality among children under 5 years of age. The source of information was mortality records from vital statistics collected by SSA/INEGI. We used the 2005 Municipal Geostatistical Framework by INEGI and SIGEPI for the spatial analysis. The selection criteria were municipalities with 80% and over of deaths due to birth defects. Deaths diminished 8% during 1998-2006 and rates decreased 20%. A total of 42.57% - 48% of deaths are due to circulatory system defects and 13.69% - 19.39% are due to the nervous system; the former rose 4% and the latter fell 32%. Eighty percent or more occur in children under 5 years and the rate in this group fell 8.63%. A total of 1 025 (41.82%) municipalities are priorities, 104 (10.14%) are high and 102 (9.95%) are very high priorities, where 66% of deaths occur among children under 5 years old. The interventions to decrease mortality due to birth defects should be directed towards one-year-old children (75%) and towards 8.4% of the municipalities that are a very high priority, since they represent 66% of the deaths.

Developmental trajectories of skin conductance level in middle childhood: sex, race, and externalizing behavior problems as predictors of growth. We examined trajectories of skin conductance level (SCL) during baselines and two tasks across middle and late childhood through growth modeling. We also assessed the role of individual differences including child sex, race, and externalizing behavior problems (delinquency, anger, and aggression) in defining these trajectories. At T1, 128 girls and 123 boys (Mean age 8.23 yrs; SD=0.73) participated; 64% were European-American and 36% were African-American. Families participated in 2nd and 3rd study waves with a one-year lag between each wave. Mothers and children reported on child externalizing problems. Addressing notable gaps in knowledge, findings demonstrate varying trajectories of SCL over time based on the child's behavior problems, race, and sex, and are of importance for a better understanding of developmental psychopathology processes.

Ringo: discordance between the molecular and clinical manifestation in a golden retriever muscular dystrophy dog. Of the various genetic homologues to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), the Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dog, which presents a variable but usually severe and progressive muscle weakness, has the closest relevance to DMD in both clinical severity and histopathological change. Among 77 GRMD dogs born in our colony in Brazil, we have identified a very mildly affected dog, Ringo, born July 2003. Among his descendants, at least one male, Suflair, is also showing a mild course. In an attempt to better characterize these two dogs, we studied the pattern of muscle proteins expression in Ringo and Suflair, as compared to severely affected and normal control dogs. Dystrophin was absent in both and utrophin was overexpressed in a pattern similar to the observed in severely affected dogs. Understanding the mechanism that is protecting Ringo and Suflair from the deleterious effect of the dystrophin gene mutation is of utmost interest. In addition it points out that the clinical impact of therapeutic trials should be interpreted with caution.

Microsatellite-based evaluation of Ribes spp. germplasm. There is a lack of published microsatellite data which characterizes Ribes spp. To address this, an initial study of simple sequence repeat (SSR) variation was undertaken in 41 cultivars belonging to four species of the genus Ribes to evaluate its genetic variability. The cultivars were collected in Piedmont, northwest Italy, together with one cultivar from Switzerland. Twenty SSRs were screened for amplification and polymorphism. Seven failed to amplify, and therefore the remaining 13 were selected and used to fingerprint all the cultivars. Microsatellite analysis resulted in the identification of 38 genotypes, suggesting the existence of possible clonal genotypes and synonyms. Among the cultivars analyzed, two tetraploid accessions were found. The evaluation of genetic variability in Ribes is of fundamental importance for future nutritional breeding programs and to preserve genetic resources, as cultivar characterization permits better management of plant collections.

Cryoablation of stellate ganglia and atrial arrhythmia in ambulatory dogs with pacing-induced heart failure. There is an association between autonomic nerve discharges and atrial arrhythmias (including bradycardia and tachycardia) in ambulatory dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (HF). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that stellate ganglia ablation can reduce the incidence of atrial arrhythmias in a canine model of pacing-induced HF. Cryoablation of the caudal half of the left and right stellate ganglia and T2-T4 thoracic sympathetic ganglia was performed in six dogs (experimental group). Left upper stellate ganglia nerve activity, vagal nerve activity, and electrocardiogram were continuously recorded using an implanted radiotransmitter. After 2 weeks of baseline recording, rapid right ventricular pacing (28 +/- 4 days) was used to induce HF. The control group (N = 6) underwent the same procedures except for cryoablation. The experimental group had no episodes of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (P <.0001 vs control). Cryoablation significantly (P = .0097) reduced prolonged (>3 seconds) sinus pause episodes from 5 +/- 6 to 0 on day 1, from 250 +/- 424 to 11 +/- 11 on day 7, and from 123 +/- 206 to 30 +/- 33 on day 14 after induction of HF. In the experimental group only, vagal nerve activity may occur alone without concomitant stellate ganglia nerve activity. However, these isolated vagal nerve activity episodes did not result in prolonged sinus pause. Histologic studies confirmed successful cryoablation of the caudal half of the stellate ganglia. Cryoablation of bilateral stellate and T2-T4 thoracic ganglia significantly reduced paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and prolonged sinus pause episodes induced by sympathetic discharges in dogs with pacing-induced HF.

Phenomenological reports diagnose accuracy of eyewitness identification decisions. This study investigated whether measuring the phenomenology of eyewitness identification decisions aids evaluation of their accuracy. Witnesses (N=502) viewed a simulated crime and attempted to identify two targets from lineups. A divided attention manipulation during encoding reduced the rate of remember (R) correct identifications, but not the rates of R foil identifications or know (K) judgments in the absence of recollection (i.e., K/[1-R]). Both RK judgments and recollection ratings (a novel measure of graded recollection) distinguished correct from incorrect positive identifications. However, only recollection ratings improved accuracy evaluation after identification confidence was taken into account. These results provide evidence that RK judgments for identification decisions function in a similar way as for recognition decisions; are consistent with the notion of graded recollection; and indicate that measures of phenomenology can enhance the evaluation of identification accuracy.

Potential of lithium to reduce aluminium-induced cytotoxic  effects in rat brain.

Analysis of cholesterol levels in lipoprotein(a) with anion-exchange chromatography. We previously established an analysis method for determining the cholesterol levels of five major lipoprotein classes [HDL, LDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), VLDL, and chylomicrons] in serum by an anion-exchange (AEX)-HPLC method, but lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases, was not determinable. Therefore, we established new AEX-HPLC separation conditions for analyzing the cholesterol levels of six lipoprotein classes, including Lp(a). Serum lipoproteins were separated by HPLC with a diethylaminoethyl-ligand nonporous polymer-based column by elution with a stepwise gradient of the sodium perchlorate concentration. In this improved method, HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons, and Lp(a) were each eluted from the column. The cholesterol levels of the eluted lipoproteins were measured enzymatically by a postcolumn reaction. The within-day assay and between-day assay coefficients of variation for the lipoprotein cholesterol levels were in the ranges of 0.29-11.86% and 0.57-11.99%, respectively. The Lp(a) cholesterol levels determined by AEX-HPLC were significantly correlated with the amounts of Lp(a) protein measured by an immunoturbidimetry method available commercially (r = 0.9503, P < 0.0001). Taken together, this AEX-HPLC method may be effectively applied to the analysis of serum lipoproteins with high levels of Lp(a).

Unintended impacts of a Medicaid prior authorization policy on access to medications for bipolar illness. Prior authorization policies (PA) are widely used to control psychotropic medication costs by state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of a Maine Medicaid PA policy on initiation and switching of anticonvulsant and atypical antipsychotic treatments among patients with bipolar disorder. We obtained Maine and New Hampshire (comparison state) Medicaid and Medicare claims data for 2001 to 2004; the Maine PA policy was implemented in July 2003. Among continuously enrolled patients with bipolar disorder (Maine: n = 5336; New Hampshire: n = 1376), we used an interrupted times series with comparison group design to estimate changes in rates of initiating new episodes of bipolar treatment and generalized estimating equations models to examine rates of switching therapies among patients under treatment. The Maine PA policy was associated with a marked decrease in rates of initiation of bipolar treatments; a relative reduction of 32.3% (95% CI: 24.8, 39.9) compared with expected rates at 4 months after policy implementation. This decrease was driven primarily by reductions in the initiation of nonpreferred agents. The policy had no discernable impact on rates of switching therapy among patients currently on treatment (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.39). The findings of this study provide evidence that PA implementation can be a barrier to initiation of nonpreferred agents without offsetting increases in initiation of preferred agents, which is a major concern. There is a critical need to evaluate the possible unintended effects of PA policies to achieve optimal health outcomes among low-income patients with chronic mental illness. In addition, more research is needed to understand how these barriers arise and whether specific seriously mentally ill populations or drug classes should be exempted from PA policies.

Anxiety sensitivity and posttrauma stress symptoms in female undergraduates following a campus shooting. Participants were recruited from female undergraduate students participating in an ongoing longitudinal study at the time of a campus shooting. Eighty-five percent (N = 691) of the 812 students who were invited to participate in the current study completed questionnaires an average of 27 days following a campus shooting. In a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal design, the cognitive and the physical concerns dimensions of postshooting anxiety sensitivity accounted for unique variance in posttrauma stress symptom severity (cross-sectional), after controlling for preshooting psychological symptoms (longitudinal). The cognitive concerns dimension showed the strongest relationship. Anxiety sensitivity also appeared to moderate the relationships of hyperarousal symptoms with reexperiencing and numbing symptoms.

Dissection of combinatorial control by the Met4 transcriptional complex. Met4 is the transcriptional activator of the sulfur metabolic network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lacking DNA-binding ability, Met4 must interact with proteins called Met4 cofactors to target promoters for transcription. Two types of DNA-binding cofactors (Cbf1 and Met31/Met32) recruit Met4 to promoters and one cofactor (Met28) stabilizes the DNA-bound Met4 complexes. To dissect this combinatorial system, we systematically deleted each category of cofactor(s) and analyzed Met4-activated transcription on a genome-wide scale. We defined a core regulon for Met4, consisting of 45 target genes. Deletion of both Met31 and Met32 eliminated activation of the core regulon, whereas loss of Met28 or Cbf1 interfered with only a subset of targets that map to distinct sectors of the sulfur metabolic network. These transcriptional dependencies roughly correlated with the presence of Cbf1 promoter motifs. Quantitative analysis of in vivo promoter binding properties indicated varying levels of cooperativity and interdependency exists between members of this combinatorial system. Cbf1 was the only cofactor to remain fully bound to target promoters under all conditions, whereas other factors exhibited different degrees of regulated binding in a promoter-specific fashion. Taken together, Met4 cofactors use a variety of mechanisms to allow differential transcription of target genes in response to various cues.

Relationship Between Accelerometer Load, Collisions, and Repeated High-Intensity Effort Activity in Rugby League Players. Triaxial accelerometers have been critical in providing information on the high-acceleration, low-velocity movements that occur in team sports. In addition, these sensors have proven to be useful in quantifying the activities that do not involve the vertical acceleration associated with locomotion (e.g., tackling, on-ground wrestling, and grappling). This study investigated the relationship between Player Load (PL), 2D Player Load (2DPL), and Player Load Slow (PL Slow), collisions, and repeated high-intensity effort (RHIE) activity in rugby league players. One hundred and eighty-two rugby league players (age, 24.3 ± 3.3 years) participated in this study. Movement was recorded using a global positioning system unit sampling at 10 Hz and triaxial accelerometer sampling at 100 Hz. Analysis was completed during 26 matches (totaling 386 appearances). Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to determine relationships between PL, 2DPL, and PL Slow and total collisions and RHIE activity. When all players were considered, weak relationships were found between PL and the number of collisions and RHIE bouts performed. However, PL was strongly associated (p ≤ 0.05) with total distance, low-speed activity, high-speed running distance, total collisions, and the number of RHIE bouts for forwards and hookers. Weak and typically insignificant relationships were found between PL, 2DPL, and PL Slow and the number of collisions and RHIE bouts performed by the adjustables and outside backs positional groups. The relationships between PL and the number of collisions and RHIE bouts are stronger in positions where contact and repeated-effort demands are high. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that PL, 2DPL, and PL Slow offer useful "real-time" measures of collision and RHIE activity, particularly in forwards and hookers, to inform interchange strategies and ensure players are training at an adequate intensity.

Increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity in retinal neurons in early diabetic retinopathy. There are increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) in diabetic retinas. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) contributes to the increased levels of retinal NO in early diabetic retinopathy by examining the expression and activity of nNOS in retinal neurons after 5 weeks of diabetes. Changes in NO levels were measured using NO imaging of retinal neurons in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes for five weeks. NO imaging was compared to nNOS localization using immunocytochemistry, and nNOS message and protein levels were measured using quantitative real-time PCR and western blots. There was a close anatomic correlation between the localization of the increased NO production and the nNOS immunoreactivity in the retinal plexiform layers of diabetic retinas. There was no change in nNOS message, but nNOS protein was decreased and its subcellular localization was altered. Treatment with insulin or aminoguanidine partially ameliorated the increase in NO in diabetic retinas. These results suggest that increased nNOS activity is responsible for the majority of increased NO in retinal neurons in early diabetic retinopathy. This supports a role for increased nNOS activity in the early neuronal dysfunction in the diabetic retina.

Attenuation of insulin-resistance-based hepatocarcinogenesis and angiogenesis by combined treatment with branched-chain amino acids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in obese diabetic rats. Insulin resistance (IR) is reportedly involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because neovascularization plays an important role in HCC, including hepatocarcinogenesis, an angiostatic therapy would be a promising approach for chemoprevention against HCC. The aim of the present study was to examine the combined effect of clinically used branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), in conjunction with neovascularization, on hepatocarcinogenesis under the condition of IR. The combined effect of the treatment on the development of liver enzyme-altered preneoplastic lesions, angiogenesis, and several indices was elucidated in obese diabetic rats. We also performed several sets of in vitro experiments to examine the mechanisms involved. When used individually, both BCAAs and ACE-I at clinically comparable low doses significantly attenuated the development of preneoplastic lesions, along with the suppression of both angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The combination treatment with both agents exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than that of either single agent. Our in vitro study showed a similar combined effect on endothelial cell tubule formation. This combination regimen showed a marked chemopreventive effect against hepatocarcinogenesis, along with suppression of neovascularization and VEGF expression, in obese diabetic rats. Because both BCAAs and ACE-Is are widely used in clinical practice, this combination therapy may represent a potential new strategy for chemoprevention against IR-based HCC in the future.

Hunting down fungal secretomes using liquid-phase IEF prior to high resolution 2-DE. The secreted proteins (secretome) of fungi play a key role in interactions of pathogenic and symbiotic fungi with plants. Using the plant pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans and symbiont Laccaria bicolor grown in culture, we have established a proteomic protocol for extraction, concentration and resolution of the fungal secretome. As no proteomic data were available on mycelium tissues from both L. maculans and L. bicolor, mycelial proteins were studied; they also helped verifying the purity of secretome samples. The quality of protein extracts was initially assessed by both 1-DE and 2-DE using first a broad pH range for IEF, and then narrower acidic and basic pH ranges, prior to 2-DE. Compared with the previously published protocols for which only dozens of 2-D spots were recovered from fungal secretome samples, up to approximately 2000 2-D spots were resolved by our method. MS identification of proteins along several pH gradients confirmed this high resolution, as well as the presence of major secretome markers such as endopolygalacturonases, beta-glucanosyltransferases, pectate lyases and endoglucanases. Shotgun proteomic experiments evidenced the enrichment of secreted protein within the liquid medium. This is the first description of the proteome of L. maculans and L. bicolor, and the first application of liquid-phase IEF to any fungal extracts.

Determinants of survival in patients with calciphylaxis: a multivariate analysis. Our study aims to assess the factors affecting survival in patients with calciphylaxis. We identified 26 patients with biopsy-proven calciphylaxis treated between 1995 and 2007. Clinical and follow-up data were obtained from medical records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the factors affecting survival. The study group consisted of 23 women and 3 men with a mean age of 56.4 +/- 12.9 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities/risk factors including coronary artery disease (58%), diabetes mellitus (58%), and peripheral vascular disease (23%). Mean laboratory values were: calcium, 9.0 mg/dL (range, 6.8-11.6); albumin, 2.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 4.5 mg/dL (range, 2.5-7.5); Ca *phosphate, 35.9; and parathyroid hormone, 320.9 pg/mL (range, 4.6-2,419). Parathyroidectomy was performed in 9 of 26 patients (35%). Of our patients, 19% underwent revascularization procedures and 58% underwent debridement. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with poor survival were female gender ( P = .01), increased weight ( P = .01), and need for vascular procedures ( P = .06). Improved survival was associated with operative debridement ( P = .01). Parathyroidectomy alone did not emerge as a determinant of patient survival, although there was a trend to improved survival when debridement and parathyroidectomy were combined ( P = .09). Rather than a single intervention such as parathyroidectomy, a multidisciplinary approach involving early diagnosis, aggressive medical management, operative debridement, and parathyroidectomy may improve survival in calciphylaxis.

Genomic variation and neurohormonal intervention in heart failure. Neurohormonal activation is an important driver of heart-failure progression, and all pharmacologic interventions that improve heart-failure survival inhibit this systemic response to myocardial injury. Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) receptors in the kidney results in the release of plasma renin, the conversion of peptide precursors to angiotensin II (a2), and ultimately the production of aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antagonists all act by inhibiting the activity of critical protein of this core pathway: the beta(1) receptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, and aldosterone synthase. Investigation of the pharmacogenetic interactions of the ACE D/I polymorphism and heart-failure therapy demonstrates the power of genomics to target therapeutics. This review explores how genetic variation in genes involved in neurohormonal activation influences heart-failure outcomes and the impact of pharmacotherapy.

Gaze direction differentially affects avoidance tendencies to happy and angry faces in socially anxious individuals. Increasing evidence indicates that eye gaze direction affects the processing of emotional faces in anxious individuals. However, the effects of eye gaze direction on the behavioral responses elicited by emotional faces, such as avoidance behavior, remain largely unexplored. We administered an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) in high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) individuals. All participants responded to photographs of angry, happy and neutral faces (presented with direct and averted gaze), by either pushing a joystick away from them (avoidance) or pulling it towards them (approach). Compared to LSA, HSA were faster in avoiding than approaching angry faces. Most crucially, this avoidance tendency was only present when the perceived anger was directed towards the subject (direct gaze) and not when the gaze of the face-stimulus was averted. In contrast, HSA individuals tended to avoid happy faces irrespectively of gaze direction. Neutral faces elicited no approach-avoidance tendencies. Thus avoidance of angry faces in social anxiety as measured by AA-tasks reflects avoidance of subject-directed anger and not of negative stimuli in general. In addition, although both anger and joy are considered to reflect approach-related emotions, gaze direction did not affect HSA's avoidance of happy faces, suggesting differential mechanisms affecting responses to happy and angry faces in social anxiety.

Association Between Sleep and Physical Function in Older Veterans in an Adult Day Healthcare Program. To examine whether sleep disturbance is associated with poor physical function in older veterans in an adult day healthcare (ADHC) program. Cross-sectional. One ADHC program in a Veterans Affairs Ambulatory Care Center. Older veterans (N = 50) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a sleep intervention program who had complete baseline data. Information on participant characteristics (e.g., age, depression, relationship to caregiver, pain, comorbidity) was collected using appropriate questionnaires. Physical function was measured using activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) total scores from the Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire. Sleep was assessed subjectively (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index) and objectively (wrist actigraphy). Participants required substantial assistance with ADLs and IADLs. A regression model showed that participant characteristics (marital status, use of sleep medication, comorbidity, posttraumatic stress disorder) and living arrangement (living with a spouse or others) were significantly associated with poor physical function. Poorer objective sleep (total sleep time, total numbers of awakenings, total wake time) was significantly associated with poor physical function, accounting for a significant proportion of the variance other than participant characteristics. Objective measures of nighttime sleep disturbance were associated with poor physical function in older veterans in an ADHC program. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions to improve sleep will delay functional decline in this vulnerable population.

Couple based family planning education: changes in male involvement and contraceptive use among married couples in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Family planning contributes substantially in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Recently, male involvement has gained considerable attention in family planning programs but the implementation thereof remains a challenge. In that context, our study aimed at measuring the effect of a six-month-long family planning education program on male involvement in family planning, as well as on couples' contraceptive practice. We conducted a quasi-experimental research among 811 married couples in Jimma Zone, southwest Ethiopia. Our study consisted of an intervention and a control group for comparative purpose; and surveyed before and after the implementation of the intervention. The intervention consisted of family planning education, given to both men and women at the household level in the intervention arm, in addition to monthly community gatherings. During the intervention period, households in the control group were not subject to particular activities but had access to routine health care services. We obtained follow-up data from 760 out of 786 (96.7%) couples who were originally enrolled in the survey. Findings were compared within and between groups before and after intervention surveys. At the baseline, contraceptive use in both control and intervention households were similar. After the intervention, we observed among men in the intervention arm a significantly higher level of willingness to be actively involved in family planning compared to the men in the control arm (p < 0.001). In addition, the difference between spouses that discussed family planning issues was less reported within the control group, both in the case of men and women ((p = 0.031) and (p < 0.001)) respectively. In general, a significant, positive difference in male involvement was observed. Concerning contraceptive use, there was change observed among the intervention group who were not using contraception at baseline. This study showed that family planning educational intervention, which includes both spouses and promotes spousal communication, might be useful to foster contraceptive practice among couples. The results also offer practical information on the benefits of male involvement in family planning as a best means to increase contraceptive use. Thus, providing opportunities to reinforce family planning education may strengthen the existing family planning service delivery system.


Reduction of acute anterior dislocations: a prospective randomized study comparing a new technique with the Hippocratic and Kocher methods.


Seasonal, Oceanographic and Atmospheric Drivers of Diving Behaviour in a Temperate Seal Species Living in the High Arctic.

Membrane-permeant phosphoinositide derivatives as modulators of growth factor signaling and neurite outgrowth. Phosphoinositides are important signaling molecules that govern a large number of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, membrane remodeling, and survival. Here we introduce a fully synthetic membrane-permeant derivative of a novel, easily accessible, and very potent phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] mimic: phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4)]. The membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4) derivative activated pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), including protein kinase B, p70S6K, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C, more potently than similar membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2) derivatives in the absence of receptor stimulation. In addition, we demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cells with the membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4)P(2), PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), and PtdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4) derivatives increases the number of neurites per cell in the presence of NGF. This work establishes membrane-permeant phosphoinositides as powerful tools to study PI3K signaling and directly demonstrates that 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are instrumental for neurite initiation.


Perfusion of veins at arterial pressure increases the expression of KLF5 and cell cycle genes in smooth muscle cells.


Aragonite undersaturation in the Arctic Ocean: effects of ocean acidification and sea ice melt.

Reelin is a platelet protein and functions as a positive regulator of platelet spreading on fibrinogen. Abnormalities of platelet functions have been linked to reelin-impaired neuronal disorders. However, little attention has been given to understanding the interplay between reelin and platelet. In this study, reelin was found to present in the human platelets and megakaryocyte-like leukemic cells. Reelin-binding assays revealed that extracellular reelin can interact with platelets through the receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. The reelin-to-platelet interactions enhance platelet spreading on fibrinogen concomitant with the augmentation of lamellipodia formation and F-actin bundling. In contrast, reelin has no effect on integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation and agonist-induced platelet aggregation. Molecular analysis revealed that the up-regulation of Rac1 activity and the inhibition of protein kinase C delta-Thr505 phosphorylation are important for reelin-mediated enhancement of platelet spreading on fibrinogen. These findings demonstrate for the first time that reelin is present in platelets and the reelin-to-platelet interactions play a novel role in platelet signaling and functions.


Metastatic retinoblastoma presenting as a left shoulder soft tissue mass: FNA findings and review of the literature.

Are safety-related features of the road environment associated with smaller declines in physical activity among youth? This study examined how objective measures of the local road environment related to safety were associated with change in physical activity (including active transport) among youth. Few longitudinal studies have examined the impact of the road environment on physical activity among children/adolescents in their neighborhoods. Participants were children aged 8-9 years (n = 170) and adolescents aged 13-15 years (n = 276) in 2004. Data were collected in 2004 and 2006 during follow-up of participants recruited initially in 2001 from 19 primary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Walking/cycling to local destinations was parent-reported for children and self-reported by adolescents. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during nonschool hours was recorded using accelerometers. Road environment features in each participant's neighborhood (area within 800 m radius of their home) were measured objectively using a Geographical Information System. Linear regression analyses examined associations between road features and changes in active transport (AT) and MVPA over 2 years. Children's AT increased but MVPA levels decreased in both age groups; on average, younger girls recorded the greatest declines. The number of traffic/pedestrian lights was associated with DeltaAT among younger girls (B=0.45, p=0.004). The total length of walking tracks (in meters) was associated with AT among younger girls (B = 0.0016, p = 0.015) and adolescent girls (B = 0.0016, p = 0.002). For adolescent boys, intersection density was associated with AT (B = 0.03, p = 0.030). Slow points were associated with MVPA among younger boys before school (B = 1.55, p = 0.021), while speed humps were associated with MVPA among adolescent boys after school (B = 0.23, p = 0.015). There were many associations for adolescent girls: for example, the total length of local roads (B = 0.49, p = 0.005), intersection density (B = 0.05, p = 0.036), and number of speed humps (B = 0.33, p = 0.020) were associated with MVPA during nonschool hours. Safety-related aspects of the built environment are conducive to physical activity among youth and may help stem age-related declines in physical activity. Passive road safety interventions may promote AT and physical activity among less active girls, in particular.


Effects of sodium hyaluronate and triamcinolone acetonide on glucosaminoglycan metabolism in equine articular chondrocytes treated with interleukin-1.

A new technique of bladder neck reconstruction during radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. To evaluate continence after radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients, in whom a new method of the bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) using deep dorsal stitch was implemented (deep single stitch through all bladder layers directly dorsal to the bladder opening after ″ tennis racket″ reconstruction) and to provide justification for its use by means of anatomical study in cadavers. Open radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in 84 patients: 39 patients with a new BNR method used to improve continence and control group of 45 patients with standard ″tennis racket″ BNR. Median follow-up was 14 months in control group and 12 months in study group. Continence recovery was accessed early postoperatively and every 3 months thereafter. Anatomical study was performed on 2 male fresh cadavers reproducing two different BNR techniques to clarify any underlying continence related mechanisms. Patients with new BNR achieved full continence significantly faster (p=0.041), but the continence rates after 12 months were similar between groups. The severity of incontinence up to month 9 was significantly reduced in BNR group. The anastomotic stricture rate was not affected. Applying new BNR to the cadaver model revealed effects on early continence, namely presence of proximal passive closure mechanism in area of bladder neck. Continence in patients with the new BNR method using deep dorsal stitch recovered significantly faster. Moreover, a reduced grade of residual incontinence was documented. The effect was non-significant at month 12 of follow-up, meaning that only early effect was present.


Regulation of XBP-1 signaling during transient and stable recombinant protein production in CHO cells.

[Comparison of selected elements of neonate immunological system with relation to indications for cesarean section and time of delivery]. To define to what degree time and the way of delivery cause changes in CD3+ lymphocytes and their subpopulations CD4+, CD8+, CD25+ and CD19+ lymphocytes and their subpopulations CD5+, CD23+. 49 healthy neonates born in the years 1998-2003 in the Clinical Ward of Perinatology and Gynecology of Silesian Medical University in Zabrze were examined. Taking into account the time of pregnancy and the way of delivery the children were divided into the following groups: Group Ib--23 full-term neonates born by Cesarean section, including 15 neonates with elective indications (Ibe), 8 with emergency indications (Ibn). Group IIb--26 pre-term neonates born by Cesarean section, including 18 with elective indications (IIbe) and 8 with emergency indications (IIbn). Our study applied a method of umbilical blood sampling with the following red blood cells lysis. Statistically significant lower mean number of B CD5+ lymphocytes was found in full-term neonates born by Cesarean section in comparison to pre-term neonates born by the same method. Similar differences concern full-term and pre-term neonates born by elective Cesarean section. Statistically significant lower mean number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD25+ lymphocytes was found in pre-term neonates born by elective Cesarean section in comparison to pre-term neonates by emergency Cesarean section. Time of pregnancy termination in a mother by Cesarean section can be related to the occurrence of statistically significant changes in B CD5+ lymphocytes quantities in her neonate. Emergency Cesarean section in a mother can be related to the increased quantity of T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes in her pre-term born neonate. No statistically significant differences were found in mean values of other immunological parameters among study groups.

Profiling the anti-protozoal activity of anti-cancer HDAC inhibitors against Plasmodium and Trypanosoma parasites. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes work together with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to reversibly acetylate both histone and non-histone proteins. As a result, these enzymes are involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression as well as other important cellular processes. HDACs are validated drug targets for some types of cancer, with four HDAC inhibitors clinically approved. However, they are also showing promise as novel drug targets for other indications, including malaria and other parasitic diseases. In this study the in vitro activity of four anti-cancer HDAC inhibitors was examined against parasites that cause malaria and trypanosomiasis. Three of these inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat(®)), romidepsin (Istodax(®)) and belinostat (Beleodaq(®)), are clinically approved for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, while the fourth, panobinostat, has recently been approved for combination therapy use in certain patients with multiple myeloma. All HDAC inhibitors were found to inhibit the growth of asexual-stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in the nanomolar range (IC50 10-200 nM), while only romidepsin was active at sub-μM concentrations against bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei brucei parasites (IC50 35 nM). The compounds were found to have some selectivity for malaria parasites compared with mammalian cells, but were not selective for trypanosome parasites versus mammalian cells. All compounds caused hyperacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in P. falciparum asexual stage parasites and inhibited deacetylase activity in P. falciparum nuclear extracts in addition to recombinant PfHDAC1 activity. P. falciparum histone hyperacetylation data indicate that HDAC inhibitors may differentially affect the acetylation profiles of histone H3 and H4.

Using Naturally Occurring Radionuclides To Determine Drinking Water Age in a Community Water System.


[Approach to alternative therapies in community pharmacy].

Synthetic approaches to protein phosphorylation. Reversible protein phosphorylation is critically important in biology and medicine. Hundreds of thousands of sites of protein phosphorylation have been discovered but our understanding of the functions of the vast majority of these post-translational modifications is lacking. This review describes several chemical and biochemical methods that are under development and in current use to install phospho-amino acids and their mimics site-specifically into proteins. The relative merits of total chemical synthesis, semisynthesis, and nonsense suppression strategies for studying protein phosphorylation are discussed in terms of technical simplicity, scope, and versatility. 


Effects of Acupuncture, RU-486 on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Chronically Stressed Adult Male Rats.

Factors sustaining pediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy in western Kenya. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires nearly perfect adherence to be effective. Although 90% of HIV-infected children live in Africa, there are limited data on pediatric adherence from this multicultural continent.We conducted a qualitative study to identify key factors contributing to pediatric ART adherence. Ten focus group discussions (N = 85) and 35 individual interviews were conducted with parents and guardians of HIV-infected children receiving ART in western Kenya. Interviews covered multiple aspects of the experience of having children take ART and factors that inhibited or facilitated medication adherence. Constant comparison, progressive coding, and triangulation methods were used to arrive at a culturally contextualized, conceptual model for pediatric ART adherence derived from the descriptions of the lived experience in this resource-limited setting. Child care, including sustained ART adherence, depends on interacting cultural and environmental determinants at the levels of the individual child, parent/caregiver, household, community, health care system, and society.

Estradiol or genistein prevent Alzheimer's disease-associated inflammation correlating with an increase PPAR gamma expression in cultured astrocytes. Inflammation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main inflammatory players in AD are the glial cells which initiate the inflammatory response. One of the earliest neuropathological changes in AD is the accumulation of astrocytes at sites of A beta deposition. It is desirable to find methods of tipping the balance towards anti-inflammatory state. Estrogenic compounds have shown anti-inflammatory and also antioxidant activity. Astrocytes were pretreated with 17-beta estradiol or with genistein, and 48 h later treated with 5 microM amyloid beta (A beta) for 24 h. We found that A beta induces inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). All these effects were prevented when cells were pretreated with estradiol or genistein, demonstrating anti-inflammatory effects of estradiol or genistein in astrocytes in primary culture. The A beta-stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory genes in cells is antagonized by the action of the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors). Here we detected an increase in PPAR-gamma expression in astrocytes in primary culture treated with A beta and estradiol or soy isoflavone genistein. Thus, some of the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogenic compounds may be mediated and activated by PPARs suppressing a diverse array of inflammatory responses caused by A beta in astrocytes in primary culture.

Quadratic System Identification: a statistical framework for the paired-pulse paradigm. System Identification refers to the problem of identifying a model or description of a system based on a stretch of input and the corresponding output from the system. The paired-pulse paradigm or the conditioning test pulse paradigm is often used in neurophysiology experiments. In this work we provide a statistical framework for the conditioning test pulse paradigm which also serves as a system identification tool for quadratic or second order Volterra systems. A nonparametric spectral domain based methodology is proposed for the quadratic system identification. It is shown that by carrying out the analysis in the spectral domain one needs to perform only a single set of double pulse experiments as opposed to multiple sets of experiments in the time domain. Simulation studies are performed to assess the performance of the methodology and to study the conditions under which the methods are expected to perform well.


Sulfated hyaluronan derivatives reduce the proliferation rate of primary rat calvarial osteoblasts.

A purified recombinant baculovirus expressed capsid protein of a new astrovirus provides partial protection to runting-stunting syndrome in chickens. A new viral sequence likely belonging to a virus of the family Astroviridae was determined using the gut content of chickens affected with the runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in chickens. Since the appropriate virus could not be isolated in cell culture the open reading frame of the viral capsid protein was cloned to generate a recombinant baculovirus. The protein was purified and used as an experimental vaccine in broiler breeders to provide maternal derived antibodies for the protection of the offspring. The presence of specific antibodies was monitored by an ELISA. The offspring of vaccinated breeder hens were partially protected in a RSS challenge model.


A compact, automated cell culture system for clinical scale cell expansion from primary tissues.

[The electronic use of the NANDA-, NOC- and NIC- classifications and implications for nursing practice]. The data model developed on behalf of the Nursing Service Commission of the Canton of Zurich (Pflegedienstkommission des Kantons Zürich) is based on the NANDA nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Outcome Classification, and the Nursing Intervention Classification (NNN Classifications). It also includes integrated functions for cost-centered accounting, service recording, and the Swiss Nursing Minimum Data Set. The data model uses the NNN classifications to map a possible form of the nursing process in the electronic patient health record, where the nurse can choose nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions relevant to the patient situation. The nurses' choice is guided both by the different classifications and their linkages, and the use of specific text components pre-defined for each classification and accessible through the respective linkages. This article describes the developed data model and illustrates its clinical application in a specific patient's situation. Preparatory work required for the implementation of NNN classifications in practical nursing such as content filtering and the creation of linkages between the NNN classifications are described. Against the background of documentation of the nursing process based on the DAPEP(1) data model, possible changes and requirements are deduced. The article provides a contribution to the discussion of a change in documentation of the nursing process by implementing nursing classifications in electronic patient records.


Expression of transient receptor potential channels and two-pore potassium channels in subtypes of vagal afferent neurons in rat.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the working area obtained by endoscope and microscope in various approaches to the anterior communicating artery complex using computed tomography-based frameless stereotaxy: a cadaver study. Surgical treatment of aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery complex is challenging, owing to its intricate vascular anatomy. Endoscopy is a recently rediscovered neurosurgical technique that could lend itself well to overcoming some of the vascular visualization challenges associated with this procedure. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the working area afforded by the microscope and the endoscope to the anterior communicating artery complex in different surgical approaches and using image guidance. We performed a total of 9 dissections, including mini-supraorbital, pterional, and orbitozygomatic approaches bilaterally in 5 whole, fresh cadaver heads. We used computed tomography-based image guidance for intraoperative navigation as well as for quantitative measurements. We estimated the working area of the anterior communicating artery complex region, using both a rigid endoscope (4.0 mm in diameter and 18 cm long with 0- and 30-degree lenses) and an operating microscope. Operability was qualitatively assessed by the senior authors. In microscopic exposure, the orbitozygomatic approach provided the greatest working area (204.5 +/- 33.9 mm2), as compared with the mini-supraorbital approach (114.8 +/- 26.9 mm2) and pterional approach (170 +/- 20.4 mm2; P < 0.05). Evaluation of the endoscopic working area showed that the supraorbital approach, using both 0- and 30-degree endoscopes, provided a working area greater than that of a conventional pterional approach (P < 0.05) and comparable to that of an orbitozygomatic approach (P > 0.05). In our model, use of the endoscope, in an assistive manner to microscopic surgery, provided a working area advantage without loss of microneurosurgical techniques of dissection or of depth perception in the surgical field. This advantage was most prominent when smaller craniotomies were used.

Decomposing Black-White Disparities in Heart Disease Mortality in the United States, 1973-2010: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis. Against the backdrop of late 20th century declines in heart disease mortality in the United States, race-specific rates diverged because of slower declines among blacks compared with whites. To characterize the temporal dynamics of emerging black-white racial disparities in heart disease mortality, we decomposed race-sex-specific trends in an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of US mortality data for all diseases of the heart among adults aged ≥35 years from 1973 to 2010. The black-white gap was largest among adults aged 35-59 years (rate ratios ranged from 1.2 to 2.7 for men and from 2.3 to 4.0 for women) and widened with successive birth cohorts, particularly for men. APC model estimates suggested strong independent trends across generations ("cohort effects") but only modest period changes. Among men, cohort-specific black-white racial differences emerged in the 1920-1960 birth cohorts. The apparent strength of the cohort trends raises questions about life-course inequalities in the social and health environments experienced by blacks and whites which could have affected their biomedical and behavioral risk factors for heart disease. The APC results suggest that the genesis of racial disparities is neither static nor restricted to a single time scale such as age or period, and they support the importance of equity in life-course exposures for reducing racial disparities in heart disease. 


Gastric collision tumor of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma--a case report.

Chronic naltrexone treatment and ethanol responsivity in outbred rats. Acute naltrexone treatment in rats produces significant alterations in ethanol palatability (increase in the aversiveness of the solution) and ethanol consumption during tests of restricted access (decrease in consumption). The effects of chronic naltrexone exposure, accomplished by implantation of osmotic mini-pumps, were examined in the present study. Rats were surgically implanted with intraoral fistulae for taste reactivity testing. The animals were given 2 bottles (distilled water and 10% ethanol, v/v) for 3, 2-week phases: Pre-Drug, Drug, and Post-Drug. After the Pre-Drug phase, rats were assigned to groups (counterbalanced based on ethanol intake) and implanted with a mini-pump containing saline, 7.5 mg/kg/d naltrexone, or 15 mg/kg/d naltrexone. The pumps were removed 2 weeks later. During each 2-week phase, taste reactivity tests with 10% ethanol were conducted at 1, 7, and 14 days (a total of 9 reactivity tests). The 7.5 mg/kg/d dose produced only minor effects on 10% ethanol reactivity and consumption during the Drug phase. The 15 mg/kg/d naltrexone dose generally shifted taste reactivity responding to 10% ethanol in a negative direction and produced a transient decrease in ethanol consumption. The 15 mg/kg/d group significantly increased ethanol consumption beyond the level of consumption by the Saline group when the pumps were removed, although the increase was delayed 48 hours. By the end of the Post-Drug period, this naltrexone group returned to control levels of ethanol consumption. Chronic naltrexone treatment at 15 mg/kg/d significantly decreased the palatability of a 10% ethanol solution, an effect seen even after drug withdrawal. Naltrexone had a minor effect on ethanol consumption during treatment but did decrease overall levels of fluid consumption. The significant increase in ethanol consumption postdrug by the high-dose naltrexone group, presumably due to receptor up-regulation during treatment, is important and understanding this effect and developing means of overcoming it within a clinical practice would be useful goals.


Oogenesis and programmed cell death of nurse cells in the endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum.

[Sequelae of peripheral facial palsy]. The purpose of this work is to study the functional sequelae after peripheral facial palsy (PFP) to analyze its impact and relationship with the degree of facial nerve dysfunction, from the neurophysiological point of view. We present a retrospective study which includes a total of 150 cases of peripheral facial palsy. All patients underwent electroneurography and electromyography to see the degree of axonal damage and to evaluate the existence of signs of reinervation in the muscles explored or possible innervation errors. Of the patients studied, 31.9% (46) had sequelae; 67.4% (31) were women, a statistically significant result (P=.031). Of all the sequelae, the most frequent was miochymia which appeared in 24% of cases (36). Patients with left side involvement presented a higher number of sequelae (40.3%, 27 cases) with a statistically significant difference (P=.05). The average rate of axonal injury on first visit by patients who subsequently developed sequelae was 75.26%; worse results on electroneurography were statistically associated with the onset of sequelae (P=.007). Electromyography of patients with sequelae shows that a greater degree of denervation could be considered a risk factor for the occurrence of sequelae (P=.039). In our study we found that sequelae are more frequent after facial palsy when there is significant axonal loss. This work shows other risk factors so far not mentioned in the literature, such as female gender and left-side involvement.


Inherited thrombophilia in infertile women: implication in unexplained infertility.

Forecasting intracranial pressure elevation using pulse waveform morphology. Management of intracranial pressure (ICP) following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an essential aspect of minimizing such secondary brain injuries as intracranial hypertension and cerebral hypoxia. Currently, ICU management of ICP elevations is reactive in nature; we propose a quantitative method to predict potentially harmful elevations in ICP. Continuous intracranial pressure measurements were obtained from 37 patients at the UCLA Medical Center. Intracranial hypertension (IH) episodes were identified along with slow wave segments (used for control sets). Four, five minute segments were then constructed from the IH episode: one from the onset of ICP elevation (pre-IH #0) along with sets 5, 20, and 35 minutes prior to the elevation (pre-IH #5, #20, #35 respectively). Quantification and recognition of the three ICP sub peaks was performed using our group's algorithm termed Morphological Clustering and Analysis of Intracranial Pressure (MOCAIP). Furthermore, a quadratic classifier (QDC) was used to determine the metrics with the greatest predictive power. These metrics were then used to compare the control data set to the data sets described previously. From the ten most frequently selected metrics each of the four pre- intracranial hypertension (pre-IH) segments were compared with the control. Sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and accuracy (AC) were determined for each set with a SEN and SPE for the data set five minutes prior to ICP elevation of 90% and 75% respectively. Combining the MOCAIP analysis, QDC classification, and bootstrap method of statistical sampling, our analysis has the potential to predict an ICP elevation event 20 minutes prior to the event onset.


The importance of pathogens in sepsis: Staphylococcus aureus story.

Management of idiopathic subgingival amalgam hypertrophy--the common amalgam overhang. An amalgam overhang is defined as an extension of amalgam restorative material beyond the confines of a cavity preparation. The pseudo pathology term "idiopathic subgingival amalgam hypertrophy" is used in the title for shock effect and as a scare tactic to catch the attention of our readers. From various studies, it is apparent that such overhangs are alarmingly common. The overhang is largely iatrogenic, caused by poor operator skill exacerbated by unusual dental morphology. Creep may also play a role in the gingival overhang of large amalgam restorations. Maybe we, as clinicians, are becoming complacent and lax in our techniques and matrixing while restoring such a routine restoration. This article revisits the pros and cons of different methods of amalgam overhang management with clinical cases for illustration.

The role of rhodopsin glycosylation in protein folding, trafficking, and light-sensitive retinal degeneration. Several mutations in the N terminus of the G-protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin disrupt NXS/T consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation (located at N2 and N15) and cause sector retinitis pigmentosa in which the inferior retina preferentially degenerates. Here we examined the role of rhodopsin glycosylation in biosynthesis, trafficking, and retinal degeneration (RD) using transgenic Xenopus laevis expressing glycosylation-defective human rhodopsin mutants. Although mutations T4K and T4N caused RD, N2S and T4V did not, demonstrating that glycosylation at N2 was not required for photoreceptor viability. In contrast, similar mutations eliminating glycosylation at N15 (N15S and T17M) caused rod death. Expression of T17M was more toxic than T4K to transgenic photoreceptors, further suggesting that glycosylation at N15 plays a more important physiological role than glycosylation at N2. Together, these results indicate that the structure of the rhodopsin N terminus must be maintained by an appropriate amino acid sequence surrounding N2 and may require a carbohydrate moiety at N15. The mutant rhodopsins were rendered less toxic in their dark inactive states, because RD was abolished or significantly reduced when transgenic tadpoles expressing T4K, T17M, and N2S/N15S were protected from light exposure. Regardless of their effect on rod viability, all of the mutants primarily localized to the outer segment and Golgi and showed little or no endoplasmic reticulum accumulation. Thus, glycosylation was not crucial for rhodopsin biosynthesis or trafficking. Interestingly, expression of similar bovine rhodopsin mutants did not cause rod cell death, possibly attributable to greater stability of bovine rhodopsin.

NARCISSISTIC DEFENSES IN THE DISTORTION OF FREE ASSOCIATION AND THEIR UNDERLYING ANXIETIES. This paper examines particular distortions in the process of free association characteristics of patients with narcissistic personality disorders. The author proposes that the dominant narcissistic transference developments typical of the early and middle phases of the analytic treatment of these patients are reflected in these distortions of free association. This paper gathers the various patterns that these defensive distortions present, along with technical interventions geared to deal with them. 

Identification of prostate cancer biomarkers in urinary exosomes. Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers since tumour-specific molecules can be found in exosomes isolated from biological fluids. We have here investigated the proteome of urinary exosomes by using mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy male controls. In total, 15 control and 16 prostate cancer samples of urinary exosomes were analyzed. Importantly, 246 proteins were differentially expressed in the two groups. The majority of these proteins (221) were up-regulated in exosomes from prostate cancer patients. These proteins were analyzed according to specific criteria to create a focus list that contained 37 proteins. At 100% specificity, 17 of these proteins displayed individual sensitivities above 60%. Even though several of these proteins showed high sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer as individual biomarkers, combining them in a multi-panel test has the potential for full differentiation of prostate cancer from non-disease controls. The highest sensitivity, 94%, was observed for transmembrane protein 256 (TM256; chromosome 17 open reading frame 61). LAMTOR proteins were also distinctly enriched with very high specificity for patient samples. TM256 and LAMTOR1 could be used to augment the sensitivity to 100%. Other prominent proteins were V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit (VATL), adipogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), and several Rab-class members and proteasomal proteins. In conclusion, this study clearly shows the potential of using urinary exosomes in the diagnosis and clinical management of prostate cancer. 


The serine/threonine kinase 33 is present and expressed in palaeognath birds but has become a unitary pseudogene in neognaths about 100 million years ago.

Micropower non-contact EEG electrode with active common-mode noise suppression and input capacitance cancellation. A non-contact EEG electrode with input capacitance neutralization and common-mode noise suppression circuits is presented. The coin sized sensor capacitively couples to the scalp without direct contact to the skin. To minimize the effect of signal attenuation and channel gain mismatch, the input capacitance of each sensor is actively neutralized using positive feedback and bootstrapping. Common-mode suppression is achieved through a single conductive sheet to establish a common mode reference. Each sensor electrode provides a differential gain of 60 dB. Signals are transmitted in a digital serial daisy-chain directly from a local 16-bit ADC, minimizing the number of wires required to establish a high density EEG sensor network. The micropower electrode consumes only 600 microW from a single 3.3 V supply.

Quantitative Micro-Computed Tomography Imaging of Vascular Dysfunction in Progressive Kidney Diseases.

Dengue Virus Infection Causes the Activation of Distinct NF-κB Pathways for Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase and TNF-α Expression in RAW264.7 Cells. Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causes an increase in proinflammatory responses, such as nitric oxide (NO) generation and TNF-α expression; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this inflammatory activation remains undefined, although the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is generally involved. In addition to TNF-α production in DENV-infected murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, inducible NO synthase was transcriptionally and posttranslationally elevated and accompanied by NO generation. NF-κB is known to be activated by DENV infection. Pharmacologically inhibiting NF-κB activation abolishes iNOS/NO biosynthesis and TNF-α production. With inhibition, the potential role of NF-κB in oxidative signaling regulation was prevented during DENV infection. Heat-inactivated DENV failed to cause the identified inflammatory responses. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR3 partly decreased NF-κB activation; however, it effectively abolished inducible iNOS/NO biosynthesis but did not inhibit TNF-α production. In contrast to TLR3, viral protein NS2B3 also independently contributed to NF-κB activation to regulate TNF-α production. These results show the distinct pathways for NF-κB activation caused by DENV infection individually for the regulation of iNOS/NO and TNF-α expression. 


Olfactory response of Haematobia irritans (Diptera: Muscidae) to cattle-derived volatile compounds.

Smoking cessation and relapse during a lung cancer screening program. The potential for negative screening to reduce smoking cessation and long-term abstinence is a concern in lung cancer screening. We examine whether consistently negative results during long-term participation in a lung cancer screening program reduce cessation or increase relapse. Participants (N = 2,078) in the Early Lung Cancer Action Program received annual screenings and periodic smoking behavior surveys over a follow-up period as long as 12 years. Point abstinence and prolonged abstinence were examined among 730 baseline smokers. Relapse was examined among 1,227 former smokers who quit for 1 year or more at enrollment, 121 recent quitters at enrollment, and 155 baseline smokers who quit during follow-up. Abstinence and relapse for participants with consistently negative computerized tomography scan results were compared with those with non-cancer-positive results using stratified Cox models. Baseline smokers with negative computerized tomography scans had a 28% lower likelihood of achieving point abstinence at one or more follow-up assessments compared with those with positive scans (hazard ratio, 0.72; P < 0.0004), but consistently negative scans were not associated with a lower likelihood of prolonged abstinence. A consistently negative scan was not associated with a higher likelihood of relapse back to smoking for long-term former smokers, recent quitters, or those who quit during follow-up. We did not detect a lower long-term smoking abstinence or increased relapse over a 6-year period of follow-up among individuals participating in a lung cancer screening program who have a consistently negative screening compared with those with a positive, but noncancer, screening result.


Chlorpyrifos Induces MLL Translocations Through Caspase 3-Dependent Genomic Instability and Topoisomerase II Inhibition in Human Fetal Liver Hematopoietic Stem Cells.

The dynamic interaction of quality and efficiency in the emergency department: Squaring the circle? This paper examines the relationship between clinical quality and organizational efficiency in emergency departments (EDs). Previous studies have often emphasized the incompatibility of quality and efficiency, or have neglected to account for their inter-relationships. Policy perspectives reflect normative prescriptions for throughput and reduced waiting times which do not always align with clinicians' foci or day-to-day practices. According to Merton's (1957) theory of "value-assimilation", medical students, for instance, are socialized to reconcile seemingly contradictory values. We aimed to explore ethnographically the possibility of the dynamic interactions of quality and efficiency in clinical practice. This study drew on empirical data from ethnographic field work, conducted over one year, including 234 hours of semi-structured observations and 56 semi-structured field interviews in the EDs of two tertiary-referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. We found that seniority and experience of emergency clinicians intersect with the functions of role-modeling, performance management, and formal and informal learning, to facilitate the care of multiple patients as they progress through the ED. These practices fundamentally embed quality in the ED's enactment of efficiency. The relationship between clinical quality and organizational efficiency can be understood through a sociological lens that highlights the roles of interdependent clinicians in a clinical pecking order, working to provide care, and balancing the two. The paper is novel in expanding "value-assimilation" into the clinical domain, and strives to reconcile policy with everyday practice in emergency settings. It moves the debate about quality versus efficiency to one that emphasizes interdependence.

Morning Blood Pressure Surge, Dipping, and Risk of Coronary Events in Elderly Treated Hypertensive Patients. The independent prognostic significance of morning surge (MS) of blood pressure (BP) is not yet clear. We investigated the association between MS of systolic BP and risk of coronary events in elderly treated hypertensive patients. The occurrence of coronary events was evaluated in 1,191 elderly treated hypertensive patients (age range 60-90 years). Subjects were divided according to tertiles of MS of systolic BP of the population as a whole, by dipping status and by group-specific tertiles of MS of systolic BP in dippers and nondippers. During the follow-up (9.1 ± 4.9 years, range 0.4-20 years), 120 coronary events occurred. In the population as a whole, coronary event risk was not significantly associated with tertiles of MS of systolic BP, whereas nondippers were at higher risk than dippers. When nondippers and dippers were analyzed separately, by group-specific tertiles of MS of systolic BP, coronary event risk was associated with MS of systolic BP in dippers but not in nondippers. After adjustment for various covariates, Cox regression analysis showed that dippers in the third tertile (>23 mm Hg) of MS of systolic BP (hazard ratio 1.912, 95% confidence interval 1.048-3.488, P = 0.03) and nondippers (hazard ratio 1.739, 95% confidence interval 1.074-2.815, P = 0.02) were at higher coronary event risk than dippers with MS of systolic BP <23 mm Hg . In elderly treated hypertensive patients, high MS of systolic BP predicts coronary events in dippers but not in nondippers. Nondippers, however, show higher risk of coronary events independently of MS in systolic BP.

(99m)Tc-human serum albumin nanocolloids: particle sizing and radioactivity distribution. Several parameters affect the biodistribution of administered nanocolloids (NC) for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) detection: particle size distribution, number of Tc atoms per particle and specific activity (SA). Relatively few data are available with frequently conflicting results. (99m)Tc-NC-human serum albumin (HSA) Nanocoll®, Nanoalbumon® and Nanotop® were analysed for particles' dimensional and radioactivity distribution, and a mathematical model was elaborated to estimate the number of particles involved. Commercially available kits were reconstituted at maximal SA of 11 MBq/µg HSA. Particles size distribution was evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering. These data were related to the radioactivity distribution analysis passing labelled NC through three polycarbonate filters (15-30-50-nm pore size) under vacuum. Highest radioactivity was carried by 30-50 nm particles. The smallest ones, even though most numerous, carried only the 10% of (99m)Tc atoms. Nanocoll and Nanotop are not significantly different, while Nanoalbumon is characterized by largest particles (>30 nm) that carried the most of radioactivity (80%). Smallest particles could saturate the clearing capacity of macrophages; therefore, if the tracer is used for SLN detection, more node tiers could be visualized, reducing accuracy of SLN mapping. Manufacturers could implement technical leaflets with particle size distribution and could improve the labelling protocol to provide clinicians useful information.

Perception and Homeostatic Control of Iron in the Rhizobia and Related Bacteria. Iron is an essential nutrient, but it can also be toxic. Therefore, iron homeostasis must be strictly regulated. Transcriptional control of iron-dependent gene expression in the rhizobia and other taxa of the Alphaproteobacteria is fundamentally different from the Fur paradigm in Escherichia coli and other model systems. Rather than sense iron directly, the rhizobia employ the iron response regulator (Irr) to monitor and respond to the status of an iron-dependent process, namely, heme biosynthesis. This novel control mechanism allows iron homeostasis to be integrated with other cellular processes, and it permits differential control of iron regulon genes in a manner not readily achieved by Fur. Moreover, studies of Irr have defined a role for heme in conditional protein stability that has been subsequently described in eukaryotes. Finally, Irr-mediated control of iron metabolism may reflect a cellular strategy that accommodates a greater reliance on manganese. 

A copulas approach to neuronal networks models. Simultaneous recordings from groups of neurons request to improve models. To switch from single unit description to multivariate models describing the coding activity of two or more neurons, we propose to use the copula notion. This mathematical object catches the coupling properties and allows a mathematical description of the dependencies between two or more random variables. Its use is here illustrated by means of toy examples and further applications are discussed.

Inferring a transcriptional regulatory network of the cytokinesis-related genes by network component analysis. Network Component Analysis (NCA) is a network structure-driven framework for deducing regulatory signal dynamics. In contrast to principal component analysis, which can be employed to select the high-variance genes, NCA makes use of the connectivity structure from transcriptional regulatory networks to infer dynamics of transcription factor activities. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we aim to deduce regulatory actions of cytokinesis-related genes, using precise spatial proximity (midbody) and/or temporal synchronicity (cytokinesis) to avoid full-scale computation from genome-wide databases. NCA was applied to infer regulatory actions of transcription factor activity from microarray data and partial transcription factor-gene connectivity information for cytokinesis-related genes, which were a subset of genome-wide datasets. No literature has so far discussed the inferred results through NCA are independent of the scale of the gene expression dataset. To avoid full-scale computation from genome-wide databases, four cytokinesis-related gene cases were selected for NCA by running computational analysis over the transcription factor database to confirm the approach being scale-free. The inferred dynamics of transcription factor activity through NCA were independent of the scale of the data matrix selected from the four cytokinesis-related gene sets. Moreover, the inferred regulatory actions were nearly identical to published observations for the selected cytokinesis-related genes in the budding yeast; namely, Mcm1, Ndd1, and Fkh2, which form a transcription factor complex to control expression of the CLB2 cluster (i.e. BUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5). In this study, using S. cerevisiae as a model system, NCA was successfully applied to infer similar regulatory actions of transcription factor activities from two various microarray databases and several partial transcription factor-gene connectivity datasets for selected cytokinesis-related genes independent of data sizes. The regulated action for four selected cytokinesis-related genes (BUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5) belongs to the M-phase or M/G1 phase, consistent with the empirical observations that in S. cerevisiae, the Mcm1-Ndd1-Fkh2 transcription factor complex can regulate expression of the cytokinesis-related genes BUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5. Since Bud4, Iqg1, and Cdc5 are highly conserved between human and yeast, results obtained from NCA for cytokinesis in the budding yeast can lead to a suggestion that human cells should have the transcription regulator(s) as the budding yeast Mcm1-Ndd1-Fkh2 transcription factor complex in controlling occurrence of cytokinesis.

Hepatitis B risks and immunisation coverage amongst Australians travelling to southeast Asia and east Asia. Southeast Asia and East Asia are regarded as highly endemic regions for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and include many popular destinations for Australian travellers. The objectives of this survey were to evaluate the extent of pre-travel health advice, the prevalence of behaviours with HBV infection risks and the prevalence of HBV vaccination amongst Australian travellers to Southeast Asia and East Asia. In 2004, a telephone survey was conducted amongst Australians, who had travelled overseas to Southeast Asia and East Asia in the past three years for three nights or more. Three hundred and nine travellers aged 14 years and over completed the interview, including 138 males (45%) and 171 females (55%). Respondents travelled for leisure (64%), business (20%), and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (16%). The most common destinations were Indonesia (34%), Thailand (32%), and China (27%). About half of the travellers (54%) sought vaccination specific health advice before travel of which about half (56%) had sought this advice more than six weeks before travel. Just over one quarter of travellers reported receiving HBV vaccination (28%) of whom most (70%) were vaccinated at least three weeks before travel. About half of the travellers (49%) had participated in at least one activity with HBV risk during their last overseas trip. Of those travellers aged 18 years and over who either had no HBV vaccination or who were unsure, about half (49%) had participated in at least one activity with HBV risk during their last overseas trip. Australian travellers to Southeast Asia and East Asia commonly undertake activities with a risk of exposure to HBV. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage amongst this group remains low. It is important that travellers to this region seek travel health advice from a qualified source, which will include a risk assessment for hepatitis B vaccination.


Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Plateau.

A collaborative biomedical engineering undergraduate work: an automatic system for blood glucose regulation. This paper is focused on the design of an automatic system to regulate blood glucose concentration. A model is developed to simulate the process. The model was based on approximating an electrochemical biosensor, for measuring the blood glucose concentration, to electrical circuits for readout, data processing and control. It was implemented using an electronics simulation software package: S-Edit and T-Spice from Tanner Tools EDA. The work was developed by a group of ten students from the fourth year of the integrated master of Biomedical Engineering course of the University of Minho in a collaborative way.

Predicting perceptual suppression from local field potential in visual cortex. Generalized flash suppression (GFS, Wilke et al. 2003) in which a salient visual stimulus can be rendered invisible despite continuous retinal input has provided a powerful means to study neural processes directly related to perception. However, the mechanisms underlying such perceptual suppression remain poorly understood. Here we asked how reliably the population responses could determine the perceptual states and what the roles of different areas in visual cortex played during suppression. Three monkeys were trained to perform the GFS task. Multi-channel neural activities in visual cortical areas V1, V2 and V4 were simultaneously recorded. Linear regression analysis on the time-frequency distributions of local field potential (LFP) recordings between two perceptual states (visible vs. invisible) showed that the significant power difference existed between the two perceptual states at the beta frequency band of 10-30 Hz. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers were implemented to decipher perceptual states. Our results showed that LFP recordings provided significantly better prediction than the chance level, and the beta band signal provided better prediction than the broad band in all the three visual cortical areas. Broad band signal provided more accurate prediction in V4 than in V2 and V1, while the beta band signal provided consistently good predictions in V1, V2 and V4. Furthermore, multi-channel recordings were more informative than single electrode recordings in V1, V2 and V4, while in V1 and V4 the benefit of decoding population activity was significant. Channel-wise correlations limited the benefits of population activity. These results indicated that considerable information was retained in the beta band of the local field potential. The benefits of population activity were explored and the different roles of different visual cortical areas during perceptual suppression were investigated.

[Aberrant methylation at promoter region of HOX A gene cluster in leukemia cells]. To explore the characteristics of CpG islands methylation at promoter region of HOX A gene cluster in leukemia cells before and after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Eleven human leukemia cell lines, bone marrow cells from leukemia patients before and after therapy and white blood cells from normal subjects were collected. HL-60 and K562 cells were treated by 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC) or ATRA respectively. Bisulfite modified DNA of these cells were amplified with PCR and quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing for methylation of CpG islands. In normal cells, CpGs at all loci of HOX A cluster were unmethylated. In HOX A4, A6, A7, A9, A10 and A11, many CpG sites were methylated (>20%) or hypermethylated (>50%) in leukemia cell lines. Percentages of methylated CpGs were higher in T-cell leukemia (71.4%) and B-cell leukemia (85.7%) than in others. For individual CpGs methylations there were HOX A4 in all leukemia cells, HOX A6 and HOX A7 in most of the leukemia samples and HOX A10 and HOX A11 in K562 and HL-60 cells (38%-86%). HOX A9 CpGs showed hypomethylation in most of myeloid leukemia cells, whereas HOX A11 CpGs were hypermethylated in B-cell leukemia (>50%). Methylation levels of HOX A4 and A6 in AML and ALL patients after complete remission were decreased obviously, and so did HOX A6 and A9 in CML patients. Methylation levels of HOX A4, A6 and A10 in HL-60 cells and of HOX A6 in K562 cells were reduced by ATRA treatment. In all leukemia cell lines, aberrant methylation of CpGs was observed at promoter regions of 6 HOX A cluster genes, and some of these genes showed leukemia-type-specific hypermethylation. CpGs methylation of some HOX A genes in leukemia cell lines, especially in HL-60 cells, were down-regulated by ATRA.


Epigenetic Repression of CCDC37 and MAP1B Links Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to Lung Cancer.

Universal external carotid artery to proximal middle cerebral artery bypass with interposed radial artery graft prior to approaching ruptured blood blister-like aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Blood blister-like aneurysms are dangerous aneurysms with fragile walls arising from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA). Primary treatment of these aneurysms in the acute stage is challenging, due to the substantial risk of periprocedural bleeding. We describe a series of 4 patients who presented with ruptured blister-like aneurysm of the ICA and were treated with completion of extracranial-intracranial high-flow bypass followed by inspection and trapping of the aneurysm. All patients were treated in the acute stage, within 48 hours of bleeding. External carotid artery to proximal middle cerebral artery bypass with interposed radial artery (RA) graft was established followed by approach to the lesion and trapping of the parent vessels. The aneurysms in 3 patients ruptured during dissection of the lesion from the surrounding structures, but bleeding was easily controlled. RA grafts were patent in all patients and no postoperative symptomatic ischemic or hemorrhagic complications were encountered, resulting in excellent outcomes with modified Rankin scale scores of 0 at follow up after 3 months. Our present strategy for surgical treatment of blister-like aneurysms completely avoided the risk of devastating intraoperative hemorrhage, offering a most cautious strategy associated with minimal risk of intraoperative massive bleeding.

Functional MRI study of brain function under resting and activated states. Numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been developed with various imaging contrasts, which can be tightly linked to brain functions, electrophysiology and diseases. Recent MRI technology developments have resulted in several important functional MRI (fMRI) methods based on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. These fMRI methods have been applied to mapping brain activation in laminar level as well functional connectivity network in a resting brain. We have found a strong correlation between the spontaneous brain activity and BOLD fluctuation indicating a tight neurovascular relation.


MR spectroscopy of the liver: principles and clinical applications.

What is life? Bio-physical perspectives. Life arises and develops in gravitationally bound atomic systems, under certain conditions, in the presence of the inflow of energy. A condition of structural dynamic reactivity to the energy inflow qualifies what are anthropomorphically considered as "alive objects". Alive objects, in this perspective, include such rudimentary animate atomic structures as the retinal molecule C20H28o to the herpes simplex virus C102H152N26o29 to the human being, a twenty-six element atomic structure, which can be quantified further as thermodynamic quasi-closed supramolecular systems, which are part of natural open systems. These systems appear and evolve in periodic conditions near to internal equilibrium. This systems attribute of dynamic life can be understood further by the determination and use of mathematical "state functions", which are functions that quantify the state of a system defined by the ensemble of physical quantities: temperature, pressure, composition, etc., which characterize the system, but neither by its surroundings nor by its history. In this view, the phenomenon of a life is easily understood as a general consequence of the laws of the universe, in particular, the laws of thermodynamics, which in the geocentric perspective translate to a formulation of "hierarchical thermodynamics" and a "principle of substance stability". The formation of living thermodynamic structures, in short, arises on the nanolevel by a constantly varying environment that causes variety of living forms. The definition of a life as the bio-chemical-physical phenomenon can thus be given on the basis of the exact sciences, i. e. chemistry, physics, and thermodynamics, without mention of numerous private attributes of a living substance and without physically baseless models of mathematical modeling, such as Prigoginean thermodynamics.

Beyond "getting drugs into bodies": social science perspectives on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. Social scientists have much to contribute to the analysis of the real and potential contribution of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to HIV prevention around the world. Beyond just a matter of clinical efficacy and getting pills into people's mouths, PrEP raises a number of important social-psychological questions that must be attended to in order to translate biomedical and clinical findings into uptake of PrEP among enough people at risk of HIV infection to produce population-level effectiveness. PrEP is a dynamic phenomenon with "dialectical" attributes that invite both optimism and cynicism as a desirable and effective HIV prevention strategy. PrEP disrupts traditional notions of "safe" and "unsafe" sex; it confers on its users a level of agency and control not generally achieved with condoms; and it affects sexual practices and sexual cultures in meaningful ways. As these dynamics play out in different contexts, and as new modes of PrEP administration emerge, it will be important for social scientists to be engaged in assessing their impact on PrEP implementation and effectiveness. 

Assessment of advanced practice palliative care nursing competencies in nurse practitioner students: implications for the integration of ELNEC curricular modules. Advanced practice nurses (APRNs) have key roles in the care of patients who are nearing death and those living with a disabling chronic disease. This article describes a mixed-method formative assessment of 36 graduate nursing students' knowledge about and attitudes toward palliative care preliminary to curricular integration of the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) graduate core modules. Students' knowledge about palliative care was assessed using the 106-item ELNEC examination. In addition, qualitative data were gathered regarding students' definitions of palliative care, the role of the APRN in palliative care, and their definitions of a "good" and "bad" death. Results revealed students' limited knowledge about palliative care. Qualitative findings indicated that most students exclusively linked palliative care with end-of-life care and believed that the treatment they provide should have the goal of prolonging life over maintaining quality of life. Implications for curriculum design, advanced practice role development, and collaboration with community health partners are discussed.

The social network map as an instrument for identifying social relations in deaf research and practice. Social support has shown itself to be an important factor in many areas in regard to mental health development and conservation. Numerous empirical findings also document its significance in various areas of research into deafness. Questionnaires are only one means of gathering information when we are trying to gain access to the social networks of deaf and hard of hearing people, their families, and relatives. The social network map is an approach that provides qualitative access to insights into social relationships and has proven, in conjunction with a qualitative interview, to be a useful tool in allowing a more detailed description and in-depth understanding of the processes of both social support and stress. The special strength of the social network map lies in the combination of visualizing social relationships and reflecting them in an interpersonal dialogue. This article describes how to go about creating a network map and illustrates this with an example of a mother of a multi-handicapped, deaf child. It concludes with a discussion of the opportunities that the use of a social network map offers as well as its potential limitations.

Determining Surgical Complications in the Overweight (DISCOVER): a multicentre observational cohort study to evaluate the role of obesity as a risk factor for postoperative complications in general surgery. Obesity is increasingly prevalent among patients undergoing surgery. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the impact of obesity on postoperative complications. This multicentre study aims to determine whether obesity is associated with increased postoperative complications following general surgery. This prospective, multicentre cohort study will be performed utilising a collaborative methodology. Consecutive adults undergoing open or laparoscopic, elective or emergency, gastrointestinal, bariatric or hepatobiliary surgery will be included. Day case patients will be excluded. The primary end point will be the overall 30-day major complication rate (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V complications). Data will be collected to risk-adjust outcomes for potential confounding factors, such as preoperative cardiac risk. This study will be disseminated through structured medical student networks using established collaborative methodology. The study will be powered to detect a two-percentage point increase in the major postoperative complication rate in obese versus non-obese patients. Following appropriate assessment, an exemption from full ethics committee review has been received, and the study will be registered as a clinical audit or service evaluation at each participating hospital. Dissemination will take place through national and local research collaborative networks.

Severe subdural hemorrhage due to minimal prenatal trauma.

A process for the purification of organochlorine contaminated activated carbon: Sequential solvent purging and reductive dechlorination. A system for the purification of organochlorine contaminated activated carbon is described. The system involves a continuous flow of aqueous ethanol to purge organochlorines from activated carbon. The organochlorine laden solvent is simultaneously treated with zero valent zinc as the bulk electron source, water as the proton source and the electron shuttle cyanocobalamin as a catalyst for reductive dechlorination. The system was characterised by performing batch reactions and extractions before being applied in a continuous flow system. In particular the ratio of water to ethanol in the system needed to be optimised. Water is needed for the reductive dechlorination reaction whilst it is not conducive to the extraction process. An 80% ethanolic solution was found to give optimal reductive dechlorination rates without compromising extraction of organochlorines from activated carbon. Of three electron shuttles evaluated cyanocobalamin was discovered to be the most relevant to the system with respect to reductive dechlorination rates and its ability to avoid absorption to activated carbon.

A beta-barrel outer membrane protein facilitates cellular uptake of polychlorophenols in Cupriavidus necator. The tcpRXABCYD operon of Cupriavidus necator JMP134 is involved in the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP). All of the gene products except TcpY have assigned functions in TCP metabolism. Sequence comparison identified TcpY as a member of COG4313, a group of hypothetical proteins. TcpY has a signal peptide, indicating it is a membrane or secreted protein. Secondary structure and topology analysis indicated TcpY as a beta-barrel outer membrane protein, similar to the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein FadL that transports hydrophobic long-chain fatty acids. Constitutive expression of tcpY in two C. necator strains rendered the cells more sensitive to TCP and other polychlorophenols. Further, C. necator JMP134 expressing cloned tcpY transported more TCP into the cell than a control with the cloning vector. Thus, TcpY is an outer membrane protein that facilitates the passing of polychlorophenols across the outer membrane of C. necator. Similarly, other COG4313 proteins are possibly outer membrane transporters of hydrophobic aromatic compounds.


Rapid EEG desynchronization and EMG activation induced by intravenous cocaine in freely moving rats: a peripheral, nondopamine neural triggering.

Small variations in crucial steps of TUNEL assay coupled to flow cytometry greatly affect measures of sperm DNA fragmentation. Techniques for assessing sperm DNA damage are numerous and various. There are 2 main types of assay: direct and indirect. The former directly detects the amount of sperm DNA damage, whereas the latter reveals the effects of an exogenous insult on sperm chromatin. In addition, even considering the same type of technique, different strategies to reveal or quantify sperm DNA damage, or both, are used. Finally, these techniques, except for sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), lack standardized protocols to which all users can adhere to minimize interlaboratory variations. In this study, we investigated the effects of some of the many ways the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluorescein-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay is performed when measuring sperm DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry. In addition, by using an established procedure, we determined the precision of the technique by calculating intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs). We found that concentration of the fixative, the time of storage of fixed samples, the fluorochrome used to label DNA breaks, and the method used to analyze flow cytometric data all greatly affect the measures of sperm DNA fragmentation. In particular, we found that treatment with paraformaldehyde produced additional damage in most samples, suggesting that TUNEL also can be considered an indirect assay when performed in semen samples treated with such a fixative reagent. We also showed that 2 different methods used to analyze data yielded results that, albeit correlating, were different and associated differently to semen quality. On the contrary, the TUNEL assay, as measured here, showed low intraassay CVs, resulting in a quite precise technique when performed in established conditions.

Evaluating the effective connectivity of resting state networks using conditional Granger causality. The human brain has been documented to be spatially organized in a finite set of specific coherent patterns, namely resting state networks (RSNs). The interactions among RSNs, being potentially dynamic and directional, may not be adequately captured by simple correlation or anticorrelation. In order to evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, we applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to the RSNs retrieved by independent component analysis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our analysis provided evidence for specific causal influences among the detected RSNs: default-mode, dorsal attention, core, central-executive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. In particular, we identified that self-referential and default-mode networks (DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the human brain functional architecture. Specifically, the former RSN exerted the strongest causal influence over the other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of self-referential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive processing. In quite contrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affected by the other RSNs, which may underlie an integration of information from primary function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies. Overall, our results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied information for a deeper understanding of the brain network dynamics.

Effect of the coating morphology on the drug release from engineered drug-polymer nanocomposites.

Plasmodium falciparum glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase is a potential drug target. The malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is exposed to substantial redox challenges during its complex life cycle. In intraerythrocytic parasites, haemoglobin breakdown is a major source of reactive oxygen species. Deficiencies in human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the initial enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), lead to a disturbed redox equilibrium in infected erythrocytes and partial protection against severe malaria. In P. falciparum, the first two reactions of the PPP are catalysed by the bifunctional enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PfGluPho). This enzyme differs structurally from its human counterparts and represents a potential target for drugs. In the present study we used epitope tagging of endogenous PfGluPho to verify that the enzyme localises to the parasite cytosol. Furthermore, attempted double crossover disruption of the PfGluPho gene indicates that the enzyme is essential for the growth of blood stage parasites. As a further step towards targeting PfGluPho pharmacologically, ellagic acid was characterised as a potent PfGluPho inhibitor with an IC50 of 76 nM. Interestingly, pro-oxidative drugs or treatment of the parasites with H2O2 only slightly altered PfGluPho expression or activity under the conditions tested. Furthermore, metabolic profiling suggested that pro-oxidative drugs do not significantly perturb the abundance of PPP intermediates. These data indicate that PfGluPho is essential in asexual parasites, but that the oxidative arm of the PPP is not strongly regulated in response to oxidative challenge.

Control of catalysis in flavin-dependent monooxygenases. Flavoprotein monooxygenases reduce flavins, speed their reaction with oxygen, and stabilize a C4a-oxygen adduct long enough to use this reactive species to transfer an oxygen atom to a substrate. The flavin-oxygen adduct can be the C4a-peroxide anion, in which case it reacts as a nucleophile. The protonated adduct - the C4a-hydroperoxide - reacts as an electrophile. The elimination of H(2)O(2) competes with substrate oxygenation. This side-reaction is suppressed, preventing the waste of NAD(P)H and the production of toxic H(2)O(2). Several strategies have been uncovered that prevent the deleterious side-reaction while still allowing substrate hydroxylation.

Skeletal Muscle Loss is Associated with TNF Mediated Insufficient Skeletal Myogenic Activation After Burn. Muscle loss accompanies severe burn; in this hyper-catabolic state, muscle undergoes atrophy through protein degradation and disuse. Muscle volume is related to the relative rates of cellular degradation and myogenesis. We hypothesize that muscle atrophy after injury is in part because of insufficient myogenesis associated with the hyper-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of skeletal myogenesis and muscle cell homeostasis in response to severe burn. Twenty-eight male C57BL6 mice received 25% TBSA scald. Gluteus muscle from these animals was analyzed at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after injury. Six additional animals without burn served as controls. We showed muscle wet weight and protein content decreased at days 3 and 7 after burn, with elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Increased cell death was observed through TUNEL staining, and cleaved caspase-3 levels reached a peak in muscle lysate at day 3 (P < 0.05). The cell proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) significantly increased after burn, associated with increased gene and protein expression of myogenesis markers Pax7 and myogenin. Desmin mRNA expression and the ratio of desmin to PCNA protein expression, however, significantly decreased at day 7 (P < 0.05). In vitro, the ratio of desmin to PCNA protein expression significantly decreased in C2C12 murine myoblasts after TNF-α stimulation for 24 h. We showed that severe burn induces both increased cell death and proliferation. Myogenesis, however, does not counterbalance increased cell death after burn. Data suggest insufficient myogenesis might be associated with pro-inflammatory mediator TNF activity. 

HDAC6 and RhoA are novel players in Abeta-driven disruption of neuronal polarity. Maintenance of neuronal polarity and regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics are vital during development and to uphold synaptic activity in neuronal networks. Here we show that soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) disrupts actin and microtubule (MT) dynamics via activation of RhoA and inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in cultured hippocampal neurons. The contact of Aβ with the extracellular membrane promotes RhoA activation, leading to growth cone collapse and neurite retraction, which might be responsible for hampered neuronal pathfinding and migration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of HDAC6 by Aβ increases the level of heterodimeric acetylated tubulin and acetylated tau, both of which have been found altered in AD. We also find that the loss of HDAC6 activity perturbs the integrity of axon initial segment (AIS), resulting in mislocalization of ankyrin G and increased MT instability in the AIS concomitant with loss of polarized localization of tau and impairment of action potential firing. 

Embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mTOR. Human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) harbor high proliferative capacity and high differentiation potential and do not raise the ethical concerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The formation of three-dimensional aggregates known as embryoid bodies (EBs) is the principal step in the differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Using c-Kit-positive hAFSC lines, we show here that these stem cells harbor the potential to form EBs. As part of the two kinase complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the key component of an important signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, tumor development and differentiation. Blocking intracellular mTOR activity through the inhibitor rapamycin or through specific small interfering RNA approaches revealed hAFSC EB formation to depend on mTORC1 and mTORC2. These findings demonstrate hAFSCs to be a new and powerful biological system to recapitulate the three-dimensional and tissue level contexts of in vivo development and identify the mTOR pathway to be essential for this process.

Non-soy legume consumption lowers cholesterol levels: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Studies evaluating the effect of legume consumption on cholesterol have focused on soybeans, however non-soy legumes, such as a variety of beans, peas, and some seeds, are commonly consumed in Western countries. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of non-soy legume consumption on blood lipids. Studies were retrieved by searching MEDLINE (from January 1966 through July 2009), EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2009), and the Cochrane Collaboration's Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials using the following terms as medical subject headings and keywords: fabaceae not soybeans not isoflavones and diet or dietary fiber and cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia or triglycerides or cardiovascular diseases. Bibliographies of all retrieved articles were also searched. From 140 relevant reports, 10 randomized clinical trials were selected which compared a non-soy legume diet to control, had a minimum duration of 3 weeks, and reported blood lipid changes during intervention and control. Data on sample size, participant characteristics, study design, intervention methods, duration, and treatment results were independently abstracted by 2 investigators using a standardized protocol. Data from 10 trials representing 268 participants were examined using a random-effects model. Pooled mean net change in total cholesterol for those treated with a legume diet compared to control was -11.8 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], -16.1 to -7.5); mean net change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was -8.0mg/dL (95% CI, -11.4 to -4.6). These results indicate that a diet rich in legumes other than soy decreases total and LDL cholesterol.


The next step in cicada audition: measuring pico-mechanics in the cicada's ear.

Casein/natamycin edible films efficiency for controlling mould growth and on microbiological, chemical and sensory properties during the ripening of Kashar cheese. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of the dipping application of coating materials such as casein (Cas), casein/natamycin (Cas/N) and natamycin (N) solutions on chemical (e.g. pH, dry matter, fat, acidity, salt, protein, water-soluble nitrogen, ripening index, 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen and pH 4.6 soluble nitrogen), microbial (e.g. total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria in MRS, lactic acid bacteria in M17, coliforms and mould) and organoleptic properties of Kashar cheese samples during ripening (3, 30, 60 and 90 days). The difference in microbiological and chemical changes between samples were found to be significant (P < 0.05) during the ripening period. The highest and lowest mould counts were determined for the control (2.87 log cfu g(-1) ) and the Cas/N (<1 log cfu g(-1) ) samples, respectively, at 90 days of ripening. Compared to other cheeses, control and Cas/N-coated cheeses had higher levels of water-soluble nitrogen and ripening index at in the end of storage. The Cas/N-coated cheese samples were preferred more by the panellists, while N-coated cheese samples received the lowest scores. This study suggests that coating could be used to improve the quality of Kashar cheese during ripening.

Patterns of binding of aluminum-containing adjuvants to Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal group C conjugate vaccines and components. The basis of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC) glycoconjugates binding to aluminum-containing adjuvants was studied. By measuring the amount of polysaccharide and protein in the non-adsorbed supernatant, the adjuvant, aluminum phosphate, AlPO4, was found to be less efficient than aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3 at binding to the conjugates, at concentrations relevant to licensed vaccine formulations and when equimolar. At neutral pH, binding of TT conjugates to AlPO4 was facilitated through the carrier protein, with only weak binding of AlPO4 to CRM197 being observed. There was slightly higher binding of either adjuvant to tetanus toxoid conjugates, than to CRM197 conjugates. This was verified in AlPO4 formulations containing DTwP-Hib, where the adsorption of TT-conjugated Hib was higher than CRM197-conjugated Hib. At neutral pH, the anionic Hib and MenC polysaccharides did not appreciably bind to AlPO4, but did bind to Al(OH)3, due to electrostatic interactions. Phosphate ions reduced the binding of the conjugates to the adjuvants. These patterns of adjuvant adsorption can form the basis for future formulation studies with individual and combination vaccines containing saccharide-protein conjugates.

Riboflavin lowers blood pressure in cardiovascular disease patients homozygous for the 677C-->T polymorphism in MTHFR. The purpose was to examine the effect of intervention with riboflavin (a cofactor for MTHFR) on blood pressure in patients homozygous (TT genotype) for the common 677C-->T polymorphism in MTHFR. We investigated 197 premature cardiovascular disease patients, prescreened for the MTHFR 677C-->T polymorphism, from an original cohort of 404 to select those with the TT genotype (n = 60) and a similar number with heterozygous (CT; n = 85) or wild-type (CC; n = 75) genotypes. Of these, 181 completed an intervention in which participants were randomized within each genotype group to receive 1.6 mg per day riboflavin or placebo for 16 weeks. Among patients taking one or more antihypertensive drugs at recruitment (82%), we observed that target blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) had been achieved in only 37% patients with the TT genotype compared with 59% with the CT and 64% with the CC genotype (P < 0.001). Riboflavin intervention reduced mean blood pressure specifically in those with the TT genotype (from 144/87 to 131/80 mmHg; P < 0.05 systolic; P < 0.05 diastolic), with no response observed in the other genotype groups. Riboflavin is effective in reducing blood pressure specifically in patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. The findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.

Targeting heat shock protein 90 with CUDC-305 overcomes erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. CUDC-305 is a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor of the novel imidazopyridine class. Here, we report its activities in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with gene deregulations conferring primary or secondary resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. We show that CUDC-305 binds strongly to HSP90 extracted from erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells (IC50 70 nmol/L). This result correlates well with the potent antiproliferative activity in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines (IC50 120-700 nmol/L) reported previously. Furthermore, it exhibits durable inhibition of multiple oncoproteins and induction of apoptosis in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells. CUDC-305 potently inhibits tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models of H1975 and A549, which harbor EGFR T790M mutation or K-ras mutations conferring acquired and primary erlotinib resistance, respectively. In addition, CUDC-305 significantly prolongs animal survival in orthotopic lung tumor models of H1975 and A549, which may be partially attributed to its preferential exposure in lung tissue. Furthermore, CUDC-305 is able to extend animal survival in a brain metastatic model of H1975, further confirming its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Correlating with its effects in various tumor models, CUDC-305 induces degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules of the PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways simultaneously, with concurrent induction of apoptosis in vivo. In a combination study, CUDC-305 enhanced the antitumor activity of a standard-of-care agent in the H1975 tumor model. These results suggest that CUDC-305 holds promise for the treatment of NSCLC with primary or acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy.

A novel motif in fungal class 1 histone deacetylases is essential for growth and development of Aspergillus.

Hyperleptinemia in horses: responses to administration of a small dose of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in mares and geldings. Mares and geldings in good body condition selected for hyperleptinemia vs. normal leptin concentrations were studied to determine whether the hyperleptinemic condition affected various characteristics of the hematologic and hormonal systems after a challenge with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin. Four mares and 4 geldings that were determined to be hyperleptinemic (mean plasma leptin concentrations of 10.0 to 15.5 ng/mL) and 4 mares and 4 geldings with mean plasma leptin concentrations between 2.4 and 5.5 ng/mL were administered Escherichia coli O55:B5 endotoxin (35 ng/kg of BW in 500 mL of saline over a 30-min infusion), or saline only, in pairs in a single-switchback design, with horses and treatments randomly assigned for the first infusion. Physiological variables and blood components were monitored for 24 h after the onset of infusions. Treatments were switched and the second infusions were administered 8 d later. Relative to vehicle infusion, endotoxin infusion increased (P < 0.01) the rectal temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, plasma total protein concentration, and blood packed cell volume; there was an interaction of leptin status, endotoxin treatment, and time for heart rate (P = 0.039), respiration rate (P = 0.018), and plasma total protein concentration (P = 0.054). Blood concentrations of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils all decreased (P < 0.001) after endotoxin infusion; there was an interaction (P = 0.0057) between sex and leptin status for blood platelet concentration. Plasma leptin concentrations increased (P = 0.013) after endotoxin infusion in both hyperleptinemic horses and those with reduced leptin concentrations. There were interactions (P < 0.037) of sex with endotoxin treatment and time for plasma concentrations of cortisol and prolactin, whereas plasma GH concentrations were affected (increased; P < 0.001) only by time after infusion. Given that the effects of hyperleptinemia were generally minor, it was concluded that the hyperleptinemic condition, and its associated type-2 diabetic symptoms, has a minimal impact on the components of the hematologic and hormonal systems studied.

[Musculoskeletal disorders of the knee of workers]. 50% of workers have been or will be affected by knee pains and complaints will be more frequent as the population ages and careers will be longer. The increase in prevalence depends on mechanical or morphological causes as well as psychosocial state and work organization. Lesions of the meniscus, well known for a long time, seem to be stable in the statistics of Social Security as well as the hygroma; the use of knee-pads (overalls with built-in cushions) is strongly recommended while working in kneeling or squatting position, even DIY activities. Are particularly dangerous: the squatting or kneeling position extended for longer than one hour a day, often recovering from these two positions (more than 30 times a day), lifting or carrying heavy loads, often climbing (around 30 times per day) stairs or ladders. These gestures and postures are unavoidable in some jobs; in those cases, advices given by the specialist of occupational medicine and the ergonomist may improve or alter the habits of the worker or of his entire team. The prevention of overweight and the habit of carrying heavy loads must be amplified, for all the usual positions of work. Consulting to decide about the return to work after surgery for knee replacement will be more frequent. Then, as each time work can interfere with health, it is logical that the family doctor have (via the patient) links with the specialist of occupational medicine, which holds valuable information for quality of life of employees.

Scientific investments continue to fuel improvements in oral health (May 2000-present). The release of Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General in May 2000 raised national, state, and local awareness, for the first time ever, of the impact of oral disease in America. The report emphasized oral health's link to general health and well-being, and called for a national effort among individuals, communities, and health care providers to improve oral health among all Americans. One of the objectives from the Surgeon General's Report On Oral Health was to "advance the science base and translate into practice." Our objective here is to address how the science base has progressed in 3 main areas that have significant potential to impact oral health: sequencing of the human genome, tissue engineering, and saliva diagnostics. A secondary objective is to comment on progress in our understanding of dental caries and its impact on young children.

Vitamin A intake and status in populations facing economic stress. Dietary quality and diversity reflect adequacy of vitamin A. Both can deteriorate in response to economic crises. Although the nutritional consequences of the 2008 world food price crisis remain unclear, past studies of diet, status, and socioeconomic standing under usual (deprived) and unusually disruptive times suggest dietary quality and vitamin A status decline in mothers and young children. This is presumably the result of shifting diets to include less preformed vitamin A-rich animal source foods and, to a lesser extent, vegetables and fruits. Cross-sectional assessments of diet, deficiency, and socioeconomic status in a number of countries and surveillance data collected during the Indonesian economic crisis of 1997-8 indicate that the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, night blindness, and other related disorders (e.g., anemia) may have increased during the 2008 crisis, and that it might not have necessarily recovered once food prices waned later in 2008. Lost employment may be a factor in slow nutritional recovery, despite some easing of food prices. Vitamin A deficiency should still be preventable amid economic instabilities through breast feeding promotion, vitamin A supplementation, fortification of foods targeted to the poor, and homestead food production that can bolster income and diversify the diet.

Effect of the novel radiant zone drying method on anthocyanins and phenolics of three blueberry liquids. The Radiant Zone dryer (RZD) is a novel drying method designed to dry liquid food products into powders. The impact of RZD on the phytochemical content of three blueberry liquid products (extract, juice, and puree) was examined. Comparative analysis between liquid and dried products revealed no statistically significant changes in the total anthocyanins (extract liquid/powder, 11.7/11.2 mg/g of dry weight; juice liquid/powder, 2.7/2.5 mg/g of dry weight; puree liquid/powder, 1.7/1.6 mg/g of dry weight, quantified as cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents) and total phenolics (extract liquid/powder, 97.1/113.1 mg/g of dry weight; juice liquid/powder, 16.6/17.4 mg/g of dry weight; puree liquid/powder, 8.3/6.2 mg/g of dry weight, quantified as gallic acid equivalents). Total antioxidant activity also showed no significant variation between wet and dried products. The high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis of the products exhibited a similar profile of 13 glycosylated anthocyanins. This study demonstrates that the novel RZD produces high-quality products because the retention of anthocyanins and phenolics during dehydration using RZD is the same as that for freeze drying. The RZD method of operation and its advantages over other dryers is also discussed.

[Air quality surveillance in France]. As air quality has a direct impact on human health, its monitoring is imperative. In France, this task was entrusted by the government (Air Law of 1996) to organisations with territorial responsibility: the Registered Associations for the Surveillance of Air Quality. The type and level of pollution evolve: from industrial and sulphur pollution in the seventies, to urban and photochemical pollution today and to nanoparticles, pesticides and pollutants in buildings tomorrow. The tools, the skills and the roles of the different people involved in air quality control follow these sometimes rapid transitions in connection with an increasingly precise understanding of the relationship between health and the environment and of the considerable research on the subject. This article describes the mechanisms of air quality monitoring in France.

Glycation isotopic labeling with 13C-reducing sugars for quantitative analysis of glycated proteins in human plasma. Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins is a post-translational modification produced by a reaction between reducing sugars and amino groups located in lysine and arginine residues or in the N-terminal position. This modification plays a relevant role in medicine and food industry. In the clinical field, this undesired role is directly linked to blood glucose concentration and therefore to pathological conditions derived from hyperglycemia (>11 mm glucose) such as diabetes mellitus or renal failure. An approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycated proteins is here proposed to achieve the three information levels for their complete characterization. These are: 1) identification of glycated proteins, 2) elucidation of sugar attachment sites, and 3) quantitative analysis to compare glycemic states. Qualitative analysis was carried out by tandem mass spectrometry after endoproteinase Glu-C digestion and boronate affinity chromatography for isolation of glycated peptides. For this purpose, two MS operational modes were used: higher energy collisional dissociation-MS2 and CID-MS3 by neutral loss scan monitoring of two selective neutral losses (162.05 and 84.04 Da for the glucose cleavage and an intermediate rearrangement of the glucose moiety). On the other hand, quantitative analysis was based on labeling of proteins with [(13)C(6)]glucose incubation to evaluate the native glycated proteins labeled with [(12)C(6)]glucose. As glycation is chemoselective, it is exclusively occurring in potential targets for in vivo modifications. This approach, named glycation isotopic labeling, enabled differentiation of glycated peptides labeled with both isotopic forms resulting from enzymatic digestion by mass spectrometry (6-Da mass shift/glycation site). The strategy was then applied to a reference plasma sample, revealing the detection of 50 glycated proteins and 161 sugar attachment positions with identification of preferential glycation sites for each protein. A predictive approach was also tested to detect potential glycation sites under high glucose concentration.

Effects of genital ulcer disease and herpes simplex virus type 2 on the efficacy of male circumcision for HIV prevention: Analyses from the Rakai trials. Randomized trials show that male circumcision (MC) reduces the incidence of HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections, and symptomatic genital ulcer disease (GUD). We assessed the role of GUD and HSV-2 in the protection against HIV afforded by MC. HIV-uninfected men were randomized to immediate (n = 2,756) or delayed MC (n = 2,775) in two randomized trials in Rakai, Uganda. GUD symptoms, HSV-2 status, and HIV acquisition were determined at enrollment and at 6, 12, and 24 mo of follow up. Ulcer etiology was assessed by PCR. We estimated the prevalence and prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) of GUD in circumcised versus uncircumcised men and assessed the effects of HSV-2 serostatus as a risk-modifying factor for GUD. We estimated the proportion of the effect of MC on HIV acquisition that was mediated by symptomatic GUD, and by HSV-2 infection. Circumcision significantly reduced symptomatic GUD in HSV-2-seronegative men (PRR = 0.51, 95% [confidence interval] CI 0.43-0.74), HSV-2-seropositive men (PRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), and in HSV-2 seroconverters (PRR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.79). The proportion of acute ulcers due to HSV-2 detected by PCR was 48.0% in circumcised men and 39.3% in uncircumcised men (chi(2)p = 0.62). Circumcision reduced the risk of HIV acquisition in HSV-2 seronegative men (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.81), and potentially in HSV-2 seroconverters (IRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.19-1.57; not significant), but not in men with prevalent HSV-2 at enrollment (IRR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.49-1.60). The proportion of reduced HIV acquisition in circumcised men mediated by reductions in symptomatic GUD was 11.2% (95% CI 5.0-38.0), and the proportion mediated by reduced HSV-2 incidence was 8.6% (95% CI -1.2 to 77.1). Circumcision reduced GUD irrespective of HSV-2 status, but this reduction played only a modest role in the protective effect of circumcision on HIV acquisition.

Wing defects in Drosophila xenicid mutant clones are caused by C-terminal deletion of additional sex combs (Asx). The coordinated action of genes that control patterning, cell fate determination, cell size, and cell adhesion is required for proper wing formation in Drosophila. Defects in any of these basic processes can lead to wing aberrations, including blisters. The xenicid mutation was originally identified in a screen designed to uncover regulators of adhesion between wing surfaces [1]. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the betaPS integrin or the patterning protein Engrailed are not affected in developing wing imaginal discs in xenicid mutants. Instead, expression of the homeotic protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is strongly increased in xenicid mutant cells. Our results suggest that upregulation of Ubx transforms cells from a wing blade fate to a haltere fate, and that the presence of haltere cells within the wing blade is the primary defect leading to the adult wing phenotypes observed.

How would early detection be possible? An enquiry into cancer related knowledge, understanding and health seeking behaviour of urban Black women in Tshwane, South Africa. The purpose of the study was to explore what women living in Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane, South Africa know and understand about cancer as well as their health seeking behaviour should they suspect that they might have cancer. An exploratory, contextual, quantitative door-to-door survey was conducted. The sampling method was convenient (n=565). Data were gathered by means of self-reports using structured interviews. The study provided evidence that, despite all the interventions to teach the community about cancer, women had a low level of knowledge and understanding of cancer. Cancer was seen as something that primarily happens to the breast. There was no link between the perception of cancer and the seriousness of the warning signs. It is doubtful if the woman, except for the possibility of a lump in the breast, would recognize any sign of cancer and consider it to be serious. Women still needed to ask permission to seek health-care and in some instances, the health care provider was chosen for them. Not all women were prepared to spend money of their own health and some would even feel guilty should they do so. Women's knowledge and understanding of cancer and health seeking behaviour related to cancer do not facilitate early detecting and therefore the possibility to be cured. The fundamental strategy of primary and secondary prevention of cancer, teaching the community, remains a challenge for both nursing practice and nursing research.

[Simple screening method for judging the complex formation between drug and aluminum (III)]. We examined a simple screening method for judging the complex formation between a drug and aluminum(III) on a spot plate. As few drug had color reaction by basing on the binary complex formation of drug-aluminum(III), the ternary complex formation of drug-aluminum(III)-dye was studied this time using 50 kinds of drugs. The dyes used were Chromazurol S and Erythrosin. As a result, in the drug that the complex formation with aluminum(III) was assumed, a remarkable coloration difference was recognized in comparison with the blank prepared under the same conditions. The proposed simple screening method should be very useful for judging instantly the complex formation between a drug and aluminum(III).

[Impact of immunotherapy in metastatic kidney cancer in Germany after introduction of new target therapy--results of a telephone survey of the German Society of Immuno- and Targeted Therapy (DGFIT)]. Until recently, the standard therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in Germany consisted of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-alfa (IFN) as single agents or in combination, with or without chemotherapy. Since 2005, new drugs (target drugs) in the therapy for mRCC are available. The aim of this study was to analyse the current therapy standard in Germany. By representative telephone interviews (GFK-Nürnberg by order of DGFIT) the following colleagues were contacted A: urologists in private practice (n = 40), B: oncologists in private practice (n = 40), C: hospital urologists (n = 35) and D: hospital oncologists (n = 35). Screening criteria were 1) responsibility for therapy in mRCC; 2) therapy of at least 10 patients with mRCC per year. Patients/year: A: n = 19, B: n = 17, C: n = 43, D: n = 21. 98% of patients with mRCC were treated: A: the most frequent therapy was sunitinib (43%, 42%, 33% as first-, second-, third-line), B: the most frequent therapy was sunitinib (45% as first-line, 37% as second-line), the most frequent third-line therapy was sorafenib (35%); C: the most frequent therapy were sorafenib and sunitinib (first-line 26% vs. 27%, second-line 46% vs. 42%), in third-line therapy additionally temsirolimus 24%; D: primary sorafenib and sunitinib (first-line 33% vs. 40%, second-line 46% vs. 42%), in third-line therapy additionally temsirolimus 23%. Immunotherapy (IL-2, IFN with or without chemotherapy) in mRCC plays in Germany for the second- and third-line therapy in A-D no major role (less than 10%). Otherwise, for first-line therapy immunotherapy has some relevance: A: 25%, B: 37%, C: 33%, D: 16%. The most important criteria for therapy decision making in A-D were: efficacy, toxicity, drug approval status. Most patients with mRCC in Germany were seen by hospital urologists. Sunitinib (in first-line) and sorafenib (in second-line) are currently the most frequent prescribed drugs in mRCC. Temsirolimus is used mostly for third-line therapy (followed by sunitinib/sorafenib). Treatment of mRCC in Germany is increasingly being performed by oncologists.

Second Primary Cancer after Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Cancer. This study was conducted to investigate the incidence and survival outcomes of second primary cancers after the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry between 1993 and 2010 were reviewed and analyzed. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of second primary cancers among women with cervical cancer were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for cervical cancer patients with or without a second primary cancer. Among 72,805 women with cervical cancer, 2,678 (3.68%) developed a second primary cancer within a mean follow-up period of 7.34 years. The overall SIR for a second cancer was 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.12). The most frequent sites of second primary cancers were the vagina, bone and joints, vulva, anus, bladder, lung and bronchus, corpus uteri, and esophagus. However, the incidence rates of four second primary cancers (breast, rectum, liver, and brain) were decreased. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 78.3% and 72.7% in all women with cervical cancer, and for women with a second primary cancer, these rates were 83.2% and 65.5% from the onset of cervical cancer and 54.9% and 46.7% from the onset of the second primary cancer, respectively. The incidence rates of second primary cancers were increased in women with cervical cancer compared to the general population, with the exception of four decreasing cancers. The 10-year overall survival rates were decreased in cervical cancer patients with a second primary cancer.


Psoriasis in a 3-month-old infant with Kawasaki disease.

[Imaging techniques in the evaluation of primary large vessel vasculitides: Part 2: duplex ultrasound, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and ophthalmological methods]. This article focuses on the clinical application and technical aspects of imaging methods which are used alternatively or additionally to angiography or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or giant cell arteritis. Providing a high spatial resolution, duplex ultrasound is particularly suitable for the evaluation of peripheral arteries. With the exception of cranial arteries, positron emission tomography as a whole body examination is the best imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory activity. Computed tomography is used for angiographic examinations and enables evaluation of wall thickening in large arteries. It is the method of choice in the case of emergencies due to aortic aneurysm or dissection. In addition to angiographic and ultrasound techniques, ophthalmological methods comprise biomicroscopy, including funduscopy and optical coherence tomography.

MitoInteractome: mitochondrial protein interactome database, and its application in 'aging network' analysis.

Cytotoxic and anti-infective sesquiterpenes present in Plagiochila disticha (Plagiochilaceae) and Ambrosia peruviana (Asteraceae). A pharmacological screening of the ethanol extract and fractions of two Peruvian medicinal plants, Plagiochila disticha and Ambrosia peruviana, led to the isolation and characterization of three ENT-2,3-secoaromadendrane-type sesquiterpenoids, named plagiochiline A ( 1), I ( 2), and R ( 3), as well as of two pseudoguaianolids, damsin ( 4) and confertin ( 5), which exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against a panel of human tumor cell lines. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 were also investigated for their in vitro antileishmanial, trypanocidal, and antituberculosis activity against Leishmania amazonensis axenic amastigotes and Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes, as well as against MDR and sensitive strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively.


[Why should vascular patients have a dietary assessment?].

Paenibacillus sputi sp. nov., isolated from the sputum of a patient with pulmonary disease. Strain KIT 00200-70066-1(T) was isolated from the sputum of a patient with pulmonary disease. Cells of the strain were Gram-variable, facultatively anaerobic, motile, spore-forming rods and formed colourless to white colonies on tryptic soy agar at 30&emsp14;°C and pH&emsp14;7. The pathogenicity of the strain is not known. The strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone, anteiso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₆:₀ and C₁₆:₀ as the major fatty acids and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and several unknown lipids in the polar lipid profile. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolate belongs to the genus Paenibacillus, sharing the highest levels of sequence similarity with Paenibacillus nanensis MX2-3(T), Paenibacillus agaridevorans DSM 1355(T) and Paenibacillus alkaliterrae KSL-134(T) (95.4, 95.2 and 94.8 %, respectively), and that it occupied a distinct position within this genus. Combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data supported the conclusion that strain KIT 00200-70066-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus sputi sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is KIT 00200-70066-1(T) (=KCTC 13252(T) =DSM 22699(T)).

Stress induced cognitive deficit is differentially modulated in BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice: correlation with Th1/Th2 balance after stress exposure. This work shows a comparative study on the effects of chronic mild stress upon learning and memory and immunity, in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Stressed BALB/c, but not C57Bl/6 mice, showed a poor learning performance, morphological alterations in the hippocampus with an increase in oxidative stress. A correlation between poor memory performance and the increase of the Th2/Th1 balance was found. Our results suggest that vulnerability to cognitive deficit associated with stress exposition could be related to a differential regulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, suggesting a better learning performance for individuals that produce Th1 type cytokine after stress exposition.

Arm swing magnitude and asymmetry during gait in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by altered gait patterns. Although decreased arm swing during gait is the most frequently reported motor dysfunction in individuals with PD, quantitative descriptions of gait in early PD have largely ignored upper extremity movements. This study was designed to perform a quantitative analysis of arm swing magnitude and asymmetry that might be useful in the assessment of early PD. Twelve individuals with early PD (in "off" state) and eight controls underwent gait analysis using an optically-based motion capture system. Participants were instructed to walk at normal and fast velocities, and then on heels (to minimize push-off). Arm swing was measured as the excursion of the wrist with respect to the pelvis. Arm swing magnitude for each arm, and inter-arm asymmetry, were compared between groups. Both groups had comparable gait velocities (p = 0.61), and there was no significant difference between the groups in the magnitude of arm swing in all walking conditions for the arm that swung more (p = 0.907) or less (p = 0.080). Strikingly, the PD group showed significantly greater arm swing asymmetry (asymmetry angle: 13.9 + or - 7.9%) compared to the control group (asymmetry angle: 5.1 + or - 4.0%; p = 0.003). Unlike arm swing magnitude, arm swing asymmetry unequivocally differs between people with early PD and controls. Such quantitative evaluation of arm swing, especially its asymmetry, may have utility for early and differential diagnosis, and for tracking disease progression in patients with later PD.

Survival and cardioprotective benefits of long-term blueberry enriched diet in dilated cardiomyopathy following myocardial infarction in rats. Despite remarkable progress in treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) over the last two decades, mortality, personal suffering and cost remain staggering, and effective interventions are still a challenge. Previously we reported that a blueberry-enriched diet (BD) attenuated necroapoptosis and inflammation in periinfarct area in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). To test the hypothesis that BD will attenuate the course of CHF, including mortality and cardiac remodeling during the first year after induction of MI in rats. Two weeks after coronary artery ligation, rats were divided into two groups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and then 12-mo dietary regimens were initiated as follows: ad libitum regular diet (control, CD, n = 27) and isocaloric food with 2% blueberry supplement (BD, n = 27) also available ad libitum. These dietary groups were compared to each other and to sham group (SH). Mortality over the 12 mo was reduced by 22% in BD compared with CD (p<0.01). In the course of developing CHF, BD had no effect on the body weight, heart rate or blood pressure. Bi-monthly Echo revealed significant attenuation of the LV chamber remodeling, LV posterior wall thinning, and MI expansion in BD compared with CD. In fact, BD arrested the MI expansion. This is the first experimental evidence that a blueberry-enriched diet has positive effects on the course of CHF and thus warrants consideration for clinical evaluation.


B cells in the aging immune system: time to consider B-1 cells.

Prognostic factors in AML in relation to (ab)normal karyotype. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a complicated, heterogeneous disease and the prognostic factors may be useful in deciding upon appropriate therapy. Cytogenetic testing at diagnosis yields critical prognostic information, but more refinement in prognosis is required. Within cytogenetic subgroups, further important subgroup definitions are possible based on the mutation status and expression analysis of genes such as C-KIT, FLT3, NPM1 and CEBPA, although defining therapies based on such mutations remains controversial.

Efficacy of Lytic Bacteriophage Preparation in Reducing Salmonella In Vitro, on Turkey Breast Cutlets, and on Ground Turkey. The efficacy of the recently approved Salmonella lytic bacteriophage preparation (SalmoFresh) in reducing Salmonella enterica serotype Heidelberg on turkey breast cutlets and ground turkey was evaluated. In a broth model assay, the phage preparation completely inhibited the growth of four S. enterica serotypes (Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Heidelberg, Salmonella Kentucky, and Salmonella Typhimurium) at 37°C at a multiplicity of infection of 10,000 PFU/CFU. At 4°C in 0.1% peptone water (PW), phage treatment at a multiplicity of infection of 10,000 resulted in ca. 4.0-log CFU/ml reductions of Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Heidelberg, and Salmonella Typhimurium. When raw turkey breast cutlets inoculated with Salmonella Heidelberg (∼10(3) CFU/g) were treated with phage preparation (10(7) PFU/g) and stored at 4°C, the phage treatment caused reductions of 0.8, 0.6, and 1.3 log CFU/g (P ≤ 0.05) of Salmonella Heidelberg on day 0, 1, and 7, respectively, compared with the counts in the control. However, no significant reduction of Salmonella Heidelberg (P > 0.05) was observed in ground turkey when turkey meat pieces inoculated with Salmonella Heidelberg were surface treated with phage preparation (10(7) PFU/g) before grinding. These findings indicate that the bacteriophage preparation was effective in reducing Salmonella on turkey breast cutlets as a surface treatment but did not cause any reduction of Salmonella Heidelberg in ground turkey. 

Risk factors for major antenatal depression among low-income African American women. Data on risk factors for major antenatal depression among African American women are scant. In this study, we seek to determine the prevalence and risk factors for major antenatal depression among low-income African American women receiving prenatal services through the Central Hillsborough Healthy Start (CHHS). Women were screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff of > or =13 as positive for risk of major antenatal depression. In total, 546 African American women were included in the analysis. We used logistic regression to identify risk factors for major antenatal depression. The prevalence of depressive symptomatology consistent with major antenatal depression was 25%. Maternal age was identified as the main risk factor for major antenatal depression. The association between maternal age and risk for major antenatal depression was biphasic, with a linear trend component lasting until age 30, at which point the slope changed markedly tracing a more pronounced likelihood for major depression with advancing age. Women aged > or =30 were about 5 times as likely to suffer from symptoms of major antenatal depression as teen mothers (OR = 4.62, 95% CI 2.23-9.95). The risk for major antenatal depression increases about 5-fold among low-income African American women from age 30 as compared to teen mothers. The results are consistent with the weathering effect resulting from years of cumulative stress burden due to socioeconomic marginalization and discrimination. Older African American mothers may benefit from routine antenatal depression screening for early diagnosis and intervention.

Telemedical diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity: accuracy of expert versus non-expert graders. To assess accuracy of telemedical retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) diagnosis by trained non-expert graders compared with expert graders. Eye examinations (n=248) from 67 consecutive infants were captured using wide-angle retinal photography (RetCam-II, Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, California, USA). Non-expert graders attended two 1-h training sessions on image-based ROP diagnosis. Using a web-based telemedicine system, 14 non-expert and three expert graders provided a diagnosis for each eye: no ROP, mild ROP, type 2 pre-threshold ROP or treatment-requiring ROP. All diagnoses were compared with a reference standard of dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy by an experienced paediatric ophthalmologist. For detection of type 2 or worse ROP, the mean (range) sensitivities and specificities were 0.95 (0.94-0.97) and 0.93 (0.91-0.96) for experts, 0.87 (0.71-0.97) and 0.73 (0.39-0.95) for resident non-experts, and 0.73 (0.41-0.88) and 0.91 (0.84-0.96) for student non-experts, respectively. For detection of treatment-requiring ROP, the mean (range) sensitivities and specificities were 1.00 (1.00-1.00) and 0.93 (0.88-0.96) for experts, 0.88 (0.50-1.00) and 0.84 (0.71-0.98) for resident non-experts, and 0.82 (0.42-1.00) and 0.92 (0.83-0.97) for student non-experts, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificity of trained non-experts were lower than that of experts, although several non-experts had high accuracy. Development of methods for training non-expert graders may help support telemedical ROP evaluation.

A poly(ethylene) glycolylated peptide for ocular delivery compacts DNA into nanoparticles for gene delivery to post-mitotic tissues in vivo. We have previously shown that a novel synthetic peptide for ocular delivery (POD) can efficiently compact DNA and deliver it to cells in vitro. This observation prompted us to develop use of POD as a nonviral vector in vivo. POD peptide was modified using poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG-POD) and used to compact DNA into nanoparticles that were then analysed using electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and fluorescent labeling. Transfection efficiency and localization were determined 48 h post-injection into the subretinal space of the mouse eye using luciferase and LacZ, respectively. Efficiency of ocular transfection was compared to two other PEGylated peptides: PEG-TAT and PEG-CK30. PEG-POD can compact DNA and form discrete nanoparticles of approximately 136 nm that can penetrate and transduce the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vivo. PEG-POD significantly increased expression of plasmid DNA by 215-fold, PEG-TAT by 56.52-fold, and PEG-CK30 by 24.73-fold relative to DNA injected alone. In all cases beta-galactosidase was observed primarily in the RPE layer after subretinal injection. Electrophysiological analyses of PEG-POD transduced retina indicates an absence of PEG-POD-mediated toxicity. PEG-POD can protect plasmid DNA from DNaseI digestion, resulting in significant transfection of the lung after intravenous injection in mice. PEG-POD was found to significantly increase gene delivery relative to both DNA alone and other pegylated peptides. These findings highlight the use of pegylated peptides, and specifically PEG-POD, as novel gene delivery vectors.

Correlative responses for carcass and meat quality traits to selection for ovulation rate or prenatal survival in French Large White pigs. Correlated effects of selection for components of litter size on carcass and meat quality traits were estimated using data from 3 lines of pigs derived from the same Large White base population. Two lines were selected for 6 generations on high ovulation rate at puberty (OR) or high prenatal survival corrected for ovulation rate in the first 2 parities (PS). The third line was an unselected control (CON). The 3 lines were kept for a 7th generation, but without any selection. Carcass and meat quality traits were recorded on the 5th to 7th generation of the experiment. Carcass traits included dressing percentage, carcass length (LGTH), average backfat thickness (ABT), estimated lean meat content, and 8 carcass joint weight traits. Meat quality traits included pH recorded 24 h after slaughter (pH24) of LM, gluteus superficialis (GS), biceps femoris (BF), and adductor femoris (AD) muscles, as well as reflectance and water-holding capacity (WHC) of GS and BF muscles. Heritabilities of carcass and meat quality traits and their genetic correlations with OR and PS were estimated using REML methodology applied to a multiple trait animal model. Correlated responses to selection were then estimated by computing differences between OR or PS and CON lines at generations 5 to 7 using least squares and mixed model methodology. Heritability (h(2)) estimates were 0.08 +/- 0.04, 0.58 +/- 0.10, 0.70 +/- 0.10, and 0.74 +/- 0.10 for dressing percentage, LGTH, ABT, and lean meat content, respectively, ranged from 0.28 to 0.72 for carcass joint traits, from 0.28 to 0.45 for pH24 and reflectance measurements, and from 0.03 to 0.11 for WHC measurements. Both OR and PS had weak genetic correlations with carcass (r(G) = -0.09 to 0.17) and most meat quality traits. Selection for OR did not affect any carcass composition or meat quality trait. Correlated responses to selection for PS were also limited, with the exception of a decrease in pH24 of GS and BF muscles (-0.12 to -0.14 after 6 generations; P < 0.05), in WHC of GS muscle (-18.9 s after 6 generations; P < 0.05) and a tendency toward an increase in loin weight (0.44 kg after 6 generations; P < 0.10) .

Formation of nanosized organic molecular crystals on engineered surfaces. The pharmaceutical industry has great interest in organic molecular nanosized crystals because their enhanced solubility and dissolution rate can potentially enhance drug bioavailability. In this work, patterned engineered surfaces were used to crystallize glycine with a lateral dimension below 200 nm in a confined volume while controlling supersaturation. Bifunctional patterned surfaces with hydrophilic islands, as small as 500 nm, surrounded by hydrophobic regions were prepared using lithography and self assembled monolayers. Individual glycine crystals under 200 nm were formed from the confined solutions wetting each hydrophilic island, while supersaturation was controlled by slow antisolvent diffusion. Individual crystals were characterized with AFM and Raman spectroscopy and determined to be the metastable beta form. The solubility enhancement as a function of crystal size was measured, and the solubility of crystals with a radius of 100 nm or less was estimated.

O6-methylguanine repair by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) repairs O6-methylguanine (O6mG) in DNA that is known to cause mutation and cancer. On the basis of calculations performed using density functional theory involving the active site of AGT, a mechanism for catalytic demethylation of O6mG to guanine has been proposed. In this mechanism, roles of six amino acids, i.e., Cys145, His146, Glu172, Tyr114, Lys165, and Ser159 in catalytic demethylation of O6mG are involved. This mechanism has three steps as follows. At the first step, Cys145 in the Cys145-water-His146-Glu172 tetrad is converted to cysteine thiolate anion while at the second step, abstraction of the Tyr114 proton by the N3 site of O6mG occurs in a barrierless manner. In the third step, abstraction of Lys165 proton by deprotonated Tyr114 and transfer of the methyl group of O6mG to the thiolate group of Cys145 anion occur simultaneously. As AGT is a major target in cancer therapy, identification of the roles of the different amino acids in demethylation of O6mG is expected to be useful in designing efficient AGT inhibitors.

Elevated levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in human fracture healing. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) plays a unique role in bone remodeling. However, to our knowledge, no data on the role of M-CSF in fracture healing in humans have been published so far. This study addressed this issue. One hundred and thirteen patients with long-bone fractures were included in the study and divided into two groups, according to their course of fracture healing. The first group contained 103 patients with normal fracture healing. Ten patients with impaired fracture healing formed the second group of the study. Volunteers donated blood samples as control. Serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months, following a standardized time schedule. In addition, M-CSF levels were measured in fracture hematoma and serum of 11 patients with bone fractures. M-CSF concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fracture hematoma contained significantly higher M-CSF concentrations compared to M-CSF concentrations in patient's serum. M-CSF levels in fracture hematoma and in patient's serum were both significantly higher than M-CSF concentrations measured in serum of healthy controls. Highly elevated M-CSF serum concentrations were found in patients with physiological fracture healing over the entire observation period. Significant differences in the M-CSF serum concentration between patients with normal fracture healing and patients with impaired fracture healing were not observed. This study indicates, for the first time, to our knowledge, a possible local and systemic involvement of M-CSF in humans during fracture healing.


Effects of temperature on the stability of microcystins in muscle of fish and its consequences for food safety.

What is a "good outcome" in psychotherapy? A qualitative exploration of former patients' point of view. The aim of this study was to explore how former psychotherapy patients characterize "good outcome" after having completed treatment that they described as successful, in the sense that therapy had changed their lives in ways that made a difference. Semistructured qualitative depth interviews were conducted with 10 former psychotherapy patients. A hermeneutical-phenomenological approach was used to analyse interview transcripts. The former patients' descriptions of good outcome clustered around four themes: establishing new ways of relating to others; less symptomatic distress, or changes in behavioural patterns contributing to suffering; better self-understanding and insight; and accepting and valuing oneself. Interrelationships between the four components of good outcome, along with limitations and implications of the study, are discussed.

Comparison of spectral/Fourier domain optical coherence tomography instruments for assessment of normal macular thickness. The purpose of this study was to report normal macular thickness measurements and assess reproducibility of retinal thickness measurements acquired by a time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Stratus, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) and three commercially available spectral/Fourier domain OCT instruments (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.; RTVue-100, Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA; 3D OCT-1000, Topcon, Inc., Paramus, NJ). Forty randomly selected eyes of 40 normal, healthy volunteers were imaged. Subjects were scanned twice during 1 visit and a subset of 25 was scanned again within 8 weeks. Retinal thickness measurements were automatically generated by OCT software and recorded after manual correction. Regression and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare agreement between instruments. Reproducibility was analyzed by using intraclass correlation coefficients, and incidence of artifacts was determined. Macular thickness measurements were found to have high reproducibility across all instruments with intraclass correlation coefficients values ranging 84.8% to 94.9% for Stratus OCT, 92.6% to 97.3% for Cirrus Cube, 76.4% to 93.7% for RTVue MM5, 61.1% to 96.8% for MM6, 93.1% to 97.9% for 3D OCT-1000 radial, and 31.5% to 97.5% for 3D macular scans. Incidence of artifacts was higher in spectral/Fourier domain instruments, ranging from 28.75% to 53.16%, compared with 17.46% in Stratus OCT. No significant age or sex trends were found in the measurements. Commercial spectral/Fourier domain OCT instruments provide higher speed and axial resolution than the Stratus OCT, although they vary greatly in scanning protocols and are currently limited in their analysis functions. Further development of segmentation algorithms and quantitative features are needed to assist clinicians in objective use of these newer instruments to manage diseases.

The impact of health needs assessment and prioritisation on District Health Board planning in New Zealand. District Health Boards (DHBs) in New Zealand are mandated to assess and prioritise the health needs of their resident populations. This paper evaluates the impact of those health needs assessments (HNAs) and prioritisation practices on health service planning and purchasing in the first 3 years of the DHBs (2001-2003). DHB HNAs, 5-yearly strategic plans, and annual plans were evaluated using document analysis to determine the impact of needs assessments on prioritisation and planning by boards. Key informant interviews with DHB senior managers were used to identify differences between boards. HNAs had relatively little influence on the direction of planning and purchasing. HNAs conducted in DHBs that focussed on planning at the service level and in relation to population subgroups using a 'mixed-scanning' approach and 'service planning groups' had a greater impact on planning and purchasing than more comprehensive approaches. DHBs found prioritisation difficult due to the level of control exercised by central government over their actions. HNAs in New Zealand need to be less ambitious, more focussed and more closely institutionally linked to prioritisation, service planning and purchasing processes if they are to have an impact on the allocation of resources.

Bacterial microbiota profiling in gastritis without Helicobacter pylori infection or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Recent 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) molecular profiling of the stomach mucosa revealed a surprising complexity of microbiota. Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use are two main contributors to gastritis and peptic ulcer. However, little is known about the association between other members of the stomach microbiota and gastric diseases. In this study, cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA was used to profile the stomach microbiota from normal and gastritis patients. One hundred and thirty three phylotypes from eight bacterial phyla were identified. The stomach microbiota was found to be closely adhered to the mucosa. Eleven Streptococcus phylotypes were successfully cultivated from the biopsies. One to two genera represented a majority of clones within any of the identified phyla. We further developed two real-time quantitative PCR assays to quantify the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus. Significantly higher abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus within the Firmicutes phylum was observed in patients with antral gastritis, compared with normal controls. This study suggests that the genus taxon level can largely represent much higher taxa such as the phylum. The clinical relevance and the mechanism underlying the altered microbiota composition in gastritis require further functional studies.


Effect of lifestyle intervention on dietary habits, physical activity, and gestational weight gain in obese pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.

Prognostic importance of a restrictive transmitral filling pattern in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Restrictive diastolic filling pattern is associated with increased mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure. Most studies have excluded patients with atrial fibrillation. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of a restrictive filling pattern in patients with atrial fibrillation. Doppler echocardiography including pulsed wave Doppler assessment of transmitral flow was performed in 880 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure on hospital admission. Filling was considered restrictive when the mitral deceleration time <or=140 milliseconds. On admission, 337 (39%) of the patients had atrial fibrillation. Among patients in atrial fibrillation, 170 (50%) had a restrictive filling; and in patients in sinus rhythm, 256 (47%) had restrictive filling (P = .34). During follow-up of median 6.7 years (range 5.3-7.8), 564 patients died (64%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients with a restrictive filling pattern irrespective of atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm (P < .001). In a multivariable model only including patients in atrial fibrillation, a restrictive filling pattern remained a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.24-2.58, P =.002). In a heterogeneous population hospitalized for symptomatic heart failure, a restrictive transmitral filling pattern during hospitalization is an ominous prognostic sign also in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation.

delta-EF1 is a negative regulator of Ihh in the developing growth plate. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) regulates proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth plate. Although the biology of Ihh is currently well documented, its transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. delta-EF1 is a two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain transcriptional repressor. Targeted inactivation of mouse delta-EF1 leads to skeletal abnormalities including disorganized growth plates, shortening of long bones, and joint fusions, which are reminiscent of defects associated with deregulation of Ihh signaling. Here, we show that the absence of delta-EF1 results in delayed hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and increased cell proliferation in the growth plate. Further, we demonstrate that delta-EF1 binds to the putative regulatory elements in intron 1 of Ihh in vitro and in vivo, resulting in down-regulation of Ihh expression. Finally, we show that delta-EF1 haploinsufficiency leads to a postnatal increase in trabecular bone mass associated with enhanced Ihh expression. In summary, we have identified delta-EF1 as an in vivo negative regulator of Ihh expression in the growth plate.

Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based on an unlikely clinical probability by the Wells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: a meta-analysis. The Wells clinical decision rule (CDR) and D-dimer tests can be used to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of an "unlikely" CDR (<or=4 points) combined with a normal D-dimer test and the safety of withholding anti-coagulants based on these criteria. Prospective studies that withheld anti-coagulant treatment from patients with clinically suspected PE and an "unlikely" CDR in combination with a normal D-dimer concentration without performing further tests were searched for in Medline, Cochrane and Embase. Primary endpoints were the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE-related mortality during 3-months follow-up. Four studies including 1660 consecutive patients were identified. The pooled incidence of VTE after initial exclusion of acute PE based on an "unlikely" CDR and normal D-dimer was 0.34% (95%CI 0.036-0.96%), resulting in a NPV of 99.7% (95%CI: 99.0-99.9%, random effects-model). The risk for PE related mortality was very low: 1/1660 patients had fatal PE (0.06%, 95%CI 0.0017-0.46%). Acute PE can be safely excluded in patients with clinically suspected acute PE who have an "unlikely" probability and a negative D-dimer test and anticoagulant treatment can be withheld. There is no need for additional radiological tests in these patients to rule out PE.


Spinal cord recordings in rats during skilled reaching task.

Influence of urban neighbourhood environment on physical activity and obesity-related diseases. The impact of characteristics of neighbourhood environment on physical activity and obesity-related diseases is still the subject of debate. This study aimed to explore the impact of urban neighbourhood environment on physical activity and obesity-related diseases. Cross-sectional study. Individuals who participated in the 2009 national health-screening programme, submitted all necessary information, and had lived in Community 1 (Haengdang) or Community 2 (Ilsan) for at least 2 years (n = 16,178) were selected for inclusion in this study. Anthropometric measures were taken and physical activity was assessed using a short questionnaire. No significant difference in the trigger factors for walking, including the amount of neighbourhood park space, number of shopping malls, and distance between the community and shopping malls, was found between the two communities. However, Community 2 had a better street environment than Community 1. Participants who lived in Community 2 were more physically active [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.48] and walked more regularly (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17) than participants who lived in Community 1, and were less likely to have abdominal obesity (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91), hypertension (adjusted OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97) and diabetes (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99). However, the risk of dyslipidaemia, especially in terms of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was higher in Community 2. These results suggest that a walkable environment has a positive influence on hypertension and diabetes, and physical activity is the possible mechanism for this association. A walkable environment may function as an important tool for health promotion in urban areas.

Lectins as pattern recognition molecules: the effects of epitope density in innate immunity. The innate immune response of multicellular organisms is initiated by the binding of soluble and membrane-bound host molecules including lectins to the surface of pathogenic organisms. Until recently, it was believed that the epitopes recognized by host molecules were uniquely associated with the pathogenic organisms. Hence, the term pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) was used to describe their binding specificities. However, with an expanding number of lectin classes including C-type lectins, siglecs, and galectins recognized as PRRs, it is apparent that many of the glycan epitopes recognized on foreign pathogens are present in the host and involved in cellular functions. Hence, the molecular basis for pattern recognition by lectins of carbohydrate epitopes on pathogens is in question. A number of studies indicate that the density and number of glycan epitopes in multivalent carbohydrates and glycoprotein receptors determine the affinity of lectins and their effector functions. This paper reviews lectins that are involved in innate immunity, mechanisms of enhanced affinity and cross-linking of lectins with density-dependent glycan epitopes, density-dependent recognition of glycan receptors by lectins in host systems and lectin-glycan interactions in foreign pathogens. Evidence indicates that lectin pattern recognition in innate immunity is part of a general mechanism of density-dependent glycan recognition. This leads to a new definition of lectin receptor in biological systems, which considers the density and number of glycan epitopes on the surface of cells and not just the affinity of single epitopes.

Twigs into branches: how a filopodium becomes a dendrite. A dendrite grows by sprouting filopodia, some of which mature into stable dendrite branches that bear synapses and sprout filopodia of their own. Recent work has shown that a filopodium begins deciding to become a stable branch within 1min of contacting a presynaptic partner, but what triggers this decision remains unknown. We consider the evidence for three possible triggers: activity of neurotransmitter receptors, signaling through adhesion proteins, and heightened membrane tension as the filopodium attempts to retract but is held in place by adhesive contacts with the target. Of these, membrane tension-induced signaling is especially appealing, as it would serve as a general reporter of attachment, independent of which specific adhesion molecules are used.

Risk factors for delayed presentation and referral of symptomatic cancer: evidence for common cancers. It has been suggested that the known poorer survival from cancer in the United Kingdom, compared with other European countries, can be attributed to more advanced cancer stage at presentation. There is, therefore, a need to understand the diagnostic process, and to ascertain the risk factors for increased time to presentation. We report the results from two worldwide systematic reviews of the literature on patient-mediated and practitioner-mediated delays, identifying the factors that may influence these. Across cancer sites, non-recognition of symptom seriousness is the main patient-mediated factor resulting in increased time to presentation. There is strong evidence of an association between older age and patient delay for breast cancer, between lower socio-economic status and delay for upper gastrointestinal and urological cancers and between lower education level and delay for breast and colorectal cancers. Fear of cancer is a contributor to delayed presentation, while sanctioning of help seeking by others can be a powerful mediator of reduced time to presentation. For practitioner delay, 'misdiagnosis' occurring either through treating patients symptomatically or relating symptoms to a health problem other than cancer, was an important theme across cancer sites. For some cancers, this could also be linked to inadequate patient examination, use of inappropriate tests or failing to follow-up negative or inconclusive test results. Having sought help for potential cancer symptoms, it is therefore important that practitioners recognise these symptoms, and examine, investigate and refer appropriately.

Twenty-year graft survival and graft function analysis by a matched pair study between pediatric en bloc kidney and deceased adult donors grafts. Pediatric en bloc kidney grafts, especially those from donors aged younger than 12 months, are still regarded controversially with respect to long-term graft survival and function as well as the postoperative development of serious hypertension and proteinuria. This retrospective single-center study analyzed 78 pediatric en bloc kidney grafts transplanted between October 1989 and December 2008. Mean donor age was 15 months in the pediatric en bloc kidney donor group and 37.8 years in the matched pair group. The mean follow-up period was 9.3 years (range, 1-19 years). Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier test for patient and graft survival. Continuous variables were compared using independent sample t test. Graft survival for the pediatric donors after 1, 5, and 10 years were 83.1%, 76.0%, 73.9% and for the matched pair control group 89.6%, 78.7%, and 57.8%, respectively. Serum creatinine levels after 1, 5, and 10 years were 1.0, 0.8, 1.1 mg/dL and for the matched pair control group 1.5, 1.7, and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. No significant long-term differences were detected between the study cohort groups with respect to the postoperative development of hypertension and proteinuria. Overall, pediatric en bloc kidney grafts are well suited to extend the scarce kidney donor pool in experienced centers because of a superior long-term outcome for graft survival and function in comparison with deceased adult kidney grafts. Special attention has to be paid to the substantial higher initial graft loss rate during the first postoperative year.


Drug interactions and adverse events associated with antimycotic drugs used for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic SCT.

Modulation of Glucagon Receptor Pharmacology by Receptor Activity-modifying Protein-2 (RAMP2). The glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors play important, opposing roles in regulating blood glucose levels. Consequently, these receptors have been identified as targets for novel diabetes treatments. However, drugs acting at the GLP-1 receptor, although having clinical efficacy, have been associated with severe adverse side-effects, and targeting of the glucagon receptor has yet to be successful. Here we use a combination of yeast reporter assays and mammalian systems to provide a more complete understanding of glucagon receptor signaling, considering the effect of multiple ligands, association with the receptor-interacting protein receptor activity-modifying protein-2 (RAMP2), and the role of individual G protein α-subunits. We demonstrate that RAMP2 alters both ligand selectivity and G protein preference of the glucagon receptor. Importantly, we also uncover novel cross-reactivity of therapeutically used GLP-1 receptor ligands at the glucagon receptor that is abolished by RAMP2 interaction. This study reveals the glucagon receptor as a previously unidentified target for GLP-1 receptor agonists and highlights a role for RAMP2 in regulating its pharmacology. Such previously unrecognized functions of RAMPs highlight the need to consider all receptor-interacting proteins in future drug development. 

Structurally Diverse Polyamines: Solid-Phase Synthesis and Interaction with DNA. A versatile solid-phase approach based on peptide chemistry was used to construct four classes of structurally diverse polyamines with modified backbones: linear, partially constrained, branched, and cyclic. Their effects on DNA duplex stability and structure were examined. The polyamines showed distinct activities, thus highlighting the importance of polyamine backbone structure. Interestingly, the rank order of polyamine ability for DNA compaction was different to that for their effects on circular dichroism and melting temperature, thus indicating that these polyamines have distinct effects on secondary and higher-order structures of DNA.

Chemistry misconceptions associated with understanding calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Successful learning of many aspects in physiology depends on a meaningful understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts. Two conceptual diagnostic questions measured student understanding of the chemical equilibrium underlying calcium and phosphate homeostasis. One question assessed the ability to predict the change in phosphate concentration when calcium ions were added to a saturated calcium phosphate solution. Fifty-two percent of the students correctly predicted that the phosphate concentration would decrease in accord with the common ion effect. Forty-two percent of the students predicted that the phosphate concentration would not change. Written explanations showed that most students failed to evoke the idea of competing chemical equilibria. A second question assessed the predicted change in calcium concentration after solid calcium phosphate was added to a saturated solution. Only 11% of the students correctly predicted no change in calcium concentration; 86% of the students predicted an increase, and many based their prediction on a mistaken application of Le Chatelier's principle to heterogeneous equilibria. These results indicate that many students possess misconceptions about chemical equilibrium that may hamper understanding of the processes of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Instructors can help students gain greater understanding of these physiochemical phenomena by adopting strategies that enable students achieve more accurate conceptions of chemical equilibria.

Mapping of NRAGE domains reveals clues to cell viability in BMP signaling. Bone morphogenetic signaling (BMP) is a key pathway during neurogenesis and depends on many downstream intermediators to carry out its signaling. One such signaling pathway utilizes neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE protein (NRAGE), a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, to upregulate p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) in response to cellular stress and activate caspases which are critical in leading cells to death. NRAGE consists of two conserved MAGE homology domains separated by a unique hexapeptide repeat domain. Although we have previously implicated NRAGE in inducing apoptosis in neural progenitors and P19 cells, a model system for neural progenitors, its domains have yet to be explored in determining which one may be responsible for setting up the signaling for apoptosis. Here, we overexpressed a series of deletion mutations in P19 cells to show that only those with at least half of the repeat domain, activated p38(MAPK) and underwent apoptosis offering intriguing incite into NRAGE's contribution in BMP apoptotic signaling.

Toxic responses to deltamethrin (DM) low doses on gonads, sex hormones and lipoperoxidation in male rats following subcutaneous treatments. Deltamethrin (DM) is a alpha- cyano pyrethroid insecticide used extensively in pest control. Although initially thought to be least toxic, a number of recent reports showed its toxicity in mammalian and non-mammalian laboratory and wildlife animal species. The present study, carried out in male rats, is a contribution to explore some mechanisms underlying DM toxicity. The aim of the present research was to investigate the effect of different subcutaneous treatments with DM (2 ppm for 30 days, 20 ppm for 45 days and 200 ppm for 60 days) on testes histopathology, sex hormones and oxidative stress from male rats. Our study mentioned an hypospermatogenesis within the testes accompanied by some apoptotic figures in particular cell fragments into the seminiferous tubules (ST)' lumen. The results obtained show that follicule-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone can be differently influenced in rats. In fact, findings of the present investigation mention a significant decrease (p < or = 0.05) of FSH, LH and testosterone at the highest DM dose. Whereas a significant reduction of FSH was noticed after 45 days of treatment. The assessment of oxidative stress by malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements in plasma revealed a significant increase of this parameter after 30 days, 45 days or 60 days. In conclusion the study shows that subcutaneous DM treatment produces an arrest of spermatogenesis, a significant disharmony in sex hormones and MDA levels in rats that is related to dose, length of treatment and to the lipid peroxidation which may be one of the molecular mechanisms involved in DM-induced gonads toxicity.

The burden of stroke and transient ischemic attack in Pakistan: a community-based prevalence study. The burden of cerebrovascular disease in developing countries is rising sharply. The prevalence of established risk factors of stroke is exceptionally high in Pakistan. However, there is limited data on the burden of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in South Asia. We report the first such study conducted in an urban slum of Karachi, Pakistan. Individuals 35 years of age or older were invited for participation in this investigation through simple random sampling. A structured face-to-face interview was conducted using a pre-tested stroke symptom questionnaire in each participant to screen for past stroke or TIA followed by neurological examination of suspected cases. Anthropometric measurements and random blood glucose levels were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of vascular risk factors with prevalence of stroke. Five hundred and forty five individuals (49.4% females) participated in the study with a response rate of 90.8%. One hundred and four individuals (19.1%) were observed to have a prior stroke while TIA was found in 53 individuals (9.7%). Overall, 119 individuals (21.8% with 66.4% females) had stroke and/or TIA. Female gender, old age, raised random blood glucose level and use of chewable tobacco were significantly associated with the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease. This is the first study demonstrating an alarmingly high life-time prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in Pakistan. Individual and public health interventions in Pakistan to increase awareness about stroke, its prevention and therapy are warranted.

A mass spectrometric comparison of the interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with myoglobin. Mass spectrometric studies of the interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with myoglobin (Mb) provide information concerning interaction kinetics, Mb adduct identity, and cisplatin and transplatin binding sites on Mb. Although the Mb-cisplatin interaction is faster than the Mb-transplatin interaction, monoadducts and diadducts were formed in both the interactions over 30h. In order to locate the binding sites of cisplatin and transplatin on Mb, digests of free Mb, Mb-cisplatin and Mb-transplatin adducts were subjected to analysis by Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS). This analysis revealed that two fragment ions, 1313.27(5+) and 1316.68(5+), were obtained only from the Mb-cisplatin and Mb-transplatin adduct digests. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS(3)) of the 1313.27(5+) and 1316.68(5+) ions indicate that these ions arise from [Pt(NH(3))](2+) and [Pt(NH(3))(2)](2+), respectively, bound to peptide His97-Gly153. The product-ion spectra of the MS/MS and MS(3) analyses of the 1313.27(5+) ion indicate a common binding site of cisplatin and transplatin on His116-His119 residues. The interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with a dipeptide His-Ser and the three dimensional (3D) structure of native Mb suggest that cisplatin and transplatin coordinate to His116 and His119.

Sexual Activity, Contraceptive Use, and Childbearing of Teenagers Aged 15-19 in the United States. Monitoring sexual activity and contraceptive use among U.S. adolescents is important for understanding differences in their risk of pregnancy. In 2013, the U.S. birth rate for teenagers aged 15-19 dropped 57% from its peak in 1991 (1), paralleling a decline in the teen pregnancy rate (1-2). But these rates are still higher than those in other developed countries (3-4). Using data from the 1988 to 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), this report provides trends and recent national estimates of sexual activity, contraceptive use, and childbearing among teenagers aged 15-19.

Effects of late gestation supplementation of rumen undegradable protein, vitamin E, zinc, and chlortetracycline to ewes on indices of immune transfer and productivity. Late gestation supplementation of feed additives, such as rumen undegradable intake protein (RUIP), vitamin E, Zn, and chlortetracycline, has inconsistently improved ewe/lamb productivity. In 3 experiments, Western white-faced ewes were supplemented for at least 30 d during late gestation with 204 g/(ewe.d) on a DM basis of high (HS; 12.5% RUIP, 880 IU/kg of vitamin E, 176 mg/kg of Zn supplied by an AA complex, and 352 mg/kg of chlortetracycline) or low (LS; 7.56% RUIP and no supplemental vitamin E, Zn, or chlortetracycline) supplements. Ewes of different age (Exp. 1; 3- vs. 6-yr-old; n = 52) and BCS (Exp. 2; good vs. poor BCS; 3.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.5, respectively; n = 40) were supplemented individually in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments for 29 d. Thereafter, each ewe was group fed the appropriate supplement until lambing (14 +/- 7 d). Ewe intake, colostral IgG, ewe and lamb parainfluenza type 3 (PI(3)) titers, milk production, ewe BW and BCS change, and lamb production were measured in both experiments. In Exp. 3, approximately 600 ewes were group fed HS or LS over 2 yr. Ewe BW, ewe BCS, lamb production, and lamb survival was measured in Exp. 3 with groups within year as the experimental unit. In Exp. 1, lambs born to 3-yr-old ewes fed the HS had greater (P = 0.01) anti-PI(3) antibody titers than lambs born to 3-yr-old ewes fed the LS. Three-year-old ewes had greater (P < 0.01) DMI than 6-yr-old ewes. In Exp. 1 and 2, d 3 and 10 milk production differences (P <or= 0.10) were detected among treatments; however, lamb production did not differ among treatments in either experiment. In Exp. 3, late gestation supplementation did not affect indices of ewe or lamb production. Under the condition of these 3 studies, late gestation supplementation of HS or LS did not affect ewe productivity. Similarly, ewe age and BCS did not affect productivity, nor did ewe age or BCS interact with type of late gestation supplement.

Kalman meets neuron: the emerging intersection of control theory with neuroscience. Since the 1950s, we have developed mature theories of modern control theory and computational neuroscience with almost no interaction between these disciplines. With the advent of computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques, along with improved neuroscience models that provide increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety of important normal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for a synergistic interaction between these fields are now strong. I show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and control of single neuron dynamics, the modulation of oscillatory wave dynamics in brain cortex, a control framework for Parkinsonian dynamics and seizures, and the use of optimized parameter model networks to assimilate complex network data - the 'consensus set'.

Gene transcription of TLR2, TLR4, LPS ligands and prostaglandin synthesis enzymes are up-regulated in canine uteri with cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most frequent bacterium isolated in cases of cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex, the most frequent endometrial disorder in the bitch. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in the innate immune system. The aim of this study was to compare transcription of genes encoding TLR2, TLR4 and LPS ligands (CD14, MD-2, LBP), prostaglandin synthesis enzymes (COX1, COX2, PGES1 and PGFS), and to compare COX1 and COX2 protein expression and PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) endometrial content in the endometrium of canine diestrous uteri with (n=7) or without (n=7) pyometra. All cases of pyometra were hyperplastic and E. coli was the only isolated bacteria, while diestrous normal uteri did not present signs of cystic endometrial hyperplasia and were negative for bacteriology. Except for COX1, transcription of all genes was significantly higher in pyometra than in normal endometria. COX1 protein was observed in both normal and pyometra uteri, but COX2 protein was only present in pyometra cases. Endometrial PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) content were significantly higher in pyometra than in normal diestrous endometria. In conclusion, data obtained in this study provides evidence that pyometra-isolated E. coli induces the up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4 genes in the canine diestrous endometrium. This up-regulation, which is probably the result of the stimulation by LPS and lipoprotein E. coli constituents, leads to the endometrial up-regulation of PG synthesis genes. This, in turn, results in a higher endometrial concentration of PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha), which may further regulate the local inflammatory response.


Robust hairy microspheres and derived hairy surfaces by an "inside-out" wet approach.

Efficacy of atorvastatin on hippocampal neuronal damage caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia: Involving TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway. Hippocampal neuronal damage is critical for the initiation and progression of neurocognitive impairment accompanied obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in the development of several hippocampus-related neural disorders. Atorvastatin was reported beneficially regulates TLR4. Here, we examined the effects of atorvastatin on hippocampal injury caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of OSAS. Mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia with or without atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Cell damage, the expressions of TLR4 and its two downstream factors myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), inflammatory agents (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β), and the oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde) were determined. Atorvastatin decreased the neural injury and the elevation of TLR4, MyD88, TRIF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress caused by CIH. Our study suggests that atorvastatin may attenuate CIH induced hippocampal neuronal damage partially via TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway. 


Thermodynamics of mixed anionic/nonionic surfactant adsorption on alumina.

Haplotypes of the porcine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene are associated with backfat thickness. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. It is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene (PPARD) has been assigned to a region on porcine chromosome 7, which harbours a quantitative trait locus for backfat. Thus, PPARD is considered a functional and positional candidate gene for backfat thickness. The purpose of this study was to test this candidate gene hypothesis in a cross of breeds that were highly divergent in lipid deposition characteristics. Screening for genetic variation in porcine PPARD revealed only silent mutations. Nevertheless, significant associations between PPARD haplotypes and backfat thickness were observed in the F2 generation of the Mangalitsa x Piétrain cross as well as a commercial German Landrace population. Haplotype 5 is associated with increased backfat in F2 Mangalitsa x Piétrain pigs, whereas haplotype 4 is associated with lower backfat thickness in the German Landrace population. Haplotype 4 and 5 carry the same alleles at all but one SNP. Interestingly, the opposite effects of PPARD haplotypes 4 and 5 on backfat thickness are reflected by opposite effects of these two haplotypes on PPAR-delta mRNA levels. Haplotype 4 significantly increases PPAR-delta mRNA levels, whereas haplotype 5 decreases mRNA levels of PPAR-delta. This study provides evidence for an association between PPARD and backfat thickness. The association is substantiated by mRNA quantification. Further studies are required to clarify, whether the observed associations are caused by PPARD or are the result of linkage disequilibrium with a causal variant in a neighbouring gene.

Braking the bandwagon: scrutinizing the science and politics of empirically supported therapies. Proponents of empirically supported therapies (ESTs) argue that because manualized ESTs have demonstrated efficacy in treating a range of psychological disorders, they should be the treatments of choice. In this article, the author uses a hypothetical treatment for obesity to highlight numerous flaws in EST logic and argues for common factors as a more clinically relevant but empirically challenging approach. The author then explores how political variables may be contributing to the expansion of EST and the resulting restriction of practitioner autonomy. Last, the author argues that EST is best viewed as 1 component of a more comprehensive evidence-based practice framework. The author concludes with some cautionary statements about the perils of equating the EST paradigm with the scientist-practitioner ideal.

Active manganese oxide: a novel adsorbent for treatment of wastewater containing azo dye. A new variety of active manganese oxide was prepared, characterized, and tested for its potential of adsorbing Congo Red, a dis-azo dye, from aqueous solutions. Both equilibrium and kinetics were investigated over different values of process parameters such as temperature (25-45 degrees C), adsorbent loading (0.4-0.6%), initial dye concentration (50-500 mg/L), presence of salts (sodium sulphate, 500 mg/L) and the oxygen content (MnO(x), x=1.2, 1.33 and 2) of the adsorbent. The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Langmuir adsorption capacity of the sorbent (x=1.33) for Congo Red was 38.6 mg/g at room temperature which is substantially higher than those for commercial manganese dioxide, red mud, coir pith, activated carbon, and fly ash. The kinetic data were best interpreted using a pseudo-second order model. The results show that the active manganese oxide used in this work removes the dye by reversible adsorption and has the potential for practical use for remediation of textile industry effluents.

[Measurements of blood velocities using duplex sonography in carotid artery stents: analysis of reliability in an in-vitro model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)]. Stents are commonly used for the treatment of occlusive artery diseases in carotid arteries. Today, there is a controversial discussion as to whether duplex sonography (DS) displays blood velocities (BV) that are too high in stented areas. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of stenting on DS with respect to BV in artificial carotid arteries. The results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were also used for the comparison. To analyze BV using DS, a phantom with a constant flow (70 cm/s) was created. Three different types of stents for carotid arteries were selected. The phantom fluid consisted of 67 % water and 33 % glycerol. All BV measurements were carried out on the last third of the stents. Furthermore, all test runs were simulated using CFD. All measurements were statistically analyzed. DS-derived BV values increased significantly after the placement of the Palmaz Genesis stent (77.6 ± 4.92 cm/sec, p = 0.03). A higher increase in BV values was registered when using the Precise RX stent (80.1 ± 2.01 cm/sec, p < 0.0001). The Strecker Tantalum stent (85.9 ± 1.95 cm/sec, p < 0.0001) generated the highest BV values. CFD simulations showed similar results. Stents have a significant impact on BV, but no effect on DS. The main factor of the blood flow acceleration is the material thickness of the stents. Therefore, different stents need different velocity criteria. Furthermore, the results of computational fluid dynamics prove that CFD can be used to simulate BV in stented silicone tubes.

Is there a difference between strong ion gap in healthy volunteers and intensive care unit patients? Abnormalities of strong ion gap (SIG) are common in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients in conjunction with a high incidence of acid-base abnormalities. However, it is unknown whether abnormalities in SIG are also seen in ICU patients without active acid-base abnormalities. Thus, we conducted this pilot study to examine differences in quantitative acid-base variables between healthy adult volunteers and stable ICU patients with no suspected acid-base abnormalities. The study used a prospective observational study of 2 cohorts, 15 healthy adult volunteers and 15 stable adult patients just before ICU discharge who were not receiving renal replacement therapy and had no known active acid-base derangements. We analyzed venous blood for acid-base variables (potential hydrogen in central venous blood [pH(CV)], partial tension of carbon dioxide in central venous blood [p(CV)co(2)], standard base excess [SBE], lactate, Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), phosphate, and albumin). From these, we calculated strong ion difference (SID) and SIG for both cohorts. Although mean values for pH(CV), p(CV)CO(2), and SBE were within the normal range in both cohorts, 10 (66.7%) of 15 of ICU patients were found to have occult acid-base disorders. The ICU patients also had reduced albumin and SID measurements and significantly greater mean SIG (5.1 ± 2.9 mEq/L) compared to healthy controls (1.4 ± 1.8 mEq/L) (P = .0002). None of the healthy controls had a SIG higher than 5.0 mEq/L, whereas 7 (46.7%) of 15 of ICU patients had a SIG higher than 5.0 mEq/L. Even among ICU patients with no abnormalities of pH(CV), p(CV)CO(2), and SBE, mean SIG was 6.4 (± 3.3 mEq/L). Stable ICU patients have much higher levels of unexplained anions when comparing with healthy controls. Whether this finding represents occult acid-base disorders or simply metabolic differences among the critically ill is uncertain. Further study in larger populations is warranted to establish the significance of high SIG in otherwise stable ICU patients.

PKC plays an important mediated effect in arginine vasopressin induced restoration of vascular responsiveness and calcium sensitization following hemorrhagic shock in rats. The present study investigated the mediated effect of protein kinase C (PKC) in arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced restoration of vascular responsiveness and calcium sensitization following hemorrhagic shock. Using both isolated superior mesenteric artery from hemorrhagic shock rats and hypoxia-treated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), we investigated the roles of PKC-alpha, delta and epsilon isoforms in AVP-induced restoration of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity. Meanwhile, effects of their specific inhibitors on the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC(20)) in VSMC were observed. The results indicated that AVP improved the reactivity of superior mesenteric artery and VSMC to norepinephrine and calcium following hemorrhagic shock and hypoxia. PKC-alpha inhibitor and PKC-epsilon inhibitory peptide antagonized these effects of AVP, while PKC-delta inhibitor only partially antagonized these effects of AVP. AVP up-regulated the expression of PKC-alpha and epsilon in the particulate fractions of hypoxia-treated VSMC with the decrease of the activity of MLCP and the increase of the phosphorylation of MLC(20). These effects of AVP were inhibited by PKC-alpha inhibitor and PKC-epsilon inhibitory peptide, but not by the PKC-delta inhibitor. The results suggested that PKC plays an important role in AVP-induced restoration of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity following hemorrhagic shock. PKC-alpha and epsilon may be the main isoforms involved in this process and play effect via MLC(20) phosphorylation dependent mechanism, while PKC-delta may be partially involved in AVP action by other mechanisms.

Salt affects plant Cd-stress responses by modulating growth and Cd accumulation. Cadmium contamination is a serious environmental problem for modern agriculture and human health. Salinity affects plant growth and development, and interactions between salt and cadmium have been reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of salinity-cadmium interactions are not fully understood. Here, we show that a low concentration of salt alleviates Cd-induced growth inhibition and increases Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Supplementation with low concentrations of salt reduced the reactive oxygen species level in Cd-stressed roots by increasing the contents of proline and glutathione and down-regulating the expression of RCD1, thereby protecting the plasma membrane integrity of roots under cadmium stress. Salt supplementation substantially reduces the Cd-induced elevation of IAA oxidase activity, thereby maintaining auxin levels in Cd-stressed plants, as indicated by DR5::GUS expression. Salt supply increased Cd absorption in roots and increased Cd accumulation in leaves, implying that salt enhances both Cd uptake in roots and the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd. The elevated Cd accumulation in plants in response to salt was found to be correlated with the elevated levels of phytochelatin the expression of heavy metal transporters AtHMA1-4, especially AtHMA4. Salt alleviated growth inhibition caused by Cd and increased Cd accumulation also was observed in Cd accumulator Solanum nigrum.

Human prostate sphere-forming cells represent a subset of basal epithelial cells capable of glandular regeneration in vivo. Prostate stem/progenitor cells function in glandular development and maintenance. They may be targets for tumor initiation, so characterization of these cells may have therapeutic implications. Cells from dissociated tissues that form spheres in vitro often represent stem/progenitor cells. A subset of human prostate cells that form prostaspheres were evaluated for self-renewal and tissue regeneration capability in the present study. Prostaspheres were generated from 59 prostatectomy specimens. Lineage marker expression and TMPRSS-ERG status was determined via immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subpopulations of prostate epithelial cells were isolated by cell sorting and interrogated for sphere-forming activity. Tissue regeneration potential was assessed by combining sphere-forming cells with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme (rUGSM) subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice. Prostate tissue specimens were heterogeneous, containing both benign and malignant (Gleason 3-5) glands. TMPRSS-ERG fusion was found in approximately 70% of cancers examined. Prostaspheres developed from single cells at a variable rate (0.5-4%) and could be serially passaged. A basal phenotype (CD44+CD49f+CK5+p63+CK8-AR-PSA-) was observed among sphere-forming cells. Subpopulations of prostate cells expressing tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (Trop2), CD44, and CD49f preferentially formed spheres. In vivo implantation of sphere-forming cells and rUGSM regenerated tubular structures containing discreet basal and luminal layers. The TMPRSS-ERG fusion was absent in prostaspheres derived from fusion-positive tumor tissue, suggesting a survival/growth advantage of benign prostate epithelial cells. Human prostate sphere-forming cells self-renew, have tissue regeneration capability, and represent a subpopulation of basal cells.

Surveillance methods for identifying, characterizing, and monitoring tobacco products: potential reduced exposure products as an example. Tobacco products are widely sold and marketed, yet integrated data systems for identifying, tracking, and characterizing products are lacking. Tobacco manufacturers recently have developed potential reduced exposure products (PREP) with implied or explicit health claims. Currently, a systematic approach for identifying, defining, and evaluating PREPs sold at the local, state, or national levels in the United States has not been developed. Identifying, characterizing, and monitoring new tobacco products could be greatly enhanced with a responsive surveillance system. This article critically reviews available surveillance data sources for identifying and tracking tobacco products, including PREPs, evaluating strengths and weaknesses of potential data sources in light of their reliability and validity. With the absence of regulations mandating disclosure of product-specific information, it is likely that public health officials will need to rely on a variety of imperfect data sources to help identify, characterize, and monitor tobacco products, including PREPs.

Complete unilateral ophthalmoplegia in herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Based on a review of 20 well-documented cases reported in the English literature between 1968 and 2008, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) may rarely be associated with complete unilateral ophthalmoplegia, defined here as impaired ocular ductions in all 4 directions within 3 months of onset of manifestations of HZO. Ophthalmoplegia occurred equally in immune-competent and immune-incompetent individuals. HZO preceded ophthalmoplegia in 75% by a mean interval of 9.5 days and a range of 2 to 60 days, occurred simultaneously with ophthalmoplegia in 20%, and followed by 2 days the onset of ophthalmoplegia in only 5%. Concurrent conjunctival inflammation, keratitis, or anterior uveitis was present in 90%. Lumbar puncture showed features of aseptic meningitis in 88%, slightly more than the 40%-50% found in patients with HZO without ophthalmoplegia. On orbit/brain imaging, abnormal enlargement of the extraocular muscles was present in 33%, and orbital soft tissue swelling was present in 17%. Enhancement of ocular motor cranial nerves was not reported. Complete or near-complete resolution of ophthalmoplegia occurred in 65% within a range of 2 weeks to 1.5 years (mean 4.4 months). A single autopsy report described granulomatous angiitis of the meninges and large vessels in the anterior cerebral circulation, as well as periaxial infarction in the optic nerve, pons, and medulla but without viral inclusion bodies or antigen. Unsettled issues are whether the pathogenesis is direct viral invasion or an immune reaction to the virus, whether the impaired ocular ductions are based on myopathic or neuropathic injury, whether there are predisposing factors to the combination of HZO and complete ophthalmoplegia, and whether treatment is effective.

[Targeted epidural blood patch: an effective treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension]. To report the authors' own experience in the treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) with targeted epidural blood patch after locating the CSF leaks with CT myelography (CTM) and to discuss the mechanism and value of this method. Six patients with SIH (3 males and 3 females aged 33-66 years) were included. All patients met the diagnostic criteria of 2nd edition of International Classification of Headache Disorders (2004). CT myelography revealed the CSF leak sites in all 6 patients. Autologous blood mixed with Omnipaque (300 mg/ml) was injected after selective puncture at the leak site indicated by CTM. All patients responded well to the treatment and achieved a complete resolution of symptoms. Nerve root irritation occurred in 2 patients. Three patients suffered from a temporary back pain. With the location of leak sites by CTM, targeted epidural blood patch is an effective way to treat spontaneous intracranial hypotension.


Sex-related differences in cisplatin-induced neuropathy in rats.

A dominant mutation in mediator of paramutation2, one of three second-largest subunits of a plant-specific RNA polymerase, disrupts multiple siRNA silencing processes. Paramutation involves homologous sequence communication that leads to meiotically heritable transcriptional silencing. We demonstrate that mop2 (mediator of paramutation2), which alters paramutation at multiple loci, encodes a gene similar to Arabidopsis NRPD2/E2, the second-largest subunit of plant-specific RNA polymerases IV and V. In Arabidopsis, Pol-IV and Pol-V play major roles in RNA-mediated silencing and a single second-largest subunit is shared between Pol-IV and Pol-V. Maize encodes three second-largest subunit genes: all three genes potentially encode full length proteins with highly conserved polymerase domains, and each are expressed in multiple overlapping tissues. The isolation of a recessive paramutation mutation in mop2 from a forward genetic screen suggests limited or no functional redundancy of these three genes. Potential alternative Pol-IV/Pol-V-like complexes could provide maize with a greater diversification of RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing machinery relative to Arabidopsis. Mop2-1 disrupts paramutation at multiple loci when heterozygous, whereas previously silenced alleles are only up-regulated when Mop2-1 is homozygous. The dramatic reduction in b1 tandem repeat siRNAs, but no disruption of silencing in Mop2-1 heterozygotes, suggests the major role for tandem repeat siRNAs is not to maintain silencing. Instead, we hypothesize the tandem repeat siRNAs mediate the establishment of the heritable silent state-a process fully disrupted in Mop2-1 heterozygotes. The dominant Mop2-1 mutation, which has a single nucleotide change in a domain highly conserved among all polymerases (E. coli to eukaryotes), disrupts both siRNA biogenesis (Pol-IV-like) and potentially processes downstream (Pol-V-like). These results suggest either the wild-type protein is a subunit in both complexes or the dominant mutant protein disrupts both complexes. Dominant mutations in the same domain in E. coli RNA polymerase suggest a model for Mop2-1 dominance: complexes containing Mop2-1 subunits are non-functional and compete with wild-type complexes.

Systemic lidocaine inhibits remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via the inhibition of cPKCgamma membrane translocation in spinal dorsal horn of rats. Remifentanil is being used increasingly as one component of total intravenous anesthesia. Severe postoperative pain has occasionally been reported with discontinuation of remifentanil. This study was designed to determine the involvement of conventional protein kinase Cgamma (cPKCgamma) in the inhibitory action of lidocaine on remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia of rats after propofol-remifentanil-based anesthesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated into the following groups randomly: propofol only (P), propofol+remifentanil (R), propofol+remifentanil+lidocaine (RL), and propofol+lidocaine (L). Cumulative pain score and withdrawal response to mechanical stimulation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence were applied to observe remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and cPKCgamma membrane translocation. We found that the cumulative pain score of group R increased significantly at 30, 120, and 300 minutes postanesthesia (P<0.05). After plantar incision, the withdrawal threshold on both the contralateral and the ipsilaeral side at 30, 120, and 300 minutes postanesthesia in group R was significantly lower than in groups P, RL, and L (P<0.05). Both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence showed that cPKCgamma membrane translocation increased in dorsal horn neurons of propofol-remifentanil-based anesthetized rats, which could be inhibited by systemic lidocaine. These results suggested that increased cPKCgamma membrane translocation was involved in remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, which was inhibited by systemic lidocaine and may contribute to reduced postoperative pain in rats after propofol-remifentanil-based anesthesia.

Severity and treatment of "occult" intra-abdominal injuries in blunt trauma victims. to assess the severity and treatment of "occult" intra-abdominal injuries in blunt trauma victims. Retrospective analysis of charts and trauma register data of adult blunt trauma victims, admitted without abdominal pain or alterations in the abdominal physical examination, but were subsequently diagnosed with intra-abdominal injuries, in a period of 2 years. The severity was stratified according to RTS, AIS, OIS and ISS. The specific treatment for abdominal injuries and the complications related to them were assessed. Intra-abdominal injuries were diagnosed in 220 (3.8%) out of the 5785 blunt trauma victims and 76 (34.5%) met the inclusion criteria. The RTS and ISS median (lower quartile, upper quartile) were 7.84 (6.05, 7.84) and 25 (16, 34). Sixty seven percent had a GCS≥13 on admission. Injuries were identified in the spleen (34), liver (33), kidneys (9), intestines (4), diaphragm (3), bladder (3) and iliac vessels (1). Abdominal injuries scored AIS≥3 in 67% of patients. Twenty-one patients (28%) underwent laparotomy, 5 of which were nontherapeutic. The surgical procedures performed were splenectomy (8), suturing of the diaphragm (3), intestines (3), bladder (2), kidneys (1), enterectomy/anastomosis (1), ligation of the common iliac vein (1), and revascularization of the common iliac artery (1). Angiography and embolization of liver and/or spleen injuries were performed in 3 cases. Three patients developed abdominal complications, all of which were operatively treated. There were no deaths directly related to the abdominal injuries. Severe "occult" intra-abdominal injuries, requiring specific treatment, may be present in adult blunt trauma patients.


Avian poxvirus infection in a white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Japan.

Temporary modification of salivary protein profile and individual responses to repeated phenolic astringent stimuli. The extent of the change in salivary protein characteristics after repeated stimulations was shown to be correlated to differences in perceived astringency. Salivary characteristics of 77 subjects were compared after masticatory (S1) and taste/masticatory (S2) stimulations. The variations (S2 minus S1) of protein concentration and saliva haze-forming capacity (HFC) were used to define 3 subject groups: low responding (LR, n = 20), medium responding (MR, n = 37), and high responding (HR, n = 20). Salivary protein concentration did not change in LR subjects; decreased a little, but significantly, in MR subjects; and strongly decreased in HR subjects. After S2, HFC increased in LR subjects, slightly decreased in MR subjects, and strongly decreased in HR subjects. Salivary protein electrophoresis patterns for HR and LR subjects were analyzed. No significant modifications of glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRPs), PRPs, and amylases and a slight decrease in cystatins and histatins were found when S2 and S1 samples were compared in LR subjects, whereas HR subjects showed a strong decrease in all the above proteins after S2. Significant modifications of mucins were not found. Tannic acid (TA, 3 g/L) astringency ratings after S1 from HR subjects were significantly higher than those from the other 2 groups, whereas no differences were found comparing LR and MR ratings. The "carryover" effect due to 4 sequential exposures to TA samples (1.4 g/L) was observed in both HR and MR groups, whereas no significant astringency rating variation was found in the LR group. The results support the inhibiting role of proteins with strong phenol-binding activity on astringency elicitation. Individual physiological variations of parotid gland functionality might account for differences in sensitivity to astringent phenolic stimuli.

Seizure prediction for epilepsy using a multi-stage phase synchrony based system. Seizure onset prediction in epilepsy is a challenge which is under investigation using many and varied signal processing techniques. Here we present a multi-stage phase synchrony based system that brings to bear the advantages of many techniques in each substage. The 1(st) stage of the system unmixes continuous long-term (2-4 days) multichannel scalp EEG using spatially constrained Independent Component Analysis and estimates the long term significant phase synchrony dynamics of narrowband (2-8 Hz and 8-14 Hz) seizure components. It then projects multidimensional features onto a 2-D map using Neuroscale and evaluates the probability of predictive events using Gaussian Mixture Models. We show the possibility of seizure onset prediction within a prediction window of 35-65 minutes with a sensitivity of 65-100% and specificity of 65-80% across epileptic patients.

Impact of peripheral arterial disease on health status: a comparison with chronic heart failure. To further document the experienced burden in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we compared the health status of patients with PAD and chronic heart failure (CHF). As a secondary aim, we studied clinical and socio-demographic correlates of health status in both conditions. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in four outpatient clinics in the Southern part of The Netherlands, with subjects consisting of ambulatory (346 PAD and 188 CHF) patients. All patients completed the Short-Form 12 to assess their physical and mental health status. Information about socio-demographic, clinical risk factors, and disease severity indices was obtained from patients' medical records. Propensity methodology was applied to enhance comparability between both medical conditions. Type of medical condition explained differences in health status (F = 33.1, P < .0001, Effect Size = 0.27). Impaired physical health status was more often reported in PAD patients (48.4%) compared with CHF patients (17.4%, Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.3-8.8, P < .0001); impaired mental health status was more noted in CHF patients (43.5% vs. 22.0%, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6, P = .002). In PAD, younger age (P = .002), low education (P = .02), cardiac history (P = .02), diabetes mellitus (P = .03), and a lower ankle brachial index (P = .003) were associated with worse physical health status; younger age (P = .01) and living without partner (P = .01) were associated with lower mental health status scores. In CHF, patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus (P < .001) and females (P = .001) reported worse physical health, whereas no clinical or socio-demographics were associated with mental health status. By contrasting PAD patients' health status with another chronic disabling condition, the impact of PAD on patients' physical health status became evident; whereas mental health status was more affected in CHF, patients with PAD reported a greater physical burden as compared with CHF patients. PAD patients who were younger, lower-educated, without a partner or had a cardiac history especially reported a higher disease burden. Clinicians need to be aware of these differences in order to develop tailor-made disease management programs for different groups of cardiovascular patients.

Pattern of bone mineral density in sickle cell disease patients with the high-Hb F phenotype. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients of all ages due to erythropoietic stress and consequent bone marrow hyperplasia. Kuwaiti SCD patients have a mild clinical phenotype because of their high Hb F level. There has been no previous documentation of BMD in this population of patients. SCD patients (n = 81) and controls (n = 67) were recruited from hematology clinics of Mubarak Hospital, Kuwait. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic) in the lumbar spine and the hip (left femoral neck). Among the 53 adult patients, the prevalence of low BMD was 67.4% in the spine and 33.3% in the hip while among controls, the figures were 23.1 and 11.3%, respectively. These differences are significant (p < 0.01). In SCD children, the figures were 17.9% (in the lumbar spine) and 3.6% (in the hip), while in controls the figures were 13.3 and 0%, respectively. The differences are not significant (p > 0.05). Patients with frequent vaso-occlusive crisis had significantly lower mean BMD, but those with MRI evidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head were more likely to have normal or osteosclerotic BMD. Our study showed that osteopenia/osteoporosis is uncommon among Kuwaiti children with SCD but quite common in adults.

The role of mucus in cough research. Cough is a defense mechanism for promoting airway hygiene when mucociliary clearance is ineffective due to increased mucus secretion, inflammation, infection, or ciliary dysfunction. Secretions can contribute to airflow limitation and chronic hypersecretion can worsen airway inflammation with retained inflammatory cells and mediators. The focus of the Second Annual Cough Conference has been on cough as a troublesome symptom; but to understand the importance and effectiveness of cough clearance, it is critical to understand airway secretions. The biophysical properties of mucus and phlegm determine how readily these secretions can be cleared by coughing.

Bio-distribution of pharmacologically administered recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). Recent clinical studies suggest that the prophylactic use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) markedly reduces the number of bleeding episodes in hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Given the short biological half-life of rFVIIa, it is unclear how rFVIIa could be effective in prophylactic treatment. To examine the extravascular distribution of pharmacologically administered rFVIIa to obtain clues on how rFVIIa could work in prophylaxis. Recombinant mouse FVIIa tagged with AF488 fluorophore (AF488-FVIIa) was administered into mice via the tail vein. At different time intervals following the administration, mice were exsanguinated and various tissues were collected. The tissue sections were processed for immunohistochemistry to evaluate distribution of rFVIIa. rFVIIa, immediately following the administration, associated with the endothelium lining of large blood vessels. Within 1 h, rFVIIa bound to endothelial cells was transferred to the perivascular tissue surrounding the blood vessels and thereafter diffused throughout the tissue. In the liver, rFVIIa was localized to sinusoidal capillaries and accumulated in hepatocytes. In bone, rFVIIa was accumulated in the zone of calcified cartilage and some of it was retained there for a week. The common finding of the present study is that rFVIIa in extravascular spaces was mostly localized to regions that contain TF expressing cells. The present study demonstrates that pharmacologically administered rFVIIa readily associates with the vascular endothelium and subsequently enters into extravascular spaces where it is likely to bind to TF and is retained for extended time periods. This may explain the prolonged pharmacological effect of rFVIIa.


Effect of ONO-4057 and tacrolimus on ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver.

Combined contactless conductometric, photometric, and fluorimetric single point detector for capillary separation methods. This work for the first time combines three on-capillary detection methods, namely, capacitively coupled contactless conductometric (C(4)D), photometric (PD), and fluorimetric (FD), in a single (identical) point of detection cell, allowing concurrent measurements at a single point of detection for use in capillary electrophoresis, capillary electrochromatography, and capillary/nanoliquid chromatography. The novel design is based on a standard 6.3 mm i.d. fiber-optic SMA adapter with a drilled opening for the separation capillary to go through, to which two concentrically positioned C(4)D detection electrodes with a detection gap of 7 mm were added on each side acting simultaneously as capillary guides. The optical fibers in the SMA adapter were used for the photometric signal (absorbance), and another optical fiber at a 45 degrees angle to the capillary was applied to collect the emitted light for FD. Light emitting diodes (255 and 470 nm) were used as light sources for the PD and FD detection modes. LOD values were determined under flow-injection conditions to exclude any stacking effects: For the 470 nm LED limits of detection (LODs) for FD and PD were for fluorescein (1 x 10(-8) mol/L) and tartrazine (6 x 10(-6) mol/L), respectively, and the LOD for the C(4)D was for magnesium chloride (5 x 10(-7) mol/L). The advantage of the three different detection signals in a single point is demonstrated in capillary electrophoresis using model mixtures and samples including a mixture of fluorescent and nonfluorescent dyes and common ions, underivatized amino acids, and a fluorescently labeled digest of bovine serum albumin.

Epidemiology of Oestrus ovis infection of sheep in northeast Spain (mid-Ebro Valley). Slaughterhouse surveys to determine the prevalence and intensity of larval Oestrus ovis Linnaeus (Diptera: Oestridae) in sheep, were conducted monthly for 1 year in northeastern Spain. The prevalence of O. ovis in 120 sheep in northeast Spain was 84.2%. The monthly prevalence ranged from 62.5% in January to 100% in June and October. Of the 3,831 larvae collected, 3,005 were first instar larvae (78.4%), 744 second instar larvae (19.4%), and 82 third instar larvae (2.1%). The mean larval burden per infected sheep was 37.9, throughout the year although infection was higher in October. The high number of first stage larvae in winter (especially October, November, and December) may be due to a period of slower larval maturation. Third-stage larvae were always present but sometimes in very low numbers compared to the total. According to the results, oestrosis appears to be a serious problem in the region.

[The clinical characteristics of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome in Qingdao]. To investigate the clinical characteristics of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) in Qingdao. Two hundred and four PI-IBS and 2068 non-PI-IBS patients were investigated with questionnaire including general information, symptoms and quality of life scores with microecological study before and after therapy. (1) The morbidity rate of PI-IBS in female was 2. 2 times of that in male, which was similar to that in non-PI-IBS. (2) Brain work labors dominated in both PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients. (3) As to the simultaneous presence of extra-gastrointestinal symptoms, there was no statistical difference between the rate of physical symptoms in PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients (chi2 =10.5, P > 0.05), but the rate of mental symptoms was higher in PI-IBS than in non-PI-IBS patients, and the difference was significant (chi2 = 28.7, P < 0.05). (4) The alteration of intestinal microflora rate in PI-IBS was obviously higher than that in non-PI-IBS patients. (5) The quality of life scores in PI-IBS was improved after treatment with Birid Triple Viable , and there was significant difference (t = 3.8, P < 0.01), but there was no statistical difference in non-PI-IBS (t = 1.5, P > 0.05). There was some difference in certain clinical characteristics between PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients in Qingdao.

The effect of methotrexate on cardiovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review. Patients with RA have an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is due to traditional risk factors and the effects of chronic inflammation. MTX is the first-choice DMARD in RA. We performed a systematic literature review to determine whether MTX affects the risk of CVD in patients with RA. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane database, database of abstracts of reviews of effects, health technology assessment and Science Citation Index from 1980 to 2008. Conference proceedings (British Society of Rheumatology, ACR and EULAR) were searched from 2005 to 2008. Papers were included if they assessed the relationship between MTX use and CVD in patients with RA. Two reviewers independently assessed each title and abstract for relevance and quality. A total of 2420 abstracts were identified, of which 18 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two studies assessed the relationship between MTX use and CVD mortality, one demonstrated a significant reduction in CVD mortality and the second a trend towards reduction. Five studies considered all-cause CVD morbidity. Four demonstrated a significant reduction in CVD morbidity and the fifth a trend towards reduction. MTX use in the year prior to the development of RA decreased the risk of CVD for 3-4 years. Four studies considered myocardial infarction, one demonstrated a decreased risk and three a trend towards decreased risk with MTX use. The current evidence suggests that MTX use is associated with a reduced risk of CVD events in patients with RA. This suggests that reducing the inflammation in RA using MTX not only improves disease-specific outcomes but may also reduce collateral damage such as atherosclerosis.

[The application of external fixator for complex tissue defect in the forearm]. To discuss the curative effect of the external fixator for complex tissue defect in the forearm. From May, 2005 through December, 2008, the external fixators were used in 17 patients to treat the complex tissue defect in the forearm caused by trauma. There were 11 male and 6 female, with a mean age of 25.6. All patients were accompanied with the exposure of tendon, muscle or screw. The skin defect ranged from 7 cm x4 cm to 19 cm x9 cm. All patients underwent pedicle flap repair. The flap ranged from 10 cm x 6 cm to 20 cm x 15 cm. The proximal pedicle of the flap was sutured into a tubular. The position of the pedicle was fixed by the external fixator. The pin was at the ulnar and the iliac (n=5), and the radius and the iliac (n=12). The immobilization lasted 3 to 8 weeks, 5.1 weeks in average. All patients were followed up for 3 to 20 months, 11.3 in average. All pedicle flaps survived with no pressure ulcer, or no erosion in the axilla. No compartment syndrome or osteomyelitis occurred. Four to six week after surgery, the pedicle was cut. Infection occurred at the cutting end in 1 patient. The wound healed after addressing. The wound in the other 16 patients healed successfully. The fracture of the ulnar and the radius healed 8.5 or 15 weeks after surgery, 13.5 weeks in average. Eleven patients underwent second stage reshape and function restoration. The function of the hands and forearms recovered satisfactorily. Eleven patients returned to their work. Six patients can live with basic function for living. The external fixator used for complex tissue defect in the forearm can keep the position of the pedicle, replacing plaster fixation. It can reduce the incidence of flap and vessel spasm, and get good outcomes.

Fish proteome analysis: model organisms and non-sequenced species. In the last decade, proteomic technologies have been increasingly used in fish biology research. Proteomics has been applied primarily to investigate the physiology, development biology and the impact of contaminants in fish model organisms, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as in some commercial species produced in aquaculture, mainly salmonids and cyprinids. However, the lack of previous genetic information on most fish species has been a major drawback for a more general application of the different proteomic technologies currently available. Also, many teleosts of interest in biological research and with potential application in aquaculture hold unique physiological characteristics that cannot be directly addressed from the study of small laboratory fish models. This review describes proteomic approaches that have been used to investigate diverse biological questions in model and non-model fish species. We will also evaluate the current possibilities to integrate fish proteomics with other "omic" approaches, as well as with additional complementary techniques, in order to address the future challenges in fish biology research.

Inflammatory biomarkers in combat wound healing. Modern war ballistics and blast injuries inflict devastating extremity injuries, violating soft tissue, bone, and neurovascular structures. Despite advances in complex wound management, appropriate timing of war wound closure remains subjective. In addition, the pathophysiology of acute wound failure is poorly defined. Patients with penetrating extremity wounds sustained during combat were prospectively studied and followed for 30 days after definitive wound closure. The primary outcome was wound healing. Wound dehiscence was defined as spontaneous partial or complete wound disruption after closure. Serum, wound effluent, and wound bed tissue biopsy were collected at each surgical wound debridement. Serum and wound effluent were analyzed with a multiplex array of 22 cytokines and chemokines, and wound tissue for corresponding gene transcript expression. Fifty-two penetrating extremity war wounds in 33 male patients were investigated. Nine (17%) wounds dehisced. Concomitant vascular injury, increased wound size, and higher injury severity score correlated with wound dehiscence. Both serum and wound effluent cytokine and chemokine protein profiles were statistically associated with healing outcome at various time points. Wound biopsy gene transcript expression demonstrated increased tissue inflammation associated with wound failure. Multiple protein and gene transcript biomarkers predictive of wound healing were identified. The cytokine and chemokine protein and gene transcript expression patterns demonstrate a condition of inflammatory dysregulation associated with war wound failure. A molecular biomarker panel may predict combat wound healing outcome and warrants prospective validation.


MRSA and diabetic foot wounds: contaminating or infecting organisms?

Quality of life in stoma patients: appropriate and inappropriate stoma sites. The objective of the cross-sectional study reported here was to compare the quality of life of patients with an appropriate stoma site and with that of patients with an inappropriate stoma site. Two groups of patients with permanent intestinal stomas were assessed, 174 patients with appropriate stoma sites and 174 patients with inappropriate stoma sites. We used the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-CR38, which evaluate 26 quality of life (QoL) scales. Data analysis was performed with SPSS software. From a total of 9 functional scales, 3 scales in patients with an appropriate stoma site were significantly higher than in patients with an inappropriate stoma site: sexual enjoyment (71.2% vs. 63.2%; p = 0.02), physical functioning (74.3% vs. 68.2%; p = 0.005), and role functioning (74.3% vs. 64.4%; p < 0.0001). From the total of 16 symptom scales, patients with an inappropriate stoma site had significantly more problems than patients with an appropriate stoma site in 8 scales: micturation (27% vs. 22.5%; p = 0.04), gastrointestinal problems (32.6% vs. 27%; p = 0.01), weight loss (36.5% vs. 29.2%; p = 0.03), dyspnea (25.95% vs. 12.5%; p = 0.0001), pain (39.3% vs. 29.6%; p = 0.001), fatigue (43.5% vs. 34.5%; p < 0.0001), nausea and vomiting (18.15% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.03), and insomnia (39.8% vs. 31.1%; p = 0.01). Patients with an appropriate stoma site scored global QoL significantly higher than those with an inappropriate stoma site (56.2% vs. 49.7%; p = 0.007) A perfectly placed intestinal stoma is strongly related to good QoL for affected patients. From the total of 26 QoL scales assessed in the study, patients with appropriate stoma sites achieved better results in at least 50% of the scales.

Determination of spatial distribution of melamine-cyanuric acid crystals in rat kidney tissue by histology and imaging matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. After the outbreak of acute renal failure associated with melamine-contaminated pet food, many attempts have been made to uncover the mechanism underlying the renal toxicity caused by melamine and melamine-related compounds. Using rat models, we investigated the renal crystal formation following the ingestion of a melamine-cyanuric acid mixture (M+CA, 1:1) to gain insight into the M+CA-induced renal toxicity. M+CA did not induce toxicity in precision-cut kidney slices, suggesting that M+CA does not have a direct nephrotoxicity. On the contrary, oral administration of M+CA for 3 days induced nephrotoxicity as determined by increased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, reduced creatinine clearance, and enlarged kidneys in the animals treated with 50 mg/kg M+CA (melamine, 25 mg/kg, and cyanuric acid, 25 mg/kg; 2 of 10 animals) and 100 mg/kg M+CA (9 of 9 animals). While urine crystals were found in all animals treated with M+CA (25-100 mg/kg), histological examination revealed that renal crystals could be observed only in the kidneys of animals showing signs of nephrotoxicity. Remarkably, at 50 mg/kg M+CA, crystals were observed mainly in the medulla region of the kidney, while at 100 mg/kg, crystals were disseminated throughout the cortex and medulla regions. To further investigate the crystal formation by M+CA, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (MALDI-Q-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry detecting melamine distribution through monitoring the product ion (m/z 85, M + H) from melamine (m/z 127, M + H) was developed to directly obtain the image of melamine distribution in the kidney. The distribution image of melamine in kidney tissue confirmed that dense points of melamine were located only in the medulla region at 50 mg/kg M+CA, while at 100 mg/kg, they were disseminated widely from the cortex to medulla. These results demonstrated that M+CA ingestion could lead to crystal formation in kidney tubules along the osmotic gradient and that renal crystal formation is closely linked with M+CA-induced nephrotoxicity.

Microplasmin degrades fibronectin and laminin at vitreoretinal interface and outer retina during enzymatic vitrectomy. To determine whether intravitreal administration of microplasmin (microPlm) will degrade fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) in rat retina during microPlm-induced posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Increasing doses of microPlm, from 0.01 U to 0.03 U, were injected into the left eyes of 60 Sprague-Dawley rats to induce PVD. The right eyes were injected with the same volume of balanced salt solution (BSS). Histochemistry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and phase contrast microscopy were performed after 1 day and 7 days, to assess the remnant vitreous cortex. The FN and LN level located at the vitreoretinal interface and the outer retina were detected by immunohistochemistry. microPlm induced complete PVD in a dose-dependent fashion, without internal limiting membrane (ILM) damage (P = 0.0001, r = -0.479). The FN and LN in the photoreceptor cell layer (PCL) were completely degraded in all microPlm-treated eyes. In eyes with complete PVD, the FN, but not the LN, was completely removed from the ILM by microPlm treatment. Intravitreal injection of microplasmin degraded FN and LN at the vitreoretinal junction as well as at the outer retina.

Pliocene hominin biogeography and ecology. Australopithecus bahrelghazali, its origin and palaeobiology are not well understood. Reported from only one location some several thousand kilometres away from East African Pliocene hominin sites, it appears to have predominantly fed on C4 sources. Yet, it lacks the morphological adaptations of other primate C4 consumers like Paranthropus boisei and Theropithecus oswaldi. Furthermore, although considered to belong to Australopithecus afarensis by most researchers, A. bahrelghazali appears to differ from the former in a key aspect of its morphology: enamel thickness. To assess the phylogeny and palaeobiology of A. bahrelghazali, I first evaluate the dietary adaptations and energetics of A. bahrelghazali using empirical data of the feeding ecology of extant baboons, Papio cynocephalus. Information published on A. bahrelghazali morphology and habitat preference is used to select C4 foods with the appropriate mechanical properties and availability within the environment to create the models. By altering the feeding time on various food categories, I then test whether A. bahrelghazali could have subsisted on a C4 diet, thus accounting for the δ(13)C composition of its dental tissue. The effects of body mass on the volume of food consumed are taken into account. The outcomes of these simulations indicate that A. bahrelghazali could have subsisted on a diet of predominantly sedges, albeit with limitations. At higher energy requirements, i.e., above 3.5 times the BMR, it would be difficult for a medium-sized primate to obtain sufficient energy from a sedge-based diet. This is apparently due to constraints on foraging/feeding time, not because of the nutritional value of sedges per se. These results are discussed against the backdrop of A. bahrelghazali biogeography, palaeoenvironment, and phylogeny. The combined evidence makes it plausible to suggest that Northern Chad may have been a refugium for migrating mammals, including hominins, and throws new light on the deep history of A. bahrelghazali.

In vitro double transposition for DNA identification. We present a double transposition technique that inserts two different transposons into target DNA to act as priming sites for amplifying the region between the two transposons for sequencing applications. Unlike some current sequencing approaches, the genome of the unknown target remains intact in this method. The transposition reaction, DNA repair, and subsequent sequencing were performed entirely in vitro, without the need for transformation into bacteria, and resulted in sequence homology with the plasmid DNA target. This approach can reduce the time required for the assay by more than a day compared with standard techniques and reduces the number of required enzymatic steps. In addition, the in vitro method enables transposition to be carried out in automated microfluidic platforms without the need for significant sample manipulation. As a demonstration of incorporating transposition techniques into high-throughput technologies, single transposition reactions were carried out in picoliter-sized droplets generated on a microfluidic platform.

Systemic treatment with strontium ranelate promotes tibial fracture healing in ovariectomized rats. Systemic treatment with strontium ranelate (SR) was performed on ovariectomized (OVX) rats with fractured tibiae. Callus quality was assessed by radiographic, histological, micro-computerized tomography, and biomechanical examinations at 4 and 8 weeks after fracture. Results revealed that systemic applied SR promoted osteoporotic fracture healing. Several studies have demonstrated the dual effect of SR on osteoporotic and undisturbed bone. However, reports of their effect on osteoporotic fracture healing are limited. This study was designed to investigate the effects of SR on bone regeneration in OVX rats with fractured tibiae. Three months after being OVX, female Sprague-Dawley rats accepted bilateral osteotomy on proximal tibiae fixed with intramedullary wires and were divided into two groups: OVX and OVX + SR (625 mg/kg/day). Callus quality was evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks postfracture. Compared with OVX group, SR treatment significantly increased bone formation, BMD, biomechanical strength, and improved microstructural properties of the callus. The ultimate load was increased by 211.0% and 61.4% (p<0.01), and the total bone volume of callus by 74.8% and 79.3% (p<0.01) at 4 and 8 weeks postfracture, respectively. SR treatment also promoted healing progress with increased osteogenesis at 4 weeks; more mature and tightly arranged woven or lamellar bone at 8 weeks across the fracture gap in histological analysis. This study suggests that systemic treatment with strontium ranelate could promote tibial fracture healing in OVX rats.

[Inhibitory effect of emodin on the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells in vitro]. To study the effect of emodin on the differentiation, maturation and function of human dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. Cells isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were induced to dendritic cells (DC) with recombinant interleukin-4 and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and different concentrations of emodin were added respectively in the cultured cells on the 5th and the 7th to obtain mature or immature DCs. The phenotype of DCs ( HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, CD83, CD14, CD11c) and the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12) were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the immune-stimulating function of DCs was evaluated by co-culture of DCs and self-T-lymphocytes. The expression rate of CD80 and CD83 in the emodin group were 13.4% +/- 6.6% and 9.3% +/- 2.2% respectively; which were significantly lower than those in the control group (39.3% +/- 8.6% and 30.7% +/- 5.6%), respectively (P<0.05). IL-12 secretion of DCs was lower (1700.44 +/- 1000.21 microg/L vs 4500.60 +/- 1200.6 microg/L) but IL-10 secretion was higher (350.6 +/- 150.2 microg/L vs 230.7 +/- 90.1 microg/L) in the emodin group than in the control group (P<0.05). Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLR) examination showed that emodin could significantly inhibit the stimulation of DCs on self-T-lymphocyte proliferation. Emodin could evidently suppress the maturation and immune stimulating function of DCs during their in vitro conversion process.

[The modulating effect of the horn extract from the saiga of different age on the organothypic lymphoid tissue culture]. The horn extracts from the saiga of different age were used to investigate its effect on organotypic tissue culture of explants from the rat spleen. From 4 to 10 amino acids were detected in the different extract fractions. The horn extracts from the young saiga, at the effective concentration 1 ng/ml, showed stimulating effect in spleen tissue cultures as compared to the control explants. No effect of extracts from the old saiga was observed in tissue culture. Possibly, a stimulation of the cellular proliferation is due to the great amino acid content in saiga horn; however this phenomenon is decreased by the aging.

Integrating WHO 2001-2008 criteria for the diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): a case-case analysis of benzene exposure. We characterized the prevalence of hematopoietic and lymphoid disease for 2923 consecutive patients presenting at 29 hospitals from August 2003 to June 2007. Diagnoses were made in our laboratory using WHO criteria based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, FISH and molecular data. A total of 611 subjects (322 males/289 females) were prospectively diagnosed with MDS using WHO (2001) criteria. Update and re-evaluation of cases using MDS (2008) criteria resulted in 649 MDS cases. Using WHO (2008) criteria, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) accounted for 68% of total cases, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 16.3%; refractory anemia (RA), 6.5%; refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 4%; and MDS-unclassifiable (MDS-U), 4.5%. Subjects were administered questionnaires and information on previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents such as benzene (BZ) was obtained. A total of 80/649 (13.2%) were determined to have some BZ exposure. The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in all MDS was 30%, the most common being +8>del(20)q>del(7q)>del(5q), while the analogous frequency in BZ-exposed cases was only 24%. To further investigate the characteristics of MDS associated with BZ, we identified a subset of cases with high BZ exposure. These BZ signal cases were each matched by age and gender to two cases with no known BZ exposure. When contrasting BZ signal cases vs matched cases with no BZ exposure, we found a high odds ratio (OR) for the WHO subtype MDS-U (OR=11.1), followed by RAEB and RCUD (OR=1), RA (OR=0.7) and RCMD (OR=0.6). Multilineage dysplasia with abnormal eosinophils (MDS-Eo) was strongly associated with BZ exposure, whereas the relative risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was reduced for high BZ-exposed cases (OR=0.5). These findings are strongly indicative that MDS subtypes are influenced by BZ exposure, and taken together with previous studies, the features of MDS-Eo suggest that altered immune regulation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of MDS following chronic exposure to BZ.

Prognostic Significance of Postoperative Subsyndromal Delirium. Whether postoperative subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is a separate syndrome from delirium and has clinical relevance is not well understood. We sought to investigate SSD in older surgical patients and to determine its prognostic significance. We performed a prospective cohort study of patients who were 65 years or older and were scheduled for noncardiac surgery. Postoperative delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method. SSD was defined as the presence of at least one of the possible 10 symptoms of delirium, as defined by the Confusion Assessment Method, but not meeting the criteria for delirium. The number of features of SSD on the first postoperative day was associated with the subsequent development of delirium on the next day, after controlling for other risk factors. When compared with a patient with no SSD features, a patient with 1 SSD feature was 1.07 times more likely to have delirium on the next day (95% CI: 0.42-2.53), with 2 features was 3.32 times more likely to have it (95% CI: 1.42-7.57), and with ≥ 2 features was 8.37 times more likely to have it (95% CI: 4.98-14.53). Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the number of features of SSD and increased length of hospital stay and worsened functional status at 1 month after surgery. SSD is prevalent in at-risk surgical patients and has prognostic significance. Only a single symptom of SSD was sufficient to cause a significant increase in hospital length of stay and further decline in functional status. These results suggest that monitoring for SSD is indicated in at-risk patients.

Does tamsulosin increase stone clearance after shockwave lithotripsy of renal stones? A prospective, randomized controlled study. To evaluate the efficacy of the selective alpha-blocker tamsulosin on stone clearance after shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) of renal stones. A prospective, randomized, controlled study was carried out in 166 patients who underwent SWL for renal stones between January and December 2007. Group 1 (n = 83) took tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily and diclofenac sodium injection (75 mg) on demand. Group 2 (n = 83) took only diclofenac sodium as needed. Patients were on this regimen for 4 weeks or until stone clearance and were followed up for a maximum of 3 months. They were evaluated for stone clearance, time to stone clearance, colic attacks, need for analgesics and any side-effects at 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months. In total, 136 patients (67 in group 1 and 69 in group 2) were available for evaluation. The demographic profile was comparable in both groups. Group 1 had a clearance rate of 73% (49/67) versus 55% (38/69) in group 2 (p = 0.008). Time to stone clearance was significantly different at 1, 2 and 3 months (p = 0.02, 0.01 and 0.008, respectively), but not significant at 2 weeks (p = 0.52). In group 2, higher number of patients had more frequent attacks of colic and used more analgesics than in group 1 (p = 003, 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Nine patients (13.4%) in group 1 had ejaculatory dysfunction. Tamsulosin significantly increases stone clearance after SWL of renal stones. It decreases the pain and amount of analgesics needed, with a low rate of side-effects.

Environmental stress: approximate entropy approach revisited. Radiotelemetred male Wistar outbrad rats and Borderline Hypertensive rats (BHR) were exposed to acute and chronic environmental stress. Approximate entropy (ApEn) approach is applied in order to investigate the pulse interval (PI) response to two different types of environmental stress: shaker and restrain stress. The performance of ApEn method was evaluated from the parameter selection point of view. The purpose of the study is to quantify the complexity of response to stress and period of recovery after the stress in order to gain an insight in consequences of chronic stress exposure.

Hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B fiber column decreases clotting activity. We investigated whether hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was able to improve coagulation abnormalities in patients with sepsis. Sixteen patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection and a mean arterial blood pressure > or =65mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilution catheter was inserted prior to DHP-PMX for intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twice within 24 h for 3 h each time. Circulating levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), the TAT/PIC ratio, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured six times. Before DHP-PMX, the TAT level was 24.5 +/- 8.3 ng/mL, the PIC level was 2.5 +/- 1.1 microg/mL, the TAT/PIC ratio was 13.9 +/- 3.5, and the PAI-1 level was 143.0 +/- 24.4 ng/L. The TAT level, TAT/PIC ratio, and PAI-1 were all significantly lower (P < 0.05) after 48 hr compared with before DHP-PMX, but no significant change of PIC was observed. In these patients with sepsis, fibrinolysis was inhibited by PAI-1, whereas clotting activity was significantly increased. This coagulation/fibrinolysis imbalance was improved by DHP-PMX. The present results suggest that indirect inhibition of clotting activity can be achieved in patients with sepsis through adsorption of lipopolysaccharide by DHP-PMX.

3-BrPA eliminates human bladder cancer cells with highly oncogenic signatures via engagement of specific death programs and perturbation of multiple signaling and metabolic determinants. Urinary bladder cancer is one of the most fatal and expensive diseases of industrialized world. Despite the strenuous efforts, no seminal advances have been achieved for its clinical management. Given the importance of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cell survival and growth, we have herein employed 3-BrPA, a halogenated derivative of pyruvate and historically considered inhibitor of glycolysis, to eliminate bladder cancer cells with highly oncogenic molecular signatures. Bladder cancer cells were exposed to 3-BrPA in the absence or presence of several specific inhibitors. Cell viability was determined by MTT and flow-cytometry assays; cell death, signaling activity and metabolic integrity by Western blotting and immunofluorescence; mutant-gene profiling by DNA sequencing; and gene expression by RT-sqPCR. 3-BrPA could activate dose-dependent apoptosis (type 1 PCD) and regulated necrosis (type 3 PCD) of T24 (grade III; H-Ras(G12V); p53(ΔY126)), but not RT4 (grade I), cells, with PARP, MLKL, Drp1 and Nec-7-targeted components critically orchestrating necrotic death. However, similarly to RIPK1 and CypD, p53 presented with non-essential contribution to 3-BrPA-induced cellular collapse, while reactivation of mutant p53 with PRIMA-1 resulted in strong synergism of the two agents. Given the reduced expression of MPC components (likely imposing mitochondrial dysfunction) in T24 cells, the suppression of constitutive autophagy (required by cells carrying oncogenic Ras; also, type 2 PCD) and derangement of glucose-homeostasis determinants by 3-BrPA critically contribute to drug-directed depletion of ATP cellular stores. This bioenergetic crisis is translated to severe dysregulation of Akt/FoxO/GSK-3, mTOR/S6, AMPK and MAPK (p44/42, p38 and SAPK/JNK) signaling pathways in 3-BrPA-treated T24 cells. Sensitivity to 3-BrPA (and tolerance to glucose deprivation) does not rely on B-Raf(V600E) or K-Ras(G13D) mutant oncogenic proteins, but partly depends on aberrant signaling activities of Akt, MAPK and AMPK kinases. Interestingly, MCT1- and macropinocytosis-mediated influx of 3-BrPA in T24 represents the principal mechanism that regulates cellular responsiveness to the drug. Besides its capacity to affect transcription in gene-dependent manner, 3-BrPA can also induce GLUT4-specific splicing silencing in both sensitive and resistant cells, thus dictating alternative routes of drug trafficking. Altogether, it seems that 3-BrPA represents a promising agent for bladder cancer targeted therapy.

Improving diffraction by humidity control: a novel device compatible with X-ray beamlines. Dehydration of protein crystals is rarely used, despite being a post-crystallization method that is useful for the improvement of crystal diffraction properties, as it is difficult to reproduce and monitor. A novel device for hydration control of macromolecular crystals in a standard data-collection environment has been developed. The device delivers an air stream of precise relative humidity that can be used to alter the amount of water in macromolecular crystals. The device can be rapidly installed and is fully compatible with most standard synchrotron X-ray beamlines. Samples are mounted in cryoloops and the progress of dehydration can be monitored both optically and by the acquisition of diffraction images. Once the optimal hydration level has been obtained, cryocooling is easy to achieve by hand or by using a sample changer. The device has been thoroughly tested on several ESRF beamlines and is available to users.

Population attributable fractions and joint effects of key risk factors for multiple sclerosis. We examined the combined effect of having multiple key risk factors and the interactions between the key risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS). We performed an incident case-control study including cases with a first clinical diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination (FCD) and population-based controls. Compared to those without any risk factors, those with one, two, three, and four or five risk factors had increased odds of being an FCD case of 2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-4.03), 4.31 (95% CI, 2.24-8.31), 7.96 (95% CI, 3.84-16.49), and 21.24 (95% CI, 5.48-82.40), respectively. Only HLA-DR15 and history of infectious mononucleosis interacted significantly on the additive scale (Synergy index, 3.78; p = 0.03). The five key risk factors jointly accounted for 63.8% (95% CI, 43.9-91.4) of FCD onset. High anti-EBNA IgG was another important contributor. A high proportion of FCD onset can be explained by the currently known risk factors, with HLA-DR15, ever smoking and low cumulative sun exposure explaining most. We identified a significant interaction between HLA-DR15 and history of IM in predicting an FCD of CNS demyelination, which together with previous observations suggests that this is a true interaction.

A longitudinal study of kidney structure and function in adults. Although kidney size is commonly measured in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), its relationship with kidney function is poorly understood. We conducted this longitudinal study to better understand the relationship between kidney size and function. We retrospectively studied 178 kidneys measured by ultrasound in 93 patients with CKD who did not have autosomal polycystic kidney disease. Renal function was measured using estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A mixed model that accounted for repeated measurements or nested observations was used for statistical analysis. In cross-sectional analyses, the following independent variables emerged as predictors of kidney size: estimated GFR along with its squared term, height, age and interactions of each of these two independent variables with aetiology of CKD. In longitudinal analyses over a median follow-up of 3.7 years, after accounting for predictors of baseline kidney size such as aetiology, height and estimated GFR, we found that kidney atrophy occurred at a rate of 0.072 cm/year (SD 0.016, P = 0.007). This atrophy was 'blunted' with declining GFR. Each 1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year greater decline in eGFR abrogated kidney atrophy by 0.015 cm/year (P = 0.024). Although in cross-sectional surveys kidney size is directly related to function, the longitudinal relationship between form and function is inverted. Since the rate of change in GFR determines kidney atrophy, we conclude that kidney size is a determinant of renal prognosis.

[Vibrational physical exercises as the rehabilitation in gerontology]. Vibration biomechanical stimulation as the physiological basis of vibration physical exercises (whole body vibration) causes reflecting muscle contractions like tonic vibration reflex. This type of intervention leads to high intensive stimulation of proprioceptors as called muscle spindles which result in alteration in parameters of activity and developments of human physiological functions. This type of training has broad positive influence on organism. Acceleration physical exercises improve muscle performance, flexibility, nervous function, significantly increase bone mineral density, physiological secretion of anabolic hormones, growth and anti-aging factors; normalize/decrease cortisol as anti-stress effect and are beneficial for balance and mobility as well. It is showed acceleration training caused by vibration stimulus is beneficial for people suffering from osteoporosis and obesity, for rehabilitation of nervous and motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke.

Antiviral treatment of recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation: predictors of response and long-term outcome.

Blinded sample size recalculation for clinical trials with normal data and baseline adjusted analysis. Baseline adjusted analyses are commonly encountered in practice, and regulatory guidelines endorse this practice. Sample size calculations for this kind of analyses require knowledge of the magnitude of nuisance parameters that are usually not given when the results of clinical trials are reported in the literature. It is therefore quite natural to start with a preliminary calculated sample size based on the sparse information available in the planning phase and to re-estimate the value of the nuisance parameters (and with it the sample size) when a portion of the planned number of patients have completed the study. We investigate the characteristics of this internal pilot study design when an analysis of covariance with normally distributed outcome and one random covariate is applied. For this purpose we first assess the accuracy of four approximate sample size formulae within the fixed sample size design. Then the performance of the recalculation procedure with respect to its actual Type I error rate and power characteristics is examined. The results of simulation studies show that this approach has favorable properties with respect to the Type I error rate and power. Together with its simplicity, these features should make it attractive for practical application.


Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, substrate transporter translocation, and metabolism in the contracting hyperthyroid rat heart.

An 8-channel skin impedance measurement system for acupuncture research. An 8-channel skin impedance measurement system for acupuncture research has been developed. The underlying model of the skin used is a parallel R & C network. Pulses are used to measure the R and C values. The measurement circuit is time multiplexed across the 8 channels at the rate of 2 measurements per second, leading to a complete set of measurements every 4 seconds. In static tests, the system has been operational for over 2 days of continuous measurements. In preliminary human tests, measurements over 2 hours have been collected per subject.

Particular features of systolic and diastolic functions in patients with metabolic syndrome. In many epidemiological studies, the relationship between metabolic syndrome and the development of congestive heart failure has been established. Due to the latter, an increased interest has been noticed in scientific studies about the changes in the function of the heart in patients with metabolic syndrome and possible disturbance mechanisms of the pumping function of the heart in this group of patients. In our research, 120 patients with metabolic syndrome and 20 health individuals were studied. The cardiac functions were assessed with the ultrasound imaging machine "Aloka SSD 5000" (Japan) convex sensor of frequency 3.5 MHz with generally used methods. In the course of the experiment, in patients with MS, concentric hypertrophy of the heart and disturbance of the diastolic function of the heart was noticed. Also it was set that there was a significant correlation between the indexes, which in a superlative degree demonstrate abdominal obesity (WHR) and the indexes of LV hypertrophy during diastole (r = 0.72; P < 0.001), LVM (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and LA (r = 0.63; P < 0.001).

Optimization of xylanase production by Thermomyces lanuginosus in solid state fermentation. Extracellular xylanase production by the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus 195 in solid state fermentation (SSF) was found to be significantly affected by fermentation temperature, duration, and inoculum volume (p < or = 0.001). Optimization of these parameters corresponded to a 21.7% increase in xylanase yield. Maximum activity (2,335 U/g of wheat bran) was obtained when 10 g of wheat bran was inoculated with 10 ml of liquid culture and cultivated at 45 degrees C for 40 h. The influence of supplemental carbon and nitrogen sources (3% w/v) on xylanase production was also assessed. Wheat bran, supplemented with glucose and cellulose, facilitated 10% and 7% increases in relative activity respectively. Ammonium based salts, nitrates, and a number of organic nitrogen sources served only to reduce xylanase production (p < or = 0.005) significantly. The enhanced xylanase titers achieved in the present study emphasize the need for optimizing growth conditions for maximum enzyme production in SSF.

Cell adhesion and EGFR activation regulate EphA2 expression in cancer. EphA2 is frequently overexpressed in cancer, and increasing amounts of evidence show that EphA2 contributes to multiple aspects of the malignant character including angiogenesis and metastasis. Several aspects of the regulation and functional significance of EphA2 expression in cancer are still largely unknown. Here we show that the expression of EphA2 in in vitro cultured cells, is restricted to cells growing adherently and that adhesion-induced EphA2 expression is dependent upon activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and Src family kinases (SRC). Moreover, the results show that adhesion-induced EGFR activation and EphA2 expression is affected by interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins working as integrin ligands. Stimulation with the EphA2 ligand, ephrinA1 inhibited ERK phosphorylation and cancer cell viability. These effects were however abolished by activation of the EGF-receptor ligand system favoring Ras/MAPK signaling and cell proliferation. Based on our results, we propose a regulatory mechanism where cell adhesion induces EGFR kinase activation and EphA2 expression; and where the effect of ephrinA1 mediated reduction in cell viability by inhibiting EphA2 expression is overruled by activated EGFR in human cancer cells.

Modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 release by berberine: in vivo and in vitro studies. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic gut hormone released from intestinal L cells. Our previous studies showed that berberine increased GLP-1 secretion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether berberine affected GLP-1 release in normal rats and in NCI-H716 cells. Proglucagon and prohormone convertase 3 genes regulating GLP-1 biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-PCR. Effects of pharmacological inhibitors on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release were studied. In vivo, 5-week treatment of berberine enhanced GLP-1 secretion induced by glucose load and promoted proglucagon mRNA expression as well as L cell proliferation in intestine. In vitro, berberine concentration-dependently stimulated GLP-1 release in NCI-H716 cells. Berberine also promoted both prohormone convertase 3 and proglucagon mRNA expression. Chelerythrine (inhibitor of PKC) concentration-dependently suppressed berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. Compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) also inhibited berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. But only low concentrations of H89 (inhibitor of PKA) showed inhibitory effects on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release. The present results demonstrated that berberine showed its modulation on GLP-1 via promoting GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 biosynthesis. Some signal pathways including PKC-dependent pathway were involved in this process. Elucidation of mechanisms controlling berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion may facilitate the understanding of berberine's antidiabetic effects.

Notes on the history of the Dr. Senckenbergische Anatomie in Frankfurt/Main. Part II. The Dr. Senckenbergische Anatomie during the Third Reich and its body supply. In order to be able to understand how body supply was maintained at the Dr. Senckenbergische Anatomie from 1933 to 1945 - with special emphasis on victims of the National Socialist regime - we have collected information from various and often fragmentary sources. The documents reveal that during this period at least 474 bodies were brought to the anatomical institute. Among them were the bodies of at least 71 prisoners, 51 of whom had been executed, and the bodies of 8 inmates of (labor-) camps. 356 unclaimed bodies were received, some of them may stem from victims of "euthanasia" programs. The sources of 39, as of yet, unnamed bodies could not be verified. The current collections and the catalogs were screened for remains of victims of the National Socialist regime, but none were found. The vast majority of the bodies were used for teaching purposes. Hans Schreiber, one of the directors of the institute, whose biography is provided here, used at least 9 additional executed individuals for his research. Wherever possible, we have identified the victims of the National Socialist regime, executed persons and the inmates of (labor-) camps, whose bodies were used by the anatomists in Frankfurt, by name. Among the victims was Georg Fröba, a communist philanthropist, whose biography is provided. 

Evidence of gray matter reduction and dysfunction in chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with cognitive deficits and morphometric brain abnormalities in childhood and a markedly elevated risk of schizophrenia in adolescence/early adulthood. Determining the relationship between neurocognition and neuroimaging findings would yield crucial information about childhood neurodevelopment and provide a basis for the study of the trajectory that occurs on the pathway to psychosis. We compared morphometric brain findings between non-psychotic children with 22q11DS (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 16), and examined the association between neurocognitive functioning and morphometric brain findings. Volumetric regional gray matter differences between the 22q11DS and control subjects were measured, and correlations of the regional gray matter volumes and neurocognition were performed. Children with 22q11DS demonstrated reductions in gray matter in several brain regions, chiefly the frontal cortices, the cingulate gyrus and the cerebellum. The volumetric reductions in these salient areas were associated with poor performance in sustained attention, executive function and verbal memory; however, the relation of brain volume with cognitive performance did not differ between the patient and control groups. Thus, children with 22q11DS demonstrate gray matter reductions in multiple brain regions that are thought to be relevant to schizophrenia. The correlation of these volumetric reductions with poor neurocognition indicates that these brain regions may mediate higher neurocognitive functions implicated in schizophrenia.

Visual annotation of the gene database. The genes in NCBI databases are currently annotated with itemized text (Gene Reference Into Function, or GeneRIF). A previous work suggests that the visual presentation can be more effective when time and space are under heavy constraints. Here we report a novel annotation of the genome information using Web 2.0 technologies: GeneGIF (Gene Graphics Into Function). The users can quickly scan through important functions of each gene from a graph, and then go to detailed pages when they find interesting annotations. The modular implementation makes it easily pluggable into other widely used databases without reprogramming. Similar approaches are being developed to incorporate information to other types of genomics and proteomics databases.

Current trends in the clinical development of peptide therapeutics. The development of peptides as drugs is attracting increasing attention from the pharmaceutical industry. This interest is at least partially a consequence of the widespread acceptance of therapeutic proteins by physicians and patients, and because of improvements to problems such as a short half-life and delivery issues. The markets for peptide-based compounds can be substantial, with six peptide drugs attaining global sales of more than US $750 million in 2008. To track trends in the clinical development and marketing approval of peptides, Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development and Ferring Research Institute compiled publically available data for peptides that entered clinical trials sponsored by commercial firms, with a focus on peptide therapeutics, but also including peptide vaccines and diagnostics. The results provide an historical overview of the development of peptide therapeutics, and may inform strategic planning in this area.

Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B56α limits phosphatase activity in the heart. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine-selective holoenzyme composed of a catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory subunit. In the heart, PP2A activity is requisite for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and central in adrenergic signaling. We found that mice deficient in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56α (1 of 13 regulatory subunits) had altered PP2A signaling in the heart that was associated with changes in cardiac physiology, suggesting that the B56α regulatory subunit had an autoinhibitory role that suppressed excess PP2A activity. The increase in PP2A activity in the mice with reduced B56α expression resulted in slower heart rates and increased heart rate variability, conduction defects, and increased sensitivity of heart rate to parasympathetic agonists. Increased PP2A activity in B56α(+/-) myocytes resulted in reduced Ca(2+) waves and sparks, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation (and thus decreased activation) of the ryanodine receptor RyR2, an ion channel on intracellular membranes that is involved in Ca(2+) regulation in cardiomyocytes. In line with an autoinhibitory role for B56α, in vivo expression of B56α in the absence of altered abundance of other PP2A subunits decreased basal phosphatase activity. Consequently, in vivo expression of B56α suppressed parasympathetic regulation of heart rate and increased RyR2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. These data show that an integral component of the PP2A holoenzyme has an important inhibitory role in controlling PP2A enzyme activity in the heart.

[Neutrophil bactericidal and absorptive function in gout]. To study neutrophil bacterial and absorptive functions and the specific features of their impairments in gout. The study included 48 male patients with a valid diagnosis of gout (mean age, 59.7 +/- 10.3 years; duration of the disease, 9.2 +/- 2.1 years; blood uric acid (UA), 520 +/- 80 micromol) (Group 1); 25 apparently healthy volunteers (mean age 55.1 +/- 6.2 years; blood UA, 350 micromol/l) (Group 2). Neutrophil functional activity was estimated from the phagocytic-nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NBT test) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the determination of non-enzyme cationic proteins (CP) and their spontaneous and induced indices. Neutrophil phagocytic function was also studied. In Group 1, the content of active oxygen forms (AOF) was increased, on average, to 113.3 +/- 8.65 conventional units (CI) versus 88.22 +/- 5.23 CI in Group 2; p < 0.05). In 34 (70.8%) of the 48 male patients with gout, spontaneous MPO activity was significantly reduced as compared with that in Group 2: 348.4 +/- 13.6 and 509.2 +/- 12.2 CI, respectively (p < 0.01). In Group 1, the level of CP was noticeably decreased to 60.1 +/- 2.06 CI whereas in Group 2, it was 84.91 +/- 5.36 CI (p < 0.05). In gouty patients, the CP stimulation index averaged 0.70 +/- 0.13; in Group 2, it was significantly higher--1.2 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.05). In the majority of gouty patients, neutrophil functional activity suffers due to its lower phagocytic function, which suppresses the body's antioxidant defense and contributes to the chronic pattern of an inflammatory process.

Commentary: mechanistic considerations for associations between formaldehyde exposure and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Occupational exposure to formaldehyde has been linked to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To date, mechanistic explanations for this association have primarily focused on formaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity, regenerative hyperplasia and DNA damage. However, recent studies broaden the potential mechanisms as it is now well established that formaldehyde dehydrogenase, identical to S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, is an important mediator of cGMP-independent nitric oxide signaling pathways. We have previously described mechanisms by which formaldehyde can influence nitrosothiol homeostasis thereby leading to changes in pulmonary physiology. Considering evidences that nitrosothiols govern the Epstein-Barr virus infection cycle, and that the virus is strongly implicated in the etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, studies are needed to examine the potential for formaldehyde to reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus as well as additively or synergistically interact with the virus to potentiate epithelial cell transformation.

What did domestication do to dogs? A new account of dogs' sensitivity to human actions. Over the last two decades increasing evidence for an acute sensitivity to human gestures and attentional states in domestic dogs has led to a burgeoning of research into the social cognition of this highly familiar yet previously under-studied animal. Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have been shown to be more successful than their closest relative (and wild progenitor) the wolf, and than man's closest relative, the chimpanzee, on tests of sensitivity to human social cues, such as following points to a container holding hidden food. The "Domestication Hypothesis" asserts that during domestication dogs evolved an inherent sensitivity to human gestures that their non-domesticated counterparts do not share. According to this view, sensitivity to human cues is present in dogs at an early age and shows little evidence of acquisition during ontogeny. A closer look at the findings of research on canine domestication, socialization, and conditioning, brings the assumptions of this hypothesis into question. We propose the Two Stage Hypothesis, according to which the sensitivity of an individual animal to human actions depends on acceptance of humans as social companions, and conditioning to follow human limbs. This offers a more parsimonious explanation for the domestic dog's sensitivity to human gestures, without requiring the use of additional mechanisms. We outline how tests of this new hypothesis open directions for future study that offer promise of a deeper understanding of mankind's oldest companion.

[Realization of algorithm on finishing optimization-tool-path generation for high-speed machining molar crown]. Molar crown is very small and has not only thin-wall, but also complex profile, especially, the occlusal surface of each molar crown has many cusps, ridges and fossae being differently distributed. When conventional processing method is used, it is impossible to machine molar prosthesis rapidly and exactly. To enhance machining velocity and improve the surface precision of molar crown, an algorithm of entity rapid offset-based STL format is put forward. By the application of Zigzag toolpath planning and micro-machining cutter, the finishing toolpaths for high speed milling molar prosthesis are generated. In terms of Mikron UCP800 high-speed machine center, the molar all-crown made of alloy aluminum material is successfully machined. The test results show that the algorithm of tool-path generation works fast, the number of toolpaths is small, and the cutter feeds smoothly.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor inhibits lysosomal degradation of Bcl-xL and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) has several biological actions on tumor cells, but its effects are cell-type dependent. The aim of this study was to examine the pathophysiological role of PEDF in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PEDF expression was examined in various hepatoma cell lines and human HCC tissues, and was seen in various hepatoma cell lines including HepG2 cells. In human HCC tissues, PEDF expression was higher than in adjacent non-HCC tissues. In addition, serum PEDF levels were higher in HCC patients than in non-HCC patients, and curative treatment of HCC caused significant reductions in serum PEDF levels compared with pretreatment levels. In vitro experiments, camptothecin (CPT) was used to induce apoptosis and the effect of PEDF was investigated by knockdown of the PEDF gene in CPT-treated HepG2 cells. Knockdown of the PEDF gene enhanced CPT-induced apoptosis, simultaneously down-regulating Bcl-xL expression in HepG2 cells. Expression of apoptosis-related molecules and effects of bafilomycin A1 on CPT-induced apoptosis were also examined in PEDF gene knockdown HepG2 cells. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 suppressed CPT-induced decreases in Bcl-xL expression and increases in apoptosis in PEDF gene knockdown HepG2 cells. PEDF may, therefore, exert anti-apoptotic effects through inhibition of lysosomal degradation of Bcl-xL in CPT-treated HepG2 cells.

Economic burden of sexually transmitted infections: incidence and direct medical cost of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among Illinois adolescents and young adults, 2005-2006. Local assessment of sexually transmitted infections (STI) magnitude and economic burden can aid in targeting resources and prevention programs. Reported cases of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary syphilis (obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health) were used to estimate the number of incident cases among persons aged 15 to 24 years, accounting for the proportion of undiagnosed and unreported cases, and sexually active population. STI costs were obtained from the published literature, and multiplied by the estimated incident cases of STIs in 2005 and 2006 to determine direct medical costs of incident infections. Incident rates per 100,000 population and costs in 2007 US dollars are estimated by age, gender, race, and county. Chlamydia incidence and cost were estimated at 5030 infections per 100,000 population and $27,576,686 in 2005, and 5259 infections per 100,000 population and $28,779,734 in 2006. Gonorrhea incidence and cost were estimated at 1740 infections per 100,000 population and $7,698,135 in 2005, and 1704 infections per 100,000 population and $7,546,500 in 2006. Syphilis incidence and cost were estimated at 9.4 per 100,000 and $59,940 in 2005, and 10.4 per 100,000 population and $66,333 in 2006. Incidence and costs of all STIs were highest among women and blacks. Ten counties accounted for >80% of the estimated statewide morbidity and costs. Estimates of STI incidence and costs are conservative, yet represent a significant economic burden in Illinois. Focusing prevention efforts on locales with the highest STI rates may maximize effectiveness in terms of disease prevention and cost reduction.

Elemental Analysis of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) Teeth Using X-ray Fluorescence and a Comparison to Other Species. Elemental composition in bone of the different species has variation depending on genetic and environmental factors especially their food habitat. The aims of this study were to conduct an elemental analysis of Asian elephant teeth, both deciduous (first molar, second molar, and tusk) and permanent (molar and tusk), and compare the elemental composition of permanent teeth among 15 species, mostly mammalian. These teeth were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence at two voltages: 15 and 50 kV. In Asian elephants, deciduous tusk showed a lower Ca/Zn ratio compared to permanent tusk, because of the lack of Zn in permanent molars. Ca/Fe ratio was higher in deciduous than permanent molars. For permanent teeth, elephant molars presented a high Ca/Pb ratio but no Ca/Zn, Ca/Sr, and Zn/Fe ratios because of the lack of Zn and Sr in the samples tested. The key elemental ratios for differentiating elephant deciduous and permanent tusk were Ca/P and Ca/Zn. The considerable variation in elemental ratio data across 15 species was observed. All tooth samples contained Ca and P, which was not surprising; however, Pb also was present in all samples and Cd in a large majority, suggesting exposure to environmental contaminants. From discriminant analysis, the combination of Ca/P+Ca/Zn+Ca/Pb+Ca/Fe+Ca/Sr+Zn/Fe can generate two equations that successfully classified six (dog, pig, goat, tapir, monkey, and elephant) out of 15 species at 100 % specificity. In conclusion, determining the elemental profile of teeth may serve as a tool to identify the tooth "type" of elephants and to potentially classify other species. 

Response-dependent contributions of human primary motor cortex and angular gyrus to manual and perceptual sequence learning. Motor sequence learning on the serial reaction time task involves the integration of response-, stimulus-, and effector-based information. Human primary motor cortex (M1) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) have been identified with supporting the learning of effector-dependent and -independent information, respectively. Current neurocognitive data are, however, exclusively based on learning complex sequence information via perceptual-motor responses. Here, we investigated the effects of continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS)-induced disruption of M1 and the angular gyrus (AG) of the IPL on learning a probabilistic sequence via sequential perceptual-motor responses (experiment 1) or covert orienting of visuospatial attention (experiment 2). Functional effects on manual sequence learning were evident during 75% of training trials in the cTBS M1 condition, whereas cTBS over the AG resulted in interference confined to a midpoint during the training phase. Posttraining direct (declarative) tests of sequence knowledge revealed that cTBS over M1 modulated the availability of newly acquired sequence knowledge, whereby sequence knowledge was implicit in the cTBS M1 condition but was available to conscious awareness in the cTBS AG and control conditions. In contrast, perceptual sequence learning was abolished in the perceptual cTBS AG condition, whereas learning was intact and available to conscious awareness in the cTBS M1 and control conditions. These results show that the right AG had a critical role in perceptual sequence learning, whereas M1 had a causal role in developing experience-dependent functional attributes relevant to conscious knowledge on manual but not perceptual sequence learning.

Influenza-associated cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited respiratory disease, the burden of influenza among individuals with CF is not well characterized. We used the CF Foundation Patient Registry to determine the relationship between pulmonary exacerbation incidence rate and influenza virus season from July 2003 through June 2007. The outcome of interest, pulmonary exacerbation, was defined as treatment of a respiratory illness with IV antibiotics. Each influenza season was defined as all months during which >/= 15% of laboratory tests for influenza virus were positive in the US influenza virologic surveillance system. We calculated incidence rates of pulmonary exacerbation during the influenza and summertime seasons as well as relative rates with 95% CIs. A multivariate regression model adjusted for demographic and clinical predictors. In 2003, the patient cohort size was 21,506 patients, and 7,727 patients experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation. The overall pulmonary exacerbation incidence rate in the influenza season was 595.0 per 10,000 person-months compared with a summertime baseline of 549.6 per 10,000 person-months. The incidence rate ratio was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.10). Multivariate analysis did not change our estimate of risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.10). An estimated annual excess of 147.6 per 10,000 person-months or an excess 2.1% of total exacerbations occur during the influenza season. Our data demonstrate a substantial contribution of the influenza season to CF morbidity. Further studies to determine any causal link between influenza infection and CF pulmonary exacerbations are necessary.

Delayed correlation of mRNA and protein expression in rapamycin-treated cells and a role for Ggc1 in cellular sensitivity to rapamycin. To identify new molecular targets of rapamycin, an anticancer and immunosuppressive drug, we analyzed temporal changes in yeast over 6 h in response to rapamycin at the transcriptome and proteome levels and integrated the expression patterns with functional profiling. We show that the integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional data sets provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of rapamycin action. We first observed a temporal delay in the correlation of mRNA and protein expression where mRNA expression at 1 and 2 h correlated best with protein expression changes after 6 h of rapamycin treatment. This was especially the case for the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and induction of heat shock and autophagy essential to promote the cellular sensitivity to rapamycin. However, increased levels of vacuolar protease could enhance resistance to rapamycin. Of the 85 proteins identified as statistically significantly changing in abundance, most of the proteins that decreased in abundance were correlated with a decrease in mRNA expression. However, of the 56 proteins increasing in abundance, 26 were not correlated with an increase in mRNA expression. These protein changes were correlated with unchanged or down-regulated mRNA expression. These proteins, involved in mitochondrial genome maintenance, endocytosis, or drug export, represent new candidates effecting rapamycin action whose expression might be post-transcriptionally or post-translationally regulated. We identified GGC1, a mitochondrial GTP/GDP carrier, as a new component of the rapamycin/target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. We determined that the protein product of GGC1 was stabilized in the presence of rapamycin, and the deletion of the GGC1 enhanced growth fitness in the presence of rapamycin. A dynamic mRNA expression analysis of Deltaggc1 and wild-type cells treated with rapamycin revealed a key role for Ggc1p in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle progression under TOR control.

Developmental phonagnosia: Neural correlates and a behavioral marker. A 20-year old female, AN, with no history of neurological events or detectable lesions, was markedly poorer than controls at identifying her most familiar celebrity voices. She was normal at face recognition and in discriminating which of two speakers uttered a particular sentence. She evidences normal fMRI sensitivity for human speech and non-speech sounds. AN, and two other phonagnosics, were unable to imagine the voices of highly familiar individuals. A region in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was differentially activated in controls when imagining familiar celebrity voices compared to imagining non-voice sounds. AN evidenced no differential activation in this area, which has been termed a person identity semantic system. Rather than a deficit in the representation of voice-individuating cues, AN may be unable to associate those cues to the identity of a familiar person. In this respect, the deficit in developmental phonagnosia may bear a striking parallel to developmental prosopagnosia. 

Auditing the diagnosis of cancer in primary care: the experience in Scotland. This paper reports on an ongoing primary care audit of cancer referrals undertaken in Scotland in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. General practitioners (GPs) in Scotland were asked to review all new cancer diagnoses within their practice during the preceding year. 4181 patients were identified in year 1 and 12 294 in year 2. The pathway taken for patients to present to, and be referred from, their GP has been analysed for 7430 of the 12 294 patients identified within year 2 across five separate health boards. The time from first symptoms to presentation to a GP varied between tumour types, being the longest (median 30 days) for head and neck cancers and the shortest (median 2 days) for bladder cancer. In all, 25% of patients within the following tumour groups waited longer than 2 months to present to their GP following first symptoms: prostate, colorectal, melanoma and head and neck cancers. Once patients had presented to their GP, those with prostate and lung cancer were referred later (median time 11 days) than those with breast cancer (median time 2 days). The priority with which GPs referred patients varied considerably between tumour groups (breast cancer 77.5% 'urgent' compared with prostate cancer 44.7% 'urgent'). In one health board the proportion of cancer patients being referred urgently increased from 46% to 58% between the first and second audit. Our data show that there are very different patterns of presentation and referral for patients with cancer, with some tumour groups being more likely to be associated with a delayed diagnosis than others.

Nano-scale control of cellular environment to drive embryonic stem cells selfrenewal and fate. Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are pluripotent cells capable to give rise to any embryonic cell lineage. In culture, these cells form colonies creating their own niche. Depending upon the molecular and physico-chemical environment, the pluripotent cells oscillate between two metastable states of pluripotency either reminiscent of the inner cell mass of the embryo or the epiblast, a stage of development which give rise to the three embryonic layers, ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. Herein, we used PLL/HA nanofilms cross-linked to various degrees to modulate the nanoenvironment of ESCs. Adhesion of ESC on nanofilms increased from native films to highly cross-linked films. The adhesion process was associated with cell proliferation. Expression of genes markers of the ICM decreased with adhesion of cells to cross-linked films. In parallel, genes more reminiscent of the epiblast, were turned on. ESC differentiation within embryoid bodies further revealed that cell pluripotency was better retained when cells did not adhere on native films. We further report that both the stiffness and the chemistry of nanofilms play a key role in modulating the niche of ESC and in turn govern their selfrenewal and fate.

Proteins from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed as a natural coagulant for potential application in water turbidity removal. The ability of coagulation active proteins from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed for the removal of water turbidity was studied. Partial purification of protein coagulant was performed by precipitation with ammonium sulphate, dialysis and anion exchange chromatography. Adsorption parameters for ion-exchange process were established using dialysate extract. Results revealed that the highest values of the adsorbed protein were achieved in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0.51 mg protein/mL matrix. Partially purified coagulant at initial turbidity 35 NTU expressed the highest value of coagulation activity, 72.3%, which was almost 22 times higher than those obtained by crude extract considering applied dosages. At the same time, the increase in organic matter that remained in water after coagulation with purified protein coagulant was more than 16 times lower than those with crude extract, relatively to its content in blank.

Organ donation workshop - a survey on nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward organ and tissue donation in Iran. Despite increasing transplantation in Iran, organ shortage and long waiting lists remain major problems in the country. Many publications have demonstrated that the willingness of healthcare professionals to participate in the donation process can improve the donation rate. Since nurses are usually the first people among the healthcare staff to recognize a patient as a potential donor, they have an important role in the procurement of organ and tissue from cadaveric donors. Our objectives were to survey nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward organ and tissue donation and to examine the effect of having them attend a workshop on organ donation. A 39-item questionnaire was completed by 66 nurses, before and after participation in a 1-day organ donation workshop that was held at the Iranian Tissue Bank (in Tehran, Iran). The questionnaire contained demographic data, 29 questions regarding knowledge, and 8 questions on attitudes toward organ and tissue donation. 69.7% women and 30.3% men participated in this study. The mean score for knowledge was 16.89 (SD= 3.33) before and 23.76 (SD=1.66) after the workshop (p=0.000). The mean attitudes score was 4.76 (SD=1.71) before and 5.08 (SD=1.34) after the workshop (p=0.235). Although 63.63% claimed they were willing to have a donation card only 15.15% actually carried one. This study demonstrated that educational programs can enhance nurses' knowledge and commitment to the organ donation process and, ultimately, increase the donation rate. Consequently, it is of great importance for organ procurement units to focus on regular training programs for all their healthcare staff.

Basigin is a druggable target for host-oriented antimalarial interventions. Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite responsible for the most lethal form of malaria, an infectious disease that causes a large proportion of childhood deaths and poses a significant barrier to socioeconomic development in many countries. Although antimalarial drugs exist, the repeated emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites limit their useful lifespan. An alternative strategy that could limit the evolution of drug-resistant parasites is to target host factors that are essential and universally required for parasite growth. Host-targeted therapeutics have been successfully applied in other infectious diseases but have never been attempted for malaria. Here, we report the development of a recombinant chimeric antibody (Ab-1) against basigin, an erythrocyte receptor necessary for parasite invasion as a putative antimalarial therapeutic. Ab-1 inhibited the PfRH5-basigin interaction and potently blocked erythrocyte invasion by all parasite strains tested. Importantly, Ab-1 rapidly cleared an established P. falciparum blood-stage infection with no overt toxicity in an in vivo infection model. Collectively, our data demonstrate that antibodies or other therapeutics targeting host basigin could be an effective treatment for patients infected with multi-drug resistant P. falciparum.

Reasonable duration of Clopidogrel use after drug-eluting stent implantation in Korean patients. Current guidelines recommend that clopidogrel be given to patients for 12 months after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. However, the evidence is insufficient to support the benefit of long-term clopidogrel therapy, especially in Asian patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether different durations of clopidogrel use might influence long-term outcomes after DES implantation. A total of 844 patients from 4 medical centers in Korea who had undergone successful DES implantation from November 2004 to April 2006 were enrolled. Patients who were event free at 6-month follow-up were divided into 2 groups by clopidogrel use (575 users, 163 nonusers) and followed. The end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. During 1,056.4 patient-years of follow-up (median 2.02), there were 7 deaths, 3 myocardial infarctions, and 2 episodes of stent thrombosis. No significant differences in the primary end point were observed between clopidogrel users and nonusers (cumulative incidence 2.9% vs 2.8%, p = 0.578; adjusted hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 2.77). In analysis with time-dependent covariates, the incidence rates of the primary end point during observation periods with and without clopidogrel were similar, although the effect estimates were broad (9.9 with and 10.6 without clopidogrel per 1,000 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 3.17). Interestingly, the effect estimates from propensity score analyses, although they also had wide confidence intervals, were closer to the null than those from conventional Cox analyses. In conclusion, this cohort of Korean patients failed to show an absolute benefit of long-term clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation. The benefit of clopidogrel use beyond 6 months after DES implantation remains uncertain, and hence the decision to use long-term dual-antiplatelet therapy should be based on the risk factors of each patient.

Transition to adult services for children and young people with palliative care needs: a systematic review. To evaluate the evidence on the transition process from child to adult services for young people with palliative care needs. Systematic review. Child and adult services and interface between healthcare providers. Young people aged 13-24 years with palliative care conditions in the process of transition. Young people and their families' experiences of transition, the process of transition between services and its impact on continuity of care and models of good practice. 92 studies included. Papers on transition services were of variable quality when applied to palliative care contexts. Most focussed on common life-threatening and life-limiting conditions. No standardised transition program identified and most guidelines used to develop transition services were not evidence-based. Most studies on transition programs were predominantly condition-specific (eg, cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer) services. CF services offered high-quality transition with the most robust empirical evaluation. There were differing condition-dependent viewpoints on when transition should occur but agreement on major principles guiding transition planning and probable barriers. There was evidence of poor continuity between child and adult providers with most originating from within child settings. Palliative care was not, in itself, a useful concept for locating transition-related evidence. It is not possible to evaluate the merits of the various transition models for palliative care contexts, or their effects on continuity of care, as there are no long-term outcome data to measure their effectiveness. Use of validated outcome measures would facilitate research and service development.

What can isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments tell us about the self-organization of surfactants into micelles? The aim of the present review is to give a concise analysis of the thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) experiments for the characterization of the self-organization of surfactants into micelles. This review is also focused on works describing some methods allowing to overcome ITC limitation and to extract accurate thermodynamic values from ITC data.

Digitally-bypassed transducers: interfacing digital mockups to real-time medical equipment. Medical device software is sometimes initially developed by using a PC simulation environment that executes models of both the device and a physiological system, and then later by connecting the actual medical device to a physical mockup of the physiological system. An alternative is to connect the medical device to a digital mockup of the physiological system, such that the device believes it is interacting with a physiological system, but in fact all interaction is entirely digital. Developing medical device software by interfacing with a digital mockup enables development without costly or dangerous physical mockups, and enables execution that is faster or slower than real time. We introduce digitally-bypassed transducers, which involve a small amount of hardware and software additions, and which enable interfacing with digital mockups.

The efficacy of safety barriers for children: absolute efficacy, time to cross and action modes in children between 19 and 75 months. We examined the efficacy of safety barriers by testing their capabilities to prevent or delay crossing. Children between 19 and 75 months tried to climb different barriers selected for their age group, which represented the most common types of panel and horizontal bars barriers available on the market. Success or failure in crossing, time to cross and crossing techniques were analysed. Barrier characteristics' influenced its restraining efficacy. Children's success rate varied between 10% and 95.3%. None of the barriers assured a considerable protective delay. Three major action modes were identified: head over waist (HOW), head and waist (HAW) and head under waist (HUW). Generally, children adopted the safer action mode, HOW, to cross most barriers. Younger children often adopted unstable action mode in barriers with crossable gaps. Although some standards might need to be re-evaluated, there are no childproof barriers. Barriers are time-delaying devices that cannot substitute supervision and education.


Concordance between side-stream end-tidal carbon dioxide and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure in respiratory service setting.

Combined resistance and aerobic exercise program reverses muscle loss in men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for prostate cancer without bone metastases: a randomized controlled trial. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) results in musculoskeletal toxicity that reduces physical function and quality of life. This study examined the impact of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program as a countermeasure to these AST-related toxicities. Between 2007 and 2008, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing AST (commenced > 2 months prior) were randomly assigned to a program of resistance and aerobic exercise (n = 29) or usual care (n = 28) for 12 weeks. Primary end points were whole body and regional lean mass. Secondary end points were muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory capacity, blood biomarkers, and quality of life. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Patients undergoing exercise showed an increase in lean mass compared with usual care (total body, P = .047; upper limb, P < .001; lower limb, P = .019) and similarly better muscle strength (P < .01), 6-meter walk time (P = .024), and 6-meter backward walk time (P = .039). Exercise also improved several aspects of quality of life including general health (P = .022) and reduced fatigue (P = .021) and decreased levels of C-reactive protein (P = .008). There were no adverse events during the testing or exercise intervention program. A relatively brief exposure to exercise significantly improved muscle mass, strength, physical function, and balance in hypogonadal men compared with normal care. The exercise regimen was well tolerated and could be recommended for patients undergoing AST as an effective countermeasure to these common treatment-related adverse effects.


A new strategy for online adaptive prostate radiotherapy based on cone-beam CT.

Case report: soft tissue metastasis from immature teratoma of the testis: second case report and review of the literature. Testicular cancer, like other histopathologic types, commonly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, and brain. Spread to soft tissue, however, is rare with only four cases with seminoma reported. However, one case with metastasis of testicular immature teratoma to soft tissue was documented previously. We report the case of a 38-year-old man with recurrent immature teratoma of the testis who presented with a painless soft tissue mass in the left thigh previously treated with standard chemotherapy. After removal of the soft tissue mass, his serum alpha-fetoprotein level had returned to the normal range. To our knowledge, this is the second case of immature teratoma of the testis metastasized to soft tissue. We suggest that for a man with testicular cancer who has a soft tissue mass, metastasis of soft tissue from testicular cancer and other solid malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a soft tissue mass together with primary soft tissue sarcoma.

Neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with unilateral or bilateral periventricular hemorrhagic infarction. Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI) is a major contributing factor to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. We hypothesized that surviving infants with unilateral PVHI would have more favorable outcomes than those with bilateral PVHI. This was a multicenter, retrospective study of infants who were admitted to 3 NICUs in North Carolina from 1998 to 2004. The clinical course and late neuroimaging studies and neurodevelopmental outcomes of 69 infants who weighed <1500 g and had confirmed PVHI on early cranial ultrasonography were reviewed. A predictive model for Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, Mental Developmental Index (MDI) <70 was constructed by using radiologic and clinical variables. Infants with unilateral PVHI had higher median MDI (82 vs 49) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (53 vs 49) than infants with bilateral PVHI. Infants with unilateral PVHI were less likely to have severe cerebral palsy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.45]) than infants with bilateral PVHI. Infants who had unilateral PVHI and developed periventricular leukomalacia and retinopathy of prematurity that required surgery had an increased probability of having MDI <70 compared with those without these complications (probability of MDI <70: 89% [95% CI: 0.64-1.00] vs 11% [95% CI: 0.01-0.28]). Infants with unilateral PVHI had better motor and cognitive outcomes than infants with bilateral PVHI. By combining laterality of PVHI, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity it is possible to estimate the probability of having an MDI <70, which will assist clinicians when counseling families.

Electrocardiographic and other clinical correlates of walking ability in older women. The purpose of this study was to examine how resting electrocardiographic (ECG) and other clinical variables, which can be included in a routine clinical examination, predict walking ability in older women. Three hundred and twenty women (63-75 years) without overt cardiac diseases and apparent mobility limitations were studied. Measurements performed were clinical examination (standard 12-lead resting ECG, assessment of physical activity level, presence of chronic diseases, use of beta-blockers, body mass index (BMI), ability to squat, resting blood pressure) and six-minute walking test. Participants walked 533+/-75 m in the six-minute walking test. The best electrocardiographic predictors of long walking distance were high TV(5) and TII, but their explanation rates were small (4.5% and 3.8%, respectively). In hypertensive participants (systolic blood pressure=SBP> or =160 mmHg), the respective values were 9.3% and 5.8%. The best predictors of long walking distance were ability to squat without limitations and low BMI (15.5% and 13.6%, respectively). Altogether the studied variables explained 36% of the variation in walking distance. The data gathered in clinical examination give useful information for the assessment of walking ability in relatively healthy older women. Resting ECG does not give clinically significant additional information for the assessment in subjects without overt cardiac disease.

Transforming growth factor-beta1 modulates metalloproteinase-2 and -9, nitric oxide, RhoA and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in colon adenocarcinoma cells. Colon carcinoma invasiveness is a process involving cell-cell and cell-matrix alterations, local proteolysis of the ECM (extracellular matrix) or changes in cytokine and growth factor levels. In order to evaluate the role of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) and small G protein RhoA in tumour progression, the influence of TGF-beta1 treatment or RhoA-associated kinase inhibitor on the production of NO (nitric oxide) and MMP-2 and MMP-9 (metalloproteinases-2 and -9) was analysed in three human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HT29, LS180, SW948) representing different stages of tumour development. All the tested cell lines produced low amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9. rhTGF-beta1 and the synthetic Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) decreased MMP-2 secretion by colon cancer cells, especially in the most advanced stage of colon cancer. rhTGF-beta1 decreased NO secretion by cells, while Y-27632 had no effect on it. Immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibodies followed by densitometry revealed that RhoA levels were slightly increased after incubation of colon carcinoma cells (SW948) with rhTGF-beta1. rhTGF-beta1 induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, especially in high Duke's grade of colon cancer, while Y-27632 blocked it. Summing up, in colon carcinoma cells, TGF-beta1 and RhoA protein may regulate tumour invasiveness measured as MMP, NO and alpha-SMA expression or assayed using motility data and may be a good target for cancer therapy.

Heat shock proteins and resistance to desiccation in congeneric land snails. Land snails are subject to daily and seasonal variations in temperature and in water availability and depend on a range of behavioral and physiological adaptations for coping with problems of maintaining water, ionic, and thermal balance. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a multigene family of proteins whose expression is induced by a variety of stress agents. We used experimental desiccation to test whether adaptation to different habitats affects HSP expression in two closely related Sphincterochila snail species, a desiccation-resistant, desert species Sphincterochila zonata, and a Mediterranean-type, desiccation-sensitive species Sphincterochila cariosa. We examined the HSP response in the foot, hepatopancreas, and kidney tissues of snails exposed to normothermic desiccation. Our findings show variations in the HSP response in both timing and magnitude between the two species. The levels of endogenous Hsp72 in S. cariosa were higher in all the examined tissues, and the induction of Hsp72, Hsp74, and Hsp90 developed earlier than in S. zonata. In contrary, the induction of sHSPs (Hsp25 and Hsp30) was more pronounced in S. zonata compared to S. cariosa. Our results suggest that land snails use HSPs as part of their survival strategy during desiccation and as important components of the aestivation mechanism in the transition from activity to dormancy. Our study underscores the distinct strategy of HSP expression in response to desiccation, namely the delayed induction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 together with enhanced induction of sHSPs in the desert-dwelling species, and suggests that evolution in harsh environments will result in selection for reduced Hsp70 expression.

Multiscale analysis of dynamics and interactions of heterochromatin protein 1 by fluorescence fluctuation microscopy. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a central factor in establishing and maintaining the repressive heterochromatin state. To elucidate its mobility and interactions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on different time and length scales by fluorescence fluctuation microscopy in mouse cell lines. The local mobility of HP1alpha and HP1beta was investigated in densely packed pericentric heterochromatin foci and compared with other bona fide euchromatin regions of the nucleus by fluorescence bleaching and correlation methods. A quantitative description of HP1alpha/beta in terms of its concentration, diffusion coefficient, kinetic binding, and dissociation rate constants was derived. Three distinct classes of chromatin-binding sites with average residence times t(res) <or= 0.2 s (class I, dominant in euchromatin), 7 s (class II, dominant in heterochromatin), and approximately 2 min (class III, only in heterochromatin) were identified. HP1 was present at low micromolar concentrations at heterochromatin foci, and required histone H3 lysine 9 methylases Suv39h1/2 for two- to fourfold enrichment at these sites. These findings impose a number of constraints for the mechanism by which HP1 is able to maintain a heterochromatin state.

Influence of DNA repair RAD51 gene variants in overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with first line chemotherapy. Lung cancer continues to be the most frequent cancer with approximately one million people worldwide dying of this disease each year. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. The RAD51 protein is the key protein for homologous recombination, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for DNA damage repair and the generation of genetic diversity. We conducted this study in order to investigate the effect of the RAD51 G135C polymorphism in treatment response to combined platinum taxanes/gemcitabine first line chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. We analysed RAD51 G135C polymorphism in 243 NSCLC patients using PCR-RFLP methodology. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups of NSCLC patients with the different genotypes regarding tumour stage (p = 0.232). Our results indicate that the mean survival rates were statistically different according to the patient's genotypes. The group of patients carrying the C allele presented a higher mean survival rate than the other patients (56.0 months vs. 41.7 months; p = 0.024). Moreover, regarding smoking history, our results demonstrate that overall survival time differed significantly according to the patient's genotypes in smoker and ex-smoker individuals (p = 0.034). No statistically significant differences were found in the genotype frequencies and overall survival rate among non-smoker NSCLC patients (p = 0.413). This is the first study evaluating the effect of the RAD51 G135C polymorphism in NSCLC patient survival. Our results suggest that RAD51 genotypes could be useful molecular markers for predicting the clinical outcome of NSCLC patients.

Age-specific factors influencing asthma management by older adults. Although many asthma patients experience their first attack after age 40, the experiences and concerns of older adults with asthma remain largely unknown. We conducted six focus groups, each consisting of participants over the age of 65 with a physician diagnosis of asthma. Semistructured questions regarding asthma education, symptoms, and management were used. A total of 46 adults participated in the six focus groups. The mean age of the participants was 72.6 years, and 43.5% were African American. The majority of participants had coexisting cardiac disease or hypertension. Major age-specific domains identified in all focus groups were atypical asthma symptoms, inability to distinguish asthma from other medical conditions, use of complementary and alternative therapies, desire for independence in asthma management, and a lack of participation in asthma education. Participants acknowledged that they did not commonly address these issues with their physicians or with family members. Optimal care will require physicians and researchers to explicitly address these issues unique to the geriatric asthmatic population.

[Effect of long-term sevoflurane anesthesia on markers of myocardial damage]. To investigate the effect of long-term sevoflurane anesthesia on markers of myocardial damage or toxicity. Forty adult patients scheduled for upper abdominal surgery with general anesthesia for 4 hours or more were randomly divided into Group S and PR (n=20 each). After anesthesia induction, patients of Group S were maintained with only sevoflurane, and patients of Group PR with target-controlled infusion of propofol 2-4 microg/ml and remifentanil 4-8 ng/ml. Anesthesia was titrated to control blood pressure and heart rate change at less than 20 percent of baseline values. Blood samples were draw at pre-induction, 4 h and 24 h post-induction respectively. Serum level of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB and myoglobin were analyzed. There were no significant changes of troponin I, creatine kinase MB and myoglobin in Group S between pre-induction and 4 h or 24 h post-induction (P > 0.05). And there was also no significant differences as compared with Group PR (P > 0.05). At the concentration range of 1.6%-3%, long-term sevoflurane anesthesia does not cause detectable changes of markers of myocardial damage or toxicity.


Rheumatic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.

Neuromesenchymal hamartoma of small bowel--an extremely rare entity: a case report. Neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma (NMVH) is a very rare stricturing condition of the small intestine, occurring focally and causing recurrent obstructive symptoms or occult chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. Salas et al. (Neuromesenchymal hamartoma of the small bowel. J Clin Gastroenterol. 1990, 12 (6): 705-9) proposed the term of "Neuromesenchymal hamartoma" for the cases of NMVH with participation of mesenchymal tissues.We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient admitted twice in a month with abdominal pain. On the third admission with clinical signs of acute abdomen, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The clinical and laboratory findings that occurred after the patient's evaluation, the intraoperative findings and the pathological features of this lesion are reported.

What factors are associated with state performance on provision of transition services to CSHCN? To examine whether individual, condition-related, and system-related characteristics are associated with state performance (high, medium, low) on the provision of transition services to children with special health care needs (CSHCN). We conducted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses of 16876 children aged 12 to 17 years by using data from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs. Polytomous logistic regression was used to compare the characteristics of CSHCN residing within high-, medium-, and low-performance states, with low-performance states serving as the reference group. Compared with non-Hispanic white CSHCN, Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.25 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.37]) and non-Hispanic black (aOR: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.30-0.62]) CSHCN were less likely to reside in a high-performance than in a low-performance state. Compared with CSHCN who had a medical home or adequate insurance coverage, CSHCN who did not have a medical home or adequate insurance coverage were less likely to reside in a high-performance than in a low-performance state (aOR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57-0.95]; aOR: 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58-0.93], respectively). Key factors found to be important in a state's performance on provision of transition services to CSHCN were race/ethnicity and having a medical home and adequate insurance coverage. Efforts to support the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's integration of system-level factors in quality-improvement activities, particularly establishing a medical home and attaining and maintaining adequate insurance, are likely to help states improve their performance on provision of transition services.

Measuring vs estimating glomerular filtration rate in kidney transplantation. Evaluation of kidney function is crucial in the care of kidney transplant recipients and in the design and interpretation of clinical trials in transplantation. Kidney function is most commonly assessed in both instances using serum creatinine concentration or an estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine. These are inexpensive, widely available, and easily administered. Both have significant drawbacks, notably with respect to their inability to accurately identify changes in GFR. Novel markers of GFR such as cystatin C and beta-trace protein show promise as accurate and sensitive markers of GFR but have not yet been adequately evaluated in kidney transplantation. In addition, they are relatively expensive compared to creatinine and their assays are not available in most clinical laboratories. Glomerular filtration rate measurement using a variety of different available tracers and techniques is infrequently used in either clinical care or research protocols because of its cost and cumbersomeness. This review will discuss the merits and pitfalls of the various tools available to evaluate GFR in kidney transplantation.


Childhood maltreatment and adult mental health.

Sphingosine kinase-1 is central to androgen-regulated prostate cancer growth and survival. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) is an oncogenic lipid kinase notably involved in response to anticancer therapies in prostate cancer. Androgens regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation, and androgen deprivation therapy is the standard of care in the management of patients with advanced disease. Here, we explored the role of SphK1 in the regulation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Short-term androgen removal induced a rapid and transient SphK1 inhibition associated with a reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo, an event that was not observed in the hormono-insensitive PC-3 cells. Supporting the critical role of SphK1 inhibition in the rapid effect of androgen depletion, its overexpression could impair the cell growth decrease. Similarly, the addition of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to androgen-deprived LNCaP cells re-established cell proliferation, through an androgen receptor/PI3K/Akt dependent stimulation of SphK1, and inhibition of SphK1 could markedly impede the effects of DHT. Conversely, long-term removal of androgen support in LNCaP and C4-2B cells resulted in a progressive increase in SphK1 expression and activity throughout the progression to androgen-independence state, which was characterized by the acquisition of a neuroendocrine (NE)-like cell phenotype. Importantly, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway--by negatively impacting SphK1 activity--could prevent NE differentiation in both cell models, an event that could be mimicked by SphK1 inhibitors. Fascinatingly, the reversability of the NE phenotype by exposure to normal medium was linked with a pronounced inhibition of SphK1 activity. We report the first evidence that androgen deprivation induces a differential effect on SphK1 activity in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell models. These results also suggest that SphK1 activation upon chronic androgen deprivation may serve as a compensatory mechanism allowing prostate cancer cells to survive in androgen-depleted environment, giving support to its inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to delay/prevent the transition to androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Differentiation of hand posture to object shape in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. Quantifying hand-shaping in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) is the first step in understanding hand posture differentiation. To quantify this ability and determine how hand posture evolves during reach toward various object shapes in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP), 2 groups of children (10 typically developing, and 10 USCP, ages 6-13) were studied in a single-session cross-sectional study. Subjects grasped rectangular, concave, and convex objects with each hand. Metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joint finger flexion and finger abduction angles were calculated. The extent to which hand posture reflects object shape was calculated using a "visuomotor efficiency (VME) index" (a score of 100 reflects perfect discrimination between objects). A mixed design ANOVA with repeated measures on time was used to compare the VME between groups. Children with USCP demonstrated a lower VME than controls in the affected hand, indicating less effective hand-shaping; p<.01. There was also a difference between groups in the evolution of VME throughout reach; p<.01. No difference in hand-shaping in the less affected hand in USCP was observed. Analysis of joint angles at contact and VME throughout reach demonstrated that children with USCP differentiated their hand posture to objects of different shapes, but demonstrated deficits in the timing and magnitude of hand-shaping isolated to the affected side. The present study suggests it may be important to consider the quality of hand activity using quantitative approaches such as VME analyses. Rehabilitation approaches that target these deficits to improve joint mobility and motor control are worth testing.

Prognostic value of metabolic parameters and clinical impact of ¹⁸F-fluorocholine PET/CT in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. To evaluate the therapeutic impact of (18)F-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer (PC) and to investigate the value of quantitative FCH PET/CT parameters in predicting progression-free survival (PFS). This retrospective study included 172 consecutive patients with PC who underwent FCH PET/CT for biochemical recurrence. Mean rising PSA was 10.7 ± 35.0 ng/ml. Patients with positive FCH PET were classified into three groups: those with uptake only in the prostatic bed, those with locoregional disease, and those with distant metastases. Referring physicians were asked to indicate the hypothetical therapeutic strategy with and without the FCH PET/CT results. Clinical variables and PET parameters including SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, total lesion choline kinase activity (TLCKA) and standardized added metabolic activity (SAM) were recorded and a multivariate analysis was performed to determine the factors independently predicting PFS. In 137 of the 172 patients, the FCH PET/CT scan was positive, and of these, 29.9 % (41/137) had prostatic recurrence, 42.3 % (58/137) had pelvic lymph node recurrence with or without prostatic recurrence, and 27.7 % (38/137) had distant metastases. The FCH PET/CT result led to a change in treatment plan in 43.6 % (75/172) of the 172 patients. Treatment was changed in 49.6 % (68/137) of those with a positive FCH PET/CT scan and in 20 % (7/35) of those with a negative FCH PET/CT scan. After a median follow-up of 29.3 months (95 % CI 18.9 - 45.9 months), according to multivariate analysis age <70 years, SAM ≥23 and SUVmean ≥3 were parameters independently predicting PFS. A nomogram constructed using the three parameters showed 49 months of PFS in patients with the best scores (0 or 1) and only 11 months in patients with a poor score (score 3). This study indicates that a positive FCH PET result in PC patients with biochemical recurrence predicts a shorter PFS and confirms the major impact of the FCH PET result on the management of biochemical recurrent PC.

Surveillance of childhood blood lead levels in 14 cities of China in 2004-2006. To investigate the blood lead level in children aged 0-6 years in urban areas of China. Fourteen cities were selected as sites under surveillance. A total of 44 045 peripheral blood specimens were collected from 2004 to 2006, during which 15 727, 14 737, and 13 584 specimens were tested in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. Tungsten atomizer absorption spectrophotometer was employed to determine blood lead level. The geometric mean blood lead level in the tested children was 47.10 microg/L with 10.10% > or = 100 microg/L, 46.17 microg/L with 7.78% > or = 100 microg/L, and 47.03 microg/L with 7.30% > or = 100 microg/L in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The blood lead levels seemed to tend to rise in parallel with the increase of age of the children and were higher in boys (48.84 microg/L, 47.56 microg/L, and 47.78 microg/L in the 3 respective years) than in girls (45.00 microg/L, 44.53 microg/L, and 46.13 microg/L). The blood lead levels in children in cities of China are lower than those in previous national studies, but higher than those in developed countries. Childhood lead poisoning remains a public health problem in China.

The Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule inhibits complement activity and neutrophil phagocytosis by multiple mechanisms. The Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule is vital for virulence and may inhibit complement activity and phagocytosis. However, there are only limited data on the mechanisms by which the capsule affects complement and the consequences for S. pneumoniae interactions with phagocytes. Using unencapsulated serotype 2 and 4 S. pneumoniae mutants, we have confirmed that the capsule has several effects on complement activity. The capsule impaired bacterial opsonization with C3b/iC3b by both the alternative and classical complement pathways and also inhibited conversion of C3b bound to the bacterial surface to iC3b. There was increased binding of the classical pathway mediators immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to unencapsulated S. pneumoniae, indicating that the capsule could inhibit classical pathway complement activity by masking antibody recognition of subcapsular antigens, as well as by inhibiting CRP binding. Cleavage of serum IgG by the enzyme IdeS reduced C3b/iC3b deposition on all of the strains, but there were still marked increases in C3b/iC3b deposition on unencapsulated TIGR4 and D39 strains compared to encapsulated strains, suggesting that the capsule inhibits both IgG-mediated and IgG-independent complement activity against S. pneumoniae. Unencapsulated strains were more susceptible to neutrophil phagocytosis after incubation in normal serum, normal serum treated with IdeS, complement-deficient serum, and complement-deficient serum treated with IdeS or in buffer alone, suggesting that the capsule inhibits phagocytosis mediated by Fcgamma receptors, complement receptors, and nonopsonic receptors. Overall, these data show that the S. pneumoniae capsule affects multiple aspects of complement- and neutrophil-mediated immunity, resulting in a profound inhibition of opsonophagocytosis.

Impact of parathyroidectomy on survival among haemodialysis patients: A prospective cohort study. We evaluated whether parathyroidectomy (PTX) was associated with survival of dialysis patients. In a cohort study with one year follow-up, data from 146 haemodialysis patients from a hospital were analyzed. We compared the baseline data between patients receiving PTX surgery and those who had not undergone PTX. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effect of PTX. Patients who had received PTX surgery were more likely to be older, have longer duration of dialysis, higher ultrafiltration rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lower albumin compared with those who had not receive PTX. During 1 year follow-up, 21 (17.1%) patients died, of whom seven died from cerebrovascular events, 10 died from cardiovascular disease, and four died from infection. The mortality was 9.4% in the PTX group and 17.3% in the control group. The PTX group had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality than the control group (P = 0.005). There was a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality in the PTX group compared with the non-PTX group (HR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.89-0.97). The lower risk (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.85-0.98) of PTX group was not changed after adjusting potential factors. Our results also suggested that this relationship was independent of many potential confounding factors. Parathyroidectomy was related to significant reduction in all-cause among patients with severe SHPT. PTX may be considered as a matter of priority, from which dialysis patients would benefit.

Cardiovascular complications of pulmonary vascular affectation may be a consequence of the overactivation of the vasoconstrictive and proliferative components of the renin-angiotensin system. We previously reported that pulmonary physiology and surfactant production is improved by the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide (LIR) in a rat model of lung hypoplasia. Because we hypothesized that streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats would show deficiencies in lung function, including surfactant proteins, and develop an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system in the lungs. This effect would in turn be prevented by long-acting agonists of the GLP-1R, such as LIR. The induction of diabetes reduced the surfactant protein A and B in the lungs and caused the vasoconstrictor component of the renin-angiotensin system to predominate, which in turn increased angiotensin II levels, and ultimately being associated with right ventricle hypertrophy. LIR restored surfactant protein levels and reversed the imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system in this type 1 diabetes mellitus rat model. Moreover, LIR provoked a strong increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression in the lungs of both diabetic and control rats, and in the circulating angiotensin(1-7) in diabetic animals. These effects prompted complete reversion of right ventricle hypertrophy. The consequences of LIR administration were independent of glycemic control and of glucocorticoids, and they involved NK2 homeobox 1 signaling. This study demonstrates by first time that GLP-1R agonists, such as LIR, might improve the cardiopulmonary complications associated with diabetes. 

Preparation of collagen modified photopolymers: a new type of biodegradable gel for cell growth. In this study a new branched methacrylated poly(propylene glycol-co-lactic acid) (PPG-PLA-IEM) and methacrylated cellulose acetate butyrate resin (CAB-IEM) were synthesized. Hydrogels with various amounts of PPG-PLA-IEM and CAB-IEM (25, 50 and 75 wt% IEM modified) were prepared by photopolymerization. Collagen tethered PEG-monoacrylate (PEGMA-collagen) was prepared and introduced as a bioactive moiety to modify the hydrogel in order to enhance cell affinity. In vitro attachment and growth of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on the hydrogels with and without collagen were also investigated. It was observed that, the collagen improves the cell adhesion onto the hydrogel surface. With the increasing amount of collagen, cell viability increased by 28% for ECV304 (P < 0.05) and 30% for 3T3 (P < 0.05).

Comparative reproducibility of dermal microvascular blood flow changes in response to acetylcholine iontophoresis, hyperthermia and reactive hyperaemia. Laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) can non-invasively measure skin microvascular changes in response to acetylcholine (ACh), local heating of the skin and reactive hyperaemia following arterial occlusion. Various studies have used microvascular changes in response to these stimuli, especially ACh iontophoresis and local heating, as a surrogate marker of endothelial function. There are few data in the literature regarding the comparative reproducibility of microvascular perfusion changes induced by the three stimuli. The aim of this study was to systematically assess and compare the reproducibility of skin microcirculatory function in response to each of these challenges. Ten healthy non-smoking subjects (seven males) median age 36 years (range 23-46), with no history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease or any connective tissue disorder, were studied. Changes in skin microcirculation in response to ACh iontophoresis, local heating of the skin and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia, on two separate days (median 31, range 11-42 days), were assessed in all subjects. We measured three parameters: the change in perfusion from baseline perfusion (peak minus baseline perfusion), the relative percentage change in perfusion from baseline (peak--baseline)/baseline x 100 (%) and also the time-to-peak perfusion. The reproducibility of the change in perfusion had coefficients of variation (CV) of 9.3% for local skin heating, 19.4% for reactive hyperaemia and 25.5% for ACh iontophoresis. The relative percentage change in perfusion from baseline was more variable with CVs ranging from 23% to 39%. The coefficient of variation of time-to-peak perfusion was 7.0% for heating, 15.1% for reactive hyperaemia and 10.4% for ACh iontophoresis. We have shown that microcirculatory changes measured by the change in perfusion from baseline and time-to-peak perfusion in response to ACh, post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia and local skin heating had good reproducibility when carried out in a controlled environment with a standardized protocol. Relative change in perfusion had relatively poor reproducibility. The change in perfusion and time-to-peak perfusion for local skin heating were the most reproducible overall.

Scaffold-based rhBMP-2 therapy in a rat alveolar defect model: implications for human gingivoperiosteoplasty. Primary alveolar cleft repair has a 41 to 73 percent success rate. Patients with persistent alveolar defects require secondary bone grafting. The authors investigated scaffold-based therapies designed to augment the success of alveolar repair. Critical-size, 7 x 4 x 3-mm alveolar defects were created surgically in 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. Four scaffold treatment arms were tested: absorbable collagen sponge, absorbable collagen sponge plus recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2), hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate plus rhBMP-2, and no scaffold. New bone formation was assessed radiomorphometrically and histomorphometrically at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Radiomorphometrically, untreated animals formed 43 +/- 6 percent, 53 +/- 8 percent, and 48 +/- 3 percent new bone at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. Animals treated with absorbable collagen sponge formed 50 +/- 6 percent, 79 +/- 9 percent, and 69 +/- 7 percent new bone, respectively. Absorbable collagen sponge plus rhBMP-2-treated animals formed 49 +/- 2 percent, 71 +/- 6 percent, and 66 +/- 7 percent new bone, respectively. Hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate treatment stimulated 69 +/- 12 percent, 86 +/- 3 percent (p < 0.05), and 87 +/- 14 percent new bone, respectively. Histomorphometry demonstrated an increase in bone formation in animals treated with hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate plus rhBMP-2 (p < 0.05; 4 weeks) compared with empty scaffold. Radiomorphometrically, absorbable collagen sponge and hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds induced more bone formation than untreated controls. The rhBMP-2 added a small but significant histomorphometric osteogenic advantage to the hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate scaffold.

The Palomero genome suggests metal effects on domestication. Maize domestication (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) resulted in a wide diversity of native landraces that represent an invaluable source of genetic information for exploring natural variation and genome evolution. We sequenced de novo the approximately 2-gigabase genome of the Mexican landrace Palomero Toluqueño (Palomero) and compared its features to those of the modern inbred line B73. We revealed differences concordant with its ancient origin and identified chromosomal regions of low nucleotide variability that contain domestication genes involved in heavy-metal detoxification. Our results indicate that environmental changes were important selective forces acting on maize domestication.

Cystic choroid plexus papilloma in the cavum septum pellucidum. A choroid plexus papilloma is a rare CNS neoplasm arising from the neuroepithelial lining of the choroid plexus. A third ventricular location of a choroid plexus papilloma is rare compared with the more common sites in the lateral and fourth ventricles. Cystic choroid plexus papilloma represents an infrequent subtype that may present diagnostic ambiguity. The authors present a case of cystic choroid plexus papilloma within a cavum septum pellucidum that radiographically mimicked neurocysticercosis.

Evidence for the progression through S-phase in the ectopic cell cycle re-entry of neurons in Alzheimer disease. Aberrant neuronal re-entry into the cell cycle is emerging as a potential pathological mechanism in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, while cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), and other mitotic factors are ectopically expressed in neurons, many of these proteins are also involved in other pathological and physiological processes, generating continued debate on whether such markers are truly indicative of a bona fide cell cycle process. To address this issue, here we analyzed one of the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins that plays a role in DNA replication and becomes phosphorylated by the S-phase promoting CDKs and Cdc7 during DNA synthesis. We found phosphorylated Mcm2 (pMcm2) markedly associated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neurites in AD but not in aged-matched controls. These data not only provide further evidence for cell cycle aberrations in AD, but the cytoplasmic, rather than nuclear, localization of pMcm2 suggests an abnormal cellular distribution of this important replication factor in AD that may explain resultant cell cycle stasis and consequent neuronal degeneration.

The neurology of balance: function and dysfunction of the vestibular system in dogs and cats. Disorders affecting the vestibular system are a common neurological problem encountered in small animal practice. As a result, veterinarians are often faced with determining the underlying etiology of affected animals. In order to establish an accurate etiological diagnosis, proper interpretation of neurological deficits and precise neuroanatomical localization are essential. Neurological examination can confirm whether the vestibular dysfunction is of peripheral or central nervous system origin. Peripheral vestibular diseases include idiopathic vestibular syndrome, which has some similarities with vestibular neuritis in humans. Central vestibular diseases in general have a poor prognosis in comparison to those affecting the peripheral vestibular system.

Acute HIV infection - New York City, 2008. Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) is a highly infectious phase of disease that lasts approximately 2 months and is characterized by nonspecific clinical symptoms. AHI contributes disproportionately to HIV transmission because it is associated with a high level of viremia, despite negative or indeterminate antibody (Ab) tests. Diagnosis of AHI with individual or pooled nucleic acid amplification tests (p-NAAT) can enable infected persons to adopt behaviors that reduce HIV transmission, facilitate partner referral for counseling and testing, and identify social networks of persons with elevated rates of HIV transmission. The national HIV surveillance case definition does not distinguish AHI from other stages of HIV infection, and the frequency of AHI among reported HIV cases is unknown. In 2008, to increase detection of AHI and demonstrate the feasibility of AHI surveillance, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) initiated p-NAAT screening at four sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and enhanced citywide HIV surveillance (using a standard case definition) to differentiate AHI among newly reported cases. Seventy cases of AHI (representing 1.9% of all 3,635 HIV diagnoses reported in New York City) were identified: 53 cases from enhanced surveillance and 17 cases from p-NAAT screening (representing 9% of 198 HIV diagnoses at the four clinics). Men who have sex with men (MSM) constituted 81% of AHI cases. Screening STD clinic patients, especially MSM, with p-NAAT can identify additional cases of HIV infection. Surveillance for AHI is feasible and can identify circumstances in which HIV prevention efforts should be intensified.

Electronic polarization is important in stabilizing the native structures of proteins. Quantum mechanical computations of proteins based on the molecular fragment approach have been carried out, and polarized protein-specific charges have been derived to provide accurate electrostatic interactions for a benchmark set of proteins. Our study shows that, under the polarized protein-specific force field, the native structure indeed corresponds to the lowest-energy conformation for these proteins. In contrast, when a standard mean-field force field such as AMBER is used, the energies of many decoy structures of proteins could be lower than those of the native structures. Furthermore, MD simulations were carried out and verified that the native structures of these proteins not only are statically more stable but are also dynamically more stable under the polarized protein-specific force field. The present results, together with several recent studies, provide strong evidence that protein polarization is critical to stabilizing the native structures of proteins.


Probabilistic prediction of the human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism sites.

Periorbital skeletal augmentation to improve blepharoplasty and midfacial results. Narrow palpebral fissures, short lower lids, and full cheeks are hallmarks of youthful periorbita. The presence of these features is predicated on a convex upper midface skeleton. Faces whose midface skeletons are flat or concave do not manifest these youthful attributes, tend to age prematurely, and are prone to lower lid malposition after blepharoplasty. Augmentation of the infraorbital rim with alloplastic implants can provide convexity to the deficient upper midface skeleton. Suspension of the cheek soft tissues (subperiosteal midface lift) on this now supportive framework narrows the palpebral fissure, shortens the lower lid, and gives fullness to the cheek. The addition of lateral canthopexy to skeletal augmentation and subperiosteal midface lift can restore lower lid position when previous blepharoplasty has resulted in lower lid malposition in patients with deficient midface skeletons. This concept has been utilized in 87 patients (65 female, 22 male) over the last 7 years. Of these 87 patients, four patients (5 percent) required revision surgery to correct implant malposition or prominence. Three patients (3 percent) required implant removal to treat infection. Implants were later replaced in two of these three patients. Augmentation of the infraorbital rim with alloplastic implants provides convexity to the upper midface skeleton. Together with lower lid and midface soft-tissue suspension, it creates or restores youthful periorbital aesthetics.

Pharmacokinetics of lamivudine & stavudine in generic fixed-dose combinations in HIV-1 infected adults in India. Antiretroviral drug concentrations are important determinants of clinical response to a drug accounting for both toxicity and efficacy. Several factors such as age, ethnicity, body weight and patients' immune status may influence antiretroviral drug concentrations. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of immunological status, sex and body mass index on the steady state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (3TC) and stavudine (d4T) in HIV-infected adults, who were undergoing treatment with generic fixed dose combinations (FDC) of these drugs in India. Twenty seven HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least two weeks at the Government ART clinic at Tambaram, Chennai, took part in the study. Serial blood samples were collected predosing and at different time points after drug administration. Plasma 3TC and d4T levels were estimated by HPLC. The patients' immune status, sex or body mass index had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of 3TC. In the case of d4T, peak concentration was significantly lower in patients with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/microl than those with > or = 200 cells/ microl (P < 0.05), but were within the therapeutic range. The mean CD4 cell counts increased from 101 cells/microl at initiation of ART to 366 cells/microl at 12 months of treatment. Blood levels of 3TC and d4T drugs that are part of generic FDCs commonly used by HIV-infected individuals in India were within the therapeutic range and not influenced by nutritional or immune status. There was a significant improvement in CD4 cell counts over 12 months of treatment. Indian generic FDCs manufactured and used widely in the developing world provide effective concentrations of antiretroviral drugs.

Targeting EXT1 reveals a crucial role for heparan sulfate in the growth of multiple myeloma. Expression of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 is a hallmark of both normal and multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells. Syndecan-1 could affect plasma cell fate by strengthening integrin-mediated adhesion via its core protein and/or by accommodating and presenting soluble factors via its HS side chains. Here, we show that inducible RNAi-mediated knockdown of syndecan-1 in human MM cells leads to reduced growth rates and a strong increase of apoptosis. Importantly, knockdown of EXT1, a copolymerase critical for HS chain biosynthesis, had similar effects. Using an innovative myeloma xenotransplantation model in Rag-2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) mice, we demonstrate that induction of EXT1 knockdown in vivo dramatically suppresses the growth of bone marrow localized myeloma. Our findings provide direct evidence that the HS chains of syndecan-1 are crucial for the growth and survival of MM cells within the bone marrow environment, and indicate the HS biosynthesis machinery as a potential treatment target in MM.

Modified head shake computerized dynamic posturography. Recent research on head shake posturography has demonstrated a modest increase in sensitivity to identifying peripheral vestibular system asymmetry when horizontal head movements were added to portions of the standard Sensory Organization Test (SOT) battery. However, limitations with respect to the head shake protocol were outlined, and usable data for assessing performance could not be established. The purpose of this study was to test a change in protocol for use of head shake SOT to address the noted limitations. Forty participants ranging in age from 20 to 79 years with no history of dizziness completed Conditions 2 and 5 of the SOT portion of computerized dynamic posturography on EquiTest equipment, while maintaining head still as well as 4 horizontal head movement velocity tasks. Slope of a linear regression fit to 6 performance points was used to characterize each participant. Spearman's ranked correlation (r) indicated a significant relationship between the slope of the line representing a decline in performance with age (r = -.52, p = .0006). The head shake modification showed a trend in increasing the separation of normal individuals across age and eliminated the limitations addressed in earlier research. Future research will investigate the head shake modification for identifying vestibular peripheral system asymmetries.

Protection against focal ischemic injury to the brain by trans-sodium crocetinate. Laboratory investigation. Ischemic injury is a potential complication in a variety of surgical procedures and is a particular impediment to the success of surgeries involving highly vulnerable neural tissue. One approach to limiting this form of injury is to enhance metabolic supply to the affected tissue. Trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC) is a carotenoid compound that has been shown to increase tissue oxygenation by facilitating the diffusivity of small molecules, such as oxygen and glucose. The present study examined the ability of TSC to modify oxygenation in ischemic neural tissue and tested the potential neuroprotective effects of TSC in permanent and temporary models of focal cerebral ischemia. Adult male rats (330–370 g) were subjected to either permanent or temporary focal ischemia by simultaneous occlusion of both common carotid arteries and the left middle cerebral artery (3-vessel occlusion [3-VO]). Using the permanent ischemia paradigm, TSC was administered intravenously beginning 10 minutes after the onset of ischemia at 1 of 8 dosages, ranging from 0.023 to 4.580 mg/kg. Cerebral infarct volume was measured 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. The effect of TSC on infarct volume was also tested after temporary (2-hour) ischemia using a dosage of 0.092 mg/kg. In other animals undergoing temporary ischemia, tissue oxygenation was monitored in the ischemic penumbra using a Licox probe. Administration of TSC reduced infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner in the permanent ischemia model, achieving statistical significance at dosages ranging from 0.046 to 0.229 mg/kg. The most effective dosage of TSC in the permanent ischemia experiment (0.092 mg/kg) was further tested using a temporary (2-hour) ischemia paradigm. Infarct volume was reduced significantly by TSC in this ischemia-reperfusion model as well. Recordings of oxygen levels in the ischemic penumbra of the temporary ischemia model showed that TSC increased tissue oxygenation during vascular occlusion, but reduced the oxygen overshoot (hyperoxygenation) that occurs upon reperfusion. The novel carotenoid compound TSC exerts a neuroprotective influence against permanent and temporary ischemic injury when administered soon after the onset of ischemia. The protective mechanism of TSC remains to be confirmed; however, the permissive effect of TSC on the diffusivity of small molecules is a plausible mechanism based on the observed increase in tissue oxygenation in the ischemic penumbra. This represents a form of protection based on “metabolic reflow” that can occur under conditions of partial vascular perfusion. It is particularly noteworthy that TSC could conceivably limit the progression of a wide variety of cellular injury mechanisms by blunting the ischemic challenge to the brain.

Influence of maternal corticosterone treatment on incubation length of eggs laid by Japanese quail hens selected for divergent adrenocortical stress responsiveness. 1. Previous studies have shown that more yolk corticosterone is found in the eggs of random bred Japanese quail hens implanted with corticosterone during egg formation; both unstressed and stressed quail hens selected for exaggerated (high stress) rather than reduced (low stress) plasma corticosterone response to brief restraint deposit more corticosterone into their egg yolks. The length of egg incubation is also known to be shorter in eggs laid by high than low stress hens. 2. Here we investigated the interactive effects of quail stress line (low vs. high stress) with maternal corticosterone treatment (empty implant controls vs. corticosterone-implants) during egg formation on length of egg incubation. 3. Mean (+/-SEM) length of egg incubation for high stress control eggs (3973 +/- 04 h) was similarly shorter (by about 4.5 h) than that found for low stress control eggs (3928 +/- 02 h). In addition, on average, the incubation length of eggs laid by corticosterone-implanted hens (3929 +/- 05 h) was nearly 3 h shorter than that found for eggs laid by control hens (3958 +/- 02 h) regardless of stress line. 4. Line x hen-implant treatment effects on mean (+/-SEM) length of egg incubation partitioned in rank order as follows: low stress control (3978 +/- 05 h) > low stress corticosterone-implant (3959 +/- 07 h) > high stress control (3938 +/- 03 h) > high stress corticosterone-implant (3912 +/- 04 h). 5. Our original contention that selection for exaggerated adrenocortical responsiveness is associated with a reduction in the length of egg incubation was supported. Because maternal stress-induced elevations of yolk B are known to occur, the present findings of further shortenings of the hatching times of eggs of corticosterone-treated hens of both stress lines are also important to the poultry industry because they warn producers that unless stress in hens during egg formation is minimised, abbreviated egg incubation periods may result beyond the effects that a hen's genetic predisposition to adrenocortical stress responsiveness has on the length of egg incubation.

Effect of particle size reduction on physicochemical properties of ashgourd (Benincasa hispida) and radish (Raphanus sativus) fibres. The present work was aimed at studying the effect of particle size reduction on the physicochemical properties of ashgourd and radish fibre. Both the fibres after extraction of juice were dehydrated and subjected to granulometry to obtain 30, 60 and 100 mesh particles. The yield was more for 60 mesh particles. The image analysis as well as microstructural analysis of particles by scanning electron microscopy showed distinctive properties. The 30 mesh particles of ashgourd and radish fibre contained 66.35% and 53.11% total dietary fibre while the soluble fibre content was 22.76% and 17.75%, respectively. The fibre content decreased by 7-8% with decrease in particle sizes. The values of water holding capacity, water binding capacity, oil binding capacity, swelling power and cation exchange capacity also decreased with the decrease in particle size. However, the particle density values increased with the decrease in particle size. These results underline the influence of the physical structure of the fibre on the physicochemical properties.

Public health education for medical students: rising to the professional challenge. Public health competencies, especially as they relate to the management of chronic disease, will be of increasing importance to the global health-care workforce. The General Medical Council's recommendations on basic medical education have helped to entrench the position of public health and related disciplines. Tomorrow's Doctors has recently been updated. This article describes the indicative goals that should underpin the development of undergraduate medical education in public health, presented in a national statement. The statement was originally produced on behalf of academic departments of public health and related disciplines in UK medical schools. The dearth of evidence in this field leaves many questions for future educational research.

Forecasting the effects of obesity and smoking on U.S. life expectancy. Although increases in obesity over the past 30 years have adversely affected the health of the U.S. population, there have been concomitant improvements in health because of reductions in smoking. Having a better understanding of the joint effects of these trends on longevity and quality of life will facilitate more efficient targeting of health care resources. For each year from 2005 through 2020, we forecasted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy for a representative 18-year-old, assuming a continuation of past trends in smoking (based on data from the National Health Interview Survey for 1978 through 1979, 1990 through 1991, 1999 through 2001, and 2004 through 2006) and past trends in body-mass index (BMI) (based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 1971 through 1975, 1988 through 1994, 1999 through 2002, and 2003 through 2006). The 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was used to examine the effects of smoking and BMI on health-related quality of life. The negative effects of increasing BMI overwhelmed the positive effects of declines in smoking in multiple scenarios. In the base case, increases in the remaining life expectancy of a typical 18-year-old are held back by 0.71 years or 0.91 quality-adjusted years between 2005 and 2020. If all U.S. adults became nonsmokers of normal weight by 2020, we forecast that the life expectancy of an 18-year-old would increase by 3.76 life-years or 5.16 quality-adjusted years. If past obesity trends continue unchecked, the negative effects on the health of the U.S. population will increasingly outweigh the positive effects gained from declining smoking rates. Failure to address continued increases in obesity could result in an erosion of the pattern of steady gains in health observed since early in the 20th century.


Clinical relevance of the interleukin 10 promoter polymorphisms in Chinese Han patients with major trauma: genetic association studies.

Adequate iodine intake of Slovenian adolescents is primarily attributed to excessive salt intake. In Slovenia, table salt iodization has been applied to combat iodine deficiency. Recently, we found that Slovenian adolescents attained iodine sufficiency (median urinary iodine concentration was 140 microg/L; prevalence of goiter was <1%). National data indicate that salt intake of Slovenian population is too high (150% above the recommended limit); therefore, we hypothesized that sufficient iodine intake in adolescents can be primarily attributed to excessive salt intake. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated iodine and salt intake in Slovenian adolescents as well as the contributions of different foods to their intake. We determined the iodine and salt intake of a national representative sample of 2581 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ covered habitual diets over the past year, and 2485 (96%) adolescents completed a valid FFQ (1370 girls, 1115 boys). The iodine intake was 189.7 +/- 2.6 microg/d (mean +/- standard error of mean), well above the recommended 150 microg/d (P < .001). Table salt was by far the biggest dietary source of iodine and sodium for both sexes. Total salt intake (mean +/- standard error of mean, 10.4 +/- 0.2 g/d) significantly exceeded the upper World Health Organization limit (<5 g/d, P < .001), especially in boys (11.5 +/- 0.3 vs 9.4 +/- 0.2 g/d in girls, P < .001). The main food sources of salt were table salt (33%), bread (24%), salty snack products (10%), meat products (8%), fish products (6%), and milk (4%). Salt intake from foods, excluding table salt, was 6.9 g/d (67% of total salt intake). We conclude that although Slovenian adolescents are iodine sufficient, their salt intake, especially among boys, is too high. Several nutritional interventions are proposed to reduce total salt intake while ensuring adequate iodine intake.

A novel cis-AB variant allele arising from a de novo nucleotide substitution c.796A>G (p.M266V) in the B glycosyltransferase gene. Cis-AB, a rare ABO variant, is the result of a mutated ABO gene that produces a glycosyltransferase enzyme with dual A and B glycosyltransferase activity. It may lead to ABO discrepancies and a delay in establishing the blood group. To date, there have been no reports of a de novo mutation leading to a cis-AB allele. Sequencing of the ABO gene using blood and hair follicle cells from the proposita were performed along with blood from her parents. To establish maternity and paternity, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis was also performed. The A and B enzyme activities of the novel enzyme were measured in an in vitro expression study. A novel cis-AB allele arising from nucleotide substitution c.796A>G (p.M266V) in the B glycosyltransferase gene were discovered in the blood and hair follicle cells from the proposita, which was absent from her parents. In all 15 autosomal STR loci analysed, the probability of maternity and paternity were 0.999999 and 0.999989, respectively. The novel enzyme created 33.1% and 60.2% of A and B antigen compared to wild type A and B glycosyltransferases. A novel mechanism leading to a cis-AB allele was discovered.

Intralesional bleomycin injections in the treatment of benign lymphoepithelial cysts of the parotid gland in HIV-positive patients: case reports. Benign lymphoepithelial cysts (BLCs) of the parotid gland are associated with human immunodeficiency virus. These cysts may grow large and uncomfortable, causing significant cosmetic embarrassment for the patient. Several treatment options have been described with varying successes. We report successful treatment of three adults with bleomycin. All three patients presented with bilateral parotid enlargements. They received a total dose of between 180 U and 270 U of bleomycin over a period of 6 to 10 weeks. They all responded completely without morbidity or recurrence. Bleomycin is effective in the treatment of BLCs of the parotid glands in HIV-positive patients.


Transforming healthcare: a safety imperative.

Acculturation differentially predicts smoking cessation among Latino men and women. The current study examined the influence of gender, acculturation indicators, and their interaction on smoking cessation among Latinos. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the main effects of gender, acculturation indicators, and their interactions on self-reported 7-day abstinence at 12-week follow-up among 271 Latino smokers seeking cessation counseling. Analyses revealed significant main effects for several acculturation indicators and significant interactions of gender with number of years lived in the United States, proportion of life lived in the United States, and preferred media language (all P values <0.05). Follow-up analyses indicated no significant relationships between abstinence and acculturation indicators among women. Among men, abstinence rates increased with years in the United States, proportion of life in the United States, and preferred media language of English. Greater acculturation predicted higher abstinence rates, but this relationship was restricted to men. This study is among the first to examine the effects of gender and acculturation on smoking abstinence among Latinos. Findings highlight the need for research focused on mechanisms underlying these relationships.

Factors associated with percutaneous nerve evaluation and permanent sacral nerve modulation outcome in patients with fecal incontinence. Sacral nerve modulation is an established treatment for fecal incontinence. Little is known about predictive factors for successful percutaneous nerve evaluation (or test stimulation) and permanent sacral nerve modulation outcome. The purpose of this retrospective study was to discover predictive factors associated with temporary and permanent stimulation. We analyzed data from test stimulations performed in patients with fecal incontinence from March 2000 until May 2007. Successful outcome was defined as >50% improvement of incontinence episodes in three weeks. Patients with a successful test stimulation were eligible for permanent sacral nerve modulation implantation. All patients who subsequently had permanent sacral nerve modulation were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictive power of baseline demographics and diagnostic variables. Test stimulations were performed in 245 patients (226 females; mean age, 56.6 (standard deviation, 12.8) years). Our analysis showed that older age (P = 0.014), external anal sphincter defects (P = 0.005), and repeated procedures after initial failure (P = 0.001) were significantly related to failure. One hundred seventy-three patients (70.6%) were eligible for permanent sacral nerve modulation implantation. The analysis showed no significant predictive factors related to permanent sacral nerve modulation. Three predictive factors were negatively associated with the outcome of test stimulation: older age, repeated procedures, and a defect in the external anal sphincter. These factors may indicate lower chances of success for test stimulation but do not exclude patients from sacral nerve modulation treatment. Although assessed in a selected patient group, no factors were predictive of the outcome of permanent stimulation.

Incidence, seasonality and mortality associated with influenza pneumonia in Thailand: 2005-2008. Data on the incidence, seasonality and mortality associated with influenza in subtropical low and middle income countries are limited. Prospective data from multiple years are needed to develop vaccine policy and treatment guidelines, and improve pandemic preparedness. During January 2005 through December 2008, we used an active, population-based surveillance system to prospectively identify hospitalized pneumonia cases with influenza confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or cell culture in 20 hospitals in two provinces in Thailand. Age-specific incidence was calculated and extrapolated to estimate national annual influenza pneumonia hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths. Influenza was identified in 1,346 (10.4%) of pneumonia patients of all ages, and 10 influenza pneumonia patients died while in the hospital. 702 (52%) influenza pneumonia patients were less than 15 years of age. The average annual incidence of influenza pneumonia was greatest in children less than 5 years of age (236 per 100,000) and in those age 75 or older (375 per 100,000). During 2005, 2006 and 2008 influenza A virus detection among pneumonia cases peaked during June through October. In 2007 a sharp increase was observed during the months of January through April. Influenza B virus infections did not demonstrate a consistent seasonal pattern. Influenza pneumonia incidence was high in 2005, a year when influenza A(H3N2) subtype virus strains predominated, low in 2006 when A(H1N1) viruses were more common, moderate in 2007 when H3N2 and influenza B co-predominated, and high again in 2008 when influenza B viruses were most common. During 2005-2008, influenza pneumonia resulted in an estimated annual average 36,413 hospital admissions and 322 in-hospital pneumonia deaths in Thailand. Influenza virus infection is an important cause of hospitalized pneumonia in Thailand. Young children and the elderly are most affected and in-hospital deaths are more common than previously appreciated. Influenza occurs year-round and tends to follow a bimodal seasonal pattern with substantial variability. The disease burden varies significantly from year to year. Our findings support a recent Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) decision to extend annual influenza vaccination to older adults and suggest that children should also be targeted for routine vaccination.

Psychosocial dimensions of exceptional longevity: a qualitative exploration of centenarians' experiences, personality, and life strategies. This qualitative study provides a comprehensive account of the social and life experiences and strategies and personality attributes that characterize exceptional longevity (living to 100 or over). It is based on nine semi-structured interviews of relatively healthy and functional Greek centenarians of both sexes. The analytic approach was thematic and based on grounded theory. We found that our participants were characterized by selectiveness in their socializing with other people and tendency to avoid conflicts. Also, we found that they predominantly used the "flight" response whenever confronted with stressors. Further, they appeared to be much adaptive as they had managed to overcome adversity and adapt successfully to major life changes. These findings provide insights into three possible pathways (social selectivity, conflict avoidance, and adaptiveness) through which psychosocial factors might be associated with aging and exceptional longevity.

The role of urinary soluble endoglin in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia: comparison with soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio. Endoglin, an anti-angiogenic glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells, has been proposed recently as a biomarker of pre-eclampsia (PE). Given that PE is characterised by an imbalance of angiogenic factors, we sought to determine the clinical utility of urinary soluble endoglin, relative to the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio, in the diagnosis of PE during gestation. Prospective observational cohort. Tertiary referral university hospital. Two hundred and thirty-four pregnant women were enrolled prospectively in the following groups: healthy controls, n = 63; gestational age (GA), median (interquartile range), 33 weeks (27-39 weeks); chronic hypertension, n = 27; GA, 33 weeks (30-36 weeks); mild PE, n = 38; GA, 37 weeks (34-40 weeks); severe PE, n = 106; GA, 32 weeks (29-37 weeks). Free urinary levels of soluble endoglin, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and PlGF were measured by sensitive and specific immunoassay. Levels for all urinary analytes were normalised to creatinine. Urinary soluble endoglin, and the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio. In healthy controls, urinary soluble endoglin levels were increased significantly at term relative to those earlier in gestation. Severe PE was characterised by an increased urinary level of soluble endoglin, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, protein to creatinine ratio and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio compared with all other groups. There was a direct correlation between urinary soluble endoglin and proteinuria that remained after GA correction (R = 0.382, P < 0.001). Urinary soluble endoglin could not differentiate mild PE from severe preterm PE. Overall, soluble endoglin had the ability to discriminate PE from chronic hypertension and healthy controls only in women who were evaluated at <37 weeks of GA. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of urinary soluble endoglin alone in the diagnosis of PE or in the identification of women with PE requiring a mandated delivery before 37 weeks of gestation were 70%, 86% and 76%, respectively. These values were inferior to those of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio (P < 0.001). The addition of urinary soluble endoglin did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio alone. We have provided evidence that soluble endoglin is present and elevated in the urine of women who develop preterm PE. Urinary soluble endoglin has only limited ability to determine the severity of PE and to distinguish between PE and chronic hypertension both preterm and at term. Compared with urinary soluble endoglin, the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio remains a better marker of disease presence, severity and outcome.

Translating the neuroscience of alcoholism into clinical treatments: from blocking the buzz to curing the blues. Understanding the pathophysiology of addictive disorders is critical for development of new treatments. A major focus of addiction research has for a long time been on systems that mediate acute positively reinforcing effects of addictive drugs, most prominently the mesolimbic dopaminergic (DA) system and its connections. This research line has been successful in shedding light on the physiology of both natural and drug reward, but has not led to therapeutic breakthroughs. The role of classical reward systems is perhaps least clear in alcohol addiction. Here, recent work is summarized that points to some clinically important conclusions. First, important pharmacogenetic differences exist with regard to positively reinforcing effects of alcohol and the ability of this drug to activate classical reward pathways. This offers an opportunity for personalized treatment approaches in alcoholism. Second, brain stress and fear systems become pathologically activated in later stages of alcoholism and their activation is a major influence in escalation of alcohol intake, sensitization of stress responses, and susceptibility to relapse. These findings offer a new category of treatment mechanisms. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling through CRH1 receptors is a major candidate target in this category, but recent data indicate that antagonists for substance P (SP) neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors may have a similar potential.

Oral administration of PPC enhances antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses while reducing IgE levels in sensitized mice. For almost 2000 years it has been recognized that aqueous extracts from pine cones possess medicinal properties beneficial for the treatment of a broad variety of diseases and conditions. In this report, the ability of an orally administered poly phenylpropanoid-polysaccharide rich extract of pine cones (PPC) to suppress the generation of IgE and to significantly enhance antigen-specific cellular responses to a variety of vaccines was tested. A variety of vaccine protocols were utilized to determine the affects of orally administered PPC on the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, the production of IgE antibodies, and the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. The effect of PPC on the Th1/Th2 balance in aged mice was also investigated. Oral delivery of PPC was found to significantly suppress serum IgE levels in naïve mice and in mice sensitized to ovalbumin. PPC was also found to enhance the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice immunized with DNA, dendritic cell, and soluble protein vaccines. The suppression of IgE was associated with reduction of IL-4 secretion and the enhanced production of IL-12 and IFNgamma by antigen-stimulated splenocytes from PPC treated mice. PPC also suppressed the Th2 response and enhanced the Th1 response of splenocytes from aged mice. Oral delivery of PPC enhances the generation of an antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses induced by soluble protein, DNA, and dendritic cell vaccines while at the same time suppressing the generation of a Th2 dominant IgE response. This effect on the Th1/Th2 balance was also observed in aged mice.

[Screening for diabetic retinopathy using a three-field digital nonmydriatic fundus camera in the North of France]. To evaluate screening for diabetic retinopathy, using three-field nonmydriatic fundus photography, combined with telemedicine, in two hospitals. Patients from the Endocrinology Department of Saint Philibert Hospital were screened consecutively from March 2007 to September 2008. Three 45 degrees digital images per eye examination were taken using a nonmydriatic fundus camera and sent by intranet to the Department of Ophthalmology of Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital for grading by two ophthalmologists. A total of 1147 patients (52% males, 48% females) were screened. The mean age was 60 years (range, 19-92 years). Most patients had type 2 diabetes (n=1000; 90%). The mean HbA1c was 8%. Microalbuminuria was detected in 239 patients (20.8%). Of these 1147 patients, 521 (45%) said they had never had a fundus examination before. Fundus photography of at least one eye could not be graded in 160 patients (14%). Diabetic retinopathy was detected in 187 patients (19%). Suspected macular edema (hard exudates within one disc diameter of the macular center) was found in 38 patients (3.8%). Referral to an ophthalmologist was required in 347 patients (30%) for diabetic retinopathy and unreadable photographs. During the period of the study, 107 patients had both three-field nonmydriatic photography and dilated funduscopy, which was used as reference. Agreement between the two readers was 0.97. Nonmydriatic photography combined with telemedicine is useful for screening for diabetic retinopathy and identifies patients requiring further complete eye examination. Good collaboration between the two centers is required to improve the follow-up after screening in the future.

How does repetition affect memory? Evidence from judgments of recency. Four experiments were done to investigate the effects of repetition on judgment of recency (JOR). Experiment 1 showed that repetition can make an item seem either more recent or less recent than a nonrepeated item, depending on presentation spacing. Experiments 2-4 showed that subjects are able to judge the recency of a repeated item's first presentation or of its second presentation with a high degree of independence, especially if they report that the item occurred twice. The data are more consistent with an independent-trace explanation of JOR and repetition than with a cumulative-strength account, but neither hypothesis explains how repetition can make an item seem less recent. It is proposed that the findings as a whole can be better explained by a hypothesis based on recursive reminding.

Stent thrombosis: a poor man's disease? Stent thrombosis is a rare but devastating complication of coronary stent implantation. The incidence and potential predictors were assessed in a "real world" single center. To examine whether socioeconomic status indeed affects the occurrence of stent thrombosis. We searched our database for cases of "definite" stent thrombosis (according to the ARC Dublin definitions). Each case was matched by procedure date, age and gender with three cases of stenting that did not result in stent thrombosis. Demographic and clinical parameters were compared and socioeconomic status was determined according to a standardized polling and market survey database. A total of 3401 patients underwent stent implantation in our hospital during the period 2004-2006. Their mean age was 63 +/- 11 years, and 80% were males. Twenty-nine cases (0.85%) of "definite" sub-acute/late stent thrombosis were recorded. Mortality at 30 days was recorded in 1 patient (3.5%). Thrombosis occurred 2 days to 3 years after stent implantation. All patients presented with acute myocardial infarction. Premature clopidogrel discontinuation was reported in 60%. Patients with stent thrombosis had significantly higher rates of AMI at the time of the initial procedure (76 vs. 32%, P < 0.001) and were cigarette smokers (60 vs. 28%, P < 0.001). Drug-eluting stents were used less in the stent thrombosis group. There was no difference in stent diameter or length between the two groups. Socioeconomic status was significantly lower in the stent thrombosis group, 3.4 +/- 2.4 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- SD, scale 1-10, P < 0.01). The incidence rate of stent thrombosis is at least 0.85% in our population. It appears in patients with significantly lower socioeconomic status and with certain clinical predictors. These results warrant stricter follow-up and support the policy of healthcare providers regarding patients at risk for stent thrombosis.

Bacillus methylotrophicus sp. nov., a methanol-utilizing, plant-growth-promoting bacterium isolated from rice rhizosphere soil. A Gram-positive bacterium, designated strain CBMB205(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of traditionally cultivated, field-grown rice. Cells were strictly aerobic, motile, rod-shaped and formed endospores. The best growth was achieved at 30°C and pH 7.0 in ammonium mineral salts (AMS) medium containing 600 mM methanol. A comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis placed strain CBMB205(T) in a clade with the species Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus vallismortis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus, Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus licheniformis and revealed pairwise similarities ranging from 98.2 to 99.2 %. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed a low level (<36 %) of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CBMB205(T) and its closest relatives. The major components of the fatty acid profile were C₁₅:₀ anteiso, C₁₅:₀ iso, C₁₆:₀ iso and C₁₇:₀ anteiso. The diagnostic diamino acid of the cell wall was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 45.0 mol%. The lipids present in strain CBMB205(T) were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, a minor amount of phosphatidylcholine and two unknown phospholipids. The predominant respiratory quinone was MK-7. Studies of DNA-DNA relatedness, morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic analyses and phylogenetic data based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing enabled strain CBMB205(T) to be described as representing a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus methylotrophicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CBMB205(T) (=KACC 13105(T)=NCCB 100236(T)).

Validating an evaluation checklist using a mixed method design. When used in evaluation, checklists provide guidance for the collection of relevant evidence used to determine the merit, worth, or significance of an evaluand. The inherently systematic process found in the use of a checklist makes it highly relevant and useful for evaluative purposes. As such, the value of checklists for evaluation purposes is generally accepted. However, the methods for validating evaluation checklists are less commonly presented and lack specificity with respect to study designs and outcomes. This article addresses this deficit by presenting a case example of a mixed methods validation study applied to an evaluation checklist. The validation approach presented herein is relatively quick and was demonstrated to be feasible on a limited budget all the while providing a reasonable level of validation for the checklist. Following a brief overview of the checklist, the two-part validation study is presented followed by a discussion of the limitations of the methodology.

Humoral immune response to mixed PfAMA1 alleles; multivalent PfAMA1 vaccines induce broad specificity. Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), a merozoite protein essential for red cell invasion, is a candidate malaria vaccine component. Immune responses to AMA1 can protect in experimental animal models and antibodies isolated from AMA1-vaccinated or malaria-exposed humans can inhibit parasite multiplication in vitro. The parasite is haploid in the vertebrate host and the genome contains a single copy of AMA1, yet on a population basis a number of AMA1 molecular surface residues are polymorphic, a property thought to be primarily as a result of selective immune pressure. After immunisation with AMA1, antibodies more effectively inhibit strains carrying homologous AMA1 genes, suggesting that polymorphism may compromise vaccine efficacy. Here, we analyse induction of broad strain inhibitory antibodies with a multi-allele Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) vaccine, and determine the relative importance of cross-reactive and strain-specific IgG fractions by competition ELISA and in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays. Immunisation of rabbits with a PfAMA1 allele mixture yielded an increased proportion of antibodies to epitopes common to all vaccine alleles, compared to single allele immunisation. Competition ELISA with the anti-PfAMA1 antibody fraction that is cross-reactive between FVO and 3D7 AMA1 alleles showed that over 80% of these common antibodies were shared with other PfAMA1 alleles. Furthermore, growth inhibition assays revealed that for any PfAMA1 allele (FVO or 3D7), the cross-reactive fraction alone, on basis of weight, had the same functional capacity on homologous parasites as the total affinity-purified IgGs (cross-reactive+strain-specific). By contrast, the strain-specific IgG fraction of either PfAMA1 allele showed slightly less inhibition of red cell invasion by homologous strains. Thus multi-allele immunisation relatively increases the levels of antibodies to common allele epitopes. This explains the broadened cross inhibition of diverse malaria parasites, and suggests multi-allele approaches warrant further clinical investigation.

Cost-effectiveness of homograft heart valve replacement surgery: an introductory study. The clinical effectiveness of heart valve replacement surgery has been well documented. Mechanical and homograft valves are used routinely for replacement of damaged heart valves. Homograft valves are produced in our country but we import the mechanical valves. To our knowledge the cost-effectiveness of homograft valve has not been assessed. The objective of the present study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of homograft valve replacement with mechanical valve replacement surgery. Our samples were selected from 200 patients that underwent homograft and mechanical heart valve replacement surgery in Imam-Khomeini hospital (2000-2005). In each group we enrolled 30 patients. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 questionnaire and utility was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). For each group we calculated the price of heart valve and hospitalization charges. Finally the cost-effectiveness of each treatment modalities were summarized as costs per QALYs gained. Forty male and twenty female participated in the study. The mean score of quality of life was 66.06 (SD = 9.22) in homograft group and 57.85 (SD = 11.30) in mechanical group (P < 0.05). The mean QALYs gained in homograft group was 0.67 more than mechanical group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) revealed a cost savings of 1,067 US$ for each QALY gained in homograft group. Despite limitation of this introductory study, we concluded that homograft valve replacement was more effective and less expensive than mechanical valve. These findings can encourage healthcare managers and policy makers to support the production of homograft valves and allocate more recourse for developing such activities.

[The relationship among IL-10, TNF gene polymorphisms, Helicobacter pylori infection and gastroduodenal diseases in Hubei Han ethnic]. To study the distribution of IL-10 and TNF gene polymorphisms in patients with gastroduodenal diseases in Hubei Han ethnic and their association with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. Six hundred and five patients with gastroduodenal diseases (196 chronic gastritis, 189 gastroduodenal ulcer and 220 gastric cancer) as well as 624 healthy controls were genotyped with PCR-RFLP method for IL-10-1082,-819,-592 and TNFalpha-308, lymphotoxin-alpha (LTalpha) Nco I and AspH I gene polymorphisms. Hp infection status was determined with ELISA. (1) There was significant difference of IL-10-1082 AG + GG genotype among the gastric cancer group with the non-malignant gastric diseases groups and healthy control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference of IL-10-592 and -819 gene polymorphisms among gastric cancer patients, non-malignant gastric disease patients and healthy controls (P > 0.05). The genotype frequencies of IL-10-819 were the same as those of IL-10-592. (2) Frequency of IL-10-1082 AG + GG genotype in gastric cancer patients with positive Hp was significantly higher than that in the other three groups (P < 0.05). (3) Frequency of LTalpha Nco I AG genotype in gastric cancer patients with Hp infection was significantly higher than that in Hp positive healthy controls (P < 0.05). There were no other associations between TNFalpha-308, LTalpha Nco I and AspH I gene polymorphisms and Hp infection in gastroduodenal diseases. (1) Allele AG + GG of IL-10-1082 was associated with gastric cancer in Han nationality of Hubei province. (2) IL-10-1082 AG + GG, LTalpha Nco I AG heterozygous genotype may be associated with Hp infection in patients with gastric cancer in Han nationality of Hubei province.

Multiple evolutionary rate classes in animal genome evolution. The proportion of functional sequence in the human genome is currently a subject of debate. The most widely accepted figure is that approximately 5% is under purifying selection. In Drosophila, estimates are an order of magnitude higher, though this corresponds to a similar quantity of sequence. These estimates depend on the difference between the distribution of genomewide evolutionary rates and that observed in a subset of sequences presumed to be neutrally evolving. Motivated by the widening gap between these estimates and experimental evidence of genome function, especially in mammals, we developed a sensitive technique for evaluating such distributions and found that they are much more complex than previously apparent. We found strong evidence for at least nine well-resolved evolutionary rate classes in an alignment of four Drosophila species and at least seven classes in an alignment of four mammals, including human. We also identified at least three rate classes in human ancestral repeats. By positing that the largest of these ancestral repeat classes is neutrally evolving, we estimate that the proportion of nonneutrally evolving sequence is 30% of human ancestral repeats and 45% of the aligned portion of the genome. However, we also question whether any of the classes represent neutrally evolving sequences and argue that a plausible alternative is that they reflect variable structure-function constraints operating throughout the genomes of complex organisms.

The bilobed flap in skin cancer of the face: our experience on 285 cases. This article describes how many of the defects caused by oncological surgery can be closed with an easily estended flap. The Zitelli bilobed flap was used to treat 285 consecutive patients with basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); 167 men (58.60%) and 118 women (41.40%) between 45 and 98 years of age. Histologically, 247 BCCs (86.6%) and 38 SCCs (13.4%) were documented. Regarding the site, 148 (51.9%) involved the nose, 51 (17.9%) the cheeks, 36 (12.6%) the preauricular region, 27 (9.5%) the perilabial region and chin and 23 (8.1%) the periorbital region. To measure long-term satisfaction patients responded to a telephone survey consisting of a single global question. The size of the defect following tumour removal was between 1 and 4cm. Carcinomas up to 1cm were treated using a one step procedure with a cryostat test of the surgical margins; all others cases were treated using two step procedure after excision and histological in sano resection. Completely acceptable aesthetic and functional deficits were obtained in 275 (96.4%) patients over a 6-72-month follow-up. Ten (3.6%) patients suffered postoperative complications. Two cases of local infection; one case of completely flap necrosis and seven cases of partial revision due to flap necrosis occurred. The level of satisfaction with the surgical long-term result reported by the patients was high. In our experience the bilobed Zitelli flap for covering defects in the area of the face showed very few complications and good aesthetic results.

High-throughput pooling and real-time PCR-based strategy for malaria detection. Molecular assays can provide critical information for malaria diagnosis, speciation, and drug resistance, but their cost and resource requirements limit their application to clinical malaria studies. This study describes the application of a resource-conserving testing algorithm employing sample pooling for real-time PCR assays for malaria in a cohort of 182 pregnant women in Kinshasa. A total of 1,268 peripheral blood samples were collected during the study. Using a real-time PCR assay that detects all Plasmodium species, microscopy-positive samples were amplified individually; the microscopy-negative samples were amplified after pooling the genomic DNA (gDNA) of four samples prior to testing. Of 176 microscopy-positive samples, 74 were positive by the real-time PCR assay; the 1,092 microscopy-negative samples were initially amplified in 293 pools, and subsequently, 35 samples were real-time PCR positive (3%). With the real-time PCR result as the referent standard, microscopy was 67.9% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.3% to 76.5%) and 91.2% specific (95% CI, 89.4% to 92.8%) for malaria. In total, we detected 109 parasitemias by real-time PCR and, by pooling samples, obviated over 50% of reactions and halved the cost of testing. Our study highlights both substantial discordance between malaria diagnostics and the utility and parsimony of employing a sample pooling strategy for molecular diagnostics in clinical and epidemiologic malaria studies.

Vogesella amnigena sp. nov., isolated from a freshwater river. A bacterial strain, designated Npb-02T, was isolated from a freshwater river in Taiwan and characterized in a taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain Npb-02T were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-accumulating, rod-shaped and non-motile. Growth occurred at 15–40 °C (optimum 25–30 °C), at pH 7.0–8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and with 0–1 % NaCl (optimum 0.5 %). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Npb-02T belonged to the genus Vogesella and was most closely related to Vogesella perlucida DS-28T with sequence similarity of 98.3 %. Strain Npb-02T contained summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c) and C16 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The major respiratory quinone was Q-8.The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an uncharacterized aminophospholipid and an uncharacterized phospholipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Npb-02T was 64.1 mol%. The DNA–DNA hybridization values for strain Npb-02T with Vogesella perlucida DS-28T, Vogesella mureinivorans 389T and Vogesella lacus GR13T were less than 25 %. On the basis of phylogenetic inference and phenotypic data, strain Npb-02T represents a novel species of the genus Vogesella, for which the name Vogesella amnigena sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Npb-02T ( = BCRC 80887T = LMG 28419T = KCTC 42195T).

Financial burden of raising CSHCN: association with state policy choices. We examined the association between state Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) income eligibility and the financial burden reported by low-income families raising children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Data on low-income CSHCN and their families were from the National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs (N = 17039), with a representative sample from each state. State Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility thresholds were from publicly available sources. The 3 outcomes included whether families had any out-of-pocket health care expenditures during the previous 12 months for their CSHCN, amount of expenditure, and expenditures as a percentage of family income. We used multilevel logistic regression to model the association between Medicaid and SCHIP characteristics and families' financial burden, controlling state median income and child- and family-level characteristics. Overall, 61% of low-income families reported expenditures of >$0. Among these families, 30% had expenses between $250 and $500, and 34% had expenses of more than $500. Twenty-seven percent of the families reporting any expenses had expenditures that exceeded 3% of their total household income. The percentage of low-income families with out-of-pocket expenses that exceeded 3% of their income varied considerably according to state and ranged from 5.6% to 25.8%. Families living in states with higher Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility guidelines were less likely to have high absolute burden and high relative burden. Beyond child and family characteristics, there is considerable state-level variability in low-income families' out-of-pocket expenditures for their CSHCN. A portion of this variability is associated with states' Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility thresholds. Families living in states with more generous programs report less absolute and relative financial burden than families living in states with less generous benefits.

Monitoring the genomic stability of in vitro cultured rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that MSCs are good candidates to use as cell therapy in many degenerative diseases. For MSC clinical applications, an adequate number of cells are necessary so an extensive expansion is required. However, spontaneous immortalization and malignant transformation of MSCs after culture expansion have been reported in human and mouse, while very few data are present for rat MSCs (rMSCs). In this study, we monitored the chromosomal status of rMSCs at several passages in vitro, also testing the influence of four different cell culture conditions. We first used the conventional traditional cytogenetic techniques, in order to have the opportunity to observe even minor structural abnormalities and to identify low-degree mosaic conditions. Then, a more detailed genomic analysis was conducted by array comparative genomic hybridization. We demonstrated that, irrespective of culture conditions, rMSCs manifested a markedly aneuploid karyotype and a progressive chromosomal instability in all the passages we analyzed and that they are anything but stable during in vitro culture. Despite the fact that the risk of neoplastic transformation associated with this genomic instability needs to be further addressed and considering the apparent genomic stability reported for in vitro cultured human MSCs (hMSCs), our findings underline the fact that rMSCs may not in fact be a good model for effectively exploring the full clinical therapeutic potential of hMSCs.

Preliminary study on the detection of cardiac arrhythmias based on multiple simultaneous electrograms. Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have improved significantly in the past decades, the algorithms used in the identification of life-threatening arrhythmias are still not accurate enough. Conventional methods commonly misclassify tachycardias, sometimes initiating an unnecessary and uncomfortable treatment. In this paper, we proposed a new method for the identification of ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations based on the comparison of simultaneous electro-grams. Our method could successfully separate supraventricular tachycardias and normal sinus rhythm, which do not require any treatment, from ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation, which are life-threatening arrhythmias and must be terminated, with a sensitivity of 93.0% and a specificity of 92.7% from the comparison of ventricular electrograms. In future studies, the classification using electrograms from the right heart must be improved.

Angiostoma glandicola sp. n. (Nematoda: Angiostomatidae): a parasite in the land snail Megaustenia sp. from the Cat Tien Forest, Vietnam. The nematode Angiostoma glandicola sp. n. found parasitizing Megaustenia sp. snails (Pulmonata: Helicarionidae) collected in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, is described and illustrated. The new species is characterized by its unusual host location (the digestive gland) and in having: two circles of cephalic probolae, six lips each bearing two prominent papillae, amphids situated at posterior of lips, the presence of lateral alae, an enlarged stoma, a club-shaped pharynx with cuticularized valves in the bulb, the nerve ring situated on the junction of the corpus and isthmus and the excretory pore opposite the bulb. Oviparous females have a mid-body vulva position, long reflexed ovaries and short divergent uteri, and a conical tail with a slightly triangular tip. Males have long, curved, not distinctly cephalate spicules and a small gubernaculum, nine pairs of pedunculate genital papillae (GP) incorporated into the bursa (three precloacal, six postcloacal in two groups: GP 4-7 closely behind the cloaca and GP 8-9 distanced), of which GP 5 and 8 terminate on dorsal edge of the bursa and GP 8 and 9 are fused at the base, the bursa nearly reaches the tail tip, unpaired precloacal GP and a pair of ventral circumcloacal GP not incorporated into bursa. It clearly differs from other species of the genus by having cephalic probolae vs. no cephalic probolae and the specific number and disposition of male GP. A partial sequence of D2D3 large subunit (LSU) rDNA was obtained and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Relationships within the Angiostoma genus are discussed.

Palliative resection of the primary tumor in 442 metastasized neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: a population-based, propensity score-matched survival analysis. There is an ongoing debate on whether palliative removal of the primary tumor may result in a survival benefit for patients with incurable stage IV pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (P-NET). The objective of this study was to assess whether palliative resection of the primary tumor in patients with incurable stage IV P-NET has an impact on survival. Patients with stage IV P-NET registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2011 were identified. Those undergoing resection of metastases were excluded. Overall and cancer-specific survival of patients who did and did not undergo resection of their primary tumor were compared by means of risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and propensity score-matched analysis. A total of 442 stage IV P-NET patients were identified, of whom 75 (17.0 %) underwent palliative primary tumor resection. The latter showed a significant benefit in both overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 0.41, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.66, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR of death = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.25-0.67, p < 0.001) in unadjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis; the benefit persisted after propensity score adjustment. This population-based analysis of stage IV P-NET patients provides compelling evidence that palliative resection of the primary tumor is associated with significant survival benefit. Thus, the recent recommendations judging resection of the primary as inadvisable and the accompanying trend towards fewer palliative resections of the primary tumor have to be contested.

Assessment of tissue oxygen saturation during a vascular occlusion test using near-infrared spectroscopy: the role of probe spacing and measurement site studied in healthy volunteers. To assess potential metabolic and microcirculatory alterations in critically ill patients, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used, in combination with a vascular occlusion test (VOT), for the non-invasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), oxygen consumption, and microvascular reperfusion and reactivity. The methodologies for assessing StO2 during a VOT, however, are very inconsistent in the literature and, consequently, results vary from study to study, making data comparison difficult and potentially inadequate. Two major aspects concerning the inconsistent methodology are measurement site and probe spacing. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of probe spacing and measurement site using 15 mm and 25 mm probe spacings on the thenar and the forearm in healthy volunteers and quantified baseline, ischemic, reperfusion, and hyperemic VOT-derived StO2 variables. StO2 was non-invasively measured in the forearm and thenar in eight healthy volunteers during 3-minute VOTs using two InSpectra tissue spectrometers equipped with a 15 mm probe or a 25 mm probe. VOT-derived StO2 traces were analyzed for base-line, ischemic, reperfusion, and hyperemic parameters. Data were categorized into four groups: 15 mm probe on the forearm (F15 mm), 25 mm probe on the forearm (F25 mm), 15 mm probe on the thenar (T15 mm), and 25 mm probe on the thenar (T25 mm). Although not apparent at baseline, probe spacing and measurement site significantly influenced VOT-derived StO2 variables. For F15 mm, F25 mm, T15 mm, and T25 mm, StO2 ownslope was -6.4 +/- 1.7%/minute, -10.0 +/- 3.2%/minute, -12.5 +/- 3.0%/minute, and -36.7 +/- 4.6%/minute, respectively. StO2 upslope was 105 +/- 34%/minute, 158 +/- 55%/minute, 226 +/- 41%/minute, and 713 +/- 101%/minute, and the area under the hyperemic curve was 7.4 +/- 3.8%.minute, 10.1 +/- 4.9%.minute, 12.6 +/- 4.4%.minute, and 21.2 +/- 2.7%.minute in these groups, respectively. Furthermore, the StO2 parameters of the hyperemic phase of the VOT, such as the area under the curve, significantly correlated to the minimum StO2 during ischemia. NIRS measurements in combination with a VOT are measurement site-dependent and probe-dependent. Whether this dependence is anatomy-, physiology-, or perhaps technology-related remains to be elucidated. Our study also indicated that reactive hyperemia depends on the extent of ischemic insult.

Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and function by gated single-photon emission computed tomography technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile in children and adolescents with severe congenital heart disease. The value of gated single-photon emission computed tomography technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI) in children is not yet established probably because gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI has rarely been used in pediatric clinical and research studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perfusion abnormalities and left ventricular (LV) function by gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI in children and adolescents with severe congenital heart disease (CHD). Seventeen children and adolescents with severe CHD (11 boys and six girls, mean age 11+/-4 years) underwent 2-day rest-stress (11 boys) or 1-day rest (six girls) gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by a 17-segment model with a 5-point score to derive the summed stress score, the summed rest score (SRS), and the summed difference score based on the 4D-MSPECT software results. The extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities was also expressed as a percentage of the LV size. The 4D-MSPECT software was used to calculate LV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF). Reversible myocardial perfusion defect was found in 7 of 11 children (64%) who underwent rest-stress gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI. The LV segments involved were anterior, anteroseptal, anterolateral, apical and inferior. These seven children showed significantly larger perfusion abnormalities on stress compared with rest study (18+/-5 vs. 7+/-4%, P<0.01) and higher summed stress score compared to SRS (11+/-4 vs. 4+/-2, P<0.01). Children and adolescents with myocardial ischemia had significantly lower poststress EF than rest EF (53+/-12 vs. 59+/-11%, P<0.05) and significantly higher poststress ESV than rest ESV (81+/-24 vs. 61+/-25 ml, P<0.05). In six children evaluated only at rest, perfusion defects involved anterior, anteroseptal and apical, or inferolateral segments, accounting for 31+/-12% of LV and with SRS of 12+/-5. Their global LV parameters were: end-diastolic volume 118+/-23 ml, ESV 56+/-16 ml, EF 51+/-10%. Poststress and rest-gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI results indicate that children and adolescents with severe CHD show a range of abnormalities in myocardial perfusion and LV function, which is useful for determining functional importance of morphological malformations. Thus, gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI provides complementary information that may guide clinical decision making in children and adolescents with severe CHD.

Perineural spread of cancer along the three trigeminal divisions. Perineural spread of head and neck cancers is a well-documented phenomenon, but the diagnosis is often delayed due to lack of familiarity with clinical manifestations, anatomy of the head and neck, and imaging signs. We present single cases of perineural spread along each of the 3 divisions of the trigeminal nerve in which the perineural spread was initially overlooked. Although perineural spread is often associated with a poor prognosis, earlier detection may improve outcome.

Diagnostic challenges and safety considerations in cochlear implantation under the age of 12 months. To review the current knowledge on cochlear implantation in infancy, regarding diagnostic, surgical and anesthetic challenges. Meta-analysis. EBM level: II. Literature-review from Medline and database sources. Related books were also included. Meta-analyses, prospective controlled studies, prospective/retrospective cohort studies, guidelines, review articles. The diagnosis of profound hearing loss in infancy, although challenging, can be confirmed with acceptable certainty when objective measures (ABR, ASSR, OAEs) and behavioural assessments are combined in experienced centres. Reliable assessment of the prelexical domains of infant development is also important and feasible using appropriate evaluation techniques. Overall, 125 implanted infants were identified in the present meta-analysis; no major anesthetic complication was reported. The rate of surgical complications was found to be 8.8% (3.2% major complications) quite similar to the respective percentages in older implanted children (major complications ranging from 2.3% to 4.1%). Assessment of hearing in infancy is feasible with adequate reliability. If parental expectations are realistic and hearing aid trial unsuccessful, cochlear implantation can be performed in otherwise healthy infants, provided that the attending pediatric anesthesiologist is considerably experienced and appropriate facilities of pediatric perioperative care are readily available. A number of concerns, with regard to anatomic constraints, existing co-morbidities or additional disorders, tuning difficulties, and special phases of the developing child should be also taken into account. The present meta-analysis did not find an increased rate of anesthetic or surgical complications in infant implantees, although long-term follow-up and large numbers are lacking.

The one year outcome after KTP laser vaporization of the prostate according to the calculated vaporized volume. The aim of this study was to develop a new simple method for measuring the vaporized volume and to evaluate the outcome of high-power potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) photoselective laser vaporization. A total of 65 patients, with a mean age of 67.7 yr (range 53 to 85), were included in the primary analysis. The vaporized volume was calculated as the pre-operative volume minus the immediate post-operative volume plus the volume of the defect. For all patients, the subjective and objective parameters improved significantly after surgery. Six and 12 months after surgery, the group with a smaller vaporized volume (<15 g) had a lower reduction of the mean International Prostate Symptom Score (P=0.006 and P=0.004) and quality of life index (P=0.006 and P=0.004) when compared to the group with a greater vaporized volume (>or=15 g). There were no differences in the change of the maximum flow rate and post-void residual based on the vaporized volume. Our findings suggest that the subjective improvement, after a high-power KTP laser vaporization, may be dependent on the vaporized volume obtained after the procedure.

Vigabatrin: a comprehensive review of drug properties including clinical updates following recent FDA approval. Vigabatrin (Sabril) was approved in the USA in mid-2009 for the adjunctive treatment of refractory complex partial seizures and as treatment of infantile spasms. Vigabatrin's more than 30-year history of research and development is condensed into a clinically relevant review pertaining to this 2009 approval. A review of the scientific literature was conducted with special focus given to the drug molecule, its mechanism of action, its effects on living systems (e.g., pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic and toxicologic), and its anticipated role among antiepileptic drugs in the USA. The recent approval of vigabatrin makes a significant addition to antiepileptic drug options. The FDA implemented a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to control for the possibility of severe adverse drug events.

A new sagittal parameter to estimate pelvic tilt using the iliac cortical density line and iliac tilt: a retrospective X-ray measurement study. When spinal kyphosis increases, the compensatory mechanism activates and the pelvic position changes. Increasing the pelvic tilt, which is the orientation of the pelvis with respect to the femoral head, is known to associate with the clinical symptoms in kyphosis in the aging population. It is often difficult to detect the femoral head on radiographs, limiting the ability to determine the pelvic tilt. Therefore, there is a need to establish another parameter independent of the femoral head which closely correlates with the pelvic tilt. Eighty-two adult patients with full-length lateral standing spine radiographs were recruited (mean age: 73.0 years). A new parameter, the iliac cortical density line (a component of the arcuate line of the ilium) and the iliac tilt (defined as the angle between the iliac cortical density line and the vertical), was analyzed to determine the correlation with the pelvic tilt. Both the pelvic tilt (PT) and iliac tilt (IT) could be identified in 67 patients, and a significant correlation was observed between the PT and IT (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). The PT could be estimated using the following formula: PT = IT - 12.9 (in females), PT = IT - 16.7 (in males). The iliac tilt, which can be easily and directly measured using the iliac cortical density line, is a new parameter that can reliably estimate the pelvic tilt even when the femoral head is not detectable on the radiograph.

Comparing effectiveness of risperidone with first-generation antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. This naturalistic retrospective study aims to compare effectiveness of a second-generation antipsychotic medication, risperidone, with first-generation antipsychotic medications (haloperidol and trifluoperazine) in an Asian population with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. A total of 261 patients were assessed for time to discontinuation for any reason and specific reasons of discontinuation, controlling for baseline differences between groups. Some 90% of patients discontinued their antipsychotic medications before 18 months. Median time to discontinuation for any reason in risperidone was 69 days versus first-generation antipsychotic medications of 27 days. Specifically, the risperidone group had a longer time to discontinuation for any reason than haloperidol (HR = 0.61, p = 0.005) and trifluoperazine groups (HR = 0.63, p = 0.03), as well as a longer time to discontinuation due to intolerability of side effects than haloperidol (HR = 0.50, p = 0.008) and trifluoperazine groups (HR = 0.26, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between medications for time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, patient's/family's decisions or other reasons. We conclude that there is a very high rate of discontinuation of the initial antipsychotic medications for various reasons, with risperidone having an overall longer time to discontinuation compared with first-generation antipsychotic medications.

Effects of pre- and postnatal olfactogustatory experience on early preferences at birth and dietary selection at weaning in kittens. The ontogenesis of olfactogustatory preferences has been investigated in various mammals but surprisingly not in domestic cats Felis catus. In a first experiment, we examined how prenatal exposure (25 days prepartum) to a cheese flavor via the mother's diet can influence olfactory preferences of neonatal kittens. During 2-choice tests, 2-day-old kittens oriented first toward the cheese odor experienced in utero more frequently than toward a usual pet food odor. The choice of kittens born to mothers fed with a control diet did not differ from random. In the second experiment, we assessed the role of pre- and postnatal exposure (from 25th day before to 23rd day after birth) to cheese flavor on food preferences in weaned kittens. Forty-five-day-old cats exposed to cheese flavor during uterine and postnatal life via their mothers' diet ate higher amounts of chicken supplemented with cheese flavor than food supplemented with usual pet food flavor. On the other hand, the control group did not exhibit a preference for a specific food. Our results clearly demonstrated that pre- and postnatal olfactogustatory exposure via maternal ingestion influences later olfactory and food preferences of cats.

A systematic review of the experiences and perceptions of the newly qualified nurse in the United Kingdom. A systematic literature review of the experiences and perceptions of newly qualified nurses in the UK during the transition from student to staff nurse. It has been widely recognised that newly qualified nurses experience a period of transition. Over the past decade there has been radical reorganisation of nurse education in the UK which has raised issues of preparation for practice. Searches were made of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE. A systematic review was carried out. Papers were critically reviewed, relevant data were extracted and synthesised. Four themes were identified from the empirical evidence base: transition and change, personal and professional development, pre-registration education, preceptorship and support. Transition remains a stressful experience for newly qualified nurses in the UK. Reasons include an increase in personal and professional development, changes in pre-registration education and lack of support once qualified. Further research is needed to address the current situation in relation to the transition period including pre-registration education, preparation for practice and support in both primary and secondary care.

Decrease of hypervirulent Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 in the Netherlands. After the first outbreaks of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 (North American pulsed-field type 1, restriction endonuclease analysis group BI) in the Netherlands in 2005, a national surveillance programme for C. difficile infection (CDI) was started. Furthermore, national guidelines were developed to rapidly recognise type 027 infections and prevent further spread. The mean incidence of CDI measured in 14 hospitals remained stable throughout the years: an incidence of 18 per 10,000 admissions was seen in 2007 and 2008. Between April 2005 and June 2009 a total of 2,788 samples were available for PCR ribotyping. A decrease was seen in the number and incidence of type 027 after the second half of 2006. In the first half of 2009, the percentage of type 027 isolates among all CDI decreased to 3.0%, whereas type 001 increased to 27.5%. Type 014 was present in 9.3% of the isolates and C. difficile type 078 slightly increased to 9.1%. We conclude that currently there is a significant decrease in type 027-associated CDI in the Netherlands.

OrderRex: clinical order decision support and outcome predictions by data-mining electronic medical records. To answer a "grand challenge" in clinical decision support, the authors produced a recommender system that automatically data-mines inpatient decision support from electronic medical records (EMR), analogous to Netflix or Amazon.com's product recommender. EMR data were extracted from 1 year of hospitalizations (>18K patients with >5.4M structured items including clinical orders, lab results, and diagnosis codes). Association statistics were counted for the ∼1.5K most common items to drive an order recommender. The authors assessed the recommender's ability to predict hospital admission orders and outcomes based on initial encounter data from separate validation patients. Compared to a reference benchmark of using the overall most common orders, the recommender using temporal relationships improves precision at 10 recommendations from 33% to 38% (P < 10(-10)) for hospital admission orders. Relative risk-based association methods improve inverse frequency weighted recall from 4% to 16% (P < 10(-16)). The framework yields a prediction receiver operating characteristic area under curve (c-statistic) of 0.84 for 30 day mortality, 0.84 for 1 week need for ICU life support, 0.80 for 1 week hospital discharge, and 0.68 for 30-day readmission. Recommender results quantitatively improve on reference benchmarks and qualitatively appear clinically reasonable. The method assumes that aggregate decision making converges appropriately, but ongoing evaluation is necessary to discern common behaviors from "correct" ones. Collaborative filtering recommender algorithms generate clinical decision support that is predictive of real practice patterns and clinical outcomes. Incorporating temporal relationships improves accuracy. Different evaluation metrics satisfy different goals (predicting likely events vs. "interesting" suggestions).

Synthesis and application of modular phosphine-phosphoramidite ligands in asymmetric hydroformylation: structure-selectivity relationship. A series of hybrid phosphine-phosphoramidite ligands has been designed and synthesized in moderate yields from chiral BINOL (1,1'-bi-2-naphthol) or NOBIN (2-amino-2'-hydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl). They have achieved highly regio- and enantioselectivities in Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylations of styrene derivatives (branched/linear ratio up to 56.6, ee up to 99 %), vinyl acetate derivatives (up to 98 % ee), and allyl cyanide (up to 96 % ee). Systematic variation of ligand structure showed that the steric factor on the phsophoramidite moiety determined the performance of the ligand. With the increased hindrance, the branched/linear ratio rose, while the ee value dropped in the hydroformylation of styrene. However, the N-substituents did not influence the selectivities much.

Initial UK Experience With a Novel Magnetic Transcutaneous Bone Conduction Device. To assess outcomes with a new transcutaneous bone conduction hearing aid. Patients that underwent implantation with the transcutaneous bone conduction device between November 2013 and May 2014. Hearing rehabilitation using the BAHA Attract. Quality of life measures using Glasgow benefit inventory (GBI) and clinically oriented scale of improvement (COSI). Audiological outcome using word discrimination score. Ten patients were implanted. Significant improvement in GBI and COSI scores comparing preimplantation and postimplantation. An increase in word discrimination scores at 30 dBA, with an increase from 0% unaided to a mean of 50% with the magnetic transcutaneous bone conduction aid and at 50 dBA with an increase from a mean of 31.7% to 88.3%. However, the word discrimination score increase at 30, 50, and 60 dBA was not statistically significant (p = 0.25; Wilcoxon). There was a high level of satisfaction with the device with significant increases in GBI and COSI scores in patients who were previously aided with an acoustic aid. The absence of daily skin hygiene appealed to patients.

Noise induced oscillations in recurrent neural networks. It has been shown that oscillations can be generated by additive Gaussian white noise in a recurrent Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model. Type 1 oscillation was induced with Stochastic Resonance (SR) by additive Gaussian noise at lower amplitudes, while Type 2 oscillation was observed at higher amplitudes. However, the mechanism of Type 2 oscillation is not clear. In this article, we test the hypothesis through computer simulations that the period of the Type 2 oscillation can be affected by temperature in a recurrent neural network in which the recurrent model is constructed by four Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models. Each HH neuron model is driven by Gaussian noise and sub-threshold excitatory synaptic currents with an alpha function from another HH neuron model, and the action potentials (spike firings) of each HH neuron model are transferred to the other HH neuron model via sub-threshold synaptic currents. From spike firing times recorded, the inter spike interval (ISI) histogram was generated, and the periodicity of spike firings was detected from the ISI histogram at each HH neuron model. The results show that the probability of spike firings in the Type1 oscillation is maximized at a specific standard deviation (S.D.) of the Gaussian white noise with SR at 6.3, 15.0 and 25.0 degrees C, while the period of the Type 2 oscillation depends on temperature. It is concluded that the Type1 oscillation can be induced by additive Gaussian white noise on the basis of a synaptic delay in the recurrent HH neuron model, whereas ISIs of the Type 2 oscillation may be determined by refractory periods of HH neuron models.

Restricted replication of the live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine during infection of primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cells. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) strains are associated with cold adapted, temperature sensitive and attenuated phenotypes that have been studied in non-human or immortalized cell cultures as well as in animal models. Using a primary, differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) culture system we compared the replication kinetics, levels of cell-associated viral proteins and virus particle release during infection with LAIV or the corresponding wild type (WT) influenza viruses. At both 33 °C and 37 °C, seasonal influenza virus and an antigenically matched LAIV replicated to similar titers in MDCK cells but seasonal influenza virus replicated to higher titers than LAIV in hNEC cultures, suggesting a greater restriction of LAIV replication in hNEC cultures. Despite the disparity in infectious virus production, the supernatants from H1N1 and LAIV infected hNEC cultures had equivalent amounts of viral proteins and hemagglutination titers, suggesting the formation of non-infectious virus particles by LAIV in hNEC cultures.

Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography with additional steady-state acquisition of the infragenicular arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if addition of infragenicular steady-state (SS) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to first-pass imaging improves diagnostic performance compared with first-pass imaging alone in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) undergoing whole-body (WB) MRA. Twenty consecutive patients with PAD referred to digital-subtraction angiography (DSA) underwent WB-MRA. Using a bolus-chase technique, first-pass WB-MRA was performed from the supra-aortic vessels to the ankles. The blood-pool contrast agent gadofosveset trisodium was used at a dose of 0.03 mmol/kg body weight. Ten minutes after injection of the contrast agent, high-resolution (0.7-mm isotropic voxels) SS-MRA of the infragenicular arteries was performed. Using DSA as the "gold standard," sensitivities and specificities for detecting significant arterial stenoses (>/=50% luminal narrowing) with first-pass WB-MRA, SS-MRA, and combined first-pass and SS-MRA were calculated. Kappa statistics were used to determine intermodality agreement between MRA and DSA. Overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting significant arterial stenoses with first-pass WB-MRA was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.78) and 0.97 (0.94 to 0.99), respectively. In first-pass WB-MRA, the lowest sensitivity was in the infragenicular region, with a value of 0.42 (0.23 to 0.63). Combined analysis of first-pass WB-MRA and SS-MRA increased sensitivity to 0.81 (0.60 to 0.93) in the infragenicular region, with specificity of 0.94 (0.88 to 0.97). Sensitivity and specificity for detecting significant arterial stenoses with isolated infragenicular SS-MRA was 0.47 (0.27 to 0.69) and 0.86 (0.78 to 0.91), respectively. Intermodality agreement between MRA and DSA in the infragenicular region was moderate for first-pass WB-MRA (kappa = 0.49), fair for SS-MRA (kappa = 0.31), and good for combined first-pass/SS-MRA (kappa = 0.71). Addition of infragenicular SS-MRA to first-pass WB MRA improves diagnostic performance.

Forest tree growth response to hydroclimate variability in the southern Appalachians. Climate change will affect tree species growth and distribution; however, under the same climatic conditions species may differ in their response according to site conditions. We evaluated the climate-driven patterns of growth for six dominant deciduous tree species in the southern Appalachians. We categorized species into two functional groups based on their stomatal regulation and xylem architecture: isohydric, diffuse porous and anisohydric, ring porous. We hypothesized that within the same climatic regime: (i) species-specific differences in growth will be conditional on topographically mediated soil moisture availability; (ii) in extreme drought years, functional groups will have markedly different growth responses; and (iii) multiple hydroclimate variables will have direct and indirect effects on growth for each functional group. We used standardized tree-ring chronologies to examine growth of diffuse-porous (Acer, Liriodendron, and Betula) and ring-porous (Quercus) species vs. on-site climatic data from 1935 to 2003. Quercus species growing on upslope sites had higher basal area increment (BAI) than Quercus species growing on mesic, cove sites; whereas, Acer and Liriodendron had lower BAI on upslope compared to cove sites. Diffuse-porous species were more sensitive to climate than ring porous, especially during extreme drought years. Across functional groups, radial growth was more sensitive to precipitation distribution, such as small storms and dry spell length (DSL), rather than the total amount of precipitation. Based on structural equation modeling, diffuse-porous species on upslope sites were the most sensitive to multiple hydroclimate variables (r(2)  = 0.46), while ring-porous species on upslope sites were the least sensitive (r(2)  = 0.32). Spring precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, and summer storms had direct effects on summer AET/P, and summer AET/P, growing season small storms and DSL partially explained growth. Decreasing numbers of small storms and extending the days between rainfall events will result in significant growth reduction, even in regions with relatively high total annual rainfall.

Intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration by Puerto Rican women with severe mental illnesses. Previous research indicates a higher prevalence of victimization among severely mentally ill women. Few studies have either compared these levels across diagnostic categories or evaluated perpetration by the women. We report qualitative and quantitative findings regarding intimate partner violence perpetrated both against and by a sample of 53 Puerto Rican women diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Interviewers shadowed participants for a period of 2 years. Two-thirds of the women with serious mental illness had histories of victimization. However, 23% of the women also reported histories of violence towards their significant others. This was attributed to various reasons, such as anger, revenge, control, and self-defense. Participants described their personal conceptualization of the violence they received and perpetrated. This has implications for programs designed to prevent family violence, for health care professionals in general, and for psychiatrists, who may be called upon to address future risk of victimization or commission of violence.

Biodegradation and biotransformation of organofluorine compounds. The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in nature, and the increasing use of organofluorine compounds in agriculture, human and veterinary medicine, and industry has raised concerns about their fate in the environment. Microorganisms can degrade organofluorine compounds, either via specific enzymatic hydrolysis of the C-F bond, or through transformation by catabolic enzymes with broad substrate specificities. Here our current understanding of organofluorine catabolism in microorganisms is summarised.

Lancemaside A ameliorates colitis by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in TNBS-induced colitis mice. In a preliminary study, we found that lancemaside A, which is a main constituent of Codonopsis lanceolata used as an herbal medicine for inflammatory diseases, potently inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated, TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation of NF-kappaB luciferase reporter gene-transfected 293-hTLR4-hemagglutinin (HA) cells. Therefore, we investigated its inhibitory effect in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice. We measured the ability of lancemaside A to inhibit LPS-stimulated, TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, as well as to inhibit colitis outcomes in TNBS-induced colitis in mice. We also measured levels of the inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6, and their transcription factor, NF-kappaB, in intestinal mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Intrarectal treatment of TNBS in mice caused colon shortening and also increased colonic expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression. Oral administration of lancemaside A (10 and 20 mg/kg), inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in TNBS-induced colitic mice and also decreased colonic expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Lancemaside A inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by TNBS, as well as the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and TLR-4. Lancemaside A also reduced the activity of intestinal bacterial beta-glucuronidase that was induced by TNBS. Lancemaside A ameliorates colitis via inhibition of TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation.

[Development and test-theoretical analysis of an instrument for data collection on patients' preferences and experiences concerning participation in nursing care decisions in acute hospitals]. Patient orientation and patient participation are important aspects of modern health care and should be taken into consideration in the context of nursing care decision-making. The concept of evidence-based nursing also includes patient preferences in participation on decision-making, an area, however, which has not been adequately investigated so far. The aim of the present study was the development and testing of an instrument in German language for collecting data on patients' preferences and the experience of patients regarding their participation in nursing care decision-making in acute hospitals. The generation of items was based on available literature and in collaboration with specialists, using the theoretical model of Charles, Gafni and Whelan (1999). For testing the instrument, data was collected on 967 adult patients in surgical and medical wards of five hospitals in Vienna from October 2007 to March 2008. Test theoretical analyses included checking internal consistency, construct validity and criterion validity. The reliability of the scale preference and experience were confirmed by Cronbach's alpha (> or = 0.84) and the results of item analysis. The construct validity was supported by representing the decision model in the data. The criterion validity (concordant and discriminant validity) was tested with the two external criterions of subjective satisfaction with the information provided and decision making, and was supported by the results both at the level of total scores and at the level of item scores. In summary, the developed instrument represents an adequately reliable and valid test-theoretic, and also model-theoretic instrument for research in the field of evidence-based nursing. Therefore it is capable of gathering new knowledge on patients' preferences on participation in nursing care decision making.

The lameness of King Philip II and Royal Tomb I at Vergina, Macedonia. King Philip II was the father of Alexander the Great. He suffered a notorious penetrating wound by a lance through his leg that was nearly fatal and left him lame in 339 B.C.E. (i.e., 3 y before his assassination in 336 B.C.E.). In 1977 and 1978 two male skeletons were excavated in the Royal Tombs II and I of Vergina, Greece, respectively. Tomb I also contained another adult (likely a female) and a newborn skeleton. The current view is that Philip II was buried in Tomb II. However, the male skeleton of Tomb II bears no lesions to his legs that would indicate lameness. We investigated the skeletal material of Tomb I with modern forensic techniques. The male individual in Tomb I displays a conspicuous case of knee ankylosis that is conclusive evidence of lameness. Right through the overgrowth of the knee, there is a hole. There are no obvious signs that are characteristic of infection and osteomyelitis. This evidence indicates that the injury was likely caused by a severe penetrating wound to the knee, which resulted in an active inflammatory process that stopped years before death. Standard anthropological age-estimation techniques based on dry bone, epiphyseal lines, and tooth analysis gave very wide age ranges for the male, centered around 45 y. The female would be around 18-y-old and the infant would be a newborn. It is concluded that King Philip II, his wife Cleopatra, and their newborn child are the occupants of Tomb I.

Comparison of Accelerated and Standard Hepatitis B Vaccination Schedules in High-Risk Healthy Adults: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. Selecting the most efficient vaccination schedule is an important issue. To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of accelerated hepatitis B vaccination schedules in high-risk healthy adults. We searched controlled trial registers of The Cochrane Library as well as MEDLINE, EMBASE, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for randomized controlled trials published up to December 2013 that compared accelerated hepatitis B vaccine schedules to the standard schedule in adults. The results were presented as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Fixed or random effect models were used for analysis. We identified 10 randomized trials, all with one or more methodological weaknesses. Compared to the standard schedule, most accelerated schedules resulted in higher proportions of healthy vaccines more rapidly reaching anti-hepatitis B antibody levels >10 IU/L (P<0.05) initially and maintaining similar seroprotection rates after 6 months (P>0.05). Although accelerated schedules produced anti-hepatitis B levels higher than the standard schedule for the first month after the initial vaccine dose, they were significantly lower than the standard schedule after 6 months, except for an accelerated schedule that called for a fourth booster injection 12 months after the initial dose. Subjects administered accelerated vaccine schedules had similar compliance rate as those administered the standard schedule over the first 6 months of vaccination (relative risk = 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.21). For rapid seroconversion and almost immediate short-term protection, accelerated vaccination schedules could be useful for at-risk groups. However, additional studies on the long-term protection and effectiveness of the primary doses of accelerated schedules are necessary.

Conditional deletion of neuronal cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in developing forebrain results in microglial activation and neurodegeneration.

Oral malodorous compound inhibits osteoblast proliferation. Oral malodorous compounds including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are causative agents of periodontitis because the toxicities are similar to that of cyanate. Previous studies demonstrated that volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) were highly toxic to periodontal tissues, causing a large reduction in the amount of collagen in human gingival fibroblasts and extracellular matrix as well as, for example, apoptosis, immunologic responses, and matrix metalloproteinase production. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of H2S on the proliferation of osteoblasts and a signaling transduction pathway through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Normal human osteoblasts (NHOst) and murine osteoblasts (cell line MC3T3-E1) were incubated with H2S. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. The effects of H2S on the signal transduction pathways, the MAPK cascade, that control cell proliferation were evaluated in NHOst by determining extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 phosphorylation with a Western blot analysis. After incubating NHOst with H2S for 24 hours, [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA significantly decreased dose-dependently with H(2)S. At a concentration of 100 ng/ml H2S, [3H]thymidine incorporation decreased 79% compared to the control. Similar results were obtained from MC3T3-E1. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 was increased by H2S at 10 minutes after starting the treatment and then decreased time dependently. The activation of ERK1/2 and p38 induced by H2S was inhibited by the specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase ([MEK]; U0126) or p38 (SB203580). H2S inhibited the proliferation of human osteoblastic cells through the MAPK pathway.


Coeliac disease: the association between quality of life and social support network participation.

Absence of aprataxin gene mutations in a Greek cohort with sporadic early onset ataxia and normal GAA triplets in frataxin gene. Phenotype of patients with the aprataxin gene mutation varies and according to previous studies, screening of aprataxin gene could be useful, once frataxin gene mutation is excluded in patients with normal GAA expansion in frataxin gene. In the present study, we sought to determine possible causative mutations in aprataxin gene (all exons and flanking intronic sequences) in 14 Greek patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia all but one without GAA expansion in frataxin gene (1 patient was heterozygous). No detectable point mutation or deletion was found in the aprataxin gene of all the patients. Our results do not confirm the previous studies. This difference may be attributed to the different populations studied and possible different genetic background. It is still questionable whether the screening for aprataxin mutation in Greek patients' Friedreich ataxia phenotype is of clinical importance; larger, multicenter studies are necessary to clarify this issue.

Enhanced tumor radiosensitivity by a survivin dominant-negative mutant. Radiosensitivity of tumors is due to a complex interaction of various factors, it has been reported that survivin also acts as a constitutive and inducible radioresistance factor in a panel of tumor cells and approaches designed to inhibit survivin expression or function may lead to tumor sensitisation to chemical and physical agents. Previously, we found that the plasmid encoding the phosphorylation-defective mouse survivin threonine 34-->alanine mutant complexed to DOTAP-chol liposome (Lip-mS) can suppress murine primary breast carcinoma. However, little is known regarding the biological effect of Lip-mS combined with radiation. The present study was designed to determine whether Lip-mS could enhance the anti-tumor activity of radiation. The Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells treated with a combination of Lip-mS and radiation displayed apparently increased apoptosis compared with those treated with Lip-mS or radiation alone. Mice bearing LLC tumors were treated with intravenous injections of Lip-mS and radiation, the combined treatment significantly reduced mean tumor volume compared with either treatment alone. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect of Lip-mS combined with radiation was greater than their additive effect when compared with the expected effect of the combined treatment. These data suggest that inhibition of survivin using a dominant-negative mutant, survivin T34A, could sensitize LLC cells to radiation efficiently and the synergistic anti-tumor activity may in part result from increasing the apoptosis of tumor cells, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and inducing a tumor-protective immune response in the combined treatment.

Is there a role for maintenance therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia? Maintenance therapy is not part of current standard treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, in other leukaemias, maintenance therapy is used to prolong responses and increase the cure rate. While maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcome in AML, several other maintenance strategies are currently being tested in this disease, including immunotherapy, demethylating agents and targeted therapies. While maintenance chemotherapy does not appear to have a role in AML curative therapy, the novel maintenance strategies currently being tested appear promising and warrant further study.

Effects of airway pressure release ventilation on blood pressure and urine output in children. Increased intrathoracic pressures during airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may compromise systemic venous return resulting in decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion. We sought to study the short-term effect of APRV on blood pressure (BP) and urine output (UO) in children with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Retrospective cohort study. All patients with ALI/ARDS who were admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between 1/00 and 06/04, and who were ventilated with APRV (for at least 12 hr) for worsening oxygenation while on conventional ventilation (CV). Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) score, admitting diagnosis, ventilator settings, gas exchange data, heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), blood pressure (BP), UO, and use of other therapies [sedatives, pressors, inotropes, and intravenous fluid (IVF)]. Eleven patients met our inclusion and exclusion criteria with a mean age of 6.2 +/- 4.8 years (range: 1-15 years), a weight of 35.5 +/- 29.5 kg (range: 12-90 kg), and a PRISM score of 18.4 +/- 9.6 (range: 2-36). Within 10 hrs of APRV, patients' mean airway pressure (Paw) increased from 16.1 +/- 6.6 to 21.1 +/- 5.5 cm of H(2)O (P = 0.04). Despite a higher Paw there were no differences in HR, CVP, BP, UO, IVF and use of other therapies while on CV or APRV (P > 0.10). In children with ALI/ARDS, despite a higher Paw, APRV does not affect BP or UO.


Activation of blood coagulation in chronic urticaria: pathophysiological and clinical implications.

Demography and language competition. Attempts to describe language competition and extinction in a mathematical way have enjoyed increased popularity recently. In this paper I review recent modeling approaches and, based on these findings, propose a model of reaction-diffusion type. I analyze the dynamics of interactions of a population with two monolingual groups and a group that is bilingual in these two languages. The results show that demographic factors, such as population growth or population dispersal, play an important role in the competition dynamic. Furthermore, I consider the impact of two strategies for language maintenance: adjusting the status of the endangered language and adjusting the availability of monolingual and bilingual educational resources.

Silene patula (Siphonomorpha, Caryophyllaceae) in North Africa: a test of colonisation routes using chloroplast markers. Based on morphological characters, the North African Silene patula has been divided into two subspecies, ssp. patula found North of Kabylies and Atlas Mountains, and ssp. amurensis found south of these regions. In order to test the hypothesis that S. patula could have derived from S. italica through the Sicilian Channel during the Messinian, we sequenced three chloroplast loci, trnH-psbA, trnS-trnG and rpl12-rps20. Fifteen haplotypes were found on 211 herbarium specimens, associated with a huge differentiation within species. The hypothesis that S. patula had independently evolved as two different subspecies North and South of the mountains is refuted and a morphological adaptation to different pollinators is suggested to explain the differences between the two taxa. The Kabylies-Numidie-Kroumirie gathers a large proportion of haplotypes, which points to this region as a probable refugium or place of origin from which spatial expansions have subsequently occurred towards Morocco and the Aurès Mountains.

Variability in short-wavelength automated perimetry among peri- or postmenopausal women: a dependence on phyto-oestrogen consumption? To determine whether the hill of vision for Short-Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) is shallower for women who consume phyto-oestrogen-rich foods than for women who do not. Visual field data were compared for two groups of healthy amenorrhoeic women 48-69 years-old with normal vision and not using hormone replacement: (1) 24 subjects who reported consuming soy and/or flax products and (2) 20 subjects who reported not consuming these products. Two types of 24-2 visual fields were measured: (1) Full Threshold SWAP and (2) a white-on-white (W/W) field obtained using a Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA Standard). The reduction of SWAP sensitivity from the centre of the field (4 loci, mean eccentricity = 4.2°) to the periphery (20 loci, mean eccentricity = 21.9°) was less for soy/flax consumers than for nonconsumers, both with age-referencing (mean difference = 1.7 dB, p = 0.018) and without (p = 0.012). Corresponding distinctions existed for the SWAP - W/W difference, and there was minimal effect for W/W fields alone. The peripheral age-referenced SWAP sensitivities averaged 2.5 dB higher for consumers than nonconsumers (p = 0.022). The between-group distinctions are consistent with the possibility (derived from the women's health literature) that phyto-oestrogens may counteract a decline of short-wavelength-sensitive cone-mediated response among postmenopausal women. These results suggest another potential application for SWAP outside its original intended purpose as a glaucoma test. Future studies should assess whether phyto-oestrogen consumption is most beneficial for women who are sufficiently young and/or not too far beyond menopause.

Two novel/ancient myosins in mammalian skeletal muscles: MYH14/7b and MYH15 are expressed in extraocular muscles and muscle spindles. The mammalian genome contains three ancient sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MYH) genes, MYH14/7b, MYH15 and MYH16, in addition to the two well characterized clusters of skeletal and cardiac MYHs. MYH16 is expressed in jaw muscles of carnivores; however the expression pattern of MYH14 and MYH15 is not known. MYH14 and MYH15 orthologues are present in frogs and birds, coding for chicken slow myosin 2 and ventricular MYH, respectively, whereas only MYH14 orthologues have been detected in fish. In all species the MYH14 gene contains a microRNA, miR-499. Here we report that in rat and mouse, MYH14 and miR-499 transcripts are detected in heart, slow muscles and extraocular (EO) muscles, whereas MYH15 transcripts are detected exclusively in EO muscles. However, MYH14 protein is detected only in a minor fibre population in EO muscles, corresponding to slow-tonic fibres, and in bag fibres of muscle spindles. MYH15 protein is present in most fibres of the orbital layer of EO muscles and in the extracapsular region of bag fibres. During development, MYH14 is expressed at low levels in skeletal muscles, heart and all EO muscle fibres but disappears from most fibres, except the slow-tonic fibres, after birth. In contrast, MYH15 is absent in embryonic and fetal muscles and is first detected after birth in the orbital layer of EO muscles. The identification of the expression pattern of MYH14 and MYH15 brings to completion the inventory of the MYH isoforms involved in sarcomeric architecture of skeletal muscles and provides an unambiguous molecular basis to study the contractile properties of slow-tonic fibres in mammals.

UEFA injury study: a prospective study of hip and groin injuries in professional football over seven consecutive seasons. Groin injury is a common injury in football and a complicated area when it comes to diagnosis and therapy. There is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological data on groin injuries in professional football. To investigate the incidence, pattern and severity of hip and groin injuries in professional footballers over seven consecutive seasons. Prospective cohort study. European professional football. During the 2001/2 to 2007/8 seasons, between nine and 17 clubs per season (23 clubs in total) were investigated, accounting for 88 club seasons in total. Time loss injuries and individual exposure during club and national team training sessions and matches were recorded. Injury incidence. A total of 628 hip/groin injuries were recorded, accounting for 12-16% of all injuries per season. The total injury incidence was 1.1/1000 h (3.5/1000 match hours vs 0.6/1000 training hours, p<0.001) and was consistent over the seasons studied. Eighteen different diagnostic entities were registered, adductor (n = 399) and iliopsoas (n = 52) related injuries being the most common. More than half of the injuries (53%) were classified as moderate or severe (absence of more than a week), the mean absence per injury being 15 days. Reinjuries accounted for 15% of all registered injuries. In the 2005/6 to 2007/8 seasons, 41% of all diagnoses relied solely on clinical examination. Hip/groin injuries are common in professional football, and the incidence over consecutive seasons is consistent. Hip/groin injuries are associated with long absences. Many hip/groin diagnoses are based only on clinical examination.

Positional effects of the matrix attachment region on  transgene expression in stably transfected CHO cells. Previous work has shown that the MAR (matrix attachment region) could increase transgene expression in stably transfected CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells. To study the positional effect of MAR on transgene expression, three expression vectors were constructed which contained the human beta-globin MAR in different sites, including the vector with two MARs flanking the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) expression cassette, one MAR at the 59 or 39 site. These vectors were transfected into CHO cells. The level of CAT gene expression was most effectively increased by two MARs flanking the CAT expression cassette. This increase was also seen when MAR was inserted at the 59 site upstream of the expression cassette, whereas the transgene expression level decreased when MAR was inserted at the 39 site downstream of the expression cassette. We have also shown that the transgene expression level is not directly proportional to the gene copy number, and gene copy number dependency does not exist.

Classic respiratory disease but atypical diagnostic testing distinguishes adult presentation of cystic fibrosis. The majority of new cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are diagnosed before age 2 years. Diagnoses in older individuals have increased because of improved genetic testing and increased awareness of the disease. A comprehensive description of clinical, genetic, and microbiologic characteristics of adult-age presentation of CF does not exist. We compare newly diagnosed CF in adults with newly diagnosed CF in children and adolescents in the United States. This is a cross-sectional study of new CF diagnoses from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry between 1995 and 2005. Diagnostic, microbiologic, and clinical features during year of diagnosis were analyzed for subjects by age group. Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables on characteristics by age group. A total of 9,766 new diagnoses of CF were reported to the Registry between 1995 and 2005. The proportion of adult diagnoses increased significantly in the years 2001 to 2005 as compared with 1995 to 2000 (9.0% vs 7.7%, P = .012). FEV(1)% predicted decreased with increasing age at diagnosis (P < .001). Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most common in adults (P < .001). Both the number of positive sweat chloride tests and prevalence of DeltaF508 mutation, the most common mutation in the United States, decreased significantly with older age at diagnosis (P < .001). Between 1995 and 2005, the proportion of new diagnoses of CF in adults in the United States increased significantly. Adults present with commonly described CF respiratory disease (Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and reduced lung function), but have lower sweat chloride values and lower frequency of DeltaF508 mutation. Knowledge of clinical characteristics and diagnostic limitations of adult patients presenting with CF will hopefully lead to earlier recognition and intervention.

Bovine Muc1 inhibits binding of enteric bacteria to Caco-2 cells. Inhibition of bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial receptors by the consumption of natural food components is an attractive strategy for the prevention of microbial related gastrointestinal illness. We hypothesised that Muc1, a highly glycosylated mucin present in cows' milk, may be one such food component. Purified bovine Muc1 was tested for its ability to inhibit binding of common enteric bacterial pathogens to Caco-2 cells grown in vitro. Muc1 caused dose-dependent binding inhibition of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. This inhibition was more pronounced for the Gram negative compared with Gram positive bacteria. It was also demonstrated that Muc1, immobilised on a membrane, bound all these bacterial species in a dose-dependent manner, although there was greater interaction with the Gram negative bacteria. A range of monosaccharides, representative of the Muc1 oligosaccharide composition, were tested for their ability to prevent binding of E. coli and S. Typhimurium to Caco-2 cells. Inhibition was structure dependent with sialic acid, L(-) fucose and D(+) mannose significantly inhibiting binding of both Gram negative species. N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine significantly inhibited binding of E. coli whilst galactose, one of the most abundant Muc1 monosaccharides, showed the strongest inhibition against S. Typhimurium. Treatment with sialidase significantly decreased the inhibitory properties of Muc1, demonstrating the importance of sialic acid in adhesion inhibition. It is concluded that bovine Muc1 prevents binding of bacteria to human intestinal cells and may have a role in preventing the binding of common enteropathogenic bacteria to human intestinal epithelial surfaces.


Expression and function of p-glycoprotein in normal tissues: effect on pharmacokinetics.

Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to evaluate striatal dopamine release elicited by subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), an effective neurosurgical therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), may act via eliciting neurotransmitter release. However, the precise relationships between DBS and neurotransmitter release are not established. One issue in these studies may be analytical limitations of microdialysis and positron emission tomography, the primary measurement technologies employed. Limitations may be overcome by microsensors, which exhibit improved temporal and spatial resolution. Here we assess fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at a carbon-fiber microelectrode (CFM) for monitoring a putative DBS neurotransmitter, dopamine, during stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a DBS target for PD. These results, obtained in the anesthetized rat, suggest that real-time microsensors are a suitable approach for testing the neurotransmitter release hypothesis of DBS action.

The limited effectiveness of legislation against female genital mutilation and the role of community beliefs in Upper East Region, Ghana. Female genital mutilation (FGM) has long been practised in many communities in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Although the Ghanaian state has a long tradition of supporting women's rights, it has not been successful in eradicating FGM, despite a law against the practice in an amendment to the Criminal Code in 1994 and the Domestic Violence Act 2003. This qualitative study in the Upper East Region examined the role of the state in stopping the practice of FGM through legal means, and why FGM continues to be practised in the community. In-depth interviews were conducted with six state officials, a circumciser, the president of a women's advocacy organisation, and semi-structured interviews with 32 community members. Although FGM has been criminalised, political support to ensure that the law is effectively implemented has been lacking. FGM education and eradication must be given more priority and significant funding by the Ghanaian state. For interventions to be effective, legal measures need to be combined with social measures. Communities practising FGM must be involved in the planning and implementation of anti-FGM interventions. Successful eradication of the practice is possible if education and dialogue between state institutions, gender and human rights groups and practising communities is strengthened.

Primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation with statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids: review of evidence and clinical relevance. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia that now stands at epidemic proportion, with more than 2.3 million people affected in the USA and over 4.5 million people affected in Western Europe. AF is an expression of underlying heart disease and is increasingly associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodeling of the atria, which relates to AF itself, to changes associated with aging and to progression of the underlying heart disease. Traditionally, AF has been addressed only after it has already presented with pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies designed for rhythm or rate control (secondary prevention). Although secondary prevention is the most feasible approach at present, the concept of primary prevention of AF with therapies aimed at preventing the development of substrate and correcting the risk factors for AF has emerged as a strategy, which is likely to produce a larger effect in the general population. Recent experiments provided new insights into AF pathophysiology, which generated background for new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. In this respect, drugs that are not traditionally antiarrhythmic such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown an antiarrhythmic potential in addition to any treatment effect on the underlying disease. These agents are thought to have an advantage of targeting both the occurrence and progression of the substrate for AF, thus, providing primary and secondary prevention of the arrhythmia. Although first experimental and hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses have been encouraging, several larger, properly designed, prospective trials have not confirmed earlier observations. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventative and reverse remodeling role of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.

Hearing illusory sounds in noise: the timing of sensory-perceptual transformations in auditory cortex.

A motion-based approach to abdominal clutter reduction. In ultrasound images, clutter is a noise artifact most easily observed in anechoic or hypoechoic regions. It appears as diffuse echoes overlying anatomical structures of diagnostic importance, obscuring tissue borders and reducing image contrast. A novel clutter reduction method for abdominal images is proposed, wherein the abdominal wall is displaced during successive-frame image acquisitions. A region of clutter distal to the abdominal wall was observed to move with the abdominal wall, and finite impulse response (FIR) and blind source separation (BSS) motion filters were implemented to reduce this clutter. The proposed clutter reduction method was tested in simulated and phantom data and applied to fundamental and harmonic in vivo bladder and liver images from 2 volunteers. Results show clutter reductions ranging from 0 to 18 dB in FIR-filtered images and 9 to 27 dB in BSS-filtered images. The contrast-to-noise ratio was improved by 21 to 68% and 44 to 108% in FIR- and BSS-filtered images, respectively. Improvements in contrast ranged from 4 to 12 dB. The method shows promise for reducing clutter in other abdominal images.

Dual-tract transhepatic U-shaped hemodialysis inferior vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a swine model. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a U-shaped inferior vena cava (IVC) catheter entirely from a transhepatic approach and to determine the catheter caliber that would provide adequate flow for hemodialysis. Three pigs (weight, 45-50 kg) were used. A peripheral right hepatic vein was accessed transhepatically by using a 22-gauge needle, and a 0.018-inch wire was passed into the hepatic veins and IVC. An accessory right hepatic vein was accessed from the IVC. A snare was deployed in the accessory vein and used as a target for a second transhepatic 22-gauge needle pass. A wire was snared through the second transhepatic tract, around into the IVC, and through the first transhepatic tract. The 0.018-inch wire was upsized to a 0.035-inch platform. Measurements where made to tailor a U-shaped catheter from simple 10.2- and 12-F tubes by cutting them longitudinally (single long side hole) along the length of the IVC segment. The U-shaped hemodialysis catheter was placed over the wire and positioned so that the catheter opening lay in the IVC. With use of a dialysis machine, pressures and flow tolerance at set flow rates (100, 200, 300, 350, and 400 mL/min) were tested. All pigs underwent and survived successful catheter placements. All 10.2- and 12-F catheters tolerated flow rates up to 350 and 400 mL/min, respectively. Establishing a U-shaped hemodialysis catheter with an entirely transhepatic approach is technically feasible. The 10.2-F U-shaped dialysis catheters provided a flow rate (>350 mL/min) that is appropriate for hemodialysis in human clinical settings.

Skull and buccal cavity allometry increase mass-specific engulfment capacity in fin whales. Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) represent not only some of the largest animals of all time, but also exhibit a wide range in intraspecific and interspecific body size. Balaenopterids are characterized by their extreme lunge-feeding behaviour, a dynamic process that involves the engulfment of a large volume of prey-laden water at a high energetic cost. To investigate the consequences of scale and morphology on lunge-feeding performance, we determined allometric equations for fin whale body dimensions and engulfment capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that larger fin whales have larger skulls and larger buccal cavities relative to body size. Together, these data suggest that engulfment volume is also allometric, increasing with body length as L(3.5)(body). The positive allometry of the skull is accompanied by negative allometry in the tail region. The relative shortening of the tail may represent a trade-off for investing all growth-related resources in the anterior region of the body. Although enhanced engulfment volume will increase foraging efficiency, the work (energy) required to accelerate the engulfed water mass during engulfment will be relatively higher in larger rorquals. If the mass-specific energetic cost of a lunge increases with body size, it will have major consequences for rorqual foraging ecology and evolution.

Dysregulation of germinal centres in autoimmune disease. In germinal centres, somatic hypermutation and B cell selection increase antibody affinity and specificity for the immunizing antigen, but the generation of autoreactive B cells is an inevitable by-product of this process. Here, we review the evidence that aberrant selection of these autoreactive B cells can arise from abnormalities in each of the germinal centre cellular constituents--B cells, T follicular helper cells, follicular dendritic cells and tingible body macrophages--or in the supply of antigen. As the progeny of germinal centre B cells includes long-lived plasma cells, selection of autoreactive B cells can propagate long-lived autoantibody responses and cause autoimmune diseases. Elucidation of crucial molecular signals in germinal centres has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Statins inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human endothelial cells: anti-angiogenic actions possibly contributing to plaque stability. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is increased in inflammation and angiogenesis and also in atherosclerotic plaques, where it co-localizes with metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in the fibrous cap weakening. Insight into the regulation of COX-2 and MMP-9 expression suggests the involvement of a Rho-dependent pathway. Because statins interfere with Rho activation, we investigated the statin effect on COX-2 and MMP expressions in the human endothelium. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were incubated with endothelial cells for 12 h before stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate or tumour necrosis factor-alpha, for times suitable to assess the endothelial tube differentiation on Matrigel and COX-2 and MMPs activities, proteins, and mRNA expressions. At 0.1-10 micromol/L, both statins reduced COX-2 expression and activity, without affecting COX-1. The statin effect was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and mimicked by the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase, indicating the involvement of Rho in the signal transduction pathway leading to COX-2 expression. In parallel, statins, as well as COX-2 inhibitors, reduced the MMP-9 stimulated release and the endothelial tubular differentiation. In the human vascular endothelium, statins reduce COX-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity. Through this mechanism, statins exert an anti-angiogenic effect possibly contributing to the cholesterol-lowering-unrelated protective effects of statins against plaque inflammatory angiogenesis and rupture.

Dietary acrylamide intake and estrogen and progesterone receptor-defined postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Acrylamide, a potential human carcinogen, has been discovered in a variety of heat-treated carbohydrate-rich food products. Previously, dietary acrylamide intake was shown to be associated with endocrine-related cancers in humans. We assessed the association between dietary acrylamide intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer stratified by estrogen and progesterone receptor status. This study was embedded within the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer, which was initiated in 1986 enrolling 62,573 women aged 55-69 years at baseline. After 13.3 years of follow-up, 2225 incident breast cancer cases were ascertained, with hormone receptor status information for 43%. Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to determine hazard ratios in quintiles of dietary acrylamide intake stratifying on estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and smoking status. No association was observed for overall breast cancer or receptor-negative breast cancer risk, irrespective of smoking status. A statistically non-significantly increased risk of ER positive, PR positive and joint receptor-positive breast cancer was found in never-smoking women. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 1.31 (95% CI: 0.87-1.97, P (trend) = 0.26) for ER+, 1.47 (0.86-2.51, P (trend) = 0.14) for PR+, and 1.43 (0.83-2.46, P (trend) = 0.16) for ER+PR+, when comparing women in the highest quintile of acrylamide intake (median 36.8 microg/day) to women in the lowest (median 9.5 microg/day). This study showed some indications of a positive association between dietary acrylamide intake and receptor-positive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal never-smoking women. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute our observations.

The astronomical orientation of ancient Greek temples. Despite its appearing to be a simple question to answer, there has been no consensus as to whether or not the alignments of ancient Greek temples reflect astronomical intentions. Here I present the results of a survey of archaic and classical Greek temples in Sicily and compare them with temples in Greece. Using a binomial test I show strong evidence that there is a preference for solar orientations. I then speculate that differences in alignment patterns between Sicily and Greece reflect differing pressures in the expression of ethnic identity.

Comparison of Staphopain A (ScpA) and B (SspB) precursor activation mechanisms reveals unique secretion kinetics of proSspB (Staphopain B), and a different interaction with its cognate Staphostatin, SspC. The scpAB and sspABC operons of Staphylococcus aureus encode Staphopain cysteine proteases ScpA and SspB, and their respective Staphostatins ScpB and SspC, which are thought to protect against premature activation of Staphopain precursors during protein export. However, we found that the proSspB precursor was secreted and activated without detriment to S. aureus in the absence of SspC function. Our data indicate that this is feasible due to a restricted substrate specificity of mature SspB, a stable precursor structure and slow secretion kinetics. In contrast, mature ScpA had a broad substrate specificity, such that it was prone to autolytic degradation, but also was uniquely able to degrade elastin fibres. Modelling of proScpA relative to the proSspB structure identified several differences, which appear to optimize proScpA for autocatalytic activation, whereas proSspB is optimized for stability, and cannot initiate autocatalytic activation. Consequently, recombinant proSspB remained stable and unprocessed when retained in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, whereas proScpA initiated rapid autocatalytic activation, leading to capture of an activation intermediate by ScpB. We conclude that the status of sspBC in S. aureus, as paralogues of the ancestral scpAB genes, facilitated a different activation mechanism, a stable proSspB isoform and modified Staphostatin function.

[Carbon and nitrogen storages and allocation in tree layers of Fraxinus mandshurica and Larix gmelinii plantations]. By the methods of wood analysis and sequential soil core, the biomass and productivity of the tree layers in 20-year old Fraxiuns mandshurica and Larix gmelinii plantations, as well as the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storages in the above- and below-ground organs of the stands, were estimated. The biomass of F. mandshurica and L. gmelinii was 6815.10 g x m(-2) and 9295.95 g x m(-2), in which, stem occupied 57.32% and 58.01%, and fine roots occupied 2.67% and 1.80%, respectively. The annual productivity of F. mandshurica and L. gmelinii was 1618.16 and 2102.45 g x m(-2) x a(-1), in which, stem accounted for 39.34% and 46.70%, and fine roots accounted for 12.06% and 5.25%, respectively. The C content in the organs of F. mandshurica was lower than that of L. gmelinii, while the N content was in adverse. The C storage of F. mandshurica was lower than that of L. gmelinii, while the N storage had no significant difference between the two tree species. The biomass, productivity, and C and N storages of aboveground organs were lower for F. mandshurica than for L. gmelinii, indicating the higher construction efficiency of the aboveground part of L. gmelinii. Due to the significant differences in the C and N contents between tree species and between the organs of same tree species, the measurement should be made on different tree species and different organs to have an accurate estimation of forest C and N storages.

Late enhancement and myocardial perfusion in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (comparison between groups). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective method to study hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To evaluate, using MRI, the parameters of systolic function, perfusion and myocardial viability in patients with HCM, comparing the groups with and without obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Twenty-one patients with a diagnosis of HCM underwent the assessment of myocardial function, viability and perfusion under stress and at rest through MRI. The ventricular segments most severely impaired by hypertrophy were those of the septal region. The obstructive group presented segmental myocardial thickening distribution similar to the non-obstructive group, but with higher means than the first group. The mean ejection fraction of the patients in the obstructive group was higher than in the non-obstructive group, whereas the means of the end systolic and diastolic volumes were lower in the obstructive group. There was a positive correlation between the ventricular segmental thickening and the late enhancement segmental mass. The stress induction resulted in an increase in the number of segments with perfusion alterations and this alteration was more evident in the obstructive group. The thickest ventricular segments are the septal ones. The hypertrophic regions are associated to a greater extension of late enhancement. There was a positive correlation between the areas of ventricular hypertrophy and altered myocardial perfusion and these findings were more evident in the obstructive group.

Model for muscle regeneration around fibrotic lesions in recurrent strain injuries. The purpose of this study was to establish an in vivo model for muscle regeneration after strain injury in the presence of a fibrotic discontinuity. The musculus soleus of 5-wk-old male rats was exposed, completely lacerated, and sutured together with or without a collagen scaffold in between the muscle ends. The scaffold represents a fibrotic discontinuity in the muscle. Muscle healing was evaluated after 14 d by general histology and staining for myofibroblasts, satellite cells (activated), and inflammatory cells. Around all wounds, satellite cells were activated. Inside the collagen scaffolds, satellite cells were absent, indicating that muscle regeneration was impaired. In the wounds without a collagen scaffold, the lacerated and the sutured myofibers contacted and had already started to regenerate, whereas this did not occur with an implanted scaffold. A fibrotic discontinuity, such as an implanted collagen scaffold, delays muscle regeneration in skeletal muscle. This model is suitable to study skeletal muscle regeneration in the presence of a fibrotic lesion and to evaluate new treatment modalities for muscle strain injuries.

Splenic stromal cells mediate IL-7 independent adult lymphoid tissue inducer cell survival. Lymphoid tissue inducer cells (LTi) play an important role in the development of lymphoid tissue in embryos. Adult CD4(+)CD3(-) LTi-like cells present a similar phenotype and gene expression to their embryonic counterpart and have important roles in CD4(+) T-cell memory and lymphoid tissue recovery following viral infection. However, adult LTi-like cells are heterogeneous populations and the factors that regulate their survival and accumulation within secondary lymphoid organs remain unclear, in particular whether the T-zone stroma is involved. Here we report the identification and characterization of a distinct subset of podoplanin(+) murine splenic stromal cells that support adult LTi-like cell survival. We have identified and isolated CD45(-)podoplanin(+) stromal cell populations which have a similar but distinct phenotype to T-zone reticular cells in LN. CD45(-)podoplanin(+) fibroblast-like cells mediate LTi-like cell survival in vitro; surprisingly this was not dependent upon IL-7 as revealed through blocking Ab experiments and studies using LTi-like cells unable to respond to gamma chain cytokines. Our findings show that adult LTi-like cells require extrinsic signals from podoplanin(+) splenic stromal cells to survive and suggest that IL-7 is not necessary to mediate their survival in the adult spleen.

A comparison of antirrhinoside distribution in the organs of two related Plantaginaceae species with different reproductive strategies. A study of two related plants (Antirrhinum majus L. and Linaria vulgaris Mill.) containing the same defensive compound (the iridoid glucoside, antirrhinoside) but with reproductive strategies that differ during ontogeny was undertaken. Young leaves are important to plants due to their higher photosynthetic rates and, therefore, should be better protected with higher concentrations of defensive compounds such as antirrhinoside. Declining concentrations of antirrhinoside as leaves aged was found for A. majus but this was generally not the case for L. vulgaris. Concentrations of antirrhinoside in root tissue were low and constant throughout ontogeny for A. majus whereas for L. vulgaris root levels of antirrhinoside were high during the period when vegetative growth is its sole means of reproduction. Antirrhinoside in L. vulgaris roots declined relative to A. majus roots during budding and flowering. During flowering, significantly less antirrhinoside and relative biomass are devoted to L. vulgaris flowers than in A. majus. While these findings are consistent with Optimal Defense Theory (ODT) further work on the distribution of antirrhinoside and the effect of insect herbivory on plant fitness in other related species is needed.

The effect of aging on human skeletal muscle mitochondrial and intramyocellular lipid ultrastructure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ultrastructural changes in intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and mitochondria occur with aging. Muscle samples were analyzed from 24 young and 20 old, equally active, individuals for IMCL and mitochondria quantity and size as well as their association. Old men had larger IMCL droplets than all other groups in the total muscle area. Old individuals showed higher IMCL content in the subsarcolemmal area. Young participants had a greater number of mitochondria compared with old participants in both fiber regions and greater enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase. The fraction of IMCL touching mitochondria was lowest in old women in the total area and in old men in the subsarcolemmal region. In summary, older adults have larger IMCL droplets, fewer mitochondria, and a lower proportion of IMCL in contact with mitochondria. These factors likely contribute to age-related reductions in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism.

Expression pattern of HLA class I antigens in renal cell carcinoma and primary cell line cultures: methodological implications for immunotherapy. Renal cell carcinomas have developed various strategies to escape immune cell recognition, including down-regulation or loss of classic HLA class I antigens (A, B, C) and aberrant expression of non-classic HLA class I antigens (G, E). In this study both classic and non-classic HLA class I antigens were tested in tumor specimens and established primary cell cultures derived from renal cell carcinoma patients. HLA class I antigens were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and the intensity of cytoplasmic staining was measured semiquantitatively. Renal tumor tissue obtained from nephrectomy was used for the explant culture. MTT assay was performed to test the chemoresistance of primary cell line cultures to common cytostatics. HLA-G and HLA-E were found in 62% and 100% of the analyzed tumor samples, respectively. Markedly higher levels of the non-classic HLA-G and -E antigens compared with the classic HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens were observed. The cells of the control renal tissues were HLA-A, -B, -C, and -E positive and HLA-G negative. Cell line cultures were successfully established in 85% of the renal cell carcinoma specimens. No or minimal changes in classic HLA-A, B, and C antigen staining were observed during cultivation of the primary cell line cultures. No correlation between HLA class I antigen expression and chemoresistance, histopathological stage, or nuclear grade was found. These findings suggest that primary cell line cultures derived from surgical specimens of renal cell carcinomas are a feasible model for immunotherapy research through their high cultivation potential.

Sleep architecture and attenuated heart rate response to arousal from sleep in patients with autonomic failure. To determine if patients with autonomic failure have increased sleep disturbances and if multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) patients have frequent arousals from sleep associated with an attenuated heart rate (HR) response compared to healthy volunteers. With informed consent, 10 autonomic failure patients and 10 healthy volunteers were studied. Sleep disturbances were scored using standard criteria. Arousals were identified from stage 2 sleep and differences in the R-R interval between groups were tested using a mixed-model regression analysis. Three MSA and one PAF patient had obstructive sleep apnoea compared to one volunteer. One MSA and three PAF patients had periodic limb movements. One MSA patient had REM behaviour disorder. The autonomic patients had significantly reduced total sleep time (p=0.007) and sleep efficiency (p=0.003). The HR response to arousal was smaller in autonomic failure patients compared to volunteers during the early phase of the arousal (p=0.047), but not the later phase (p=0.67). Autonomic failure patients have increased sleep disturbances compared to healthy volunteers. The smaller HR response in autonomic failure patients suggests that an intact sympathetic nervous system is a key component of the HR response associated with arousal from sleep.

Capacitive on-line hematocrit sensor design based on impedance spectroscopy for use in hemodialysis machines. This paper presents a new design for an on-line and in-line hematocrit (HCT) sensor. Special feature of the sensor is the capability to measure the hematocrit of a blood sample inside standard plastic tubing widely used in medical equipment. No blood sample has to be extracted out of existing extracorporeal blood circulation systems such as hemodialysis machines or heart-lung machines. The sensor principle is based on electrical impedance spectroscopy. Dielectric properties of the blood and the plastic tubing are measured at various frequencies. In order to optimize the sensitivity, a unique electrode configuration is developed and optimized by Finite Element Simulation. The new electrode design optimizes the overall sensitivity of the sensor towards a change in dielectric properties of the blood caused by the HCT value and therefore decreases the sensitivity to side effects caused by temperature drift and component tolerances. As a result of the optimized overall sensor performance the complexity of a sensor readout circuitry can be reduced to a minimum which leads to an unmatched price-performance ratio for a complete measurement system.

Human immunodeficiency virus disclosure and patient confidentiality in orthopaedic procedures. A thirty-two-year-old man with hemophilia whose chief complaint was knee pain was referred by his hematologist for consideration of a total knee arthroplasty. On his initial visit, the patient was seen and evaluated with his pregnant wife and their infant child present in the examination room at his request. During the review of systems and past medical history, the treating surgeon inquired into the status of his human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and CD4 count. At that point, the patient denied ever testing positive for HIV. Later, in a private discussion, the patient confirmed his HIV-positive status. He admitted that his wife was unaware of his history, and he stated that he did not wish her to know. The surgeon explained to the patient that his HIV history posed a major health risk to his wife and children and encouraged him to discuss it with her. The surgeon sought the advice of the institution's legal counsel. It was explained that, according to state law, the surgeon was not obliged to, but could, inform the patient's wife of the situation. At the next visit, the surgeon again asked the patient to discuss the situation with his spouse. The patient agreed to do so. To confirm that the information had been conveyed, the surgeon asked the patient to return with his wife to discuss the patient's HIV status and the informed consent pertinent to total knee arthroplasty. When the patient did not return, the surgeon notified the referring hematologist of the situation.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: a complexity of interactions between genes and environment. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a commonly occurring genetic condition, likely to be encountered today in virtually any corner of the globe. Sudden episodes of hemolysis associated with the condition may result in exponential increases in serum total bilirubin concentrations to levels at which bilirubin-induced neurologic damage may occur. The hyperbilirubinemia is the result of complex interactions between genes and environment. Neonatal screening programs coupled with parental and medical caretaker education may be successful in limiting the severity of disease.

Aquastatin A, a new inhibitor of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase from Sporothrix sp. FN611. Bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase has been confirmed as a novel target for antibacterial drug development. In this study, we determined that a fungal metabolite from Sporothrix sp. FN611 potently inhibited the enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) of Staphylococcus aureus. Its structure identified the metabolite as aquastatin A by the MS and NMR data. Aquastatin A inhibited S. aureus FabI with an IC(50) of 3.2 microM. It also prevented the growth of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with minimum inhibitory concentration of 16-32 microg/ml. Aquastatin A also exerted an inhibitory effect against the FabK isoform, an enoyl-ACP reductase of Streptococcus pneumoniae, with an IC(50) of 9.2 microM. The degalactosylation of aquastatin A did not affect the FabI and FabK-inhibitory or antibacterial activities, thereby suggesting that the sugar moiety within its molecular structure was not involved in these activities. The inhibitory effects of aquastatin A and its degalactosylated derivative on enoyl-ACP reductases and bacterial viability are reported for the first time in this study; these effects point to the potential that aquastatin A may be developed into a new broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-MRSA agent.

CHMP5 controls bone turnover rates by dampening NF-κB activity in osteoclasts. Physiological bone remodeling requires that bone formation by osteoblasts be tightly coupled to bone resorption by osteoclasts. However, relatively little is understood about how this coupling is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of NF-κB signaling in osteoclasts via a novel activity of charged multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5) is a key determinant of systemic rates of bone turnover. A conditional deletion of CHMP5 in osteoclasts leads to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts coupled with exuberant bone formation by osteoblasts, resembling an early onset, polyostotic form of human Paget's disease of bone (PDB). These phenotypes are reversed by haploinsufficiency for Rank, as well as by antiresorptive treatments, including alendronate, zolendronate, and OPG-Fc. Accordingly, CHMP5-deficient osteoclasts display increased RANKL-induced NF-κB activation and osteoclast differentiation. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that CHMP5 cooperates with the PDB genetic risk factor valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) to stabilize the inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα), down-regulating ubiquitination of IκBα via the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15. Thus, CHMP5 tunes NF-κB signaling downstream of RANK in osteoclasts to dampen osteoclast differentiation, osteoblast coupling and bone turnover rates, and disruption of CHMP5 activity results in a PDB-like skeletal disorder.

Marathon runner's retinopathy. To report a case of an unusual retinopathy in an otherwise healthy 25-year-old marathon runner. Case report. A 25-year-old female marathon runner developed sudden onset of monocular vision loss during a routine training run. The retinal features included a large, central, subhyaloid hemorrhage, multiple intraretinal hemorrhages, disc edema and venous dilation and tortuosity resembling characteristics of both valsalva retinopathy and nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Work up for underlying systemic cause was negative. However, the patient did participate in endurance exercise. Strenuous exercise increases activated platelets and other clotting factor elements. During exercise, this increase in clotting factors in the coagulation cascade is usually balanced by activation of key elements in the fibrinolysis cascade as well. However, certain individuals, especially those who already have a predisposition to clotting or other thrombogenic risk factors may disrupt the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis during strenuous exercise favoring coagulation which places them at risk for thrombus formation.

Naturally- and experimentally-designed restorations of the Parkin gene deficit in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. Intranuclear events due to mutations in the Parkin gene remain elusive in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). We identified a mutant PARKIN protein in fibroblast cultures from a pair of siblings with ARJP who were homozygous for the exon 4-deleted Parkin gene. Disease was mild in one patient and debilitating in the other. The detected mutant, encoded by a transcript lacking exon 3 as well as exon 4, is an in-frame deletion that removes 121 aa, resulting in a 344-aa protein (PaDel3,4). Cell culture and transfection studies revealed negative correlations between expression levels of PaDel3,4 and those of cell cycle proteins, including cyclin E, CDK2, ppRb, and E2F-1, and demonstrated that GFP-PaDel3,4 entered nucleus and ubiquitinated cyclin E as a part of SCF(hSel-10) ligase complex in the patient cells. In addition, nuclear localization signal-tagged PaDel3,4 expressed in the transfected patient cells most effectively ubiquitinated cyclin E and reduced DNA damage, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Antisense-oligonucleotide treatment promoted skipping of exon 3 and thus generated PaDel3,4, increasing cell survival. Collectively, we propose that naturally- and experimentally-induced exon skipping at least partly restores the mutant Parkin gene deficit, providing a molecular basis for the development of therapeutic exon skipping.


Changing incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus skin abscesses in a pediatric emergency department.

Dynamic NMR study of dinitrophenyl derivatives of seven-membered cyclic ketals of pyridoxine. Two pyridoxine derivatives containing a dinitrophenyl moiety were investigated by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Conformational dynamics in solution were studied for each compound using dynamic NMR experiments. It was shown that both compounds studied are involved into two conformational exchange processes. The first process is a transformation of the seven-membered cycle conformation between the enantiomeric P-twist and M-twist forms, and the second is a rotation of the dinitrophenyl fragment of the molecules around the C-O bond. Energy barriers of both conformational transitions were determined.


Socioeconomic inequalities in survival and provision of neonatal care: population based study of very preterm infants.

Clomiphene citrate and enclomiphene for the treatment of hypogonadal androgen deficiency. Hypogonadism has a number of important clinical consequences related to androgen deficiency and impaired spermatogenesis. The cause of this condition is multifactorial and can result from hypothalamic, pituitary or gonadal dysfunction as well as factors that affect hormonal signaling along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. While testosterone replacement is the most common treatment, it can paradoxically lead to infertility, and may be a less physiologic therapy for patients with secondary hypogonadism due to pituitary dysfunction. Clomiphene citrate, and its derivatives, may allow for restoration of gonadal function by restoring physiologic pituitary function in a subset of patients with hypogonadism.

Leptin and ghrelin in Korean systemic lupus erythematosus. Elevated serum leptin levels have been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), however these studies have provided no information regarding the ghrelin levels. We investigated the clinical significance of serum leptin and ghrelin levels in SLE. The leptin levels of SLE patients were higher than those of normal healthy controls, while the ghrelin levels of the SLE were lower. In addition, the ghrelin levels were significantly lower in SLE patients with arthritis and hematologic disorder. Taken together, these findings suggest that leptin and ghrelin play a role in clinical manifestations observed in SLE.

The effects of the fraud and abuse enforcement program under the National Health Insurance program in Korea. To examine the general deterrence effect of the Korean government's fraud and abuse enforcement program on medical clinics in the country. The effects were evaluated by analyzing the association between the fear of penalty from a potential onsite investigation and the costliness index (CI). Using a stratified proportional systematic sampling method, 800 out of the 15,443 clinics in Korea that had not had an onsite investigation before June 2007 were selected. Perceived deterrence was measured via face-to-face interviews with the chief doctor of each clinic; these were conducted in July and August 2007. CI was calculated by dividing observed costs by expected costs based on National Health Insurance Claims from January to October 2007. Clinics with a high fear of penalty had a significantly lower CI than did other clinics after adjusting for factors related to the provider's perception of onsite investigation, the provider's service experiences, and general characteristics such as provider's sex and age. Designing effective fraud and abuse control programs can improve the efficiency of providing services to patients.

Stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque by pitavastatin in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits: A serial tissue-characterizing intravascular ultrasound study. To examine the effects of pitavastatin on atherosclerotic plaque in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits using serial in vivo tissue-characterizing intravascular ultrasound. A total of 11 WHHL rabbits of 10-12 weeks of age were divided into two groups, control and pitavastatin-administered groups. A total of 29 atherosclerotic plaque segments from control group and 43 plaque segments from the pitavastatin group were serially imaged by 40MHz intravascular ultrasound in vivo with a tissue characterization software (iMAP™, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) at the baseline and the follow-up (16th week). The level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased in pitavastatin group. During the follow-up period, plaque area was significantly increased in the control group, whereas it was not significantly changed in the pitavastatin group. The fibrotic, necrotic, and necrotic plus lipidic areas were significantly increased in the control group, while no significant change was revealed for tissue profile in pitavastatin group. The change in the percent areas of fibrotic and lipidic plus necrotic tissues were significantly different between the two groups especially in the superficial half portion of plaque. These data indicate that pitavastatin could attenuate atherosclerotic plaque formation and that it could stabilize the plaque in WHHL rabbits. Considering the fact that these were observed even with a high follow-up level of cholesterol, these data might come from the pleiotropic effects of pitavastatin.

Effect of remifentanil on the nonlinear electroencephalographic entropy parameters in propofol anesthesia. Nonlinear electroencephalographic entropy parameters have been proposed for the assessment of depth of anesthesia. The influence of remifentanil, a commonly used intraoperative opioid, on these parameters, namely approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PeEn), during induction of propofol anesthesia was studied. Remifentanil was shown to reduce the propofol-induced changes in ApEn and SampEn throughout the transition from awake to burst suppression state. Coadministration of opioids therefore challenges the reliability of these parameters as indicators of depth of anesthesia. No consistent influence on PeEn was observed. However, this may have been due to strong interindividual variation in PeEn values.

Determination of serum holotranscobalamin concentrations with the AxSYM active B(12) assay: cut-off point evaluation in the clinical laboratory. A reliable early marker is required for diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency. We calculated an appropriate holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) cut-off point for identifying cobalamin deficiency using an immunoenzymatic assay. Determination of the cut-off threshold and correlation between HoloTC and the other diagnostic parameters routinely used for vitamin B(12) deficiency [total vitamin B(12) (tB(12)), folate, homocysteine] were measured in 250 routine blood specimens from 107 men (mean age 59.0+/-18.8 years) and 143 women (mean age 54.2+/-23.1 years). The inclusion criterion was serum tB(12) concentration <or=221 pmol/L. Analytical performance results agreed with those reported by others. A weak correlation (R=0.42) was found between HoloTC and tB(12). A 40 pmol/L cut-off threshold was chosen for HoloTC and the associated sensitivity and specificity was 0.86 and 0.66, respectively. Out of 250 tested samples, 126 showed tB(12) concentrations 139-221 pmol/L (gray zone, GZ) and 124 had tB(12) concentrations <139 pmol/L (low, L). Values less than the cut-off for HoloTC were present in 68.2% and 37.9% of cases in the GZ and L group, respectively (p<0.01), and in 53.2% of subjects. Our results confirmed the analytical reliability of the AxSYM HoloTC assay. The method is adequate for routine use and a cut-off threshold of 40 pmol/L is appropriate for assessing cobalamin deficiency in populations with reduced tB(12) values.

Stereotactic spine radiosurgery for intradural and intramedullary metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become an important treatment alternative to surgery for a variety of spinal lesions. However, the use of SRS in the management of intradural intramedullary (IDIM) metastasis remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of SRS for treatment of IDIM metastasis. Nine patients with 11 IDIM metastases treated with SRS at Henry Ford Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 50 years, with a range of 14-71 years. There were 4 intradural extramedullary and 7 intramedullary lesions. The radiosurgery procedure used techniques of image-guided and intensitymodulated radiation. The mean treatment dose was 13.8 Gy, with a range of 10-16 Gy. All patients had clinical follow-up (except in 1 lesion), with an emphasis on initial symptoms and ambulatory status, and 8 patients (9 lesions) had imaging studies. The median follow-up duration was 10 months. The presenting symptoms were improved in 8 (80%) of 10 evaluable lesions, unchanged in 1 case, and worsened in 1 case. Radiographic responses were seen as follows: complete response in 2 (22%) of 9; partial response in 3 (33%) of 9; stable disease in 3 (33%) of 9; and progressive disease in 1 (11%) of 9. After radiosurgery, 7 patients (78%) remained ambulatory until the last follow-up visit. The overall median survival time after SRS was 8 months, with a range of 2-19 months. No radiation toxicity was detected clinically during the follow-up period. Despite the fact that this was a small series of patients with IDIM metastasis who had limited treatment options, SRS appears to be an effective and safe method of treating patients with these lesions.

A Kelch repeat protein, Cokel1p, associates with microtubules and is involved in appressorium development in Colletotrichum orbiculare. Kelch repeat proteins are conserved in diverse organisms and some are known to mediate fundamental cellular functions. We isolated the gene CoKEL1, encoding a novel kelch repeat protein, from Colletotrichum orbiculare. Analysis of a cokel1 mutant indicated that CoKEL1 is involved in proper appressorium development and cell wall synthesis. Appressoria produced by cokel1 disruption mutants showed irregular shape and impairment of turgor generation and the mutant appressoria rarely penetrated to form infection hyphae in host epidermal cells. Accordingly, cokel1 mutants had reduced pathogenicity on host leaves compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the cokel1 mutant was more sensitive to cell-wall-degrading enzymes and showed altered labeling with the cell wall stain Calcofluor white. Cokel1p was localized on cortical and spindle microtubules in vegetative hyphae. These results suggest that Cokel1p is a microtubule-associated protein involved in infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity. This is the first report that a kelch repeat protein is required for the pathogenicity of a fungal plant pathogen.

Nanostimulation: manipulation of single neuron activity by juxtacellular current injection. In the mammalian brain, many thousands of single-neuron recording studies have been performed but less than 10 single-cell stimulation studies. This paucity of single-cell stimulation data reflects a lack of easily applicable single-cell stimulation techniques. We provide a detailed description of the procedures involved in nanostimulation, a single-cell stimulation method derived from the juxtacellular labeling technique. Nanostimulation is easy to apply and can be directed to a wide variety of identifiable neurons in anesthetized and awake animals. We describe the recording approach and the parameters of the electric configuration underlying nanostimulation. We use glass pipettes with a DC resistance of 4-7 Mohms. Obtaining the juxtacellular configuration requires a close contact between pipette tip and neuron and is associated with a several-fold increase in resistance to values > or = 20 Mohms. The recorded action potential (AP) amplitude grows to > or = 2 mV, and neurons can be activated with currents in the nanoampere range--hence the term nanostimulation. While exact AP timing has not been achieved, AP frequency and AP number can be parametrically controlled. We demonstrate that nanostimulation can also be used to selectively inhibit sensory responses in identifiable neurons. Nanostimulation is biophysically similar to electroporation, and based on this assumption, we argue that nanostimulation operates on membranes in the micrometer area directly below the pipette tip, where membrane pores are induced by high transmembrane voltage. There is strong evidence to suggest that nanostimulation selectively activates single neurons and that the evoked effects are cell-specific. Nanostimulation therefore holds great potential for elucidating how single neurons contribute to behavior.

Sample size adjustment based on promising interim results and its application in confirmatory clinical trials. For a carefully planned and well-designed Phase 3 confirmatory trial, there is still a potential risk of failing to meet the study objective due to possible differences between Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. As illustrated by the ENGAGE trial, potential sample size increase at an interim analysis can mitigate the risk for an otherwise underpowered study. Many approaches for sample size adjustment (SSA) require certain modifications to the conventional statistical method, such as changing critical values or using a weighted Z-statistic for final hypothesis testing. Without modification, the type I error rate can be inflated, primarily caused by sample size increase for nonpromising interim observation that is close to null or no treatment effect. As illustrated by the TOPICAL trial, increasing sample size for nonpromising interim result could waste limited resource on ineffective treatment. The modifications in these approaches are therefore unnecessary costs of flexibility/interpretability for unnecessary scenarios of sample size increase. To discuss and illustrate the appropriateness of SSA based on promising interim results, that is, conditional power being greater than 50% (or CDL approach), in a carefully planned and well-designed Phase 3 confirmatory trial. Two clinical trials are used to illustrate the clinical setting for the CDL approach and appropriateness of its application. Operating characteristics are assessed and compared to other methods using numeric computation. Hypothetical trials based on real clinical data are used to illustrate the approach. The CDL approach for SSA leads to a small increase in expected sample size resulting in a small power gain versus the fixed design. This indicates that adding SSA will not on average substantially affect the budget at the portfolio level. However, when the interim result is promising, the CDL approach can dramatically increase the conditional power therefore mitigating the risk of an otherwise underpowered study. Implementation challenges of the SSA methods are not in the scope of this paper. SSA is not intended to replace careful design of a confirmatory trial; instead, it can mitigate the risk for a well-designed trial. The CDL approach for SSA based on promising interim results, that is, conditional power being greater than 50%, is particularly useful in mitigating the risk for a carefully planned and well-designed Phase 3 confirmatory trial. No modification to the conventional statistical procedure is necessary while the type I error rate is controlled. Such a feature of ''no interference,'' or no change to the conventional statistical procedure with or without sample size adjustment, is important for the interpretation of a confirmatory trial. Similar to the fixed design, carefully planned and well-designed group sequential studies can also benefit from SSA to mitigate the risk of failing to meet the study objective.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade: high hopes sent back to reality? Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in the development of various cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Thus, effective RAS inhibition has been a major achievement to improve the treatment of patients at risk for CVDs, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Three substance classes that block RAS-activation are currently available, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (ARB) and renin inhibitors. Although the overall goal of these drugs remains the blockade of RAS activation, their individual targets in this system vary and may substantially influence the clinical benefit derived from the long term use of these substances. Here, we summarize the evidence available for the use of ARBs in different cardiovascular pathologies and the impact of this evidence on current treatment guidelines for patients at risk for CVD. Today, ARBs represent a good alternative in case of ACE-inhibitor intolerance due to their outstanding tolerability. ARBs in comparison to ACE-inhibitors have been proven to exert similar effective in the treatment of systolic heart failure, primary prevention of stroke, new onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 and DM type 2 dependent macroalbuminuria. ARBs should be considered as alternatives to ACE-inhibitors in subjects post-myocardial infarction. Overall however, there is no profound proof for a specific cardiovascular protection by blockade of the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor that exceeds the impact of ACE-inhibition or synergises with ACE-blockade. In fact, combination of ARBs and ACE-inhibitor result in an increased rate of adverse effects and, therefore, this combination should not be encouraged. To summarize, the initial hope for a more specific impact on cardiovascular diseases by inhibition of the AT1-receptor in comparison to ACE-inhibition has not come true. However, ARBs have been proven to be equally effective as ACE-blockade in a large variety of clinical settings.

Evaluation of the HIV lay counselling and testing profession in South Africa. With the launch of the national HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) campaign in South Africa (SA), lay HIV counsellors, who had been trained in blood withdrawal, have taken up the role of HIV testing. This study evaluated the experiences, training, motivation, support, supervision, and workload of HIV lay counsellors and testers in South Africa. The aim was to identify gaps in their resources, training, supervision, motivation, and workload related to HCT services. In addition it explored their experiences with providing HIV testing under the task shifting context. The study was conducted in eight of South Africa's nine provinces. 32 lay counsellors were recruited from 67 HCT sites, and were interviewed using two questionnaires that included structured and semi-structured questions. One questionnaire focused on their role as HIV counsellors and the other on their role as HIV testers. Ninety-seven percent of counsellors reported that they have received training in counselling and testing. Many rated their training as more than adequate or adequate, with 15.6% rating it as not adequate. Respondents reported a lack of standardised counselling and testing training, and revealed gaps in counselling skills for specific groups such as discordant couples, homosexuals, older clients and children. They indicated health system barriers, including inadequate designated space for counselling, which compromises privacy and confidentiality. Lay counsellors carry the burden of counselling and testing nationally, and have other tasks such as administration and auxiliary duties due to staff shortages. This study demonstrates that HCT counselling and testing services in South Africa are mainly performed by lay counsellors and testers. They are challenged by inadequate work space, limited counselling skills for specific groups, a lack of standardised training policies and considerable administrative and auxiliary duties. To improve HCT services, there needs to be training needs with a standardised curriculum and refresher courses, for HIV counselling and testing, specifically for specific elderly clients, discordant couples, homosexuals and children. The Department of Health should formally integrate lay counsellors into the health care system with proper allocation of tasks under the task shifting policy.

The development of animal personality: relevance, concepts and perspectives. Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate causation and its ecological and evolutionary significance, but have mostly ignored questions about its development, although an understanding of the latter is highly relevant to these other questions. One possible reason for this neglect is confusion about many of the concepts and terms that are necessary to study the development of animal personality. Here, we provide a framework for studying personality development that focuses on the properties of animal personality, and considers how and why these properties may change over time. We specifically focus on three dimensions of personality: (1) contextual generality at a given age or time, (2) temporal consistency in behavioural traits and in relationships between traits, and (3) the effects of genes and experience on the development of personality at a given age or life stage. We advocate using a new approach, contextual reaction norms, to study the contextual generality of personality traits at the level of groups, individuals and genotypes, show how concepts and terms borrowed from the literature on personality development in humans can be used to study temporal changes in personality at the level of groups and individuals, and demonstrate how classical developmental reaction norms can provide insights into the ways that genes and experiential factors interact across ontogeny to affect the expression of personality traits. In addition, we discuss how correlations between the effects of genes and experience on personality development can arise as a function of individuals' control over their own environment, via niche-picking or niche-construction. Using this framework, we discuss several widely held assumptions about animal personality development that still await validation, identify neglected methodological issues, and describe a number of promising new avenues for future research.

Novel amino-modified silica nanoparticles as efficient vector for hepatocellular carcinoma gene therapy. Due to the ineffective conventional treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the nonviral gene delivery system has been proved to be an attractive alternative to HCC therapy. In this work, we have developed a kind of new self-assembled nanoparticles, which were named as amino-modified silica nanoparticles (AMSNs). Scanning electron microscopy and zeta potential results demonstrated that AMSNs had a diameter of 20-30 nm and positive surface charges of +11.3 mV, respectively. The AMSNs could bind DNA strongly and protect DNA from degradation, which was confirmed by DNA-binding assay and serum protection assay. Furthermore, AMSNs could transfer foreign DNA into targeted cells with high transfection efficiency and little cytotoxicity. Combined with the p53 gene, AMSNs could transfect pp53-EGFP in HepG2 cells and result in a high-level of p53 mRNA and protein expressions. The nude mice treated with AMSNs/pp53-EGFP complexes showed significant tumor growth inhibition. Our results showed the AMSNs, an efficient gene vector, had the potential of gene therapy for HCC.

An overview of the effects of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds on vertebrates, as documented in human and ecological epidemiology. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are primary examples of persistent organic pollutants that induce toxicity in both wildlife and humans. Over the past 200 years these compounds have been almost exclusively generated by human activity and have left a string of disasters in the wake of their accidental release. Most recently, the contamination of the Irish pork supply with dioxins resulted in an international recall of all Irish pork products. Epidemiologic data on human and ecological dioxin exposures have revealed a common pattern of biological response among vertebrate species, which is mediated through activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). These AhR-mediated effects include profound consequences on the vertebrate individual exposed in early life with respect to myriad developmental endpoints including neurologic, immunologic, and reproductive parameters. Humans appear to be susceptible to these effects in a manner similar to that of the laboratory and wildlife species, which have demonstrated such outcomes. Furthermore, epidemiologic data suggest that there is little or no margin of exposure for humans with respect to these developmental effects. Given these concerns, prudent public health policy should include the continued reduction of exposures.


Interaction of anthraquinone dyes with lysozyme: evidences from spectroscopic and docking studies.

Knee valgus angle during landing tasks in female volleyball and basketball players. Increased knee valgus angles have been associated with an increased risk of a variety of knee injuries. It has yet to be established if knee valgus angles during jump landing tasks differ between jumping sports with relatively higher and lower knee injury rates-namely, basketball and volleyball. Any difference in knee angles on landing may be related to sport-specific differences, which may in turn relate to the different injury risk rates. Fifteen elite female basketball and volleyball players had their knee valgus angles assessed during 2 landing tasks: 1 bilateral (drop jump landing) and 1 unilateral (step landing task). During the drop jump task knee valgus angle was significantly greater in the basketball group (p = 0.017) in the right knee, but there was no significant difference in performance between sports in the left knee (p = 0.67). During the step landing task volleyball players had significantly greater knee valgus angles than basketball players for both the left (p = 0.018) and right (p = 0.025) knees. The basketball group showed superior control of knee valgus during the unilateral task, which may be related to sport-specific skills. The basketball players showed significant asymmetry in knee valgus angle during bilateral drop jump landings; this finding reflects those of previous studies and may be related to the relative increased knee injury risk reported for this population group.

Molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of Blastocystis infection in humans in Italy. In order to describe the molecular epidemiology of Blastocystis infection in Italy, 189 isolates, which had been collected during the years 2012-2014 from mildly symptomatic patients, or those affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or chronic diarrhoea, or otherwise immunosuppressed, were subtyped by sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene (536 bp). Six subtypes (STs) were detected: ST1 (15·3%), ST2 (13·8%), ST3 (46·0%), ST4 (21·7%), ST6 (3·2%) and ST8 (0·5%). They clustered in distinct clades, as inferred from Bayesian inference phylogenetic and median joining network analyses. A high genetic differentiation was found at the inter-subtype level; it ranged from Jukes-Cantor (JC) distance = 0·02 (between ST1 and ST4) to JC = 0·11 (between ST6 and ST2). At the intra-ST level, a high genetic homogeneity was registered in ST4, whereas higher genetic variation was found in isolates corresponding to ST1 and ST2. Accordingly, high values of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were observed in ST1, ST2 and ST3. No association was found between patient gender and ST, whereas ST3 and ST1 were significantly more prevalent in patients aged 15-50 years. A significant occurrence of Blastocystis ST4 in patients suffering from IBS, IBD or chronic diarrhoea was observed; in addition, a slight significant association between ST1 and ST3 and IBS patients was found. Multiple correspondence analysis showed some significant contribution of different variables (subtypes, haplotypes, age) in the observed pattern of ordination of the 189 patients in the symptom categories.

UOK 262 cell line, fumarate hydratase deficient (FH-/FH-) hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma: in vitro and in vivo model of an aberrant energy metabolic pathway in human cancer. Energy deregulation and abnormalities of tumor cell metabolism are critical issues in understanding cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), and one known to be highly metastatic and unusually lethal. There is considerable utility in establishing preclinical cell and xenograft models for study of disorders of energy metabolism, as well as in development of new therapeutic approaches targeting of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme-deficient human cancers. Here we describe a new immortalized cell line, UOK 262, derived from a patient having aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kidney cancer. We investigated gene expression, chromosome profiles, efflux bioenergetic analysis, mitochondrial ultrastructure, FH catabolic activity, invasiveness, and optimal glucose requirements for in vitro growth. UOK 262 cells have an isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality, i(1)(q10), and exhibit compromised oxidative phosphorylation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation of HLRCC. The cells also display glucose-dependent growth, an elevated rate of lactate efflux, and overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Mutant FH protein was present primarily in edematous mitochondria, but with catalytic activity nearly undetectable. UOK 262 xenografts retain the characteristics of HLRCC histopathology. Our findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux in UOK 262 are an essential feature of this TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form of kidney cancer. This tumor model is the embodiment of the Warburg effect. UOK 262 provides a unique in vitro and in vivo preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer.

Fetuin-A/albumin-mineral complexes resembling serum calcium granules and putative nanobacteria: demonstration of a dual inhibition-seeding concept. Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble calcium granules widely distributed in nature. They appear to be assembled through a dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phosphate, even in submillimolar amounts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhibitor, fetuin-A is much more potent than albumin, and it will only seed particles at higher mineral-to-protein concentrations. Both proteins display a bell-shaped, dose-dependent relationship, indicative of the same dual inhibitory-seeding mechanism seen with whole serum. As ascertained by both seeding experiments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not only more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the expense of albumin. The nanoparticles formed in the presence of fetuin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the particles seeded by albumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protein-mineral particles resemble closely serum granules and NB. These particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depend on the protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios favoring faster conversion to crystals. Our results point to a dual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model for the assembly of particles in supersaturated solutions like serum. The presence of proteins and other inhibitory factors tend to block apatite nuclei formation or to stabilize the nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences are overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and films-a mechanism that may explain not only the formation of calcium granules in nature but also normal or ectopic calcification in the body.

Robust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with ensemble feature selection methods. Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method. Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of approximately 15% in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Phase I/II study of tandem high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for advanced multiple myeloma. The efficacy and safety of high-dose chemotherapy with tandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) were evaluated in a multicenter clinical study of patients with advanced multiple myeloma. Eligible patients (n = 40) were consecutively enrolled in the phase I/II study and received 2-4 cycles of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone regimen. The responding patients underwent PBSC harvesting following high-dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim administration. The first auto-PBSCT (n = 32) following high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m(2)) was performed within 2 months of PBSC harvesting; the second auto-PBSCT (n = 28) was scheduled 3-6 months later. Treatment-related mortality was 2.5% (n = 1) throughout the protocol. Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 12.5 and 14.3% of the first and second auto-PBSCT patients, respectively. All but one patient (who died) achieved hematopoietic recovery. For the 28 patients completing the second auto-PBSCT, the results were favorable with a response rate of 65% (complete response rate = 27.5%, n = 11); the five-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 20.3 and 66.5%, respectively. In conclusion, high-dose chemotherapy with tandem auto-PBSCT is feasible and safe with a favorable response rate in treating advanced multiple myeloma in Japan.

Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies: Serum vitamin D and prostate cancer risk. To review and summarize evidence from longitudinal studies on the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and the risk of prostate cancer (PC). Relevant prospective cohort studies and nested case-control studies published until July 2009 were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. The following data were extracted in a standardized manner from eligible studies: first author, publication year, country, study design, characteristics of the study population, duration of follow-up, PC incidence/PC mortality according to serum vitamin D status and the respective risk ratios, and covariates adjusted for in the analysis. Due to the heterogeneity of studies in categorizing serum vitamin D levels, all results were recalculated for an increase in serum 25(OH)D by 10ng/ml. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using meta-analysis methods. Overall, eleven original articles were included, ten of which reported on the association between serum vitamin D levels and PC incidence and one article reported on the association with PC mortality. Meta-analysis of studies on PC incidence resulted in a summary OR (95% confidence interval, CI) of 1.03 (0.96-1.11) associated with an increase of 25(OH)D by 10ng/ml (P=0.362). No indication for heterogeneity and publication bias was found. According to available evidence from longitudinal studies, serum 25(OH)D is not associated with PC incidence.

Novel Ammonia-Lowering Agents for Hepatic Encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis, leading to frequent hospitalizations. Because ammonia is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HE, therapies specifically aimed at reducing ammonia levels have been developed for conditions causing hyperammonemia, including HE. Ammonia scavengers have been used in HE patients, leading to improvements in symptoms. Bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol has also been studied recently, resulting in more rapid improvement in acute HE compared with lactulose. Extracorporeal devices have been used in cases of refractory HE but currently are used primarily in research settings and not approved for clinical management for HE.

Plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 better predicts outcome than N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide in patients with systolic heart failure and a high prevalence of coronary artery disease. Metalloproteinases have been proposed as biochemical markers of left ventricular (LV) remodeling in systolic heart failure (HF). However, their role in the prognostic stratification of these patients remains controversial. In the present study, we aimed at investigating the value of plasma metalloproteinases-3 and -9 in comparison with N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide in patients with systolic HF. One hundred and 27 consecutive patients hospitalized for systolic HF (LV ejection fraction < 45%) were enrolled. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was the aetiology in 67% of the study patients. Plasma metalloproteinases-3 and -9 and N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide levels were assessed. A complete echocardiographic and Doppler examination was also performed. Follow-up period was 24-15 months. On univariate analysis, a number of measurements predicted cardiac events in the following order of power: NYHA class >2, LV ejection fraction < 25%, metalloproteinases-9 > 238 ng/ml, mitral E wave deceleration time < 150 ms, N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide > 1586 pg/ml and metalloproteinases-3 > 15 ng/ml. However, on multivariate analysis the only independent variables of cardiac events were NYHA class (OR=2.26, p=0.059) and plasma metalloproteinases-9 (OR=2.00, p=0.029). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with elevated levels of metalloproteinases-9 exhibited a significantly worse event free-survival at 45 months than those without (21% vs. 54%, log-rank: 13.93, p=0.0002). A worse survival was also observed in patients with elevated N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide levels with respect to those without (18% vs. 46%, log-rank: 9.11, p=0.025). Our results demonstrated the value of plasma metalloproteinases-9 levels for prognostication of patients with systolic HF and a high prevalence of CAD.

[Effective evaluation of multiple level surgery in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome]. To investigate the therapeutic effects of multiple level surgery in treating obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). One hundred ninety two patients with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography were treated through uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). Thirty patients were combined with sub-mucous resection of the nasal septum. Forty four patients received sub-mucous resection of the nasal septum and partial inferior turbinectomy. Two patients received sub-mucous resection of the nasal septum and partial resection of the tongue base. Two patients received genioglossus advancement and partial resection of the tongue base. Three patients received partial resection of the tongue base. In addition, the patients with the nasal disease and/or the lingual fat, AHI > 40 times/h, LSaO(2) < 0.64 and/or BMI > 30 kg/m(2) received tracheotomy before general anaesthesia. One hundred ninety two patients were treated through UPPP. One hundred ninety one patients were successful, one patient died of pneumothorax and cardiac arrest during the incision of the trachea. All patients were followed-up for 6-37 months, among them, 132 patients showed therapeutic effect, with the effective rate as 68.7%. Fifty five patients were cured (AHI < 5 times/h); 39 patients had significant effect (AHI < 20 times/h and decreased > or = 50%); 38 patients were effective (AHI decreased > or = 50%). However, 60 patients did not have any therapeutic effect, with the ineffective rate as 31.3%. Fifty four patients had palatopharyngeal and nasal cavity emphasis, 24 patients had palatopharyngeal and oropharyngeal emphasis, 96 patients had palatopharyngeal and nasal cavity and oropharyngeal emphasis. Some patients were treated with UPPP, which made effective rate as 15 (68.2%), 12 (63.2%), 29 (55.8%). The others were treated with multiple level operations, which made effective rate as 25 (78.1%), 5 (5/5), 33 (75.0%). The effective rate was 60.2% (56/93) by simple UPPP and it was 77.8% (63/81) by multiple level treatment in patients with multiple level obstruction. There was statistical significance between them (chi(2) = 6.2, P = 0.01). The effective rate was improved through multiple level operations in OSAHS patients. The serious complications could be prevented through tracheotomy before general anaesthesia in patients with severe OSAHS who needed multiple level surgery.

New Insights on COX-2 in Chronic Inflammation Driving Breast Cancer Growth and Metastasis. The medicinal use of aspirin stretches back to ancient times, before it was manufactured in its pure form in the late 19th century. Its accepted mechanistic target, cyclooxygenase (COX), was discovered in the 1970s and since this landmark discovery, the therapeutic application of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has increased dramatically. The most significant benefits of NSAIDs are in conditions involving chronic inflammation (CI). Given the recognized role of CI in cancer development, the use of long-term NSAID treatment in the prevention of cancer is an enticing possibility. COX-2 is a key driver of CI, and here we review COX-2 expression as a predictor of survival in various cancer types, including breast. Obesity and post-partum involution are natural inflammatory states that are associated with increased breast cancer risk. We outline the COX-2 mediated mechanisms contributing to the growth of cancers. We dissect the cellular mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and how COX-2 may induce this to facilitate tumor progression. Finally we examine the potential regulation of COX-2 by c-Myb, and the possible interplay between c-Myb/COX-2 in proliferation, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α)/COX-2 in invasive pathways in breast cancer. 

Oseltamivir resistance and the H274Y neuraminidase mutation in seasonal, pandemic and highly pathogenic influenza viruses. Along with influenza vaccines, the world is currently almost completely dependent on two licensed drugs for the treatment or prevention of seasonal (influenza A and B viruses) and pandemic influenza (influenza A viruses). These drugs - oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) - are classified as neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) because they act by inhibiting one of the key surface proteins of the influenza virus, the neuraminidase, which in turn reduces the ability of the virus to infect other respiratory cells. Our dependence on these drugs has arisen because of high levels of resistance with seasonal influenza viruses to the older class of anti-influenza drugs, the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), combined with the lack of activity of these drugs against influenza B viruses. Recently, however, significant levels of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1) seasonal influenza viruses have also been encountered, which has been associated with a single amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase (H274Y). Oseltamivir is the most widely used and stockpiled NAI and, while these A(H1) viruses are still sensitive to zanamivir, it highlights the ease with which the influenza virus can mutate and reassort to circumvent available drugs. Fortunately, the current pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus, which is circulating globally, remains largely sensitive to both NAIs, although a small number of oseltamivir-resistant viruses have been isolated from patients to date, again with the H274Y mutation. Clearly there is a need to use the NAI drugs prudently to ensure they remain an effective defence against future seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, along with careful monitoring of levels of resistance in the circulating viruses combined with the further development of new anti-influenza drugs.


In Situ Tissue Engineering of Functional Small-Diameter Blood Vessels by Host Circulating Cells Only.

RPS25 is essential for translation initiation by the Dicistroviridae and hepatitis C viral IRESs. Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated using a cap-dependent mechanism of translation. However, approximately 10% of mammalian mRNAs initiate translation using a cap-independent mechanism that is not well understood. These mRNAs contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5' untranslated region. The cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) intergenic region IRES (IGR IRES) functions in yeast, mammals, and plants, and does not require any translation initiation factors. We used yeast genetics to understand how ribosomes are recruited directly to the mRNA by an IRES. We found that Rps25p has an essential role in CrPV IGR IRES activity in yeast and mammalian cells but not in cap-dependent translation. Purified 40S ribosomal subunits lacking Rps25 are unable to bind to the IGR IRES in vitro. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES also requires Rps25, demonstrating the function of Rps25 is conserved across IRES types. Yeast strains lacking Rps25 exhibit only slight defects in global translation, readthrough, ribosome biogenesis, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting. This work is the first demonstration of a ribosomal protein that is specifically required for IRES-mediated translation initiation. Our findings provide us with the beginnings of a model for the molecular interactions of an IRES with the ribosome.

Six-month gain in weight, height, and CD4 predict subsequent antiretroviral treatment responses in HIV-infected South African children. Construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4 percentage (CD4%) in children initiating ART, and to assess the association between lower percentiles and subsequent ART responses. Cohort of 1394 HIV-infected children initiating ART between April 2004 and March 2008, Johannesburg, South Africa The generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape was used to construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4%. Cox proportional models were used to assess the association between lower percentiles of each distribution and death, virological suppression, and treatment failure between 6 to 36 months post-ART initiation. Lower percentiles for gain in weight, CD4, and CD4% count after 6 months of ART, but not height, were associated with poor subsequent treatment outcomes independent of baseline characteristics, with increasing strength of association as percentiles decreased. Age-specific 6-month post-ART weight gain in our cohort was substantially higher compared with 6-month weight gain in non-HIV-infected American children of the Fels Institute cohort and the attained weight-for-age at 6 months post-ART plotted on WHO weight-for-age growth charts were not associated with subsequent treatment outcomes. Gain in CD4% in the first 6 months of ART was the best predictor of poor subsequent ART outcomes. In areas with limited access to CD4%, weight gain post-ART using our newly developed reference distributions for HIV-infected children on ART is a good alternative to CD4%, and clearly superior to the commonly used 'Road-to-Health' weight-for-age charts.

Artifact on electromyography produced by an implanted sacral nerve stimulator. A patient with muscle cramps was referred for nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Her study demonstrated bursts of spontaneous electromyography activity, which waxed and waned in amplitude with a "dive bomber"-like sound. The abnormal finding was found to be an artifact from an implanted sacral nerve stimulator for bladder incontinence.

Defibrillator synchronization tester. A defibrillator sync output signal connector provides an ECG synchronization signal that can be used by some defibrillators for the purpose of performing synchronized cardioversion [1]. This process is used to stop an abnormally fast heart rate or cardiac arrhythmia by the delivery of a therapeutic dose of electric current to the heart during the R-wave of the cardiac cycle. Timing the shock to the R-wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle, which could induce ventricular fibrillation [2]. GE patient monitors include a selectable analog output feature, which provides an analog ECG or arterial blood pressure signal. The blood pressure signal can be used to synchronize balloon pumps to provide cardiac assist to post-MI patients with poor injection fraction. Proper operation requires the defibrillator sync and analog output function to be checked. Checkouts are typically done during planned maintenance and after major part replacements such as patient monitor's main CPU board. Checking out defibrillator sync signals could be done using a GE defibrillator sync tester. The defibrillator sync tester provides a loop back path for the defibrillator sync signals to be displayed on the patient monitor screen and eliminates the need for an external oscilloscope.

Detection of synchrony in biosignals using cross fuzzy entropy. A new method, namely Cross fuzzy entropy (C-FuzzyEn) analysis, that could enable the measurement of the synchrony or similarity of patterns between two distinct signals, was presented in this study. Tests on simulated data sets showed that C-FuzzyEn was superior to the conventional cross sample entropy (C-SampEn) in several aspects, including giving entropy definition in case of small parameters, better relative consistency, and less dependence on record length. The proposed C-FuzzyEn was then applied for the analysis of simultaneously recorded electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG) signals during sustained isometric contraction for monitoring local muscle fatigue. The results showed that the C-FuzzyEn of EMG-MMG decreased significantly during the development of muscle fatigue. The time-decrease trend of C-FuzzyEn is similar to the mean frequency (MNF) of EMG, the commonly used muscle fatigue indicator.

Delayed reopening of a hemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale after left lung transplantation: emergency management. We report the case of a man who underwent a left-lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis and who developed deterioration of his respiratory condition at Day 16 post-operatively, with marked hypoxemia not explained by the usual early respiratory complications of lung transplantation. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography identified a patent foramen ovale with massive spontaneous right-to-left shunting. As for the pathogenesis of this right-to-left shunting, we found no evidence supporting an elevation of right-side pressures, with the redirection of the inferior vena cava flow toward the patent foramen ovale being the suspected mechanism. We conclude that delayed reopening of the patent foramen ovale leading to massive right-to-left shunting is a possible complication after lung transplantation.

Identification of ADAMTS13 peptide sequences binding to von Willebrand factor. ADAMTS13 cleaves multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF) to regulate VWF-mediated thrombus formation. To search ADAMTS13 peptide sequences binding to VWF, a lambda-phage library expressing various peptides of ADAMTS13 on the surface was screened using VWF either immobilized or in solution under static condition. By the first screening, peptides sharing the C-terminus of spacer domain from Arg(670) to Gln(684) (epitope-A) were selected. To explore additional sites, peptide sequences from the first screening were synthesized and added to the second screening. Consequently, Pro(618) to Glu(641) (epitope-B) in the middle of spacer domain was obtained from immobilized VWF condition. Synthetic epitope-B peptide inhibited the cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13, while the synthetic epitope-A peptide did not as efficiently as epitope-B. Elimination of four amino acids from either sides of epitope-B terminus markedly reduced the inhibitory effect. These two sites in the spacer domain may play significant roles in binding to VWF.

Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: an update. This is an update of the main studies published in the last year regarding biomarkers, advances in pathophysiology, lupus nephritis as well as outcomes and therapies in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). Some progress in the pathophysiology of cSLE was made in the past year. Although biomarkers were studied in lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric lupus, none of the proposed biomarkers was shown to be a significant improvement over current disease measures. More encouraging was the research into creating an easy, rapid screening tool for neurocognitive dysfunction in cSLE. Two studies in health-related quality of life (HRQL) recognized its importance in determining outcome and found that ethnicity and obesity might significantly alter HRQL in cSLE patients. There were no prospective clinical trials involving cSLE patients. A better understanding of pathophysiology may elucidate novel molecules as therapeutic targets in cSLE. Advances in the field of biomarkers may enable a more accurate prediction of clinical outcome, optimizing early interventions and therefore improving disease prognostics.

A nonsynaptic mechanism underlying interictal discharges in human epileptic neocortex. Very fast oscillations (VFOs, >80 Hz) are important for physiological brain processes and, in excess, with certain epilepsies. Putative mechanisms for VFO include interneuron spiking and network activity in coupled pyramidal cell axons. It is not known whether either, or both, of these apply in pathophysiological conditions. Spontaneously occurring interictal discharges occur in human tissue in vitro, resected from neocortical epileptic foci. VFO associated with these discharges was manifest in both field potential and, with phase delay, in excitatory synaptic inputs to fast spiking interneurons. Recruitment of somatic pyramidal cell and interneuron spiking was low, with no correlation between VFO power and synaptic inputs to principal cells. Reducing synaptic inhibition failed to affect VFO occurrence, but they were abolished by reduced gap junction conductance. These data suggest a lack of a causal role for interneurons, and favor a nonsynaptic pyramidal cell network origin for VFO in epileptic human neocortex.

Participants' perceptions of motivation, randomisation and withdrawal in a randomised controlled trial of interventions for prevention of depression. Little is known about how participants perceive prevention trials, particularly trials designed to prevent mental illness. This study examined participants' motives for participating in a trial and their views of randomisation and the ability to withdraw from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for prevention of depression. Participants were older adults reporting elevated depression symptoms (N = 900) living in urban and regional locations in Australia who had consented to participate in an RCT of interventions to prevent depression. Participants rated their agreement with various statements describing motivations for enrolment in the trial and opinions regarding randomisation and withdrawal. The majority of participants expressed a triad of altruistic motivation for participation, relative lack of concern about randomisation and commitment to the trial. Certain subgroups of participants, such as women and those with higher depression scores, reported higher levels of concern about specific issues. The findings suggest that participants enrolled in prevention trials for mental illness are likely to hold positive attitudes (eg, high commitment, low expectation of personal gain) towards research trials. The identification of relationships between key person factors and trial-related attitudes enabled profiling of participant groups, which can inform recruitment strategies and interactions of participants and research projects in future prevention trials.

[The method for calculation the dose absorbed by terrestrial animals for assessments of the environmental impact from radioactive contamination]. The method for calculatior of the exposure doses to terrestrial animals in areas contaminated by radionuclides using a point source dose function is presented. To take into account scattered gamma-radiation, the Berger formula for dose buildup factor in an infinite air medium has been parameterized. In developed dosimetric model, an animal phantom is presented as parallelepiped to estimate external dose exposures and as a tissue equivalent sphere to estimate internal doses. Using the analytical expressions, dose rate conversion coefficients for external and internal exposures of animals have been estimated for individual radionuclides. For energies of gamma-rays, the results are found to be in good agreement with those estimated by the Monte-Carlo method for the ellipsoidal phantoms of animals.

A 31-year-old woman with epigastric pain was given a diagnosis of a pseudocyst associated with pancreatitis. Despite treatment, symptoms did not completely improve and she was referred to our hospital. Since imaging examinations demonstrated findings characteristic of mucinous cystic neoplasm, the lesion was resected. Histopathologic examinations revealed mucinous cystic adenoma. Remains of intracystic hemorrhage were evident and short-term morphological changes were presumed to be associated with hemorrhage.

Regulation of XBP-1 signaling during transient and stable recombinant protein production in CHO cells. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is a key regulator of cellular unfolded protein response (UPR). The spliced isoform of XBP-1, XBP-1S, is a transcription activator, which is expressed only when UPR is induced. However, the impact of recombinant protein production on the regulation of XBP-1 signaling in CHO cells is not well understood. In this report, we cloned the Chinese hamster XBP-1 homolog to aid the investigation of the interplay between protein productivity, culture conditions, and endogenous XBP-1 signaling in CHO cells. Interestingly, expression of XBP-1S is detected in the non-producing and unstressed CHO-K1 cells. Transient expression of recombinant erythropoietin reveals a positive correlation between XBP-1 mRNA abundance and protein production level. However, such a correlation is not observed in batch cultivation of stable producing cell lines. The increased XBP-1 splicing is detected in late-phase cultures, suggesting that induction of XBP-1S may be a result of nutrient limitations or other environmental stresses rather than that of increased intracellular accumulation of recombinant proteins. Our data suggest that XBP-1 is a key determinant for the secretory capacity of CHO cells. Understanding its dynamic regulation hence provides a rational basis for cellular engineering strategies to improve recombinant protein secretion.

[Diagnostic value of quantitative low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography with three-dimensional speckle-tracking for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome]. To access left ventricular global deformation abnormalities during low-dose dobutamine stress test (DSE) by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography(3D-STE)in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and explore the diagnostic value of 3D-STE combined with DES for NSTE-ACS. Forty-nine patients with suspected NSTE-ACS underwent DSE and coronary angiography with an initial dobutamine dose of 5 µg·kg(-1)·min(-1), which was doubled at 3-min intervals to the peak dose of 20 µg·kg(-1)·min(-1). The global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), territory longitudinal strain (TLS), and territory circumferential strain (TCS) of the left ventricular subendocardial myocardium were measured with 3D-STE at rest and at the peak-dose stage. Conventional echocardiography and 3D-STE parameters and their changes during DSE were evaluated, and their diagnostic values were analyzed according to the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All the patients completed DSE uneventfully and 3D-STE showed a good reproducibility of the results. Compared with patients with non-NSTE-ACS, NSTE-ACS patients showed obviously reduced resting left ventricular global deformation function especially in terms of circumferential deformation (P<0.05); the ROC curves for the parameters were similar between the two groups (P>0.05). During DSE, the global deformation differences between the two groups further increased (P<0.01), and the diagnostic values of the peak-dose stage parameters were significantly greater than those of the resting parameters. ROC curves analysis showed that TLS and TCS at peak-dose stage had the highest diagnostic value for NSTE-ACS. 3D-STE combined with low-dose DSE is a safe and effective noninvasive technique for accessing and identifying NSTE-ACS, and DSE can significantly enhance the diagnostic value of 3D-STE.

Comparative analysis of selected exhaled breath biomarkers obtained with two different temperature-controlled devices. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a suitable and non-invasive method for evaluation of airway inflammation. Several studies indicate that the composition of the condensate and the recovery of biomarkers are affected by physical characteristics of the condensing device and collecting circumstances. Additionally, there is an apparent influence of the condensing temperature, and often the level of detection of the assay is a limiting factor. The ECoScreen2 device is a new, partly single-use disposable system designed for studying different lung compartments. EBC samples were collected from 16 healthy non-smokers by using the two commercially available devices ECoScreen2 and ECoScreen at a controlled temperature of -20 degrees C. EBC volume, pH, NOx, LTB4, PGE2, 8-isoprostane and cys-LTs were determined. EBC collected with ECoScreen2 was less acidic compared to ECoScreen. ECoScreen2 was superior concerning condensate volume and detection of biomarkers, as more samples were above the detection limit (LTB4 and PGE2) or showed higher concentrations (8-isoprostane). However, NOx was detected only in EBC sampled by ECoScreen. ECoScreen2 in combination with mediator specific enzyme immunoassays may be suitable for measurement of different biomarkers. Using this equipment, patterns of markers can be assessed that are likely to reflect the complex pathophysiological processes in inflammatory respiratory disease.

Chemosensory properties of human sweat. Human sweat contains a mixture of odorants with trigeminal as well as olfactory properties. It has been shown that trigeminal perception is necessary to localize odors and that humans are not able to localize substances that only activate the olfactory system. To analyze the chemosensory properties of human sweat, we studied humans' ability to localize sweat stimuli to the different nostrils. Human sweat was collected during a bicycle workout (20 males) and was then applied to 34 different subjects (17 females) during odor detection and localization experiments by using an olfactometer. During the detection experiment, subjects were instructed to discriminate between sweat stimuli (20) and blanks (10). During the localization experiment, they were assigned to allocate the stimuli to either the right (15) or the left nostril (15). We found that subjects were able to detect the sweat stimuli with moderate to high sensitivity. However, they failed to localize the sweat stimuli to the accurate nostril above chance level. Due to this inability to localize the stimuli, we conclude that human sweat does not activate the intranasal trigeminal system but only the olfactory system.

The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum: cell biological peculiarities and nutritional consequences. Apicomplexan parasites obligatorily invade and multiply within eukaryotic cells. Phylogenetically, they are related to a group of algae which, during their evolution, have acquired a secondary endosymbiont. This organelle, which in the parasite is called the apicoplast, is highly reduced compared to the endosymbionts of algae, but still contains many plant-specific biosynthetic pathways. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum infects mammalian erythrocytes which are devoid of intracellular compartments and which largely lack biosynthetic pathways. Despite the limited resources of nutrition, the parasite grows and generates up to 32 merozoites which are the infectious stages of the complex life cycle. A large part of the intra-erythrocytic development takes place in the so-called parasitophorous vacuole, a compartment which forms an interface between the parasite and the cytoplasm of the host cell. In the course of parasite growth, the host cell undergoes dramatic alterations which on one hand contribute directly to the symptoms of severe malaria and which, on the other hand, are also required for parasite survival. Some of these alterations facilitate the acquisition of nutrients from the extracellular environment which are not provided by the host cell. Here, we describe the cell biologically unique interactions between an intracellular eukaryotic pathogen and its metabolically highly reduced host cell. We further discuss current models to explain the appearance of pathogen-induced novel physiological properties in a host cell which has lost its genetic programme.

Impact of biostimulated redox processes on metal dynamics in an iron-rich creek soil of a former uranium mining area. Understanding the dynamics of metals and radionuclides in soil environments is necessary for evaluating risks to pristine sites. An iron-rich creek soil of a former uranium-mining district (Ronneburg, Germany) showed high porewater concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides. Thus, this study aims to (i) evaluate metal dynamics during terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) and (ii) characterize active microbial populations in biostimulated soil microcosms using a stable isotope probing (SIP) approach. In biostimulated soil slurries, concentrations of soluble Co, Ni, Zn, As, and unexpectedly U increased during Fe(III)-reduction. This suggests that there was a release of sorbed metals and As during reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-oxides. Subsequent sulfate-reduction was concurrent with a decrease of U, Co, Ni, and Zn concentrations. The relative contribution of U(IV) in the solid phase changed from 18.5 to 88.7% after incubation. The active Fe(III)-reducing population was dominated by delta-Proteobacteria (Geobacter) in (13)C-ethanol amended microcosms. A more diverse community was present in (13)C-lactate amended microcosms including taxa related to Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, delta-Proteobacteria, and beta-Proteobacteria. Our results suggested that biostimulated Fe(III)-reducing communities facilitated the release of metals including U to groundwater which is in contrast to other studies.

A novel cleft rhinoplasty procedure combining an open rhinoplasty with the Dibbell and Tajima techniques: a 10-year review. The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel cleft rhinoplasty procedure that combines an open rhinoplasty with the Dibbell and Tajima techniques. A single-surgeon, 10-year, retrospective review was conducted of all unilateral cleft lip rhinoplasties (n = 157). Nonsyndromic patients undergoing a combined open incision/Dibbell/Tajima procedure and who had follow-up of greater than 8 months were included. Thirty-five patients were identified. Standardized patient photographs were studied in 18 patients who had both preoperative and 1-year postoperative photographs. Farkas normal values were applied to the medial canthal distance; from this value, metric measurements of changes in alar base width, columellar height, and nostril apex height were derived. There were no complications secondary to skin envelope ischemia or cartilage graft infection. The revision rate was 11 percent for alar base position, 3 percent for depressed lower lateral cartilage, and 3 percent for nostril apex overhang. After the procedure, there was a statistically significant decrease in alar base width (19.9 mm versus 18.2 mm; p < 0.01) and an increase in columellar height (8.37 mm versus 9.59 mm; p = 0.02) and nostril apex height (4.70 mm versus 5.44 mm; p = 0.02) on the affected side. The differences in alar base width, columellar height, and nostril apex height between the affected and nonaffected sides all decreased significantly postoperatively. The combined open rhinoplasty/Dibbell/Tajima procedure is safe, has a low revision rate, and is associated with a statistically significant decrease in alar base width, an increase in columellar height and nostril apex height, and a greater symmetry of nasal form.


Right hepatic artery crossing the common hepatic artery: an unusual blood supply to the liver.

David D. Derse, 1949-2009. David D. Derse, Ph.D., Head of the Retrovirus Gene Expression Section in the HIV Drug Resistance Program at the National Cancer Institute-Frederick (NCI-Frederick), passed away on October 9, 2009, a scant six weeks after being diagnosed with liver cancer. It was with great sadness that family, friends, and colleagues gathered together for his memorial service on Saturday, October 17, 2009, at the Middletown United Methodist Church in Maryland. As a NCI scientist since 1986, Dave studied the molecular mechanisms of infection and replication of a number of different types of retroviruses. Dave became an internationally known expert on human T cell lymphotrophic viruses type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) and served on the editorial boards of Virology and Retrovirology. His most recent studies focused on the mechanisms of HTLV-1 virion morphogenesis, transmission, and replication.

Severity of disease in patients admitted for acute care to a general hospital: age and gender differences. Debates regarding unnecessary admissions and the benefit of hospitalization of older people for acute care lack data about severity of disease in older compared with younger patients, and comparison of gender. The objective was to assess the severity of illness upon admission in relation to age and gender, in a single-center, prospective observational study. Place was the Emergency room in a general community hospital in Oslo, Norway. Patients were consecutively admitted for acute care from October 1st to December 31st 2006. The Acute Physiological Score (APS), which is part of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) upon admission, age and gender, were main outcomes. Of a total of 1736 patients admitted, 1565 (90.1%) were included in the study, 918 (58.7%) women and 600 (38.3%) aged 80+ years. Estimate (95% CI) for the age effect on the APS was 0.02 (0.016, 0.024), p<0.0001, which implies that the APS increases by 0.2 for every increase of one year, after adjusting for co-morbidities. The effect of female gender was -0.39 (-0.54, -0.24). Gender difference was highest among patients 80 years and older. Older patients admitted for acute care have a higher severity of disease than younger ones. Males have more severe disease than females, particularly the oldest.


Modulation and Functional Role of the Orientations of the N- and P-Domains of Cu+ -Transporting ATPase along the Ion Transport Cycle.

Determinants of low birth weight: a case control study in a district hospital in Karnataka. A Case-control study was conducted in District Lady Goschen hospital, Dakshina Kannada district, Southern Karnataka. Subjects were mothers who underwent normal delivery and their neonates. A total of 150 cases and 300 controls were selected. Significant risk factors identified in univariate analysis included pre pregnancy maternal weight (<45 kgs)(OR=6.77), anaemia in pregnancy (Hb<11 gm%) (OR=3.11), age less than 20 years (OR=2.96) and maternal height (<145 cms) (OR=2.79). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that pre pregnancy maternal weight (<45 kgs)(OR=7.02), anemia in pregnancy (OR=4.37) and maternal age less than 20 years (OR=3.96) were the significant risk factors of low birth weight of term babies. The strategy needs to focus attention on nutrition education to facilitate better weight gain during adolescent period. Discouraging teenage pregnancy is also essential in order to reduce the burden of LBW babies.


Protective effect of glutathione S-transferase-fused mutant staphylococcal enterotoxin C against Staphylococcus aureus-induced bovine mastitis.

Chronic vagal stimulation in patients with congestive heart failure. Increased sympathetic and reduced vagal activity predict increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Experimentally, vagal stimulation (VS) is protective both during acute myocardial ischemia and in chronic heart failure. In man, VS is used in refractory epilepsy but has never been used in cardiovascular diseases. Thus, there is a strong rationale to investigate the effects of chronic VS in patients with CHF. We assesses the feasibility and safety of chronic VS with CardioFit (BioControl Medical), a VS implantable system delivering pulses synchronous with heart beats to the right cervical vagus nerve in a preliminary pilot study in eight advanced CHF patients with favorable results, and subsequently in a larger multicenter study. Overall, 32 patients have been successfully implanted (mostly in NYHA Class III; mean age 56 years, ischemic etiology in 69%; prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in 63%; concomitant beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 100%). Preliminary results confirm feasibility of the study, an acceptable side effect profile and promising preliminary efficacy data. Several mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial effect observed in patients with heart failure. Should these results be confirmed in larger controlled studies, chronic vagal stimulation could be a further treatment option for CHF patients, possibly integrated with defibrillator and resynchronization therapies.

Probiotics prevent death caused by Citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice. Intestinal bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates. Therefore, the aims of this study were to characterize Citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice and determine the role played by specific probiotics in ameliorating disease severity. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with C. rodentium was performed at postnatal day 14. A subset of mice was pretreated orally with either a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus helveticus or placebo, starting at 7 days. To study the effects of B and T cells, rag1(-/-) and JH(-/-) mice were used, with survival, colonic crypt depth, and barrier function evaluated as outcome measures. C. rodentium infection caused weight loss and death. In contrast, survival was maintained by daily treatment with Lactobacilli. Weight loss, colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia, mucosal barrier dysfunction, and elevated serum corticosterone levels in C. rodentium-infected wild-type mice were ameliorated by probiotics, but not in rag1(-/-) animals. Beneficial effects of probiotics were observed in B cell-deficient (JH(-/-)) mice, indicating the requirement of T cells in reducing the adverse sequelae of neonatal enteric infection. These findings demonstrate that C. rodentium infection in newborn mice causes death and that probiotics promote survival, but only in the presence of T cells.

Single-molecule measurements of synthesis by DNA polymerase with base-pair resolution.

A two-subunit bacterial sigma-factor activates transcription in Bacillus subtilis. The sigma-like factor YvrI and coregulator YvrHa activate transcription from a small set of conserved promoters in Bacillus subtilis. We report here that these two proteins independently contribute sigma-region 2 and sigma-region 4 functions to a holoenzyme-promoter DNA complex. YvrI binds RNA polymerase (RNAP) through a region 4 interaction with the beta-subunit flap domain and mediates specific promoter recognition but cannot initiate DNA melting at the -10 promoter element. Conversely, YvrHa possesses sequence similarity to a conserved core-binding motif in sigma-region 2 and binds to the N-terminal coiled-coil element in the RNAP beta'-subunit previously implicated in interaction with region 2 of sigma-factors. YvrHa plays an essential role in stabilizing the open complex and interacts specifically with the N-terminus of YvrI. Based on these results, we propose that YvrHa is situated in the transcription complex proximal to the -10 element of the promoter, whereas YvrI is responsible for -35 region recognition. This system presents an unusual example of a two-subunit bacterial sigma-factor.

Cancers, infections, and endocrine diseases in women with endometriosis. To assess the prevalence of patient-reported, physician-diagnosed comorbid conditions in women with endometriosis. Cross-sectional study of self-reported survey data. Academic research. Four thousand three hundred thirty-one Endometriosis Association (EA) members reporting surgically diagnosed endometriosis. None. Self-reported, physician-diagnosed infectious diseases, cancers, and endocrine diseases. Nearly two-thirds of women reported one or more of the assessed conditions. Recurrent upper respiratory infections and recurrent vaginal infections were common and more likely in women responding to the EA survey. Melanoma was reported by 0.7% (n=29), breast cancer by 0.4% (n=16), and ovarian cancer by 0.2% (n=10). While ovarian cancer and melanoma were significantly more common than in the general population, breast cancer was surprisingly less common. Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome were rare (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). Respondents reported a higher prevalence of recurrent upper respiratory or vaginal infections, melanoma, and ovarian cancer than the general population. These findings document other potential associations related to the immune system, which may help focus future research into this disease.

[Evaluation of the implant sites of palatal implants using cone beam computed tomography]. To investigate the vertical bone height and the bone density of the palate for implants placement using cone beam CT(CBCT) and to provide references to the safe and stable placement of palatal implants. Three-dimensional reformatting images were reconstructed with the selected CBCT scanning data of 34 patients aged 18 to 35 yeras, by means of EZ implant software. The vertical bone height was measured at 20 interesting sites of palate. Bone density was measured at 10 sites that could support 3.0 mm long implants. The data of the vertical bone height and bone density were analyzed by K-means cluster analysis. According to the cluster analysis results, the 10 sites were classified into 3 clusters. There were statistical differences among these three clusters in bone height and bone density (P < 0.05). The LSD result showed that the greatest mean value of vertical bone height was obtained in cluster 2, followed by cluster 1 and cluster 3; the highest bone density was founded in cluster 3, followed by cluster 1 and cluster 2. Evaluation of the sites for palatal implant placement with cone beam CT would be helpful in safe and stable implantation.

[Regulation of food intake by gastrointestinal peptides]. Short-term regulation of food intake controls what, when and how much we eat during a single day or a meal, and is regulated by mechanical stimulation and release of peptides in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Both composition and structure of food affect peptide release. Many of these peptides inhibit also GI motility. Macronutrients stimulate GI peptides in different ways. Of special interest are the peptides ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY. The amount of existing literature is, however, limited, and the results somewhat contradictory, which makes it challenging to make conclusions about the exact role of different macronutrients.

Device therapy and cardiac transplantation for end-stage heart failure. The prevalence of heart failure is increasing, and the prognosis of end-stage heart failure remains dismal. The gold-standard therapy in end-stage heart failure remains cardiac transplantation at the present time, but there is a great excess of eligible candidates compared with the number of donor organs. Advances in mechanical support, the development of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and the total artificial heart has reduced mortality and morbidity in patients awaiting transplantation, and LVADs are now approved as an strategy for destination therapy. Miniaturization, increased device durability, and complete implantability may render LVADs an option in earlier stages of heart failure, as a bridge to myocardial recovery or even as a viable alternative to transplantation. Alternative strategies under investigation are cell therapy and xenotransplantation. In the present article, current and potential future therapeutic options in end-stage heart failure are reviewed.


Stably maintained dendritic spines are associated with lifelong memories.

Macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha/CCL-20 is transcriptionally induced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine in human mononuclear phagocytes through nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Alterations in iron availability can trigger pro-inflammatory signals in various cell types. We demonstrate that desferrioxamine (DFX), an iron chelator used in clinics for the treatment of iron overload, neoplasias, and Alzheimer disease, stimulates the expression and secretion of CCL20, a chemoattractant for immature dendritic cells, activated/memory T lymphocytes, and naive B cells, in primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Iron chelation was part of the mechanism by which DFX induced CCL20, because addition of iron sulfate counteracted its stimulatory effects. Functional studies of the CCL20 promoter, using a series of 5'-deleted and mutated reporter constructs, demonstrated that CCL20 mRNA induction was dependent on gene transcription activation and mediated by the NF-kappaB pathway. The NF-kappaB element located at position -92/-82 of the CCL20 promoter was required for gene transactivation by DFX because: (i) transcription was abrogated by a 3bp mutation of the NF-kappaB-binding motif; (ii) treatment with DFX increased specific NF-kappaB binding to this sequence. Nuclear translocation of both NF-kappaBp65 and NF-kappaBp50 family members was increased in response to DFX and associated with I-kappaBalpha degradation, suggesting a role for these subunits in CCL20 promoter transactivation. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that iron chelation can transcriptionally induce CCL20 in mononuclear phagocytes and identify the NF-kappaB binding site as a regulatory sequence of the CCL20 promoter that is activated by iron deprivation. These results add new insights into our understanding of the mechanisms by which iron perturbations affect mononuclear phagocyte immune functions and regulate inflammatory responses.

Eight-year prescription trends of memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors among persons 65 years and older in Germany. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term trends of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and memantine prescriptions in Germany according to sex, age and type of prescribing medical specialist. We used data of the statutory health insurance company Gmünder ErsatzKasse for persons aged 65 years and older over the years 2000-2007. Trends in prescription prevalences were stratified and directly standardized. The standardized prescription prevalence of antidementia drugs in persons aged > or =65 years doubled in the period of 8 years in males (from 0.66% in 2000 to 1.32% in 2007) and in females (from 0.88 to 1.73%). We found significant 2.12-2.48-fold increases for the age group 80 years and above, smaller in the age group 70-79 years (1.57-1.94-fold) and no clear trend for those in the age range 65-69 years. The proportion of memantine prescribed by neurologists and psychiatrists increased from 22.6% in 2000 to 45.8% in 2007. Our study gives first insights into prescribing trends of antidementia drugs in Germany. Further evidence from health services research on dementia care is clearly needed.


Functional magnetic resonance imaging of effects of a nicotinic agonist in schizophrenia.

Classification of respiratory signals by linear analysis. The aim of this study is the classification of wheeze and non-wheeze epochs within respiratory sound signals acquired from patients with asthma and COPD. Since a wheeze signal, having a sinusoidal waveform, has a different behavior in time and frequency domains from that of a non-wheeze signal, the features selected for classification are kurtosis, Renyi entropy, f(50)/ f(90) ratio and mean-crossing irregularity. Upon calculation of these features for each wheeze and non-wheeze portion, the whole data scattered as two classes in four dimensional feature space is projected using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) onto the single dimensional space that separates the two classes best. Observing that the two classes are visually well separated in this new space, Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing is applied. Finally, the correct classification rate is %95.1 for the training set, and leave-one-out approach pursuing the above methodology yields a success rate of %93.5 for the test set.

Experimental evaluation of aniline and methyl blue for intraocular surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biocompatibility of aniline and methyl blue in a well-established cell culture model and assess the staining properties of these dyes at the level of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) in human donor eyes. Dye-related toxicity was evaluated by a colorimetric test (MTT) measuring the inhibition of retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19 and primary human retinal pigment epithelium) cell proliferation. Cell viability was also quantified based on a two-color fluorescence assay (Life-Dead Assay). Aniline blue and methyl blue at a concentration of 0.2% was applied over the macula during vitrectomy in human donor eyes to evaluate the staining properties at the level of the ILM. Both dyes and dye concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% showed no toxic effect on ARPE-19 and primary human retinal pigment epithelium cell proliferation for exposure times of 1 and 10 minutes, respectively. Cell viability was also not affected at all. Both dyes provided a good contrast at the level of the ILM and allowed for a controlled removal of the ILM during surgery. No penetration into deeper retinal layers was noted. Our results indicate that aniline blue and methyl blue might be applicable for intraocular surgery, providing a very good biocompatibility and required selective staining characteristics at the level of the ILM.


Rapid monitoring of mRNA levels with a molecular beacon during microbial fermentation.

Glucocerebrosidase mutations are not a common risk factor for Parkinson disease in North Africa. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) have recently been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD). GBA mutations have been observed to be particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Interestingly, this population also has a high incidence of the Lrrk2 p.G2019S mutation which is similar in North African Arab-Berber populations. Herein, our sequencing of the GBA gene, in 33 North African Arab-Berber familial parkinsonism probands, identified two novel mutations in three individuals (p.K-26R and p.K186R). Segregation analysis of these two variants did not support a pathogenic role. Genotyping of p.K-26R, p.K186R and the common p.N370S in an ethnically matched series consisting of 395 patients with PD and 372 control subjects did not show a statistically significant association (P>0.05). The p.N370S mutation was only identified in 1 sporadic patient with PD and 3 control subjects indicating that the frequency of this mutation in the North African Arab-Berber population is much lower than that observed in Ashkenazi Jews, and therefore arose in the latter after expansion of the Lrrk2 p.G2019S variant in North Africa.

Comparison of database search strategies for high precursor mass accuracy MS/MS data. In shotgun proteomics, the analysis of tandem mass spectrometry data from peptides can benefit greatly from high mass accuracy measurements. In this study, we have evaluated two database search strategies which use high mass accuracy measurements of the peptide precursor ion. Our results indicate that peptide identifications are improved when spectra are searched with a wide mass tolerance window and precursor mass is used as a filter to discard incorrect matches. Database searches with a peptide data set constrained to peptides within a narrow mass window resulted in fewer peptide identifications but a significantly faster database search time.

Comparison of long-term outcomes following sirolimus-eluting stent vs paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation in patients with long calcified coronary lesions. Although previously reported studies on coronary calcification mainly focused on its presence or absence in discrete focal target lesions, calcified coronary lesions (CCL) angiographically present as diffuse long lesions in some patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) on long CCL. A total of 122 patients with 134 lesions (77 patients with 88 lesions for SES and 45 patients with 46 lesions for PES) were enrolled from 3 centers. Long CCL was defined visually as a culprit lesion with type B or C that was mainly due to coronary calcification with > 20 mm in total length by coronary angiography. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 year and angiographic follow-up at 6 to 9 months after procedure. Major adverse coronary events (MACE) were defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat target-lesion revascularization (TLR). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline, procedural, or angiographic characteristics and in 1-year rates of all-cause death, MI, and TLR between the 2 groups (all P = NS [not significant]). Likewise, the cumulative incidence of MACE at 1 year was similar between the 2 groups (7.8% of patients in the SES group vs 4.4% of patients in the PES group, respectively, P = NS). In patients who underwent follow-up angiography, the angiographic binary restenosis rate was 6.2% in the SES group vs 12.1% in the PES group, respectively (P = NS). In patients with long CCL, both SES and PES were comparably effective in either angiographic or clinical long-term outcomes.

Microbiological and microscopic analysis of the pulp of non-vital traumatized teeth with intact crowns. This study evaluated the presence of microorganisms and analyzed microscopically the pulp of 20 traumatized human teeth with intact crowns and clinical diagnosis of pulp necrosis, based on the association of at least three of the clinical criteria: crown discoloration, negative response to thermal and electric pulp vitality tests, positive response to vertical and horizontal percussion, pain on palpation or mobility. Microbiological collection was performed from the root canals to evaluate the presence of microorganisms. The pulp samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) for histological evaluation of possible morphological alterations. Analysis of results was performed by statistical tests (linear regression test and diagnostic analysis) and subjective analysis of the sections stained with H.E. and revealed that only 15% of the sample did not exhibit microbial development. The time elapsed between dental trauma and onset of endodontic intervention ranged from 15 days to 31 months; the percussion test presented high sensitivity (80%) for detection of microorganisms in the root canal of traumatized teeth; 3 teeth (15%) did not present pulp tissue, being characterized as complete autolysis; analysis of pulp samples was performed on the other 17 cases, among which 3 (15%) exhibited partial necrosis without possibility of repair and 14 presented complete necrosis; none of the clinical criteria employed for the diagnosis of pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth was pathognomonic. The present results allowed the following conclusions: with regard to microbiological findings, 85% of teeth presented microorganisms in the root canal, despite the presence of an intact crown. Concerning the microscopic findings, 100% of traumatized teeth presented pulp necrosis; the pulp vitality tests based on pulp response to heat, cold and vertical percussion were the most reliable to diagnose pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth.

Systematic evaluation of observational methods assessing biomechanical exposures at work. This systematic review aimed to identify published observational methods assessing biomechanical exposures in occupational settings and evaluate them with reference to the needs of different users. We searched scientific databases and the internet for material from 1965 to September 2008. Methods were included if they were primarily based on the systematic observation of work, the observation target was the human body, and the method was clearly described in the literature. A systematic evaluation procedure was developed to assess concurrent and predictive validity, repeatability, and aspects related to utility. At least two evaluators independently carried out this evaluation. We identified 30 eligible observational methods. Of these, 19 had been compared with some other method(s), varying from expert evaluation to data obtained from video recordings or through the use of technical instruments. Generally, the observations showed moderate to good agreement with the corresponding assessments made from video recordings; agreement was the best for large-scale body postures and work actions. Postures of wrist and hand as well as trunk rotation seemed to be more difficult to observe correctly. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability were reported for 7 and 17 methods, respectively, and were judged mostly to be good or moderate. With training, observers can reach consistent results on clearly visible body postures and work activities. Many observational tools exist, but none evaluated in this study appeared to be generally superior. When selecting a method, users should define their needs and assess how results will influence decision-making.

Thai venous stroke prognostic score: TV-SPSS. Prognosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has never been studied in Thailand. A simple prognostic score to predict poor prognosis of CVST has also never been reported. The authors are aiming to establish a simple and reliable prognostic score for this condition. The medical records of CVST patients from eight neurological training centers in Thailand who received between April 1993 and September 2005 were reviewed as part of this retrospective study. Clinical features included headache, seizure, stroke risk factors, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), blood pressure on arrival, papilledema, hemiparesis, meningeal irritation sign, location of occluded venous sinuses, hemorrhagic infarction, cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure, treatment options, length of stay, and other complications were analyzed to determine the outcome using modified Rankin scale (mRS). Poor prognosis (defined as mRS of 3-6) was determined on the discharge date. One hundred ninety four patients' records, 127 females (65.5%) and mean age of 36.6 +/- 14.4 years, were analyzed Fifty-one patients (26.3%) were in the poor outcome group (mRS 3-6). Overall mortality was 8.4%. Univariate analysis and then multivariate analysis using SPSS version 11.5 revealed only four statistically significant predictors influencing outcome of CVST They were underlying malignancy, low GCS, presence of hemorrhagic infarction (for poor outcome), and involvement of lateral sinus (for good outcome). Thai venous stroke prognostic score (TV-SPSS) was derived from these four factors using a multiple logistic model. A simple and pragmatic prognostic score for CVST outcome has been developed with high sensitivity (93%), yet low specificity (33%). The next study should focus on the validation of this score in other prospective populations.

Innate and adaptive cellular phenotypes contributing to pulmonary disease in mice after respiratory syncytial virus immunization and infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major leading cause of infantile viral bronchiolitis. However, cellular phenotypes contributing to the RSV protection and vaccine-enhanced disease remain largely unknown. Upon RSV challenge, we analyzed phenotypes and cellularity in the lung of mice that were naïve, immunized with formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), or re-infected with RSV. In comparison with naïve and live RSV re-infected mice, the high levels of eosinophils, neutrophils, plasmacytoid and CD11b(+) dendritic cells, and IL-4(+) CD4(+) T cells were found to be contributing to pulmonary inflammation in FI-RSV immune mice despite lung viral clearance. Alveolar macrophages appeared to play differential roles in protection and inflammation upon RSV infection of different RSV immune mice. These results suggest that multiple innate and adaptive immune components differentially contribute to RSV disease and inflammation.

Ureteral implantation using a three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy: description of technique and outcome in nine dogs. To report the procedure, postoperative outcome and complications of a new technique for ureteral implantation by means of a three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy in dogs. Clinical records of dogs requiring ureteral implantation between April 2007 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment, preoperative biochemistry results, details of the surgical procedure, perioperative and postoperative complications, postoperative biochemistry results and outcome. Nine dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up times ranged from 10 to 79 months (median 30 months), with 8 of 9 dogs having an excellent long-term outcome and no major postoperative complications. One dog with follicular cystitis as a comorbidity developed obstruction from inflammatory granuloma and required revision surgery. The three-stitch technique for ureteral implantation compares favourably to previously documented techniques in terms of outcome and complication rates. Reduced tissue handling and a decreased volume of suture material may be beneficial for healing. The technique is also faster than previously described options, which may be of benefit in unstable patients requiring ureteral implantation due to traumatic injury or rupture.

Percutaneous transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells in a canine model of spinal cord injury. The authors describe a method for percutaneous transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB)-derived multipotent stem cells (MSCs) under fluoroscopic guidance. The investigators then tested whether percutaneous transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs improved neurological functional recovery after acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The authors induced SCI in 10 dogs by percutaneous balloon compression. The 10 injured dogs were assigned randomly to the following groups (2 dogs each): Group 1, evaluated 2 weeks after sham transplantation; Group 2, evaluated 2 weeks after transplantation; Group 3, evaluated 4 weeks after sham transplantation; Group 4, evaluated 4 weeks after transplantation; and Group 5, evaluated 4 weeks after multispot transplantations. The dogs with sham transplantation (Groups 1 and 3) received the same volume of saline, as a control. A spinal needle was advanced into the spinal canal, and the investigators confirmed that the end of the spinal needle was located in the ventral part of spinal cord parenchyma by using contrast medium under fluoroscopic guidance. The hUCB-derived MSCs were transplanted into the cranial end of the injured segment in 6 injured dogs at 7 days after SCI. Two dogs in Group 2 showed no improvement until 2 weeks after transplantation. Three of 4 dogs (Groups 4 and 5) that received cellular transplants exhibited gradual improvement in hindlimb locomotion from 3 weeks after cell transplantation. The CM-DiI-labeled hUCB-derived MSCs were observed in the spinal cord lesions at 4 weeks posttransplantation and exerted a significant beneficial effect by reducing cyst and injury size. The transplanted cells were positive for NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and von Willebrand factor. The percutaneous transplantation technique described here can be easily performed, and it differs from previous techniques by avoiding surgical exposure and allowing cells to be more precisely transplanted into the spinal cord. This technique has many potential applications in the treatment of human SCI by cell transplantation. The results also suggest that transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs may have therapeutic effects that decrease cavitation for acute SCI.

Closure of autobiographical memories moderates their directive effect on behaviour. Specific autobiographical memories have been theorised to serve a directive function, whereby the content of the memory directs behaviour outside awareness. The present research tested whether the extent to which a memory feels low in closure, or psychologically not in the past, moderates this directive effect. A total of 163 participants in an online experiment were asked to recollect a specific autobiographical memory of a time they had failed to donate to charity, or were not asked to recollect a memory. Those who recollected a memory were randomly assigned to think of the memory as high versus low in closure. Recollecting an autobiographical memory made to feel low in closure led to more memory-relevant behaviour than either recollecting a memory made to feel high in closure, or no memory at all. Moreover, the directive effect of a low-closure memory occurred whether participants were made aware of an upcoming behavioural opportunity or not. Discussion centres on possible processes linking low closure and behaviour, as well as implications for the self-memory system theory of autobiographical memory.

Effects of landmark distance and stability on accuracy of reward relocation. Although small-scale navigation is well studied in a wide range of species, much of what is known about landmark use by vertebrates is based on laboratory experiments. To investigate how vertebrates in the wild use landmarks, we trained wild male rufous hummingbirds to feed from a flower that was placed in a constant spatial relationship with two artificial landmarks. In the first experiment, the landmarks and flower were 0.25, 0.5 or 1 m apart and we always moved them 3-4 m after each visit by the bird. In the second experiment, the landmarks and flower were always 0.25 m apart and we moved them either 1 or 0.25 m between trials. In tests, in which we removed the flower, the hummingbirds stopped closer to the predicted flower location when the landmarks had been closer to the flower during training. However, while the distance that the birds stopped from the landmarks and predicted flower location was unaffected by the distance that the landmarks moved between trials, the birds directed their search nearer to the predicted direction of the flower, relative to the landmarks, when the landmarks and flower were more stable in the environment. In the field, then, landmarks alone were sufficient for the birds to determine the distance of a reward but not its direction.

Risk for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens, Bangladesh. To evaluate risk factors for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study. We enrolled 25 case farms (cases March-November 2007) and 75 control farms (June-November 2007). We used a questionnaire to collect farm data, which were analyzed by matched-pair analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Factors independently associated were offering slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard chickens (odds ratio [OR] 13.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-131.98, p = 0.027), having a nearby water body (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24-22.34, p = 0.024), and having contact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14-17.50, p = 0.032). Separating chickens and ducks at night was protective (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.45, p = 0.006). Reducing these risks and taking protective measures might reduce the risk for influenza (H5N1) infection in backyard chickens.

Reduction of Listeria monocytogenes on the surface of fresh channel catfish fillets by bacteriophage Listex P100. Bacteriophage Listex P100 (phage P100) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service for Listeria monocytogenes control on both raw and ready-to-eat food products. In this article, we present the proof of concept on the influence of phage dose, phage contact time, and storage temperature on the listericidal activity of phage P100 in reducing the L. monocytogenes loads on the surface of fresh channel catfish fillet. The fresh catfish fillet samples were surface inoculated with approximately 4.3 log(10) colony forming units (CFU)/g of a two serotype mix (1/2a and 4b) of L. monocytogenes cells and then surface treated with phage P100. L. monocytogenes reduction was influenced by phage contact time and phage dose regardless of higher or lower temperature regimes tested on catfish fillet. The reduction in L. monocytogenes loads (p < 0.05) with the phage P100 dose of 2 x 10(7) plaque forming units (PFU)/g (7.3 log(10) PFU/g) was 1.4-2.0 log(10) CFU/g at 4 degrees C, 1.7-2.1 log(10) CFU/g at 10 degrees C, and 1.6-2.3 log(10) CFU/g at room temperature (22 degrees C) on raw catfish fillet. The phage contact time of 30 min was adequate to yield greater than 1 log(10) CFU/g reduction in L. monocytogenes, whereas 15 min contact time with phage yielded less than 1 log(10) CFU/g reduction in L. monocytogenes loads on catfish fillet. Phage P100 titer was stable on catfish fillet samples, and overall reductions in L. monocytogenes counts were still maintained over a 10-day shelf life at 4 degrees C or 10 degrees C by phage P100 treatment. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of an alternative generally recognized as safe antimicrobial such as bacteriophage Listex P100 in quantitatively reducing L. monocytogenes from fresh catfish fillet surfaces.


Characterization of spatiotemporal gait characteristics in clinically normal dogs and dogs with spinal cord disease.

Outcomes of intestinal failure--a comparison between children with short bowel and dysmotile intestine. We investigated whether mortality, intestinal adaptation, and liver function differ between intestinal failure (IF) patients with either short bowel (SB) or bowel dysmotility (DM). Twenty-six consecutive patients with SB (n = 20) or DM (n = 6) treated between 2000 and 2007 were retrospectively assessed. Intestinal failure was defined as less than 25% of age-adjusted small intestinal length or dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) more than 6 months. Median age-adjusted small intestinal length (17% vs 45%) and gestational age (35 vs 40 weeks) were (P < .05) shorter, whereas proportion of the remaining colon (86% vs 0%) was (P < .05) higher in the SB group relative to the DM group. Overall survival was 92%. Median peak serum bilirubin (80 vs 25 micromol/L) and rate of cholestasis (11/20 vs 0/6) were higher (P < .05) in the SB group. Short bowel rather than DM as an etiology of IF predicted weaning off PN (RR, 39.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-526; P < .01) and development of cholestasis (risk ration [RR], 18.3; 95% CI, 0.658-127; P < .05). Three SB children developed liver failure and two died, whereas neither of these occurred in the DM group. Children with SB are more likely to wean off PN but more prone to cholestatic liver disease than those with DM as an etiology of IF.

A novel method of consensus pan-chromosome assembly and large-scale comparative analysis reveal the highly flexible pan-genome of Acinetobacter baumannii. Infections by pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii plague military and civilian healthcare systems. Previous A. baumannii pan-genomic studies used modest sample sizes of low diversity and comparisons to a single reference genome, limiting our understanding of gene order and content. A consensus representation of multiple genomes will provide a better framework for comparison. A large-scale comparative study will identify genomic determinants associated with their diversity and adaptation as a successful pathogen. We determine draft-level genomic sequence of 50 diverse military isolates and conduct the largest bacterial pan-genome analysis of 249 genomes. The pan-genome of A. baumannii is open when the input genomes are normalized for diversity with 1867 core proteins and a paralog-collapsed pan-genome size of 11,694 proteins. We developed a novel graph-based algorithm and use it to assemble the first consensus pan-chromosome, identifying both the order and orientation of core genes and flexible genomic regions. Comparative genome analyses demonstrate the existence of novel resistance islands and isolates with increased numbers of resistance island insertions over time, from single insertions in the 1950s to triple insertions in 2011. Gene clusters responsible for carbon utilization, siderophore production, and pilus assembly demonstrate frequent gain or loss among isolates. The highly variable and dynamic nature of the A. baumannii genome may be the result of its success in rapidly adapting to both abiotic and biotic environments through the gain and loss of gene clusters controlling fitness. Importantly, some archaic adaptation mechanisms appear to have reemerged among recent isolates.

Atelocollagen-delivered siRNA targeting the FABP5 gene as an experimental therapy for prostate cancer in mouse xenografts. The gene FABP5 encodes cutaneous fatty acid binding protein (C-FABP) that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it acts as a putative oncogene. To test the hypothesis that siRNA to FABP5 delivered to the external environment of a prostate cancer would reduce the level of C-FABP in vivo, experiments were established whereby siRNA to FABP5 suspended in atelocollagen was injected around tumour masses produced by PC-3M cells in Balb/c nude mice and compared with the effect of non-specific scrambled siRNA in atelocollagen. At autopsy, the average size of tumours from the groups treated with 10 and 15 microM siRNA in atelocollagen was significantly (p=0.02) reduced by more than 3-fold, when compared to the controls. In contrast, when compared to the tumours produced by the group treated with scrambled siRNA, treatment with 10 microM FABP5 siRNA in buffer and 1 or 5 microM siRNA in atelocollagen did not produce significant differences. Although the dosage of 15 microM siRNA produced a greater reduction in tumour sizes when compared with 10 microM, this difference was not significant (p=0.9). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed that the levels of C-FABP expression in tumours from mice treated with 10 and 15 microM dosages were lower than those from the other groups. These data demonstrate that FABP5 siRNA delivered by atelocollagen to the external environment surrounding a tumour mass can effectively inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in nude mice when administered in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of >10 microM.


Genetic influences on the cognitive biases associated with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents.

Conjoint effects of serum calcium and phosphate on risk of total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in the community. Hyperphosphatemia is a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease. Relations of circulating calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (Pi) to long-term mortality risk in the community require further investigation. Associations of serum Ca and Pi to mortality were evaluated in a community-based cohort of 2176 men (mean age, 50.1 years). During follow-up (median, 29.8 years), 1009 men died, and 466 of these deaths resulted from cardiovascular causes. In Cox proportional hazards models, serum Pi and [CaxPi] were independent predictors of total mortality (hazard ratio per SD, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=0.03; 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18; P=0.01; 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P=0.008). Serum Ca was associated with risk of total mortality (1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P=0.02) and noncardiovascular mortality (1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21; P=0.04). Results were consistent after multivariate adjustments in subsamples of individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min and low-to-normal serum Ca and Pi. Circulating Ca and Pi levels are associated with risks of total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in the community, and their conjoint effects are additive. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether Ca and Pi are modifiable risk factors in the general population.

Intracranial complications of sinusitis: what is the role of endoscopic sinus surgery in the acute setting. Intracranial complications of sinusitis (ICS) are uncommon in the antibiotic era. The role of neurosurgical drainage of ICS is fairly well established, but the role for acute surgical intervention for the sinus disease is not well defined. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with ICS to see if we could identify the role and effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) in the acute setting of ICS. The study used a retrospective review of patients presenting to a tertiary care academic medical center for a 6-year period. Twenty-three patients were identified with ICS, including epidural (8), subdural (10), intracerebral abscesses (2), and meningitis (3). Males were more affected than females (7:1). Twenty patients were 21 years old or younger. Twenty-two patients (96%) had radiologic evidence of frontal sinusitis with prefrontal or frontal lobe ICS at presentation. Medical therapy alone was successful in avoiding craniotomy in only 3 of 8 cases. Endoscopic sinus surgery and intravenous antibiotics as initial treatment was successful in avoiding craniotomy in only 1 of 6 patients. Of 23 patients, 18 underwent neurosurgical procedures--9 emergent procedures for abscesses more than 1 cm and 9 delayed procedures for persistent disease despite ICS less than 1 cm at presentation. Intracranial complications of sinusitis usually result from indirect spread of acute frontal sinusitis. The role of ESS in the initial treatment of ICS is not clear. In our series, ESS did not appear to alter the need for neurosurgical intervention, which was ultimately necessary in most patients with ICS, even with lesions less than 1 cm.

Entorrhizomycota: A New Fungal Phylum Reveals New Perspectives on the Evolution of Fungi. Entorrhiza is a small fungal genus comprising 14 species that all cause galls on roots of Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. Although this genus was established 130 years ago, crucial questions on the phylogenetic relationships and biology of this enigmatic taxon are still unanswered. In order to infer a robust hypothesis about the phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and to evaluate evolutionary trends, multiple gene sequences and morphological characteristics of Entorrhiza were analyzed and compared with respective findings in Fungi. In our comprehensive five-gene analyses Entorrhiza appeared as a highly supported monophyletic lineage representing the sister group to the rest of the Dikarya, a phylogenetic placement that received but moderate maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony bootstrap support. An alternative maximum likelihood tree with the constraint that Entorrhiza forms a monophyletic group with Basidiomycota could not be rejected. According to the first phylogenetic hypothesis, the teliospore tetrads of Entorrhiza represent the prototype of the dikaryan meiosporangium. The alternative hypothesis is supported by similarities in septal pore structure, cell wall and spindle pole bodies. Based on the isolated phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and its peculiar combination of features related to ultrastructure and reproduction mode, we propose a new phylum Entorrhizomycota, for the genus Entorrhiza, which represents an apparently widespread group of inconspicuous fungi.

IL-23 signaling enhances Th2 polarization and regulates allergic airway inflammation. IL-23/IL-17 axis is an important regulator in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of IL-23 in allergic airway inflammation is not well understood. In this study, we show that in an allergen-induced asthma model, mice with transgenic overexpression of IL-23R exhibited increased airway infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production, whereas those deficient in IL-23 displayed reduced airway inflammation. In vitro, IL-23-IL-23R signaling promoted GATA-3 expression and enhanced Th2 cytokine expression. Conversely, in the absence of this signal, Th2 cell differentiation was partially inhibited. Therefore, IL-23 signaling may regulate allergic asthma through modulation of Th2 cell differentiation.

Alleviation of high-fat diet-induced fatty liver damage in group IVA phospholipase A2-knockout mice. Hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, a feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is mediated by several putative factors including prostaglandins. In the present study, we examined whether group IVA phospholipase A(2) (IVA-PLA(2)), which catalyzes the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis, is involved in the development of fatty liver, using IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice. Male wild-type mice on high-fat diets (20% fat and 1.25% cholesterol) developed hepatocellular vacuolation and liver hypertrophy with an increase in the serum levels of liver damage marker aminotransferases when compared with wild-type mice fed normal diets. These high-fat diet-induced alterations were markedly decreased in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice. Hepatic triacylglycerol content was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice under normal dietary conditions. Although high-fat diets increased hepatic triacylglycerol content in both genotypes, the degree was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice. Under the high-fat dietary conditions, IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice had lower epididymal fat pad weight and smaller adipocytes than wild-type mice. The serum level of prostaglandin E(2), which has a fat storage effect, was lower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, irrespective of the kind of diet. In both genotypes, high-fat diets increased serum leptin levels equally between the two groups, but did not affect the serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, free fatty acid, triacylglycerol, glucose, or insulin. Our findings suggest that a deficiency of IVA-PLA(2) alleviates fatty liver damage caused by high-fat diets, probably because of the lower generation of IVA-PLA(2) metabolites, such as prostaglandin E(2). IVA-PLA(2) could be a promising therapeutic target for obesity-related diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Adipose tissue-derived stem cells inhibit neointimal formation in a paracrine fashion in rat femoral artery. Subcutaneous adipose tissue contains a lot of stem cells [adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)] that can differentiate into a variety of cell lineages. In this study, we isolated ASCs from Wistar rats and examined whether ASCs would efficiently differentiate into vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. We also administered ASCs in a wire injury model of rat femoral artery and examined their effects. ASCs expressed CD29 and CD90, but not CD34, suggesting that ASCs resemble bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. When induced to differentiate into ECs with endothelial growth medium (EGM), ASCs expressed Flt-1, but not Flk-1 or mature EC markers such as CD31 and vascular endothelial cadherin. ASCs produced angiopoietin-1 when they were cultured in EGM. ASCs stimulated the migration of EC, as assessed by chemotaxis assay. When ASCs that were cultured in EGM were injected in the femoral artery, the ASCs potently and significantly inhibited neointimal formation without being integrated in the endothelial layer. EGM-treated ASCs significantly suppressed neointimal formation even when they were administered from the adventitial side. ASC administration significantly promoted endothelial repair. These results suggested that although ASCs appear to have little capacity to differentiate into mature ECs, ASCs have the potential to secrete paracrine factors that stimulate endothelial repair. Our results also suggested that ASCs inhibited neointimal formation via their paracrine effect of stimulation of EC migration in situ rather than the direct integration into the endothelial layer.

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus infection of a resistant tomato line with a silenced sucrose transporter gene LeHT1 results in inhibition of growth, enhanced virus spread, and necrosis. To identify genes involved in resistance of tomato to Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), cDNA libraries from lines resistant (R) and susceptible (S) to the virus were compared. The hexose transporter LeHT1 was found to be expressed preferentially in R tomato plants. The role of LeHT1 in the establishment of TYLCV resistance was studied in R plants where LeHT1 has been silenced using Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing (TRV VIGS). Following TYLCV inoculation, LeHT1-silenced R plants showed inhibition of growth and enhanced virus accumulation and spread. In addition, a necrotic response was observed along the stem and petioles of infected LeHT1-silenced R plants, but not on infected not-silenced R plants. This response was specific of R plants since it was absent in infected LeHT1-silenced S plants. Necrosis had several characteristics of programmed cell death (PCD): DNA from necrotic tissues presented a PCD-characteristic ladder pattern, the amount of a JNK analogue increased, and production of reactive oxygen was identified by DAB staining. A similar necrotic reaction along stem and petioles was observed in LeHT1-silenced R plants infected with the DNA virus Bean dwarf mosaic virus and the RNA viruses Cucumber mosaic virus and Tobacco mosaic virus. These results constitute the first evidence for a necrotic response backing natural resistance to TYLCV in tomato, confirming that plant defense is organized in multiple layers. They demonstrate that the hexose transporter LeHT1 is essential for the expression of natural resistance against TYLCV and its expression correlates with inhibition of virus replication and movement.


An ex-vivo human intestinal model to study Entamoeba histolytica pathogenesis.

Increasing CNS noradrenaline reduces EAE severity. The endogenous neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) is known to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in glial cells, as well as provide neuroprotection against excitatory and inflammatory stimuli. These properties raise the possibility that increasing levels of NA in the central nervous system (CNS) could provide benefit in neurological diseases and conditions containing an inflammatory component. In the current study, we tested this possibility by examining the consequences of selectively modulating CNS NA levels on the development of clinical signs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide to develop a chronic disease, pretreatment to selectively deplete CNS NA levels exacerbated clinical scores. Elevation of NA levels using the selective NA reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine did not affect clinical scores, while treatment of immunized mice with the synthetic NA precursor L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS) prevented further worsening. In contrast, treatment of mice with a combination of atomoxetine and L-DOPS led to significant improvement in clinical scores as compared to the control group. The combined treatment reduced astrocyte activation in the molecular layer of the cerebellum as assessed by staining for glial fibrillary protein but did not affect Th1 or Th17 type cytokine production from splenic T cells. These data suggest that selective elevation of CNS NA levels could provide benefit in EAE and multiple sclerosis without influencing peripheral immune responses.


Pulsatility of insulin release--a clinically important phenomenon.

Brevirhabdus pacifica gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from deep-sea sediment in a hydrothermal vent field. A Gram-stain-negative, motile, aerobic bacterial strain, designated 22DY15T, was isolated from a deep-sea sediment sample collected from a hydrothermal vent field located in the East Pacific Rise. The isolate was a short rod with a single flagellum and was positive for catalase and oxidase activities. Q-10 was the predominant respiratory quinone. The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphoglycolipid, one aminolipid and three unidentified phospholipids. The principal fatty acid (>70 %) was C18 : 1ω7c. The genomic DNA G+C content was 64.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 22DY15T represents a distinct lineage within the family Rhodobacteraceae. The closest relatives were species of the genera Aliiroseovarius (93.3–96.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Sulfitobacter (94.0–96.0 %) and Loktanella (92.0–95.9 %). Differential phenotypic properties, together with phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain 22DY15T could be differentiated from its most closely related genera. Therefore, it is proposed that strain 22DY15T represents a novel species in a new genus of the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Brevirhabdus pacifica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is 22DY15T ( = JCM 19489T = DSM 27767T = CGMCC 1.12416T = MCCC 1K00276T).

Can suggestion obviate reading? Supplementing primary Stroop evidence with exploratory negative priming analyses. Using the Stroop paradigm, we have previously shown that a specific suggestion can remove or reduce involuntary conflict and alter information processing in highly suggestible individuals (HSIs). In the present study, we carefully matched less suggestible individuals (LSIs) to HSIs on a number of factors. We hypothesized that suggestion would influence HSIs more than LSIs and reduce the Stroop effect in the former group. As well, we conducted secondary post hoc analyses to examine negative priming (NP) - the apparent disruption of the response to a previously-ignored item. Our present findings indicate that suggestion reduces Stroop effects in HSIs. Secondary analyses show that LSIs had an NP effect at baseline (i.e., without suggestion) and that suggestion influenced the NP condition. Thus, at least in this experimental context, suggestion seems to dampen a deeply-engrained and largely automatic process - reading - by wielding a larger influence on HSIs relative to comparable LSIs.

Why isn't more injury prevention evidence-based? The focus on evidence-based practice is critical to addressing the issue of injuries, yet advances in the science of injury prevention have not always led to advances in practice. Effective approaches are not always adopted, or when adopted and transferred from one setting to another, they do not always achieve expected results. These challenges were the basis of two breakout sessions at the second European Injury Control and Safety Promotion Conference in Paris, France (October 2008). In summarising the key issues raised during those sessions, this article describes what is meant by evidence-based practice, discusses why evidence-based practice tends not to occur and considers approaches that may facilitate the adoption and implementation of evidence-based strategies. To address the challenge, specific action is required, both on the part of the research community and those responsible for developing and implementing injury prevention policies and programmes.

A first-generation haplotype map of maize. Maize is an important crop species of high genetic diversity. We identified and genotyped several million sequence polymorphisms among 27 diverse maize inbred lines and discovered that the genome was characterized by highly divergent haplotypes and showed 10- to 30-fold variation in recombination rates. Most chromosomes have pericentromeric regions with highly suppressed recombination that appear to have influenced the effectiveness of selection during maize inbred development and may be a major component of heterosis. We found hundreds of selective sweeps and highly differentiated regions that probably contain loci that are key to geographic adaptation. This survey of genetic diversity provides a foundation for uniting breeding efforts across the world and for dissecting complex traits through genome-wide association studies.

Detection and species identification of Leishmania DNA from filter paper lesion impressions for patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis. Traditional detection of Leishmania from ulcers involves collection of invasive specimens that cause discomfort, require technical expertise, and carry risks of invasive procedures. We compared traditional diagnostic methods with a molecular noninvasive filter paper-based method for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Consecutive patients presenting to the Leishmania Clinic at Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia were enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on lesion scrapings, aspirates, and filter paper impressions. The reference standard was any 2 of 5 tests positive: smear, aspirate culture, invasive-specimen PCR (scrapings and aspirates), filter paper PCR, and leishmanin skin test. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity. Leishmania speciation was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of positive specimens. Forty-five patients with 66 lesions were enrolled. Of 52 lesions diagnosed as cutaneous leishmaniasis, 50 were positive by PCR of invasive specimens versus 48 by PCR of filter papers (P=.930). Sensitivity and specificity of PCR on invasively obtained specimens were 94.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.9%-100%) and 92.9% (95% CI, 79.4%-100%). Sensitivity and specificity of filter paper PCR were 92.3% (95% CI, 85.1%-99.5%) and 100%. Culture, smear, and leishmanin skin test all had inferior sensitivities, compared with PCR of invasive or noninvasive specimens (P<.001). Of 50 specimens positive by PCR, 19 had sufficient DNA for PCR-RFLP analysis. Filter paper PCR constitutes a sensitive and specific alternative to traditional diagnostic assays. This novel, rapid, well-tolerated method has the potential for widespread use in the field and in pediatric populations where traditional specimen collection is most difficult to perform, and can potentially be used for rapid species identification.

Vitrification of Rattus norvegicus immature cumulus-oocyte complexes using hyaluronic acid. The aim of this study was to assess in vitro meiosis resumption and nuclear maturation of Rattus norvegicus oocytes after vitrification with different cryoprotective solutions. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were exposed to an equilibration solution for 4 min placed in cryoprotective solutions for 1 min and vitrified in open pulled straws. Cryoprotective solutions were prepared with 15% ethylene glycol + 15% dimethyl sulfoxide + 0.5 M sucrose and different supplements, to form the following groups: G1, 20% fetal bovine serum in modified phosphate-buffered saline (mPBS); G2, 0.4% bovine serum albumine in mPBS; G3, 1% hyaluronic acid in mPBS; and G4, 0.4% polyvinyl alcohol in mPBS. Seven days after vitrification, the COCs from G1 to G4 were warmed and in vitro matured for 30 h along with the control group. Hoechst staining was performed to assess meiosis resumption and nuclear maturation rates. Control group showed higher meiosis resumption (77.88%) and nuclear maturation rates (55.75%) compared to all vitrified groups. Among the vitrified COCs, G3 showed the highest meiosis resumption and nuclear maturation rates (G1, 26.5 and 15.38%; G2, 22.12 and 11.54%; G3, 34.55 and 20%; G4, 20.17 and 9.24%). Supplementation of the vitrification solution with 1% hyaluronic acid provided better results, compared to the other supplements. Hyaluronic acid can be useful to vitrify rat COCs associated with other cryoprotectant agents. 

The role of the hippocampus in prediction and imagination. Traditionally, the hippocampal system has been studied in relation to the goal of retrieving memories about the past. Recent work in humans and rodents suggests that the hippocampal system may be better understood as a system that facilitates predictions about upcoming events. The hippocampus and associated cortical structures are active when people envision future events, and damage that includes the hippocampal region impairs this ability. In rats, hippocampal ensembles preplay and replay event sequences in the absence of overt behavior. If strung together in novel combinations, these sequences could provide the neural building blocks for simulating upcoming events during decision-making, planning, and when imagining novel scenarios. Moreover, in both humans and rodents, the hippocampal system is spontaneously active during task-free epochs and sleep, further suggesting that the system may use idle moments to derive new representations that set the context for future behaviors.

Comparison of real-time PCR methods for measurement of HIV-1 proviral DNA.

In the present study, real-time PCR methods used commonly for HIV-1 proviral DNA evaluation were compared, showing strong differences in the results, probably as a consequence of genome variability in the target regions. Standardization of HIV-1 proviral DNA quantitation assays is needed for use in clinical management of patients with HIV-1.

In vivo imaging of obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. Obesity is associated with low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue, which contributes to the development of obesity-related diseases such as insulin resistance, hypertension and arteriosclerosis. Here we developed an animal model that non-invasively monitors inflammation in adipose tissue using in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) technique. In vitro, stimulation with TNFalpha or co-culture with RAW264 macrophages increased bioluminescence in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing NF-kappaB-mediated luciferase gene (3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P). In vivo, lipopolysaccharide increased bioluminescence in mice transplanted with 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P cells. Moreover, light emission derived from implanted cells was significantly higher in diet-induced obese mice transplanted with 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P than in lean mice. Our results showed that BLI technique and 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P cells provide a useful approach to non-invasively monitor obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue in in vivo.

Interaction of Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) nanoparticles with antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Plant viruses such as Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) are increasingly being developed for applications in nanobiotechnology including vaccine development because of their potential for producing large quantities of antigenic material in plant hosts. In order to improve efficacy of viral nanoparticles in these types of roles, an investigation of the individual cell types that interact with the particles is critical. In particular, it is important to understand the interactions of a potential vaccine with antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the immune system. CPMV was previously shown to interact with vimentin displayed on cell surfaces to mediate cell entry, but the expression of surface vimentin on APCs has not been characterized. The binding and internalization of CPMV by several populations of APCs was investigated both in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The association of the particles with mouse gastrointestinal epithelium and Peyer's patches was also examined by confocal microscopy. The expression of surface vimentin on APCs was also measured. We found that CPMV is bound and internalized by subsets of several populations of APCs both in vitro and in vivo following intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral administration, and also by cells isolated from the Peyer's patch following gastrointestinal delivery. Surface vimentin was also expressed on APC populations that could internalize CPMV. These experiments demonstrate that APCs capture CPMV particles in vivo, and that further tuning the interaction with surface vimentin may facilitate increased uptake by APCs and priming of antibody responses. These studies also indicate that CPMV particles likely access the systemic circulation following oral delivery via the Peyer's patch.

[Epilepsy by bovine (zebu) goring: a case report in Burkina Faso]. The post-traumatic epilepsy is responsible for 20% of the symptomatic epilepsies. Accidents on public highway constitute more than 70% of the causes. We report a singular case of fronto-polar post-traumatic epilepsy by zebu goring which appeared two years after the traumatism. The neurological examination of the patient was normal apart from a inconspicuous expansiveness of humor underlined by an excess of familiarity and hypersyntony. The cerebral scanner revealed a left fronto-basal cortico-under-cortical low density up to the homolateral fronto-polar area. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed some left fronto-polar bursts of spike and wave on a normal bottom line. This clinical observation draws our attention on the fact that in Sahelian tropical environment where bovine breeding holds a major place, the cranio-encephalic traumatism by goring is not rare and can be responsible for epilepsy in the same way as accidents on public highway, or ballistic traumatism.

A Perioperative Course of Gabapentin Does Not Produce a Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Analgesia after Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Studies examining the efficacy of a single preoperative dose of gabapentin for analgesia after cesarean delivery (CD) have been inconclusive. The authors hypothesized that a perioperative course of gabapentin would improve analgesia after CD. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial was designed to determine the analgesic efficacy of a perioperative course of gabapentin when added to a multimodal analgesic regimen. Women scheduled for elective CD during spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a perioperative oral course of either gabapentin (600 mg preoperatively followed by 200 mg every 8 h for 2 days) or placebo. Postoperative pain was measured at 24 and 48 h, at rest and on movement, on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 100 mm). The primary outcome was pain on movement at 24 h. Neonatal outcomes, opiate consumption, VAS satisfaction (0 to 100 mm), adverse effects, and persistent pain were also assessed. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was a statistically significant but small reduction in VAS pain score (mean [95% CI]) on "movement" (40 mm [36 to 45] vs. 47 mm [42 to 51]; difference, -7 mm [-13 to 0]; P = 0.047) at 24 h in the gabapentin (n = 100) compared with control group (n = 97). There was more sedation in the gabapentin group at 24 h (55 vs. 39%, P = 0.026) but greater patient VAS satisfaction (87 vs. 77 mm, P = 0.003). A perioperative course of gabapentin produces a clinically insignificant improvement in analgesia after CD and is associated with a higher incidence of sedation.


Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Composition and Serum High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Levels in Healthy Japanese Residents: The KOBE Study.

Conditioned eyelid movement is not a blink. Based on kinematic properties and distinct substrates, there are different classes of eyelid movement described as eyeblinks. We investigate whether the eyelid movements made in response to a conditioned stimulus (CS) are a category of eyelid movements distinct from blinks. Human subjects received 60 trials of classical eyelid conditioning with a tone as the CS and electrical stimulation of the supraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve as the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Before and after training, reflex blinks were elicited with the UCS. The kinematics of conditioned responses (CRs) differed significantly from those of reflex blinks. The slope of the amplitude-maximum velocity function was steeper for reflex blinks than for CRs, and reflex blink duration was significantly shorter than CR duration. Unlike reflex blinks, for which maximum velocity was independent of blink duration, the maximum velocity of CRs depended on CR duration. These quantitative and qualitative differences indicated that CRs were a unique class of eyelid movements distinct from blinks and eyelid movements with vertical saccadic gaze shifts.

Enhancement of interleukin-1beta-induced iNOS expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of Goto-Kakizaki diabetes rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is altered in vascular smooth muscle cells of type 2 diabetes rats. We used cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) isolated from male Goto-Kakizaki diabetes rats (G-K rats) aged 27-28weeks and age-matched Wistar rats (control rats). iNOS and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were evaluated by immunoblot and/or immunochemical analyses, and NO production was evaluated by measuring NO(X) (NO(2) and NO(3)). Expression of iNOS was not detected in ASMCs of either G-K or control rats under a resting condition. Stimulation with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) induced iNOS expression, which was much greater in ASMCs from G-K rats than in ASMCs from control rats. When ASMCs were stimulated with IL-1beta, the number of iNOS-immunoreactive ASMCs from G-K rats increased more prominently than did the number of such ASMCs from control rats. IL-1beta-induced NO production was also much greater in ASMCs from G-K rats than in those from control rats. Both IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression and NO production in ASMCs of G-K and control rats were markedly reduced in the presence of an ERK inhibitor, U0126 or PD98059. Both basal and IL-1beta-stimulated levels of ERK activity were significantly higher in ASMCs from G-K rats than in ASMCs from control rats. The results suggest that iNOS induction is enhanced in cultured ASMCs from G-K rats and that this enhancement is associated with increased ERK activity.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak in a pediatric intensive care unit linked to a humanitarian organization residential center. Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly colonizes the hospital environment. Between April 2006 and September 2008, we investigated an outbreak of P. aeruginosa infection occurring in a pediatric intensive care unit. We conducted epidemiologic and molecular investigations to identify the source of the outbreak. Retrospective case finding; surveillance cultures of patients and environmental sites; admission screening; case-control study; and molecular typing. Infants and children in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care institution. Thirty-seven cases of P. aeruginosa infection or colonization were detected between April 2006 and September 2008, including 3 fatal bloodstream infections. A closely-related strain was detected in 4 residents of a humanitarian nongovernmental organization (NGO) center who developed an infection, from 4 additional residents upon their hospital admission, and from a sink drain at the NGO residential center. NGO recipients represented 65% (24/37) of the total number of cases of P. aeruginosa colonization or infection during the outbreak period. Investigation at the residential center showed widespread contamination of the sewage system (10/14 sinks and shower drains, 70%) and a high prevalence (38%) of P. aeruginosa carriage among children. These findings suggest that the probable cause of the outbreak was the contamination of the NGO residential center with further nosocomial transmission after admission, and highlight the importance of considering external sources when investigating hospital outbreaks.

The new UK-WHO growth charts: are you using them for children from birth to four years? New UK-WHO child growth charts for newborn babies up to four years of age have been developed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health for use in the United Kingdom. Based on the World Health Organization's growth charts derived from data from breast-fed infants, the new charts replace existing charts used in the UK that reflected growth patterns of formula-fed infants. The UK-WHO child growth charts were launched in the UK in May 2009 and will be included in the Personal Child Health Record given to new parents in the UK as the main record of their child's growth and development. This article discusses difficulties surrounding the launch, the main differences between the UK-WHO charts and their predecessors, and the training needed for health professionals working with the new charts.

Apoptotic pathways in degenerative disk lesions in the wrist. Degenerative articular disk perforations of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) of the wrist could result from chronic loading of the ulnocarpal joint. Apoptosis played a crucial role in fibrocartilage cell loss, and the purpose of this study was to clarify which apoptotic pathway was involved in the development of degenerative disk lesions. We also investigated whether ulna length played an etiologic role in the occurrence of fibrocartilage cell loss. Included in the study were 17 patients with degenerative articular disk tears of the TFC (Palmer type 2C). After arthroscopic debridement of the TFC, histologic sections were examined to assess the presence of apoptosis. Apoptosis was determined by use of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Fas ligand and BID (BH3 interacting domain death) agonist were applied for immunohistochemical analysis. Cells positive for caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, Fas ligand, and BID were found in all specimens. The number of cells positive for caspase 3 and BID was significantly increased in specimens from patients with an ulna-positive variance. In contrast, for cells positive for caspase 8, caspase 9, and Fas ligand, no significant difference was found between specimens from patients with an ulna-positive variance and those from patients with an ulna-neutral/ulna-negative variance. The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in the development of degenerative disk lesions. Fibrocartilage cell loss occurs mainly through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The accumulation of apoptotic cells is not significantly different between the 3 zones of the TFC. It could be verified that ulna length is correlated with fibrocartilage cell loss. Ulnar shortening is a valuable treatment option for degenerative TFC lesions. Knowledge of the specific apoptotic pathway that is causing degenerative disk lesions is critical in selecting the appropriate and most beneficial therapeutic treatment to halt further cell loss and the degeneration of the TFC.

Electrocatalytic activity of salicylic acid on the platinum nanoparticles modified electrode by electrochemical deposition. Platinum nanoparticles (PNP) were deposited on the Pt disk electrode by electrochemical deposition, it was found that salicylic acid (SA) had good electrocatalytic oxidation response at the prepared Pt nanoparticles modified Pt disk electrode (PNP/Pt). Then the modified electrode was used to detect SA in weak alkali condition, it was found that the response current was 9.2 times that of bare Pt disk electrode, and the linear range of detection was 2.0x10(-5) to 5.0x10(-4)M. After that, the electrode was adopted to detect the SA in Zuguangsan, one kind of Chinese medicine, the results showed that the PNP/Pt electrode has low detection limit, high repeatability and stability as SA sensor, could be applied in the detection of SA reliably.

Apolipoprotein E4 and sex affect neurobehavioral performance in primary school children. Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) and female sex are risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear whether apoE4 contributes to behavioral function at younger ages. Standard neuropsychological assessments [intelligence quotient (IQ), attention, and executive function] and a test developed in this laboratory (Memory Island test of spatial learning and memory) were used to determine whether E4 and sex affect neuropsychological performance in healthy primary school children (age 7-10). A medical history was also obtained from the mother to determine whether negative birth outcomes were associated with apoE4. Mothers of apoE4+ children were more likely to report that their newborn was placed in an intensive care unit. A sex difference in birth weight was noted among apoE4- (males > females), but not apoE4+, offspring. Conversely, among apoE4+, but not apoE4- children, there was a sex difference in the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) vocabulary score favoring boys. ApoE4- girls had better visual recall than apoE4+ girls or apoE4- boys on the Family Pictures test. Finally, apoE4+, unlike apoE4-, children did not show spatial memory retention during the Memory Island probe trial. Thus, apoE4 may affect neurobehavioral performance, particularly spatial memory, and antenatal health decades before any clinical expression of neurodegenerative processes.

[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: evolution of a tumor concept from unclassifiable neoplasms to targeted molecular therapy]. The discovery of activating oncogenic C-KIT and PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) represented the key for the development of innovative targeted molecular therapy using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) Imatinib (Glivec(R)), Sunitinib and other substances. This makes a precise histopathological diagnosis a major prerequisite, supplemented by appropriate risk stratification for the assessment of the expected biological behavior of individual tumors. Current knowledge demonstrates that the presence of kinase mutations in C-KIT and PDGFRA and their localization within the gene sequence as well as the mutation type are of great importance for planning appropriate treatment (drug selection and dose recommendation), but also for the assessment of prognosis and explanation of secondary resistance to TKI after initial response. This article gives an overview on current developments in the histopathological and molecular diagnostics of GIST and the role of kinase mutation analysis for optimizing patient treatment.

Swiss results from a global observational study of venous thromboembolism risk and prophylaxis use in the acute care hospital setting: analysis from the ENDORSE study. The aim of the present analysis from the epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the acute hospital care setting (ENDORSE) study was to evaluate the prevalence of VTE risk in acute care hospitals and the proportion of at-risk medical and surgical patients who receive recommended prophylaxis in Switzerland. All patients (age >or=40 years) admitted to a medical ward or those (age >or=18 years) admitted to a surgical ward in ten randomly selected Swiss hospitals were assessed for risk of VTE. The 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based consensus guidelines were used to assess VTE risk and to determine whether patients were receiving recommended thromboprophylaxis. 2000 patients were eligible; of these 1153 (58%) were in surgical wards, and 847 (42%) in medical wards. According to the ACCP criteria, the proportion of surgical patients at VTE risk was similar in Switzerland (68%, between hospital range 48-86%) in comparison to the global ENDORSE study (64%) (p = 0.296). The rate of at-risk medical patients was lower in Switzerland (21%, range 3-44%) than in the global study (42%) (p <0.001). The proportion of at-risk surgical patients with ACCP-recommended VTE prophylaxis was higher in Switzerland (81%, between-hospital range 76-93%) than in the global study (59%) (p <0.001). Among medical patients at risk, the use of recommended thromboprophylaxis was higher in Switzerland (61%, between-hospital range 0-84%) than in the global ENDORSE (40%) (p <0.001). However 56% of the patients with cancer, 41% with major trauma, and 29% undergoing vascular surgery did not receive any recommended prophylaxis. Among surgical patients at risk, the use of ACCP-recommended prophylaxis was lower in academic (77%) vs. non-academic (86%) institutions (p = 0.0025). In Switzerland, although the rate of recommended thromboprophylaxis is higher than in many countries, it is still improvable in medical patients at risk according to the ACCP guidelines. Consequently, hospital wide strategies for systematic risk factor assessment and implementation of practical tools to ensure appropriate use of prophylaxis in patients at VTE risk are required.


Two cases of severe de novo colitis in kidney transplant recipients after conversion to prolonged-release tacrolimus.

Cross, but not direct, presentation of cell-associated virus antigens by spleen macrophages is influenced by their differentiation state. The initiation of T-cell immune responses requires professional antigen-presenting cells. Emerging data point towards an important role for macrophages (Mphi) in the priming of naïve T cells. In this study we analyzed the efficiency and the mechanisms by which Mphi derived from spleen (Sp-Mphi) or bone marrow (BM-Mphi) present Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) antigens to epitope-specific T cells. We demonstrate that because of phagosomal maturation, Sp-Mphi downregulate their ability to cross-present cell-associated, but not soluble, antigens, as they are further differentiated in culture without altering their capacity to directly present virus antigens after infection. We propose that Sp-Mphi are extremely efficient at direct and cross-presentation. However, if these cells undergo further M-CSF-dependent maturation, they will adapt to be more scavenger and phagocytic and concurrently reduce their cross-presenting capacity. Accordingly, Sp-Mphi can have an important role in regulating T-cell responses through cross-presentation depending on their differentiation state.

Abscess of adrenal gland caused by disseminated subacute Nocardia farcinica pneumonia. A case report and mini-review of the literature. Infections caused by Nocardia farcinica are uncommon and show a great variety of clinical manifestations in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Because of its unspecific symptoms and tendency to disseminate it may mimic the clinical symptoms and radiologic findings of a tumour disease and the diagnosis of nocardiosis can easily be missed, because there are no characteristic symptoms. We present a case of an adrenal gland abscess caused by subacute disseminated N. farcinica pneumonia. An infection with N. farcinica is potentially lethal because of its tendency to disseminate -particularly in the brain- and its high resistance to antibiotics. Awareness of this differential diagnosis allows early and appropriate treatment to be administered.

Clostridium difficile ribotypes 001, 017, and 027 are associated with lethal C. difficile infection in Hesse, Germany. From January 2008 to April 2009, 72 cases of severe Clostridium difficile infection were reported from 18 different districts in the state of Hesse, Germany. A total of 41 C. difficile isolates from 41 patients were subjected to PCR ribotyping. PCR ribotype (RT) 027 was the most prevalent strain accounting for 24 of 41 (59%) of typed isolates, followed by RT 001 (eight isolates, 20%), RT 017 and 042 (two isolates each), and RT 003, 066, 078, 081, and RKI-034 (one isolate each). Eighteen patients had died within 30 days after admission. C. difficile was reported as underlying cause of or contributing to death in 14 patients, indicating a case fatality rate of 19%. The patients with lethal outcome attributable to C. difficile were 59-89 years-old (median 78 years). Ribotyping results were available for seven isolates associated with lethal outcome, which were identified as RT 027 in three and as RT 001 and 017 in two cases each. Our data suggest that C. difficile RT 027 is prevalent in some hospitals in Hesse and that, in addition to the possibly more virulent RT 027, other toxigenic C. difficile strains like RT 001 and 017 are associated with lethal C. difficile infections in this region.


Evidence of gray matter reduction and dysfunction in chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

The Soft Triangle: An Often Neglected Area in Rhinoplasty. This study aims to focus on one of the lesser mentioned topics in discussions of aesthetic nose operations, the soft triangle. In addition to outlining the characteristics of the area, the various complications specific to the soft triangle are discussed along with methods and techniques utilized by the authors to avoid such complications. One hundred twenty-seven of 841 (15 %) patients who were assessed both preoperatively and intraoperatively for the presence of an anatomical issue of the soft triangle were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups according to their anatomical features that were identified intraoperatively. The preoperative and postoperative photographs of all patients were compared to assess the effects of the respective soft triangle grafts on both nostril length and the nostril/lobule harmony. The average follow-up time of the patients was 27 months (6-60). Postoperative notching (of various degrees) was found in six (6/127) total patients: one (1/31) patient in the first group, two (2/24) patients in the second group, and three (3/72) patients in the third group. Neglecting the soft triangle area might yield grim results in terms of cosmetic and functional aspects. To avoid these problems, incisions should be planned purposefully, and patients who have anatomically weak support should be identified so that additional precautions should be taken for these cases. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Promotive effects of resistant maltodextrin on apparent  absorption of calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc in rats. It has been reported that low-viscous and fermentable dietary fiber and nondigestible oligosaccharides enhance mineral absorption. Resistant maltodextrin, nonviscous, fermentable and soluble source of dietary fiber, has several physiological functions. However, influence of resistant maltodextrin on mineral absorption is unclear. We conducted balance studies in rats to investigate effects of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin on apparent mineral absorption. In experiment 1 (Exp. 1), 40 rats were fed test diets based on AIN-93G with or without resistant maltodextrin or hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin for 2 weeks. In experiment 2 (Exp. 2), 32 rats were cecectomized (CX) or sham-operated (Sham) and fed diets with or without hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin for 1 week. In Exp. 1, ingestion of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin dose-dependently enhanced apparent absorption rates of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn, and increased cecal fermentation with cecal expansion. In Exp. 2, the absorption rates of Ca and Mg were significantly enhanced by ingestion of hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin in Sham group but not in CX group. The promotion of Fe and Zn absorption was not affected by cecectomy. Ingestion of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin increased apparent Ca and Mg absorptions dependent on cecal fermentation, while other mechanisms may also be involved in promotion of apparent Fe and Zn absorption by resistant maltodextrin.

Convergent One-Pot Oxidative [n + 1] Approaches to Spiroacetal Synthesis. Two one-pot oxidative annulative approaches to spiroacetal synthesis are described. One approach uses a Lewis acid mediated Ferrier reaction in the fragment-coupling stage followed by DDQ-promoted oxidative carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and cyclization. An alternative approach employs a Heck reaction for fragment coupling followed by DDQ-mediated enone formation and cyclization. These strategies provide convergent routes to common subunits in natural products, medicinal agents, and chemical libraries under mild reaction conditions.

Characterization of the surface deposition on anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium after immersion in simulated body fluid. The interface phenomena between anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium (SA-treated c.p.Ti) endosseous implants and biological tissue are important in osseous wound healing. Therefore purpose of this study was to characterize the morphological, structural and chemical features of SA-treated c.p.Ti surfaces after immersion in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Anodic oxide (AO) c.p.Ti and SA-treated c.p.Ti disks were immersed for 14 and 28 days in HBSS (37 degrees C, pH 7.4). These samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalyzer, and ion chromatography. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns were similar in each sample before and after HBSS immersion. Scanning electron microscopy performed after 28 days immersion in HBSS revealed deposits completely covering SA-treated c.p.Ti. However, deposits were not observed on AO c.p.Ti after 14 or 28 days immersion. Electron probe microanalyzer results revealed an even distribution of calcium and phosphorus on SA-treated c.p.Ti after 28 days immersion, however there was no change in AO c.p.Ti disks during all immersion periods. Ion chromatography showed increased levels of calcium and phosphorus on SA-treated c.p.Ti disks compared to AO c.p.Ti disks, after 28 days immersion. The results indicate that the deposits formed on SA-treated c.p.Ti surfaces contained calcium phosphate. These deposits may be formed as a consequence of the topography and physicochemical properties of SA-treated c.p.Ti surfaces and may play a key role in osteoconduction during osseous wound healing.

Race moderates the relationship between obesity and colorectal cancer screening in women. To determine if the relationship between obesity and usage of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in women varies when stratifying by race. Using nationally representative data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey, we examined the relationship between obesity and CRC screening for white and African-American women aged 50 and older. Screening usage variables indicated if a woman was up-to-date for any CRC screening test, colonoscopy, or FOBT. We used multivariable logistic regression models that included interaction terms to determine if race moderates the obesity-screening relationship. We also calculated adjusted up-to-date colonoscopy rates using direct standardization to model covariates. The relationship between obesity and screening differed by race for any CRC screening test (P = 0.04 for interaction) and for colonoscopy (P = 0.01 for interaction), but not for FOBT. Obese white women had a lower adjusted colonoscopy rate (30.2%, 95% CI 25.9-34.8) than non-obese white women (39.1%, 95% CI 36.1-42.2). Obese African-American women, on the other hand, had a higher adjusted colonoscopy rate (41.2%, 95% CI 31.6-51.4) than their non-obese counterparts (35.6%, 95% CI 28.3-43.6). Overall, adjusted colonoscopy rates were lowest among obese white women. Obesity is associated with lower CRC screening rates in white, but not African-American women.

Differential behaviour of Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 LipC, a lipase showing greater versatility than its counterpart LipA. Growth of Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 on oleic acid releases polymerized hydroxy-fatty acids as a result of several enzymatic conversions that could involve one or more lipases. To test this hypothesis, the lipolytic system of strain Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 was analyzed, revealing the presence of at least an intracellular carboxylesterase and a secreted lipase. Consensus primers derived from a conserved region of bacterial lipase subfamilies I.1 and I.2 allowed isolation of two secreted lipase genes, lipA and lipC, highly homologous to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Homologous cloning of the isolated lipA and lipC genes was performed in Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 for LipA and LipC over-expression. The overproduced lipases were further purified and characterized, both showing preference for medium fatty acid chain-length substrates. However, significant differences could be detected between LipA and LipC in terms of enzyme kinetics and behaviour pattern. Accordingly, LipA showed maximum activity at moderate temperatures, and displayed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. On the contrary, LipC was more active at low temperatures and displayed partial interfacial activation, showing a shift in substrate specificity when assayed at different temperatures, and displaying increased activity in the presence of certain heavy metal ions. The versatile properties shown by LipC suggest that this lipase could be expressed in response to variable environmental conditions.

Luminescence and advanced mass spectroscopic characterization of sodium zinc orthophosphate phosphor for low-cost light-emitting diodes. A new rare-earth-free NaZnPO4:Mn(2+) (NZP:Mn) phosphor powder has been developed by our group and investigated meticulously for the first time using secondary ion mass spectroscopy and chemical imaging techniques. The studies confirmed the effective incorporation of Mn(2+) into the host lattice, resulting in an enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. Phase purity has been verified and structure parameters have been determined successfully by Rietveld refinement studies. The NZP:Mn phosphor powder exhibits strong absorption bands in the ultraviolet and visible (300-470 nm) regions with a significant broad yellow-green (~543 nm) emission due to the characteristic spin forbidden d-d transition ((4)T1→(6)A1) of Mn(2+) ions, indicating weak crystal field strength at the zinc-replaced manganese site. The decay constants are a few milliseconds, which is a pre-requisite for applications in many display devices. The results obtained suggest that this new phosphor powder will find many interesting applications in semiconductor physics, as cost-effective light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as solar cells and in photo-physics.

Tissue preparation for histochemistry: fixation, embedding, and antigen retrieval for light microscopy. A number of techniques have been developed to use chemical, immunological, and molecular biology assays in histological material. Collectively termed histochemistry, these techniques have allowed us to better understand tissue and organ biology in situ. Success with each of these methods is dependent on the adequate preparation of material. In this article, we describe the basic steps required to prepare tissue for routine histochemical analysis.Histochemical techniques routinely use frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue as a basis for cellular and morphological analysis. Freezing tissue results in less alteration to epitopes and therefore may offer improved staining characteristics compared to techniques based on paraffin embedding. As in conventional histology, the use of fixation and embedding in more rigid media such as wax offers a number of potential advantages related to improved structural detail. Improvements in morphology may however be offset by a loss of antigens. The careful application of antigen retrieval techniques may overcome these deficiencies.

Prevalence and clinical correlates of pruritus in patients with systemic sclerosis. There are no studies of pruritus prevalence or clinical correlates in systemic sclerosis (SSc). The objectives of this study were to document the proportion of SSc patients with pruritus on most days, to determine when in the course of the disease pruritus is most prevalent, and to identify clinical correlates. We performed a cross-sectional, multicenter study of 400 SSc patients from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group Registry > or =1 year after Registry enrollment. Patients indicated whether they experienced pruritus during the past month on most days and underwent clinical histories and medical examinations. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between sociodemographic and clinical variables and pruritus. A total of 179 patients (45%) reported pruritus on most days, including 69% (11 of 16) among patients 1.0-1.9 years from onset of non-Raynaud's symptoms, 41% (38 of 93) for 2.0-4.9 years, 47% (44 of 94) for 5.0-9.9 years, 43% (60 of 140) for 10.0-19.9 years, and 46% (26 of 57) for > or =20 years. In post hoc analysis, patients 1.0-1.9 years from disease onset were significantly more likely to report pruritus (P = 0.049). Patients with pruritus had significantly more skin involvement (P = 0.029), more gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (P < 0.001), worse breathing problems (P = 0.001), worse Raynaud's symptoms (P = 0.002), and more severe finger ulcers (P = 0.009). Only the number of GI symptoms predicted pruritus in multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.37; P < 0.001). Pruritus is common in SSc and is independently associated with GI symptoms. Focused research on sources of pruritus and its management in SSc is needed.

[The evolutionary role of nitric oxide in circadian activity and defense of the organism from cosmic rays]. The cosmic rays are one of the constantly acting factors influencing on genetic apparatus and depending from sun activity, which have the circadian rhythm. The nature creates a number of mechanisms, which defend the organism from cosmic rays and free radicals as consequence. However, the malfunctions of these mechanisms damage the genetic apparatus, accelerate the aging and bring to a number of illnesses. It is supposed that to neutralise the free radicals as cosmic rays consequence the organism uses its own free radicals, which have the physiological functions, for example, the nitric oxide. To limit the nitric oxide production, the mechanism of melatonin formation is used, which has a circadian rhythm.

Structure and hydration of membranes embedded with voltage-sensing domains. Despite the growing number of atomic-resolution membrane protein structures, direct structural information about proteins in their native membrane environment is scarce. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of the highly charged S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains responsible for nerve impulses, where interactions with the lipid bilayer are critical for the function of voltage-activated ion channels. Here we use neutron diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and hydration of bilayer membranes containing S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Our results show that voltage sensors adopt transmembrane orientations and cause a modest reshaping of the surrounding lipid bilayer, and that water molecules intimately interact with the protein within the membrane. These structural findings indicate that voltage sensors have evolved to interact with the lipid membrane while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum, and that water penetrates the membrane, to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric field.

Serum heme-albumin: an allosteric protein. Heme scavenging by plasma proteins, including serum albumin (SA), provides protection against free-heme oxidative damage, limits access by pathogens to the heme, and contributes to iron homeostasis by recycling the heme iron. In turn, serum heme-albumin (SA-heme) acquires heme-based ligand-binding and (pseudo-)enzymatic properties. Heme binding to SA and SA-heme reactivity are allosterically and competitively modulated by endogenous and exogenous third components, this being relevant in pharmacotherapy management.


The role of 15-LOX-1 in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

Gastric bleeding from a penetrating pancreatic pseudocyst with pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery. The successful management of gastric bleeding from a pseudocyst with a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery is reported here. A 62-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital with a complaint of hematomesis. On a computed tomography and an abdominal angiography, it was evident that he was actively bleeding from a splenic pseudoaneurysm caused by a pancreatic pseudocyst. A transcathetheral arterial embolization (TAE) was performed on the splenic pseudoaneurysm to control bleeding. After the TAE, we resected the pancreatic pseudocyst by distal pancreatectomy with partial gastrectomy. Gastrointestinal bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm caused by a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare, but sometimes lethal, complication. As only conservative therapy or TAE often results in lethal re-bleeding, we propose to perform elective surgery after TAE.

Effects of ergosterol on the structure and activity of Neurospora mitochondrial porin in liposomes. Mitochondrial porins (also known as voltage-dependent anion-selective channels (VDACs)) regulate and contribute to cellular metabolism. These proteins copurify with sterols, and some purified forms of the protein require sterol for insertion into planar artificial membranes. Recently, interactions between detergent-solubilized mitochondrial porins and sterols have been detected by NMR and spectroscopic methods, but the effects of sterols on pore function remained to be assessed. Therefore, in this work, a freeze-thaw technique was used to introduce recombinant Neurospora porin into liposomes containing, or lacking, the native fungal sterol ergosterol. In both types of liposomes, insertion of the protein converts it to a protease-resistant state and low levels of dimeric and trimeric forms are observed. There are only minor differences between the secondary structural components of the protein in the presence or absence of sterol. Ergosterol in proteoliposomes alters their osmotic responses to sucrose, possibly due to increased membrane rigidity or interactions with the protein that were not revealed by the methods used in this study. The presence of ergosterol is associated with an increased change in conformation and loss of function of liposome-embedded porin at high temperature. Taken with other evidence for direct interactions of sterols with porins, these results support a link between these two molecules in mitochondrial membrane activity.

Advanced sialoendoscopy techniques, rare findings, and complications. This article presents and discusses advanced minimally invasive sialoendoscopy and combined methods: endoscopy, endoscopic-assisted techniques, and external-lithotripsy combined procedures. It also presents rare situations and complications encountered during sialoendoscopic procedures. Sialoendoscopy is a relatively novel technique, which adds significant new dimensions to the surgeon's armamentarium for management of inflammatory salivary gland diseases. Because of the rapid development in minimally invasive surgical techniques, surgeons are capable of more facilely treating complicated inflammatory and obstructive conditions of the salivary glands.

Two different forms of arousal in Drosophila are oppositely regulated by the dopamine D1 receptor ortholog DopR via distinct neural circuits. Arousal is fundamental to many behaviors, but whether it is unitary or whether there are different types of behavior-specific arousal has not been clear. In Drosophila, dopamine promotes sleep-wake arousal. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding its influence on environmentally stimulated arousal. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in the D1 dopamine receptor DopR enhance repetitive startle-induced arousal while decreasing sleep-wake arousal (i.e., increasing sleep). These two types of arousal are also inversely influenced by cocaine, whose effects in each case are opposite to, and abrogated by, the DopR mutation. Selective restoration of DopR function in the central complex rescues the enhanced stimulated arousal but not the increased sleep phenotype of DopR mutants. These data provide evidence for at least two different forms of arousal, which are independently regulated by dopamine in opposite directions, via distinct neural circuits.

Heterogeneous kinetics of the reduction of chromium (VI) by elemental iron. Zero valent iron (ZVI) has been extensively used as a reactive medium for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in reactive permeable barriers. The kinetic rate depends strongly on the superficial oxidation of the iron particles used and the preliminary washing of ZVI increases the rate. The reaction has been primarily modelled using a pseudo-first-order kinetics which is inappropriate for a heterogeneous reaction. We assumed a shrinking particle type model where the kinetic rate is proportional to the available iron surface area, to the initial volume of solution and to the chromium concentration raised to a power alpha which is the order of the chemical reaction occurring at surface. We assumed alpha=2/3 based on the likeness to the shrinking particle models with spherical symmetry. Kinetics studies were performed in order to evaluate the suitability of this approach. The influence of the following parameters was experimentally studied: initial available surface area, chromium concentration, temperature and pH. The assumed order for the reaction was confirmed. In addition, the rate constant was calculated from data obtained in different operating conditions. Digital pictures of iron balls were periodically taken and the image treatment allowed for establishing the time evolution of their size distribution.


State of homeobox A10 expression as a putative prognostic marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Over-indebtedness and its association with the prevalence of back pain. Over-indebtedness is an increasing phenomenon worldwide. Massive financial strain, as found in over-indebted persons, might influence the occurrence of back pain. In this explorative study we examined the prevalence of back pain in over-indebted persons in Germany for the first time ever and compared it to the prevalence of back pain in the German general population. A cross sectional study comprising 949 participants (52.6% women) was conducted to collect data on the point prevalence of back pain in an over-indebted collective. A representative sample of the German general population (N = 8318, 53.4% women) was used as non-indebted reference group. The point prevalence of back pain was 80% in the over-indebted collective, compared to 20% in the general population. The influence of socioeconomic factors on the prevalence of back pain differed partially between the general population and the over-indebted collective. Being over-indebted was identified as an independent effect modifier and was associated with an eleven times increased probability to suffer from back pain (aOR: 10.92, 95%CI: 8.96 - 13.46). Until now, only little is known about the effects of intense financial strain like over-indebtedness on health. Our study suggests that over-indebted persons represent a risk group for back pain and that it might be sensible to take financial strain into account when taking a medical history on back pain. Over-indebtedness and private bankruptcy is of increasing importance in industrialized countries, therefore more research on the subject seems to be necessary.

I-NET: interactive neuro-educational technology to accelerate skill learning. The learning of a novel task currently rely heavily on conventional classroom instruction with qualitative assessment and observation. Introduction of individualized tutorials with integrated neuroscience-based evaluation techniques could significantly accelerate skill acquisition and provide quantitative evidence of successful training. We have created a suite of adaptive and interactive neuro-educational technologies (I-NET) to increase the pace and efficiency of skill learning. It covers four major themes: 1) Integration of brain monitoring into paced instructional tutorials, 2) Identifying psychophysiological characteristics of expertise using a model population, 3) Developing sensor-based feedback to accelerate novice-to-expert transition, 4) Identifying neurocognitive factors that are predictive of skill acquisition to allow early triage and interventions. We selected rifle marksmanship training as the field of application. Rifle marksmanship is a core skill for the Army and Marine Corps and it involves a combination of classroom instructional learning and field practice involving instantiation of a well-defined set of sensory, motor and cognitive skills. The instrumentation that incorporates the I-NET technologies is called the Adaptive Peak Performance Trainer (APPT). Preliminary analysis of pilot study data for performance data from a novice population that used this device revealed an improved learning trajectory.

The properties of adaptive walks in evolving populations of fungus. The rarity of beneficial mutations has frustrated efforts to develop a quantitative theory of adaptation. Recent models of adaptive walks, the sequential substitution of beneficial mutations by selection, make two compelling predictions: adaptive walks should be short, and fitness increases should become exponentially smaller as successive mutations fix. We estimated the number and fitness effects of beneficial mutations in each of 118 replicate lineages of Aspergillus nidulans evolving for approximately 800 generations at two population sizes using a novel maximum likelihood framework, the results of which were confirmed experimentally using sexual crosses. We find that adaptive walks do indeed tend to be short, and fitness increases become smaller as successive mutations fix. Moreover, we show that these patterns are associated with a decreasing supply of beneficial mutations as the population adapts. We also provide empirical distributions of fitness effects among mutations fixed at each step. Our results provide a first glimpse into the properties of multiple steps in an adaptive walk in asexual populations and lend empirical support to models of adaptation involving selection towards a single optimum phenotype. In practical terms, our results suggest that the bulk of adaptation is likely to be accomplished within the first few steps.

Does attrition during follow-up bias outcome data in studies of eating disorders? Attrition is a pervasive problem in eating disorders research. This study examined whether those who do and do not respond to follow-up assessments differ before or during treatment. Participants (N=268) receiving residential eating disorders treatment were categorized according to those who did ("responders," n=152) and did not ("non-responders," n=116) complete a one-month follow-up assessment. Among participants diagnosed with bulimia nervosa (n=136), responders exhibited significantly higher scores than non-responders at intake on restraint, weight concern, eating concerns, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and depressive symptoms, and had significantly less improvement in eating concerns during treatment. Among participants with anorexia nervosa (n=132), there were no significant differences between responders and non-responders at intake or in treatment improvement. Research on bulimia nervosa treatment based on responders to follow-up assessments may underestimate the amount of improvement that patients experience.


A Nordic multi-center study on physical and daily activities for residents in nursing home settings: design of a randomized, controlled trial.

Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus after resection of intra-articular nodular fasciitis of the elbow. Nodular fasciitis most often occurs within subcutaneous tissues, but may also arise within skeletal muscle, dermis, vessels, peripheral nerves and, although rarely, within joints. Knowledge regarding the cause of aneurysmal bone cysts, its natural history, and the results of treatment is limited. Secondary aneurysmal bone cysts are associated with other neoplastic processes. Intra-articular nodular fasciitis in the elbow joint has not been reported previously, nor has the development of aneurysmal bone cyst secondary to intra-articular nodular fasciitis in the elbow joint. We report an unusual case of a Japanese 13-year-old boy who presented with a 1-year history of right elbow pain. The onset of pain was insidious, without antecedent trauma. On physical examination, the range of motion of the elbow was limited. Grip strength was reduced in the affected extremity. Incisional biopsy was performed and histologic findings revealed nodular fasciitis in the elbow joint. After tumor excision, a secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus developed. Endoscopy-assisted curettage and artificial bone grafting were performed. One year after surgery, a plain radiography showed no recurrence, and the patient returned to his daily activities without any symptoms. An aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus developed after excision of intra-articular nodular fasciitis arising in the elbow. The secondary aneurysmal bone cyst successfully healed after endoscopy-assisted curettage and artificial bone grafting. The findings of this case suggest that these two tumors reside in the same biologic spectrum defined as USP6-induced tumors.

FAK interaction with MBD2: A link from cell adhesion to nuclear chromatin remodeling? Cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation are tightly linked and coordinated cellular processes. Cell adhesion dependent gene expression is believed to contribute to such coordination. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its related protein, PYK2 (proline rich tyrosine kinase 2), are a major family of cell adhesion activated tyrosine kinases that play important roles in these cellular processes. Whereas FAK or PYK2 is known to be a scaffold protein, recruiting many cytoplasmic proteins into the focal adhesion complex and regulating focal adhesion turnover and cell migration, how FAK or PYK2 links to the nuclei and regulates gene expression remain largely unclear. We recently report a new signaling of FAK in regulating heterochromatin remodeling by its interaction with MBD2 (Methyl CpG binding domain protein 2), which may underlie FAK regulation of myogenin expression and muscle differentiation. Two insights have been obtained through the analysis of FAK-MBD2 interaction. The interaction appears to be sufficient, but not necessary, for FAK translocation into or maintaining in the nucleus. The nuclear FAK-MBD2 complexes cause altered heterochromatin organization and decreased MBD2 association with HDAC1 (histone deacetylase complex 1) and methyl CpG site in the myogenin promoter, thus, inducing myogenin expression. These results demonstrate a new mechanism underlying FAK regulation of gene expression, and suggest a potential link between cell adhesion and cell differentiation.

RETINAL LESION EVOLUTION IN SUSAC SYNDROME. To describe retinal lesion development in Susac syndrome during acute, postacute, and late phases of the disease. Cross-sectional study of four patients with Susac syndrome and longitudinal short-interval case study of one additional patient. Retinal changes were analyzed with high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography and retinal fluorescein angiography. Retinal Susac syndrome lesions comprise four different lesion sections, which can be distinguished in acute and postacute phases of the disease: a primary section at the site of branch retinal artery occlusion, which spans more layers than supplied by the affected vessel; hypoxic sections from superficial and deep capillary networks; and an axonal damage section with degenerating axons from perished ganglion cells in the main and hypoxic sections. In the later stages, main and hypoxic lesion sections can no longer be distinguished, and both show degeneration from outer plexiform to retinal nerve fiber layers. The dynamics of lesion development and morphologically distinct lesion sections suggest more complex mechanisms of lesion evolution beyond an isolated endothelial immune reaction and subsequent hypoxic tissue damage. The characteristic lesion morphology assists in differentiating the diagnosis of acute visual loss in neuroinflammatory disease. Specificity of the identified changes has to be determined in future studies also including patients with other retinal vascular diseases.

Jack Bowman: Winnipeg's contributions to the treatment and prevention of Rhesus hemolytic disease of the newborn. Jack Bowman (1925-2005) was a Canadian pediatrician who was on the staff of the Winnipeg Children's Hospital. He was trained by Bruce Chown who had started the Rhesus (Rh) hemolytic disease of the Newborn program and in due course succeeded Chown as director of the program. Jack began as one of the three pediatricians (including his twin Bill) who performed exchange transfusions on the affected infants. In due course with his colleague in obstetrics, he was the first in North America to perform intrauterine transfusions for the babies at risk of stillbirth. He was a leader in the prevention of Rh disease by the administration of anti-Rh immunoglobulin to the Rh-negative mothers and established that this could be done safely and effectively during pregnancy. He introduced to North America the column fractionation method of preparing the immunoglobulin that produced a higher yield of a purer product that could be given intravenously. Jack Bowman successfully combined research with clinical practice throughout his career.

Animals to heal animals: ethnoveterinary practices in semiarid region, northeastern Brazil. Animal-based remedies constitute an integral part of Traditional Medicine and this is true in Brazil as well both in rural and urban areas of the country. Due to its long history, zootherapy has in fact become an integral part of folk medicine in the country. The use of these natural resources for medical purposes, however, is not restricted to human diseases treatment, being also widely used for the treatment of animal illnesses. Ethnoveterinary is a science that involves the popular practical knowledge used to treat and prevent animal diseases. This study documents ethnoveterinary practices in one local semi-arid region in Northeast Brazil and discusses the findings in the surveyed area. Information was obtained through the use of semi-structured questionnaires. A total of 20 respondents (09 men and 11 women) provided information on animal species and body parts used as medicine, information concerning the illnesses to which the remedies were prescribed were also obtained. Eleven animal species were used in the treatment of 11 diseases in the surveyed area. The species inventoried comprise 3 taxonomic categories: mammals (05), reptiles (04) and birds (02). The obtained results proves that the use of animals or their derived products as therapeutic resources to the treatment of animal diseases represent a common practice and is culturally important in the studied area. It is evident that the popular knowledge about the ethnoveterinary practices is, frequently, passed through generations. We also noticed that, besides the cultural aspects, the socio-economic context permeates the use of zootherapics, since these practices constitute an alternative to the medicines acquired in veterinarian pharmacies, which have a high cost.

The ubiquitin-like protein FAT10 mediates NF-kappaB activation. NF-kappaB is a central mediator of innate immunity and contributes to the pathogenesis of several renal diseases. FAT10 is a TNF-alpha-inducible ubiquitin-like protein with a putative role in immune response, but whether FAT10 participates in TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation is unknown. Here, using renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) derived from FAT10(-/-) and FAT10(+/+) mice, we observed that FAT10 deficiency abrogated TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and reduced the induction of NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Despite normal IkBalpha degradation and polyubiquitination, FAT10 deficiency impaired TNF-alpha-induced IkBalpha degradation and nuclear translocation of p65 in RTECs, suggesting defective proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated IkBalpha. In addition, FAT10 deficiency reduced the expression of the proteasomal subunit low molecular mass polypeptide 2 (LMP2). Transduction of FAT10(-/-) RTECs with FAT10 restored LMP2 expression, TNF-alpha-induced IkBalpha degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, LMP2 transfection restored IkBalpha degradation in FAT10(-/-) RTECs. In humans, common types of chronic kidney disease associated with tubulointerstitial upregulation of FAT10. These data suggest that FAT10 mediates NF-kappaB activation and may promote tubulointerstitial inflammation in chronic kidney diseases.

Prevalence of Parental Misconceptions About Antibiotic Use. Differences in antibiotic knowledge and attitudes between parents of Medicaid-insured and commercially insured children have been previously reported. It is unknown whether understanding has improved and whether previously identified differences persist. A total of 1500 Massachusetts parents with a child <6 years old insured by a Medicaid managed care or commercial health plan were surveyed in spring 2013. We examined antibiotic-related knowledge and attitudes by using χ(2) tests. Multivariable modeling was used to assess current sociodemographic predictors of knowledge and evaluate changes in predictors from a similar survey in 2000. Medicaid-insured parents in 2013 (n = 345) were younger, were less likely to be white, and had less education than those commercially insured (n = 353), P < .01. Fewer Medicaid-insured parents answered questions correctly except for one related to bronchitis, for which there was no difference (15% Medicaid vs 16% commercial, P < .66). More parents understood that green nasal discharge did not require antibiotics in 2013 compared with 2000, but this increase was smaller among Medicaid-insured (32% vs 22% P = .02) than commercially insured (49% vs 23%, P < .01) parents. Medicaid-insured parents were more likely to request unnecessary antibiotics in 2013 (P < .01). Multivariable models for predictors of knowledge or attitudes demonstrated complex relationships between insurance status and sociodemographic variables. Misconceptions about antibiotic use persist and continue to be more prevalent among parents of Medicaid-insured children. Improvement in understanding has been more pronounced in more advantaged populations. Tailored efforts for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations remain warranted to decrease parental drivers of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.

IL-6 deficiency attenuates murine diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a common cause of liver disease, is still poorly understood. This study aimed at assessing the involvement of a major inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in NASH. Steatohepatitis was induced by feeding wild-type or IL-6(-/-) mice for 5 weeks with a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Whereas MCD diet-induced weight loss and decreases in serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were similar in both genotypes, serum alanine aminotransferase was less elevated in IL-6(-/-) mice than in wild-type animals. Despite having a comparable liver steatosis score, IL-6-deficient mice exhibited less lobular inflammation than their wild-type littermates. Liver gene expression of TGF-beta and MCP-1 was also strongly attenuated in mutant mice; a more modest reduction was observed for PPAR-gamma and F4/80 transcripts as well as proteins. Chromatographic analysis of liver lipids demonstrated that MCD diet induced in normal and mutant mice a similar decrease in the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine. However, the diet-induced increase in the levels of sphingomyelin and ceramide was less important in IL-6(-/-) mice. Altogether, these results indicate that IL-6 deficiency does not block the development of NASH; yet, IL-6 plays a critical role in the accompanying liver inflammation.

Model for a solid-liquid stirred tank two-phase partitioning bioscrubber for the treatment of BTEX. A dynamic mathematical model has been developed to predict the performance of a stirred tank, solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactor (SL-TPPB) for the treatment of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene (BTEX) contaminated gases. The SL-TPPB system consists of an aqueous phase containing a bacterial consortium and a solid phase of silicone rubber beads (10%; v/v) with a high affinity for BTEX compounds. The silicone rubber beads serve to sequester and release BTEX according to thermodynamic equilibrium, which increases mass transfer from the gas phase and reduces aqueous phase concentrations of these toxic compounds during fluctuating inlet loadings. The model was developed from mass balances on BTEX components in the gas, aqueous and polymer phases, and biomass in the aqueous phase. Dynamic experimental data from this system were used to fit model parameters and to assess the accuracy of the model. A detailed estimability analysis of model parameters and initial conditions was completed to identify uncertain parameters that are most influential for the model predictions and to determine the parameters and initial conditions that should be targeted for estimation using the dynamic data. It was found that the developed model, with estimated parameters and initial conditions, has the ability to predict experimental off-gas BTEX concentrations with reasonable accuracy, which are the outputs of greatest importance.


Acupuncture and reflexology for insomnia: a feasibility study.

Assessment of dermal exposure and skin condition of workers exposed to nickel at a South African base metal refinery. The objectives of this study were to assess dermal exposure of cell workers to nickel at a South African base metal refinery and to characterize their skin condition by measuring the skin hydration and trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) indices. The skin hydration index of the index finger, palm, neck, and forehead was measured before, during and at the end of the shift. The TEWL index was measured before and at the end of the shift. Dermal exposure samples were collected with Ghostwipes from the index finger and palm of the dominant hand, before, during, and at the end of the shift. Neck and forehead samples were collected before and at the end of the shift. Wipe samples of various surfaces in the workplace were also collected. Wipes were analyzed for nickel according to NIOSH method 9102, using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Hydration indices measured on the hands decreased significantly during the shift, but recovered to normal levels by the end of the shift. TEWL indices for the index finger and palm of the hands are indicative of a low barrier function even before commencement of the shift, which further deteriorated significantly during the shift. During the shift, substantial nickel skin loading occurred on the index finger and palm of the hand. Levels on the neck and forehead were much lower. Various workplace surfaces, which workers come into contact with, were also contaminated with nickel. The skin condition and high levels of nickel on the skin were most probably caused by inadequate chemical protection provided by protective gloves. Although, the permeability of nickel through intact skin is considered to be low, a decreased barrier function of dehydrated or slightly damaged skin will increase its permeability for nickel. The ethnicity of these exposed workers may contribute significantly toward the low incidence of allergic contact dermatitis observed. Several measures to lower dermal exposure to nickel are also recommended.

Real time speech enhancement for the noisy MRI environment. Performance of two Adaptive (nLMS and Normalized Sign-error LMS) and a single channel (LogMMSE) speech enhancement algorithms are tested on a floating point DSP to reveal their effectiveness in enhancing speech corrupted in noisy MRI environment with very low SNR. The purpose of experiments is to reduce the fatigue of the listener by eliminating the strong MRI noise. The experiments use actual data set collected from a 3-Tesla MRI machine. Results of the experiments and performance of the speech enhancement system are presented in this paper. The speech enhancement system is automated. Our experiments reveal that after enhancement of the speech signal using Sign-Error LMS, the residual noise shows characteristics of white noise in contrast to the residual noise of the other algorithms which is more structured. It is also shown that the Sign-Error LMS offers fast convergence in comparison to the other two methods.

Melatonin ameliorates oxidative damage induced by maternal lead exposure in rat pups. During the particular period of cerebellum development, exposure to lead (Pb) decreases cerebellum growth and can result in selective loss of neurons. The detection and prevention of Pb toxicity is a major international public health priorities. This research study was conducted to evaluate the effects of melatonin, an effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger, on Pb induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the cerebellum. Pb exposure was initiated on gestation day 5 with the addition of daily doses of 0.2% lead acetate to distilled drinking water and continues until weaning. Melatonin (10mg/kg) was given once daily at the same time. 21 days after birth, several antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assayed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were measured as a marker of lipid peroxidation. Rotarod and locomotor activity tests were performed on postnatal days (PDs) 31-33 and a histological study was performed after completion of behavioral measurements on PD 33. The results of the present work demonstrated that Pb could induce lipid peroxidation, increase TBARS levels and decrease GPx and SOD activities in the rat cerebellum. We also observed that Pb impaired performance on the rotarod and locomotor activities of rats. However, treatment with melatonin significantly attenuated the motoric impairment and lipid peroxidation process and restored the levels of antioxidants. Histological analysis indicated that Pb could decrease Purkinje cell count and melatonin prevented this toxic effect. These results suggest that treatment with melatonin can improve motor deficits and oxidative stress by protecting the cerebellum against Pb toxicity.


Laparoscopic versus open major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a matched pair analysis.

Bone-supportive behavior of microplasma-sprayed CaP-coated implants: mechanical and histological outcome in the goat. New microplasma spray (MPS) equipment to deposit calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic coatings onto titanium substrates has been developed. With this apparatus, it is possible to spray fine particles, as well as to apply textured hydroxylapatite coatings onto titanium surfaces. Moreover, due to the low heat power of the microplasma jet, overheating of the powder particles as well as excessive local overheating of the substrate is reduced. Furthermore, because of the small laminar plasma jet, it is possible to achieve high spray efficiency in the case of spraying of dental implants. Additionally, the low level of noise (25-50 dB) and hardly any dust makes it possible to operate the MSE under normal workroom conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the biological properties of different MPS - CaP coatings on titanium implants when inserted into the femoral condyle of goats. For histomorphometrical evaluation as well as mechanical testing, 48 screw-type titanium implants were inserted into the femoral condyles of 12 goats each. The implants were either coated with a conventionally plasma-sprayed CaP ceramic, MPS CaP ceramic, or acid-etched without an additional CaP coating. Six and 12 weeks after implantation, the animals were sacrificed and bone-to-implant contact, amount of bone, as well as mechanical bone fixation were evaluated. For bone-to-implant contact no statistically significant difference was found between the different CaP coatings. However, statistically significant differences were found between non-coated, acid-etched titanium implants and CaP-coated implants after 6 and 12 weeks of healing. The bone values were not statistically significantly different between the different CaP coatings at 6 and 12 weeks. Furthermore, CaP ceramic-coated implants showed statistically significantly higher torque values compared with the non-coated implants after 6 and at 12 weeks of healing. No significant differences existed between the various types of CaP coatings. On the basis of our observations, we conclude that conventionally plasma-sprayed CaP ceramic-coated implants, as well as MPS-coated implants have a comparable effect on adjacent bone response.

[Photodynamic effect of two kinds of phycobiliproteins on human liver cancer cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro]. We studied the effect of photodynamic therapy with phycobiliproteins on human liver cancer cells in vitro. With 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay), we used two phycobiliproteins, R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) and C-phycocyanin (C-PC) prepared from Porphyra yezoensis, to determine the killing rates and apoptosis rates of human liver cancer cells (SMMC-7721) mediated by laser. When the concentration of R-PE was 120 mg/L, the survival rate of human liver cancer cells was 27% after treated by Argon laser with 100 J/cm2 doses, while the survival rate in the control group (without adding R-PE) was 65%. When the C-PC concentration was 120 mg/L, the survival cell rate was 47% after treated by He-Ne laser with 35 J/cm2 dose, while the survival rate in the control group (without adding C-PC) was 70%. After handled only with these two kinds of phycobiliproteins for 72 h, the growth of cancer cells presented significant inhibition. The maximal inhibition rates reached up to 31% with R-PE (120 mg/L concentration) and 27% with C-PC (250 mg/L concentration) respectively. After irradiated by laser for 8 h, the maximal cell apoptosis rates were 31.54% with R-PE and 32.54% with C-PC, respectively. It indicated that R-PE and C-PC extracted from Porphyra yezoensis could develop to new photosensitizers for cancer photodynamic therapy.

The role of health impact assessment in promoting population health and health equity. Within the discipline of health promotion there has been long-standing understanding of the social determinants of health and life expectancy.1-3 There is also long-standing evidence of the unfair, unjust distribution of these resources within and among societies. It has proven difficult to translate this evidence of the need for the fairer distribution of socially-distributed resources into powerful action by the range of sectors through whose policies and programs/services much of this inequitable distribution is created.4 Health promotion has proven effective in contributing to significant improvements in the health of populations. It is, now, based on well-developed theory and a comprehensive body of evidence. However, health promotion in particular and the health sector in general have found it difficult to work with other sectors to influence public policy to create the social, economic, environmental and cultural conditions necessary for health equity. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is outlined as an approach that offers the health sector a structured, transparent method and process to work with other sectors to predict the impact of policy proposals on the health of populations (and on the determinants of health), and to predict the distribution of these impacts in advance of adoption and implementation of the policy. Based on Australian experience of conducting HIAs, the paper outlines contributions that HIA can make to formulating and implementing of healthy public policy. It describes the steps in HIA and illustrates the use of these in practice.

Sugar deprivation reduces insemination of Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), despite daily recruitment of adults, and predicts decline in model populations. Our research tests the hypothesis that the inability to sugar-feed reduces the insemination rate in mosquito populations. To test this, we measured the effects of sugar availability on cumulative insemination performance of male Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) during 10-d periods of continual emergence of equal numbers of both sexes, and we evaluated the implications at the population level with a matrix population model. On each day of each of four replicates, 20 newly emerged mosquitoes of each sex were recruited into the populations within two mesocosms, large walk-in enclosures with simulated natural conditions. Each mesocosm contained a cage to replicate the experiment on a small scale. Scented sucrose was absent or present (control). A human host was available nightly as a bloodmeal source in both mesocosms. Sugar availability and enclosure size significantly influenced female insemination. In the mesocosms, with sugar 49.7% of the females were inseminated, compared with 10.9% of the females without sugar. In the small cages, the insemination rates were 76.0 and 23.5%, respectively. In the mesocosms, cumulative survival of females after 10 d was 51.6% with sugar and 25.6% without sugar. In the cages, female survival was 95 and 73%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the population projection matrix shows that both reduced male survival and reduced mating capability due to a lack of sugar contributed to lower insemination rates in females, and in the absence of sugar the insemination rate was lowered to an extent that led to population decline.

Insight into stress-induced cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death due to stress. A forensic cardio-pathologist point of view. Emotional, physiological and physical stress is associated with increased rates of cerebrovascular events and sudden deaths. The pathophysiology of stress-induced cardiomyopathy is not well understood. Proposed mechanisms for catecholamine-mediated stunning in stress cardiomyopathy include epicardial vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction, hyperdynamic contractility with midventricular or outflow tract obstruction, and direct effects of catecholamines on cardiomyocytes. Studies show evidence of significant heritable influences on individual responses to adrenergic stimulation. Data from such studies may be of help for a more accurate comprehension of clinical and morphological alterations of the heart. Irrespective of the cause, patients with the classic stress-induced cardiomyopathy morphology deserve special attention because this extensive distribution of wall motion abnormalities has implications for potential associated complications. Cardiac response may be significantly coupled to genetic differences at candidate loci that encode components of catecholamine biosynthesis, storage, and metabolic pathway. Given the role of the sympathetic nervous system in responses to acute stress, it is reasonable to explore whether genetically determined alterations in catecholamine system functions contribute to acute and chronic cardiovascular disorders such as stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

Dermal delivery of HSP47 siRNA with NOX4-modulating mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles for treating fibrosis. Fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma have been linked to increased oxidative stress and upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes. Recent work suggests a role of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in inducing excessive collagen synthesis, leading to fibrotic diseases. Herein, we elucidate the relationship between NOX4 and HSP47 in fibrogenesis and propose to modulate them altogether as a new strategy to treat fibrosis. We developed a nanoparticle platform consisting of polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on a 50-nm mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) core. The nanoparticles effectively delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HSP47 (siHSP47) in an in vitro model of fibrosis based on TGF-β stimulated fibroblasts. The MSNP core also imparted an antioxidant property by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequently reducing NOX4 levels in the in vitro fibrogenesis model. The nanoparticle was far superior to n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) at modulating pro-fibrotic markers. In vivo evaluation was performed in a bleomycin-induced scleroderma mouse model, which shares many similarities to human scleroderma disease. Intradermal administration of siHSP47-nanoparticles effectively reduced HSP47 protein expression in skin to normal level. In addition, the antioxidant MSNP also played a prominent role in reducing the pro-fibrotic markers, NOX4, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen type I (COL I), as well as skin thickness of the mice.

The 8th and 9th tandem spectrin-like repeats of utrophin cooperatively form a functional unit to interact with polarity-regulating kinase PAR-1b. Utrophin is a widely expressed paralogue of dystrophin, the protein responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a large spectrin-like protein whose C-terminal domain mediates anchorage to a laminin receptor, dystroglycan (DG). The rod domain, composed of 22 spectrin-like repeats, connects the N-terminal actin-binding domain and the C-terminal DG binding domain, and thus mediates molecular linkage between intracellular F-actin and extracellular basement membrane. Previously, we demonstrated that a cell polarity-regulating kinase, PAR-1b, interacts with the utrophin-DG complex, and positively regulates the interaction between utrophin and DG. In this study, we demonstrate that the 8th and 9th spectrin-like repeats (R8 and R9) of utrophin cooperatively form a PAR-1b-interacting domain, and that Ser1258 within R9 is specifically phosphorylated by PAR-1b. Substitution of Ser1258 to alanine reduces the interaction between utrophin and DG, suggesting that the Ser1258 phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of the utrophin-DG complex. Interestingly, PAR-1b also binds and phosphorylates R8-9 of dystrophin, and colocalizes with dystrophin at the skeletal muscle membrane. These results reveal a novel function of the rod domain of utrophin beyond that of a passive structural linker connecting the N- and C-terminal domain.

From anti-allergic to anti-Alzheimer's: Molecular pharmacology of Dimebon. Dimebon, originally developed as an anti-histamine drug, is being re-purposed for new indications as an effective treatment for patients suffering from Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, albeit with an as-yet unknown mechanism of action. We have performed molecular pharmacology profiling of this drug on a panel of 70 targets to characterize the spectrum of its activity, with the goal to possibly elucidate a potential molecular mechanism for the re-purposing of this drug candidate. We show that in addition to histaminergic receptors, Dimebon exhibits high affinity to a constellation of other receptors; specifically serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. Good correlations with published literature were obtained for the affinity of Dimebon to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase, interact with H1and H2 receptors (Ki = 2 nM and 232 nM), and to block histamine-induced calcium fluxes in cells. Within serotonergic receptor subtypes, Dimebon shows highest affinity for 5-HT7 (Ki=8 nM) and 5-HT6 (Ki=34 nM) receptors, with the relative affinity rank-order of 5-HT7 > 5-HT6 > or = 5-HT2A = 5-HT2C > 5-HT1A = 5-HT1B > 5-HT2B=5-HT3. Dimebon also interacts with adrenergic receptor subtypes (rank-order: alpha1A (Ki = 55 nM)= alpha1B > or = alpha2A (Ki = 120 nM) = alpha1D), and dopaminergic receptor subtypes (rank-order: D1=D2S=D2L (Ki approximately 600 nM) >D3> or =D4.2>D4.4> or =D4.7). These results demonstrate a molecular pharmacological basis for re-purposing of this drug to new therapeutic areas. The informed targeting of the combined molecular target activities may provide additional advantages for patients suffering from similar diseases syndromes. Understanding the role that different pathways play in diseases with complex etiologies may allow for the rational design of multi-target drugs.

In vitro chemopreventive potential of fucophlorethols from the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus L. by anti-oxidant activity and inhibition of selected cytochrome P450 enzymes. Within a project focusing on the chemopreventive potential of algal phenols, two phloroglucinol derivatives, belonging to the class of fucophlorethols, and the known fucotriphlorethol A were obtained from the ethanolic extract of the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus L. The compounds trifucodiphlorethol A and trifucotriphlorethol A are composed of six and seven units of phloroglucinol, respectively. The compounds were examined for their cancer chemopreventive potential, in comparison with the monomer phloroglucinol. Trifucodiphlorethol A, trifucotriphlorethol A as well as fucotriphlorethol A were identified as strong radical scavengers, with IC(50) values for scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2 picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH) in the range of 10.0-14.4 microg/ml. All three compounds potently scavenged peroxyl radicals in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. In addition, the compounds were shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 1A activity with IC(50) values in the range of 17.9-33 microg/ml, and aromatase (Cyp19) activity with IC(50) values in the range of 1.2-5.6 microg/ml.

Evaluation of the Virtual Physiology of Exercise Laboratory program. The Virtual Physiology of Exercise Laboratory (VPEL) program was created to simulate the test design, data collection, and analysis phases of selected exercise physiology laboratories. The VPEL program consists of four modules: 1) cardiovascular, 2) maximal O(2) consumption (Vo(2max)), 3) lactate and ventilatory thresholds, and 4) respiratory exchange ratio. The purpose of this investigation was to compare student learning from the VPEL program with that from traditional "hands-on" exercise physiology laboratory activities. Student participants from the spring 2009 Integrated Fitness Programming course were randomly assigned to either experimental group 1 or group 2. Group 1 completed a hands-on version of a typical Vo(2max) laboratory activity, whereas group 2 completed the VPEL Vo(2max) module. Both groups then completed the same assessment to evaluate their understanding of Vo(2max) laboratory concepts. Group 1 then completed the VPEL lactate and ventilatory threshold module, whereas group 2 completed a hands-on version of that same activity. Both groups then completed the same assessment to evaluate their understanding of lactate and ventilatory threshold laboratory concepts. Mean Vo(2max) assessment scores were 86.39 +/- 4.13 and 85.64 +/- 6.72 and mean lactate and ventilatory threshold assessment scores were 85.50 +/- 8.05 and 86.15 +/- 6.45 for groups 1 and 2, respectively. These findings lend additional support to the following conclusion of similar investigations (2, 4, 6): that virtual laboratories instruct students as effectively as hands-on laboratories.

Total synthesis of (-)-lycoperine A. Lycoperine A was synthesized through a highly convergent route in which a double alkylation of 2,6-dicyano-N-benzylpiperidine with the octahydroquinoline moiety gave the lycoperine skeleton. The octahydroquinoline was prepared by a desymmetrization reaction of 5-methylcyclohexane-1,3-dione. Hydrolysis, reductive amination, and cyclization gave lycoperine A in 13 steps and 3% overall yield. The absolute configuration of lycoperine A was assigned as 6R,6'R,8R,8'R,13S,17R.

Decline and compensation in aging brain and cognition: promises and constraints. Preface. Age-related cognitive declines are common and inevitable, but life trajectories of brain and cognitive functions are variable and plastic. To identify the mechanisms of decline, the prospects for improvement, and the constraints on the remedial approaches, the contributors of this special issuer examine several diverse areas of cognitive and brain aging: from structural and metabolic brain aging to genetics, and from age-sensitive cognitive domains to those that resist aging. In spite of such thematic diversity, several common threads are clear. To achieve better compensation for age-related changes in cognition, we need to understand their brain substrates, telling cognitively relevant from epiphenomenal. We also need to understand the sources of profound individual variability in aging trajectories, and to learn to tailor interventions to specific individual profiles of decline.

Ligational behavior of thiosemicarbazone, semicarbazone and thiocarbohydrazone ligands towards VO(IV), Ce(III), Th(IV) and UO2(VI) ions: synthesis, structural characterization and biological studies. Mono- and binuclear VO(IV), Ce(III), Th(IV) and UO(2)(VI) complexes of thiosemicarbazone, semicarbazone and thiocarbohydrazone ligands derived from 4,6-diacetylresorcinol were synthesized. The structures of these complexes were elucidated by elemental analyses, IR, UV-vis, ESR, (1)H NMR and mass spectra as well as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements and thermal analyses. The thiosemicarbazone (H(4)L(1)) and the semicarbazone (H(4)L(2)) ligands behave as dibasic pentadentate ligands in case of VO(IV) and UO(2)(VI) complexes, tribasic pentadentate in case of Ce(III) complexes and monobasic pentadentate in case of Th(IV) complexes. However, the thiocarbohydrazone ligand (H(3)L(3)) acts as a monobasic tridentate ligand in all complexes except the VO(IV) complex in which it acts as a dibasic tridentate ligand. The antibacterial and antifungal activities were also tested against Rhizobium bacteria and Fusarium-Oxysporium fungus. The metal complexes of H(4)L(1) ligand showed a higher antibacterial effect than the free ligand while the other ligands (H(4)L(2) and H(3)L(3)) showed a higher effect than their metal complexes. The antifungal effect of all metal complexes is lower than the free ligands.

An overview of second generation biofuel technologies. The recently identified limitations of 1st-generation biofuels produced from food crops (with perhaps the exception of sugarcane ethanol) have caused greater emphasis to be placed on 2nd-generation biofuels produced from ligno-cellulosic feedstocks. Although significant progress continues to be made to overcome the technical and economic challenges, 2nd-generation biofuels production will continue to face major constraints to full commercial deployment. The logistics of providing a competitive, all-year-round, supply of biomass feedstock to a commercial-scale plant is challenging, as is improving the performance of the conversion process to reduce costs. The biochemical route, being less mature, probably has a greater cost reduction potential than the thermo-chemical route, but here a wider range of synthetic fuels can be produced to better suit heavy truck, aviation and marine applications. Continued investment in research and demonstration by both public and private sectors, coupled with appropriate policy support mechanisms, are essential if full commercialisation is to be achieved within the next decade. After that, the biofuel industry will grow only at a steady rate and encompass both 1st- and 2nd-generation technologies that meet agreed environmental, sustainability and economic policy goals.

Tip60 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by translocation of androgen receptor into the nucleus. There are currently few effective therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). CRPC which is resistant to castration is thought to result from increased activation of the androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway, which may be augmented by AR coactivators. Luciferase reporter assay, Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence microscopy, cell proliferation assay, and flow cytometry for cell-cycle analysis were used to resolve a role of Tip60 regulating AR in PCa cells. Tip60 regulated transcriptions of AR target genes androgen independently. Tip60 knockdown induced translocation of AR into the cytoplasm. Acetylation-mimicking mutations in the nuclear localization signal sequence caused AR protein to mainly localize in the nucleus despite androgen starvation, whereas non-acetylation-mimicking mutations caused AR to mainly localize in the cytoplasm despite androgen stimulation. Tip60 overexpression in castration-resistant LNCaP derivative CxR cells resulted in increases in the acetylated form of AR and AR localization in the nucleus even without androgen. Consequently, Tip60 silencing suppressed the growth of AR-expressing PCa cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, similar to inhibition of androgen/AR signaling. Furthermore, Tip60 knockdown suppressed the cell growth of CxR cells. Tip60 is involved in the proliferation of PCa cells as an AR coactivator. Modulation of Tip60 expression or function may be a useful strategy for developing novel therapeutics for PCa, even CRPC, which remain dependent on AR signaling, by overexpressing AR and its coactivators.

Non-destructive determination of the coating film thickness by X-ray powder diffractometry and correlation with the dissolution behavior of film-coated tablets. The goal of this project was to determine the effect of the thickness of the coating film on the dissolution behavior of tablets. Commercially available film-coated tablets containing aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine, were used as the model system. First, a non-destructive X-ray microdiffractometric technique was developed to quantify the thickness of the film-coating in intact tablets. The same tablets were then subjected to dissolution tests. There was an inverse correlation between the cumulative amount of drug in solution at 5min and the thickness of the coating film. As the coating thickness increased, the initiation of tablet dissolution was delayed, resulting in a decrease in the cumulative amount of drug in solution. Finally, the technique was applied to formulations marketed by different companies. The X-ray microdiffractometric technique has the potential to predict the dissolution behavior of tablets.

[Differential diagnosis of child sexual abuse]. The evaluation of a child presenting with an anogenital complaint or lesion can be challenging for both the clinician and the patient. The doctor met the real possibility that a diagnosis of a condition caused by sexual abuse will affect significantly the child and the family. A misdiagnosis of abuse or failure to recognize a treatable condition can also have detrimental consequences. Most primary care physicians are not trained to recognize the variety of systemic and dermatologic problems that affect the anogenital area. Dermatologists and other specialists often do not appreciate the possibility of sexual abuse. In this article we present a systematic approach to the child with anogenital complaints which may mimic sexual abuse.

Electro-mediated gene transfer and expression are controlled by the life-time of DNA/membrane complex formation. Electroporation is a physical method used to transfer molecules into cells and tissues. Clinical applications have been developed for antitumor drug delivery. Clinical trials of gene electrotransfer are under investigation. However, knowledge about how DNA enters cells is not complete. By contrast to small molecules that have direct access to the cytoplasm, DNA forms a long lived complex with the plasma membrane and is transferred into the cytoplasm with a considerable delay. To increase our understanding of the key step of DNA/membrane complex formation, we investigated the dependence of DNA/membrane interaction and gene expression on electric pulse polarity and repetition frequency. We observed that both are affected by reversing the polarity and by increasing the repetition frequency of pulses. The results obtained in the present study reveal the existence of two classes of DNA/membrane interaction: (i) a metastable DNA/membrane complex from which DNA can leave and return to external medium and (ii) a stable DNA/membrane complex, where DNA cannot be removed, even by applying electric pulses of reversed polarity. Only DNA belonging to the second class leads to effective gene expression. The life-time of DNA/membrane complex formation is of the order of 1 s and has to be taken into account to improve protocols of electro-mediated gene delivery.


Age-related defects in the cytoskeleton signaling pathways of CD4 T cells.

The genotoxicity of mainstream and sidestream marijuana and tobacco smoke condensates. While the prevalence of tobacco use has decreased in Canada over the past decade, that of marijuana use has increased, particularly among youth. However, the risks of adverse health effects from marijuana smoke exposure, specifically as compared to tobacco, are currently not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relative ability of matched marijuana and tobacco condensates to induce (geno)toxic responses in three in vitro test systems. This study provides comparative data for matched sidestream and mainstream condensates, as well as condensates prepared under both a standard and an extreme smoking regime designed to mimic marijuana smoking habits. The results indicate that tobacco and marijuana smoke differ substantially in terms of their cytotoxicity, Salmonella mutagenicity, and ability to induce chromosomal damage (i.e., micronucleus formation). Specifically, the marijuana condensates were all found to be more cytotoxic and more mutagenic in the presence of S9 than the matched tobacco condensates. In contrast, the tobacco condensates appeared to induce cytogenetic damage in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the matched marijuana condensates did not. In addition, when corrected for total particulate matter yield, little difference was observed in the mutagenic activity of samples smoked under the extreme vs the standard regime for both tobacco and marijuana condensates.

MicroRNAs: New Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, Therapy Prediction and Therapeutic Tools for Breast Cancer. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in the initiation and progression of several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC), as strong evidence has been found that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. This review presents the state of the art on the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of BC. Based on the results obtained in the last decade, some miRNAs are emerging as biomarkers of BC for diagnosis (i.e., miR-9, miR-10b, and miR-17-5p), prognosis (i.e., miR-148a and miR-335), and prediction of therapeutic outcomes (i.e., miR-30c, miR-187, and miR-339-5p) and have important roles in the control of BC hallmark functions such as invasion, metastasis, proliferation, resting death, apoptosis, and genomic instability. Other miRNAs are of interest as new, easily accessible, affordable, non-invasive tools for the personalized management of patients with BC because they are circulating in body fluids (e.g., miR-155 and miR-210). In particular, circulating multiple miRNA profiles are showing better diagnostic and prognostic performance as well as better sensitivity than individual miRNAs in BC. New miRNA-based drugs are also promising therapy for BC (e.g., miR-9, miR-21, miR34a, miR145, and miR150), and other miRNAs are showing a fundamental role in modulation of the response to other non-miRNA treatments, being able to increase their efficacy (e.g., miR-21, miR34a, miR195, miR200c, and miR203 in combination with chemotherapy). 

H reflex modulation by transcranial magnetic stimulation in spinal cord injury subjects after gait training with electromechanical systems. Prospective longitudinal study. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the soleus H reflex in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) before and after locomotion training. Neurorehabilitation hospital in Barcelona, Spain. H reflex was elicited in 29 incomplete patients with SCI at 20, 50 and 80 ms after single vertex TMS, and compared with 13 healthy subjects. Patients were subdivided in two groups according to time since injury (<3 months, 3-12 months), and all received training with electromechanical systems. The H reflex modulation pattern to TMS was reassessed and the results were analyzed as a function of change in the patient clinical score. Healthy subjects showed a significant H reflex facilitation at 20 ms (186.1%) and at 80 ms (190.6%) compared with the control H reflex. In patients, the H reflex facilitation at 20 ms was significantly reduced before training (142.5%, P=0.039) compared with healthy subjects. After training, patients with <3 months exhibited an increase in H reflex facilitation at 20 ms (170.7%, P=0.04), a greater gait velocity (P=0.014) and a positive correlation with the walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI II) scale (P=0.050), compared with those with >3 months. TMS-induced H reflex modulation may help in the assessment of changes in the descending control of leg reflexes. Our results suggest that the changes on reflex modulation in patients with SCI occur within the first 3 months after injury.

Development of a cytotoxic T-cell assay in rabbits to evaluate early immune response to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection causes adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL) following a prolonged clinical incubation period, despite a robust adaptive immune response against the virus. Early immune responses that allow establishment of the infection are difficult to study without effective animal models. We have developed a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assay to monitor the early events of HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Rabbit skin fibroblast cell lines were established by transformation with a plasmid expressing simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and used as autochthonous targets (derived from same individual animal) to measure CTL activity against HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs expressing either HTLV-1 envelope surface unit (SU) glycoprotein 46 or Tax proteins were used to infect fibroblast targets in a (51)Cr-release CTL assay. Rabbits inoculated with Jurkat T cells or ACH.2 cells (expressing ACH HTLV-1 molecule clone) were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, 21, and 34 wk post-infection. ACH.2-inoculated rabbits were monitored serologically and for viral infected cells following ex vivo culture. Proviral load analysis indicated that rabbits with higher proviral loads had significant CTL activity against HTLV-1 SU as early as 2 wk post-infection, while both low- and high-proviral-load groups had minimal Tax-specific CTL activity throughout the study. This first development of a stringent assay to measure HTLV-1 SU and Tax-specific CTL assay in the rabbit model will enhance immunopathogenesis studies of HTLV-1 infection. Our data suggest that during the early weeks following infection, HTLV-1-specific CTL responses are primarily targeted against Env-SU.

Age and sex influence the balance between maximal cardiac output and peripheral vascular reserve. We evaluated the influence of age and sex on the relationship between central and peripheral vasodilatory capacity. Healthy men (19 younger, 12 older) and women (17 younger, 17 older) performed treadmill and knee extensor exercise to fatigue on separate days while maximal cardiac output (Q, acetylene uptake) and peak femoral blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound) were measured, respectively. Maximal Q was reduced with age similarly in men (Y: 23.6 +/- 2.7 vs. O: 17.4 +/- 3.5 l/min; P < 0.05) and women (Y: 17.7 +/- 1.9 vs. O: 12.3 +/- 1.6 l/min; P < 0.05). Peak FBF was similar between younger (Y) and older (O) men (Y: 2.1 +/- 0.5 vs. O: 2.2 +/- 0.7 l/min) but was lower in older women compared with younger women (Y: 1.9 +/- 0.4 vs. O: 1.4 +/- 0.4 l/min; P < 0.05). Maximal Q was positively correlated with peak FBF in men (Y: r = 0.55, O: r = 0.74; P < 0.05) but not in women (Y: r = 0.34, O: r = 0.10). Normalization of cardiac output to appendicular muscle mass and peak FBF to quadriceps mass reduced the correlation between these variables in younger men (r = 0.30), but the significant association remained in older men (r = 0.68; P < 0.05), with no change in women. These data suggest that 1) aerobic capacity is associated with peripheral vascular reserve in men but not women, and 2) aging is accompanied by a more pronounced sex difference in this relationship.

The effect of fetal growth and nutrient stresses on steroid pathways. The early life environment is a crucial time for establishing the trajectory of future health. Low birthweight is considered a marker of an adverse in utero environment and predisposes to cardio-metabolic disease later in life. It has been proposed that this is mediated by glucocorticoids, with life-long activation of the HPA axis. Here we review the evidence to support this hypothesis, with particular emphasis on the effects of fetal growth and nutrient stresses in utero on steroid pathways of the HPA axis. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes could help to optimize in utero health, and identify individuals at greatest risk of future disease.


Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment.

Taking the lead: community pharmacists' perception of their role potential within the primary care team. Patient-focused care provided by an interprofessional team has long been presented as the preferred method of primary care delivery. Community pharmacists should and can provide leadership for many clinical and managerial activities within the primary care team. To determine the extent to which community pharmacists are prepared to be members of the health care team, and to assess their support for general expansion of clinical responsibilities. A mail questionnaire (in either English or French) was sent to 1500 community pharmacists between February and April 2004. Respondents were asked to indicate the necessity of pharmacy leadership for a range of clinical and managerial services associated with a primary care team. Respondents were also asked to indicate the extent to which they should be more involved in drug therapy selection and monitoring, as well as assuming greater responsibility for treating both minor and chronic illnesses. The response rate was 35.2% (470/1337) with the highest response rate in the Prairie provinces (40.6%) and the lowest in Quebec (24.4%). Most pharmacists in the study did not advocate a strong leadership role for non-discipline-specific clinical and managerial activities. Most of them indicated that community pharmacists should be more involved in selecting (69.9%) and monitoring (81.0%) drug therapy, and be more responsible for treating minor illnesses (72.0%). Support for more responsibility declined to 50% for chronic illnesses. The findings of the study suggest substantial variability among pharmacists in their perception of the need for pharmacy leadership across 16 clinical and managerial activities.

Clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with familial obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Craniofacial structure and body fat are key factors that predispose to upper airway obstruction while asleep, and these phenotypes can be genetically inherited. Neither the clinical characteristics of familial obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) nor the definitive morphological factors responsible for familial occurrence have been well identified. This study compared the clinical and cephalographic characteristics of Japanese patients with familial OSAS, non-familial OSAS and healthy controls, to clarify the mechanisms underlying familial OSAS. The study recruited 28 patients with familial OSAS, comprising 14 index cases and 14 first-degree relatives affected with OSAS, and compared these with age- and sex-matched patients with non-familial OSAS (n = 32) and healthy subjects (n = 33). Data on clinical status were collected, including the presence of hypertension, BMI and daytime sleepiness measured on the Epworth sleepiness scale. Respiratory function was evaluated by the AHI, % periods in which SpO(2) fell 90% or below and lowest value of SpO(2) on polysomnograms. Information on the first witnessed age of habitual snoring during sleep was collected via interview with patients and/or their family members. A detailed cephalometric assessment was made of each study subject. Patients with familial OSAS had lower mean BMI than did patients with non-familial OSAS. The first witnessed age of habitual snoring was younger in the familial cases than the non-familial cases. Cephalometric variables showed that the posterior airway space and the distance between the gonion and the gnathion were significantly smaller in the familial group than in the other two groups. Familial OSAS occurred at a younger age than non-familial OSAS due to minor anomalies of craniofacial morphology.


Live births achieved via IVF are increased by improvements in air quality and laboratory environment.

A translational research approach to poor treatment response in patients with schizophrenia: clozapine-antipsychotic polypharmacy. Poor treatment response in patients with schizophrenia is an important clinical problem, and one possible strategy is concurrent treatment with more than one antipsychotic (polypharmacy). We analyzed the evidence base for this strategy using a translational research model focused on clozapine-antipsychotic polypharmacy (CAP). We considered 3 aspects of the existing knowledge base and translational research: the link between basic science and clinical studies of efficacy, the evidence for effectiveness in clinical research and the implications of research for the health care delivery system. Although a rationale for CAP can be developed from receptor pharmacology, there is little available preclinical research testing these concepts in animal models. Randomized clinical trials of CAP show minimal or no benefit for overall severity of symptoms. Most studies at the level of health services are limited to estimates of CAP prevalence and some suggestion of increased costs. Increasing use of antipsychotic polypharmacy in general may be a factor contributing to the under-utilization of clozapine and long delays in initiating clozapine monotherapy. Translational research models can be applied to clinical questions such as the value of CAP. Better linkage between the components of translational research may improve the appropriate use of medications such as clozapine in psychiatric practice.

Ex vivo comparison of microbicide efficacies for preventing HIV-1 genomic integration in intraepithelial vaginal cells. Vaginally applied microbicides hold promise as a strategy to prevent sexual HIV transmission. Several nonspecific microbicides, including the polyanion cellulose sulfate, have been evaluated in large-scale clinical trials but have failed to show significant efficacy. These findings have prompted a renewed search for preclinical testing systems that can predict negative outcomes of microbicide trials. Moreover, the pipeline of potential topical microbicides has been expanded to include antiretroviral agents, such as reverse transcriptase, fusion, and integrase inhibitors. Using a novel ex vivo model of vaginal HIV-1 infection, we compared the prophylactic potentials of two forms of the fusion inhibitor T-20, the CCR5 antagonist TAK-778, the integrase inhibitor 118-D-24, and cellulose sulfate (Ushercell). The T-20 peptide with free N- and C-terminal amino acids was the most efficacious compound, causing significantly greater inhibition of viral genomic integration in intraepithelial vaginal leukocytes, measured by an optimized real-time PCR assay, than the more water-soluble N-acetylated T-20 peptide (Fuzeon) (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], 0.153 microM versus 51.2 microM [0.687 ng/ml versus 230 ng/ml]; P<0.0001). In contrast, no significant difference in IC50s was noted in peripheral blood cells (IC50, 13.58 microM versus 7.57 microM [61 ng/ml versus 34 ng/ml]; P=0.0614). Cellulose sulfate was the least effective of all the compounds tested (IC50, 1.8 microg/ml). These results highlight the merit of our model for screening the mucosal efficacies of novel microbicides and their formulations and potentially rank ordering candidates for clinical evaluation.


Arabidopsis deadenylases AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b play overlapping and distinct roles in mediating environmental stress responses.

Thiazolidinediones increase the wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) inhibitor Dickkopf-1 in adipocytes: a link with osteogenesis. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a secreted inhibitor of canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signalling; the key pathway for cell fate and development. Inhibition of WNT signalling by DKK1 in precursor cells promotes adipogenesis and inhibits osteogenesis. Previous studies have shown that treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) reduces bone density and increases risk of bone fractures, while body fat is increased. We examined the effect of TZDs on secretion and DKK1 levels in pre-adipocytes and mature adipose cells and also measured circulating DKK1 levels in 11 patients with type 2 diabetes before and after treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone for 90 days. TZDs added in vitro rapidly increased DKK1 protein levels and secretion in both fully differentiated adipose cells and pre-adipocytes undergoing differentiation. In parallel, beta-catenin levels, a marker of canonical WNT signalling, were reduced. Serum levels of DKK1 were also increased in several of the patients with type 2 diabetes after treatment with rosiglitazone for 90 days. These results provide a novel mechanism whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation can terminate WNT signalling and promote adipogenesis. Furthermore, they provide an explanation for why TZD treatment can lead to reduced bone formation and increased risk of fractures, since inhibited WNT signalling in progenitor cells promotes adipogenesis while osteogenesis is reduced.

Predictive value of frozen-section analysis in the histological assessment of steatosis before liver transplantation. Histological quality assessment of donated livers is a key factor for extending the cadaveric donor pool for liver transplantation. We retrospectively compared frozen-section analysis with routine histological permanent slides and the outcomes of grafts in liver biopsies from 294 candidate donors. The kappa concordance coefficient of agreement between frozen-section analysis and routine histological analysis was very good for macrosteatosis (kappa = 0.934), microsteatosis (kappa = 0.828), and total steatosis (kappa = 0.814). The correlation between the mean amounts of macrosteatosis, microsteatosis, and total steatosis in frozen and permanent sections was also significant (P < 0.001, Spearman's test). Macrosteatosis and microsteatosis were overestimated to >30% in 4 of 32 cases (12.5%) and in 23 of 62 cases (37.1%), respectively. The only 2 histological parameters of frozen sections able to predict graft dysfunction within 7 days of transplantation were macrosteatosis and total steatosis (P = 0.018 and P = 0.015, respectively, Mann-Whitney test). None of the other histopathological features evaluated in frozen sections, including portal inflammation, lobular necrosis, myointimal thickening, biliocyte regression, cholestasis, hepatocellular polymorphism, lipofuscin storage, and fibrous septa, were significantly correlated with the graft outcome. The frozen-section histological evaluation of biopsies from cadaveric liver donors is an accurate, time-effective, and predictive method for the assessment of graft suitability.

Effects of magnesium on postprandial serum lipid responses in healthy human subjects. Postprandial hyperlipidaemia has been recognised to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis development. Epidemiological and animal studies have shown that Mg intake is inversely associated with some risk factors of atherosclerosis, including lipid metabolism. The present study was performed to determine the effects of Mg supplementation on postprandial responses in serum lipid levels. We used bittern (Nigari, in Japanese), a natural MgCl(2) solution from sea or salt lake water, for Mg supplementation. In a two-way, randomised, crossover study, sixteen healthy male volunteers consumed 30 g butter with or without 5 ml bittern containing 500 mg of Mg. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were taken 2, 3, 4 and 6 h after ingestion. Postprandial lipid responses were evaluated by serum TAG, chylomicron TAG, apo-B48, remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) and NEFA concentrations. We found that the serum and the chylomicron TAG responses after the fat load were reduced and delayed by Mg supplementation. The concentrations of apo-B48 (P < 0.05), RLP-C (P < 0.05) and NEFA (P < 0.05) were significantly lower at 2 h after the fat-with-Mg meal compared with the fat-only meal. The present study indicated that Mg supplementation could inhibit fat absorption and improve postprandial hyperlipidaemia in healthy subjects.

Expecting the Unexpected: Perspectives on Stillbirth and Late Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Anomalies. Expectant mothers and their spouses spend months preparing to eagerly welcome their much-anticipated baby into their family. Stillbirth or a diagnosis of life-limiting fetal anomalies comes as a devastating turn of events for affected women and their families. From the time of diagnosis to intervention (i.e., induction of labor for stillbirth or late termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies), affected women often feel vulnerable and abandoned, with many experiencing long-term psychological and emotional effects. Knowledge of obstetric management, ethical and medical challenges, and psychological aspects have evolved in recent years. Familiarity with this emerging knowledge better prepares the obstetric anesthesiologist to deliver effective and empathic care. Encounters with women experiencing stillbirth and life-limiting fetal anomalies prompted this review of current evidence regarding parturient' perspectives on their care as they set out on the road to recovery.

Promoting Good Psychiatric Management for Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder. General psychiatric management for patients with borderline personality disorder was devised to be an outpatient intervention that could be readily learned and easily delivered by independent community mental health professionals. To disseminate the approach, Drs. Gunderson and Links developed the Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder (Gunderson & Links, ) that presented the basics of the approach, videos to illustrate the appropriate clinical skills, and case examples to practice adherence to the approach. Unfortunately, the inclusion of "psychiatric" in the treatment's name may discourage psychologists and other mental health professionals from using this therapy. In this article, we review the basic principles and approaches related to general psychiatric management. With a case example, we illustrate how psychologists can use all the general psychiatric management principles for their patients with BPD, except medications and, as a result, provide and deliver this approach effectively.

Influence of parity-related factors adjusted for abortion on knee osteoarthritis in Korean women aged 50 or older: A cross-sectional study. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is pervasive in aged populations, and induces considerable socioeconomic expense. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between OA prevalence and pregnancy and parity in Koreans, considering for the potential effect of abortion. A total 5449 women aged ≥50 years with radiological knee examination results of 24,173 participants of the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010-2012) were analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Association between OA prevalence (Kellgren/Lawrence grade) and pregnancy and parity as odds ratios (ORs) by logistic regression. Knee OA results were normal in 1996 participants (36.1%), suspected in 1012 (18.6%), mild in 781 (14.3%), moderate in 1073 (19.7%), and severe in 617 (11.3%). Increase in number of pregnancies adjusted for abortion was significantly associated with increased OA prevalence (OR 1.081; 95% CI 1.015, 1.152). OA prevalence increased with parity (continuous variable) in ever-abortion (OR 1.092; 95% CI 1.009, 1.181) and with parity (categorical variable) with reference value set at 1-2 (P for trend; p=0.0195). In analyses adjusted for abortion, ever-abortion negatively influenced OA prevalence. Parity was not associated with OA in number of pregnancies unadjusted for abortion or in never-abortion women. This study shows that maternity-related factors such as pregnancy and parity were related with knee OA prevalence in this population-based sample of older women, and that relationships with abortion were stronger.

Emergency department headache admissions in an acute care hospital:why do they occur and what can we do about it? Many patients present to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of headache and a significant proportion of these visits would result in hospital admissions. This study analyses the demographics, presentation, work-up, reasons for admission, diagnoses and outcomes of patients admitted with the chief complaint of headache--to identify possible ways of reducing such admissions. A retrospective analysis was done of the electronic medical records/discharge summaries of all adult patients admitted during a 1-year period from January to December 2006 with the diagnosis of primary headaches or secondary headaches not related to trauma, intracranial infection, inflammation, mass lesion, raised intracranial pressure or a serious systemic illness from the ED of the National University Hospital of Singapore. One thousand two hundred and seventy-six patients presented to the adult ED with primary headaches or secondary headaches not related to serious conditions in 2006. This represented 2% of the ED attendances in the period. Two hundred and twenty-three patients were admitted for various reasons--diagnostic uncertainty: 110 (49%), pain control: 73 (33%), social/patient request: 60 (27%) and others: 4 (2%). Sixty-six per cent of the patients had either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) head imaging. Eighteen patients (8%) were eventually diagnosed with a "potentially serious" diagnosis (intracranial haemorrhage, brain metastasis, stroke, meningitis, cerebral inflammation, cysticercosis, cervical osteomyelitis, hydrocephalus, seizure and malignant hypertension). Specific strategies addressing the various reasons for admission including physician training, use of evaluation protocols, imaging to exclude secondary pathology, a longer duration of treatment and evaluation in the ED, effective pain control and patient education may help reduce headache admissions.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolizing cytochrome P450s in freshly prepared uncultured rat blood lymphocytes. In an attempt to develop blood lymphocyte cytochrome P450 expression profile as a surrogate to monitor tissue enzyme, the present study aimed to identify the expression and regulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) responsive CYPs in freshly prepared rat blood lymphocytes. Semi-quantitative and RT-PCR studies demonstrated constitutive and inducible mRNA expression of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1 isoenzymes and the associated transcription factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR translocator (ARNT) in blood lymphocytes. Absolute quantification using RT-PCR revealed several fold lower basal expression of CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1 in lymphocytes when compared to the liver. However, significant increase in the mRNA expression of these isoenzymes as well as AhR and ARNT in lymphocytes following pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) have demonstrated that responsiveness is retained in the blood lymphocytes, though the magnitude of increase is several fold lower when compared to liver. This increase in the mRNA expression was found to be associated with an increase in the protein expression of CYP1A1 and 1A2 in blood lymphocytes. Further, CYPs expressed in blood lymphocytes catalysed the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoxy- and 7-methoxyresorufins (ER or MR), though the reactivity was several fold lower in lymphocytes when compared to the liver enzyme. Our data providing quantitative evidence for similarities in the regulation of PAH-regulated CYP in uncultured and non-mitogen stimulated blood lymphocytes with the liver enzyme has led us to suggest that blood lymphocytes could be used as a surrogate to monitor tissue expression of CYPs.

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry study on the distribution of alendronate sodium in drug-loaded ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The aim of this study was to investigate the drug distribution in ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) loaded with alendronate sodium (ALN), which was developed to treat particle-induced osteolysis after artificial joint replacements, since the drug distribution in UHMWPE could play a key role in controlling drug release. A mixture of UHMWPE powder and ALN was dried and hot pressed to prepare UHMWPE loaded with ALN (UHMWPE-ALN). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the hot press had no effect on the functional groups of ALN in UHMWPE-ALN. X-ray diffraction indicated that there was no phase change of the UHMWPE after hot pressing. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) spectra revealed the existence of characteristic elements and functional groups from ALN in UHMWPE-ALN, such as Na+, C3H8N+, PO3(-) and PO3H(-). In addition, SIMS images suggested that ALN did not agglomerate in UHMWPE-ALN. A small punch test and hardness test were carried out and the results indicated that ALN did not affect the mechanical properties at the present content level. The present study demonstrated that it was feasible to fabricate the un-agglomerated distributed drug in UHMWPE with good mechanical properties. This ALN loaded UHMWPE would have potential application in clinics.

Recurrent disease following liver transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Recurrence of the original disease following liver transplantation is not uncommon and can lead to graft failure. There are limited data on recurrent fatty liver disease following liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of recurrent fatty liver disease in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, its effect on survival, and whether there are any predictive factors for recurrence. We analyzed patients undergoing liver transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis from 1997 to 2008 at a single center. Patients undergoing transplantation for cholestatic disease, alcohol, hepatitis C, or cryptogenic cirrhosis were controls. Ninety-eight patients underwent transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Recurrent fatty liver disease was seen in 70%, 25% had recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and 18% had stage II/IV or greater fibrosis at a mean of 18 months. No patients with recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis developed graft failure or required retransplantation at a follow-up of 3 years. No recipient or donor factors were associated with disease recurrence, although patients with recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis had a higher incidence of diabetes, weight gain, and dyslipidemia at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. One-third of patients with recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis had normal liver enzymes at the time of diagnosis post-transplantation. In conclusion, recurrent fatty liver disease is common following liver transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis but does not lead to early allograft failure. Recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can occur despite normal liver enzymes, and features of metabolic syndrome are associated with disease recurrence.

A rare case of cerebral cortical dysplasia with arterial vascular dysplasia. Cortical dysplasias are rarely associated with vascular anomalies. They are usually associated with venous anomalies or in few cases with both arterial and venous anomalies. Twenty-six year old female presented with history of headache showed cortical dysplasia associated with pure arterial dysplasia in the absence of any associated venous anomaly. An abnormal arterial supply to or an abnormal venous drainage from the growing cortex may result in cortical rearrangements that eventually give rise to various neuronal migration anomalies.

Do smokers know what we're talking about? The construct validity of nicotine dependence questionnaire measures. Few studies have examined whether nicotine dependence self-report questionnaires can predict specific behaviors and symptoms at specific points in time. The present study used data from a randomized clinical trial (N = 608; M. E. Piper et al., 2007) to assess the construct validity of scales and items from 3 nicotine dependence measures: the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (T. F. Heatherton, L. T. Kozlowski, R. C. Frecker & K.-O. Fagerström, 1991), the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (S. Shiffman, A. J. Waters, & M. Hickcox, 2004), and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (M. E. Piper et al., 2004). Scales from these measures were used to predict participants' reports on real-time measures of withdrawal symptoms and smoking behavior and retrospective self-report questionnaires to assess convergent and discriminative validity. The nicotine dependence measures' scales and items generally predicted the real-time measures of similar constructs, but the percent of variance accounted for was low. The nicotine dependence measures did, however, show evidence of discriminative validity. Thus, this study provides modest support for the construct validity of these nicotine dependence scales.

Down-regulation of serum gonadotropins is as effective as estrogen replacement at improving menopause-associated cognitive deficits. Declining levels of estrogen in women result in increases in gonadotropins such as luteinizing hormone (LH) through loss of feedback inhibition. LH, like estrogen, is modulated by hormone replacement therapy. However, the role of post-menopausal gonadotropin increases on cognition has not been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that the down-regulation of ovariectomy-driven LH elevations using the gonadotropin releasing hormone super-analogue, leuprolide acetate, improves cognitive function in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests in the absence of E2. Furthermore, our data suggest that these effects are independent of the modulation of estrogen receptors alpha and beta, or activation of CYP19 and StAR, associated with the production of endogenous E2. Importantly, pathways associated with improved cognition such as CaMKII and GluR1-Ser831 are up-regulated by leuprolide treatment but not by chronic long-term E2 replacement suggesting independent cognition-modulating properties. Our findings suggest that down-regulation of gonadotropins is as effective as E2 in modulating cognition but likely acts through different molecular mechanisms. These findings provide a potential novel protective strategy to treat menopause/age-related cognitive decline and/or prevent the development of AD.

Pontocerebellar volume deficits and ataxia in alcoholic men and women: no evidence for "telescoping". Brain volume shrinkage is common in treatment-seeking patients with alcohol use disorders. Whether women are more vulnerable to brain dysmorphology than men despite lower alcohol consumption levels or shorter dependency ("telescoping effect") remains controversial and has not been considered with respect to infratentorial structures or their potential contribution to ataxia. The 200 participants included 64 men and 31 women with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition alcohol dependence and 105 controls. An infratentorial region (pons, cerebellar hemispheres, vermis (anterior, posterior, and inferior sectors), fissures, cisterns, fourth ventricle) was quantified with atlas-based parcellation. To enable comparison of men and women, regional tissue volumes were expressed as ratios of tissue in the volume. Participants also completed quantitative ataxia testing. Total infratentorial and vermian tissue ratios were significantly smaller in alcoholics than controls; alcoholic women did not show disproportionately greater volume deficits than alcoholic men. A re-analysis including alcoholic men and women matched in alcohol consumption, onset age, abstinence duration, and age revealed again that alcoholic women did not have disproportionately greater regional vermian volume deficits than alcoholic men. Alcoholic men and women were impaired in all measures of ataxia, which correlated with low infratentorial tissue ratios in men. Alcoholic men showed deficits of pontocerebellar volume ratios, yet alcoholic women did not display signs of "telescoping". Further, alcoholic men and women both showed signs of ataxia of gait and balance, related to affected pontocerebellar systems in the men but not the women, suggesting the need to consider other neural substrates for ataxia in women.

Cardiovascular and respiratory outcome of preconditioned rats submitted to chronic intermittent hypoxia. What is the central question of this study? What are the effects of hypoxic preconditioning upon the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to subsequent episodes of chronic intermittent hypoxia? What is the main finding and its importance? The cardiovascular and respiratory responses to a chronic intermittent hypoxia protocol were not altered by previous exposure to intermittent or sustained hypoxia. These findings show that preconditioning to hypoxia produced neither facilitation nor protection from the cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunctions in response to subsequent episodes of chronic intermittent hypoxia in juvenile rats. Rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) develop hypertension, which is associated with changes in the coupling of sympathetic and respiratory activities. In this study, we hypothesized that previous preconditioning to intermittent or sustained hypoxia would affect cardiovascular and respiratory changes produced by subsequent protocols of CIH. To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were preconditioned to either 10 days of CIH or 24 h of sustained hypoxia (SH). After the initial exposure to hypoxia, rats were maintained in normoxic conditions for 15 days before a new protocol of CIH during 10 days. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables obtained from groups of preconditioned rats were compared with a group of rats exposed to CIH for the first time and also to a group of rats maintained in normoxic conditions throughout the period of time of the respective preconditioning protocol. The data show that CIH produced a similar increase in arterial pressure and heart rate in both CIH and SH preconditioning protocols. Respiratory parameters during basal conditions were also not affected by preconditioning to either CIH or SH. We conclude that previous exposure to CIH or SH preconditioning does not facilitate or prevent the cardiovascular changes produced by CIH.

Catastrophic NAD+ depletion in activated T lymphocytes through Nampt inhibition reduces demyelination and disability in EAE. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) inhibitors such as FK866 are potent inhibitors of NAD(+) synthesis that show promise for the treatment of different forms of cancer. Based on Nampt upregulation in activated T lymphocytes and on preliminary reports of lymphopenia in FK866 treated patients, we have investigated FK866 for its capacity to interfere with T lymphocyte function and survival. Intracellular pyridine nucleotides, ATP, mitochondrial function, viability, proliferation, activation markers and cytokine secretion were assessed in resting and in activated human T lymphocytes. In addition, we used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model of T-cell mediated autoimmune disease to assess FK866 efficacy in vivo. We show that activated, but not resting, T lymphocytes undergo massive NAD(+) depletion upon FK866-mediated Nampt inhibition. As a consequence, impaired proliferation, reduced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, and finally autophagic cell demise result. We demonstrate that upregulation of the NAD(+)-degrading enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) by activated T cells enhances their susceptibility to NAD(+) depletion. In addition, we relate defective IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in response to FK866 to impaired Sirt6 activity. Finally, we show that FK866 strikingly reduces the neurological damage and the clinical manifestations of EAE. In conclusion, Nampt inhibitors (and possibly Sirt6 inhibitors) could be used to modulate T cell-mediated immune responses and thereby be beneficial in immune-mediated disorders.

Characteristics of gastroesophageal reflux and potential risk of gastric content aspiration in children with cystic fibrosis. Increased gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied the occurrence of acid, weakly acidic (WA), and weakly alkaline (WALK) reflux in children with CF and evaluated a possible surrogate marker for risk of gastric content aspiration. Twenty-four children with CF underwent impedance-pH monitoring for detection of acid (pH < 4), WA (pH 4-7), and WALK-GER (pH > or = 7). In 11 children, cough was objectively recorded with esophageal manometry and the symptom association probability was calculated to determine the reflux-cough relation. Presence of bile acids (BA) was measured in the saliva of 65 patients with CF and 23 healthy children, respectively. Sixteen of the 24 children had increased GER (esophageal acid exposure). The majority of reflux events were acidic in nature. WA reflux was less common and WALK reflux was rare. The sequence reflux-cough was found in 8 of the 11 children and 1 of 11 children had a positive symptom association probability for reflux-cough. The sequence cough-reflux was found in only 3 of the 11 children. Only a small fraction of the total esophageal acid and volume exposure was secondary to cough. Twenty-three of the 65 children with CF had BA in saliva compared with none of the healthy controls. Although WA-GER is uncommon, acid GER is prevalent in children with CF. It is a primary phenomenon and is not secondary to cough. One third of the children with CF have BA in saliva, which may indicate an increased risk for aspiration. However, the impact of salivary BA and potential aspiration on CF pulmonary disease needs further investigation.

[Chronopharmacology--importance of the biological clock in drug treatment]. Nearly all functions of living creatures including man exhibit significant daily variations. Today, internal biological clocks are traced down to the molecular level. In man pathophysiological events such as coronary infarction, angina pectoris, asthma attacks and gastro-intestinal ulcers do not occur at random but exhibit a clear-cut daily rhythmic pattern. It is, therefore, not surprising that the pharmacokinetics as well the effects and side-effects of drugs can vary significantly with the time of day as has been documented in many clinical studies. Thus, "time-of-day" has to be regarded as an important factor to evaluate drug efficacy and its therapeutic window.

Metabolic imprinting in obesity. Increasing evidence indicates that early metabolic programming contributes to escalating obesity rates in children and adults. Metabolic imprinting is involved in the establishment of set points for physiologic and metabolic responses in adulthood. Evidence from epidemiological studies and animal models indicates that maternal health and nutritional status during gestation and lactation have long-term effects on central and peripheral systems that regulate energy balance in the developing offspring. Perinatal nutrition also impacts susceptibility to developing metabolic disorders and plays a role in programming body weight set points. The states of maternal energy status and health that are implicated in predisposing offspring to increased risk of developing obesity include maternal overnutrition, diabetes, and undernutrition. This chapter discusses the evidence from epidemiologic studies and animal models that each of these states of maternal energy status results in metabolic imprinting of obesity in offspring. Also, the potential molecular mediators of metabolic imprinting of obesity by maternal energy status including glucose, insulin, leptin, inflammatory cytokines and epigenetic mechanisms are considered.

A sequence-based hybrid predictor for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins. Proteins are dynamic macromolecules which may undergo conformational transitions upon changes in environment. As it has been observed in laboratories that protein flexibility is correlated to essential biological functions, scientists have been designing various types of predictors for identifying structurally flexible regions in proteins. In this respect, there are two major categories of predictors. One category of predictors attempts to identify conformationally flexible regions through analysis of protein tertiary structures. Another category of predictors works completely based on analysis of the polypeptide sequences. As the availability of protein tertiary structures is generally limited, the design of predictors that work completely based on sequence information is crucial for advances of molecular biology research. In this article, we propose a novel approach to design a sequence-based predictor for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins. The novelty in the design stems from incorporating two classifiers based on two distinctive supervised learning algorithms that provide complementary prediction powers. Experimental results show that the overall performance delivered by the hybrid predictor proposed in this article is superior to the performance delivered by the existing predictors. Furthermore, the case study presented in this article demonstrates that the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of providing the biologists with valuable clues about the functional sites in a protein chain. The proposed hybrid predictor provides the users with two optional modes, namely, the high-sensitivity mode and the high-specificity mode. The experimental results with an independent testing data set show that the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of delivering sensitivity of 0.710 and specificity of 0.608 under the high-sensitivity mode, while delivering sensitivity of 0.451 and specificity of 0.787 under the high-specificity mode. Though experimental results show that the hybrid approach designed to exploit the complementary prediction powers of distinctive supervised learning algorithms works more effectively than conventional approaches, there exists a large room for further improvement with respect to the achieved performance. In this respect, it is of interest to investigate the effects of exploiting additional physiochemical properties that are related to conformational ambivalence. Furthermore, it is of interest to investigate the effects of incorporating lately-developed machine learning approaches, e.g. the random forest design and the multi-stage design. As conformational transition plays a key role in carrying out several essential types of biological functions, the design of more advanced predictors for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins deserves our continuous attention.

Crystal structure of the human monoacylglycerol lipase, a key actor in endocannabinoid signaling. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol plays a major role in endocannabinoid signaling, and is tightly regulated by the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Here we report the crystal structure of human MAGL. The protein crystallizes as a dimer, and despite structural homologies to haloperoxidases and esterases, it distinguishes itself by a wide and hydrophobic access to the catalytic site. An apolar helix covering the active site also gives structural insight into the amphitropic character of MAGL, and likely explains how MAGL interacts with membranes to recruit its substrate. Docking of 2-arachidonoylglycerol highlights a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic cavity that accommodate the lipid into the catalytic site. Moreover, we identified Cys201 as the crucial residue in MAGL inhibition by N-arachidonylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl-reactive compound. Beside the advance in the knowledge of endocannabinoids degradation routes, the structure of MAGL paves the way for future medicinal chemistry works aimed at the design of new drugs exploiting 2-arachidonoylglycerol transmission.

Synthesis of heparan sulfate with cyclophilin B-binding properties is determined by cell type-specific expression of sulfotransferases. Cyclophilin B (CyPB) induces migration and adhesion of T lymphocytes via a mechanism that requires interaction with 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate (HS). HS biosynthesis is a complex process with many sulfotransferases involved. N-Deacetylases/N-sulfotransferases are responsible for N-sulfation, which is essential for subsequent modification steps, whereas 3-O-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) catalyze the least abundant modification. These enzymes are represented by several isoforms, which differ in term of distribution pattern, suggesting their involvement in making tissue-specific HS. To elucidate how the specificity of CyPB binding is determined, we explored the relationships between the expression of these sulfotransferases and the generation of HS motifs with CyPB-binding properties. We demonstrated that high N-sulfate density and the presence of 2-O- and 3-O-sulfates determine binding of CyPB, as evidenced by competitive experiments with heparin derivatives, soluble HS, and anti-HS antibodies. We then showed that target cells, i.e. CD4+ lymphocyte subsets, monocytes/macrophages, and related cell lines, specifically expressed high levels of NDST2 and 3-OST3 isoforms. Silencing the expression of NDST1, NDST2, 2-OST, and 3-OST3 by RNA interference efficiently decreased binding and activity of CyPB, thus confirming their involvement in the biosynthesis of binding sequences for CyPB. Moreover, we demonstrated that NDST1 was able to partially sulfate exogenous substrate in the absence of NDST2 but not vice versa, suggesting that both isoenzymes do not have redundant activities but do have rather complementary activities in making N-sulfated sequences with CyPB-binding properties. Altogether, these results suggest a regulatory mechanism in which cell type-specific expression of certain HS sulfotransferases determines the specific binding of CyPB to target cells.

RIP1 Cleavage in the Kinase Domain Regulates TRAIL-Induced NF-κB Activation and Lymphoma Survival. Although TRAIL is considered a potential anticancer agent, it enhances tumor progression by activating NF-κB in apoptosis-resistant cells. Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) overexpression and caspase-8 activation have been implicated in TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that caspase-8-dependent cleavage of RIP1 in the kinase domain (KD) and intermediate domain (ID) determines the activation state of the NF-κB pathway in response to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment. In apoptosis-sensitive cells, caspase-8 cleaves RIP1 in the KD and ID immediately after the recruitment of RIP1 to the receptor complex, impairing IκB kinase (IKK) recruitment and NF-κB activation. In apoptosis-resistant cells, cFLIP restricts caspase-8 activity, resulting in limited RIP1 cleavage and generation of a KD-cleaved fragment capable of activating NF-κB but not apoptosis. Notably, depletion of the cytoplasmic pool of TRAF2 and cIAP1 in lymphomas by CD40 ligation inhibits basal RIP1 ubiquitination but does not prompt cell death, due to CD40L-induced cFLIP expression and limited RIP1 cleavage. Inhibition of RIP1 cleavage at the KD suppresses NF-κB activation and cell survival even in cFLIP-overexpressing lymphomas. Importantly, RIP1 is constitutively cleaved in human and mouse lymphomas, suggesting that cFLIP-mediated and caspase-8-dependent limited cleavage of RIP1 is a new layer of mechanism that promotes NF-κB activation and lymphoma survival.

Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of ovarian stromal hyperplasia and ovarian hyperthecosis. Ovarian stromal hyperplasia and ovarian hyperthecosis are non-neoplastic conditions of the ovary associated with clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism from ovarian production of male hormones. In this article, we present the first published cases of the magnetic resonance imaging appearance of these conditions, which may mimic that of ovarian neoplasm. In contrast to bilateral ovarian vein sampling, magnetic resonance imaging may provide a noninvasive means of suggesting a diagnosis of ovarian stromal hyperplasia/ovarian hyperthecosis when a hormone-secreting ovarian neoplasm is suspected clinically and thereby may assist in identifying patients who may be effectively treated nonsurgically with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone therapy.

[Body mass index growth curves for Chinese children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years]. To construct the body mass index (BMI) reference data and curves for Chinese children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age. Data from two national representative cross-sectional surveys which were The National Growth Survey of Children under 7 years in the Nine Cities of China in 2005 and The Physical Fitness and Health Surveillance of Chinese School Students in 2005. Height (length was measured for children under 3 years) and weight data of 93,702 urban healthy children from nine cities/provinces used to calculate the BMI. The LMS method was used to smooth the BMI, with estimates of L, M, and S parameters, values of percentile and Z-score curves which were required were calculated, and then standardized growth charts were generated. Adult cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 18 years was used to study the cut-offs for children 2 to 18 years of age. The smoothed percentiles and Z-scores reference data and curves of BMI-for-age for boys and girls aged 0-18 years were made out respectively. BMI cut-off values for overweight and obesity for children from 2 to 18 years of age were also defined. At 18 years, the BMI values are equivalent to the overweight cut-off (> or =24 kg/m2) and obesity cut-off (> or =28 kg/m2) for Chinese adults. Comparison with the reference of the WHO and 2000 CDC for the United States, there were some difference among them, at the 97th percentile curve there was a big difference between Chinese and U. S. adolescents. On the whole, the China BMI curve for boys was higher than the new WHO curve and lower than 2000 CDC at 97 percentile curve, but the China BMI curve for girls was lowest among the three curves. There was also significant difference between China and Japan BMI values at 97 percentile curve. BMI growth curves are very useful in child growth monitoring and nutritional surveillance, discovering overweight and obesity. The BMI growth charts are recommended for use in pediatric clinic and public health service.

[Metabonomic variation of esophageal cancer within different ethnic groups in Xinjiang, China]. To investigate the metabonomic variation between patients with esophageal cancer (EC) and healthy controls, and to analyze the variation between patients with EC. H-MR and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed on 108 plasma specimens from EC patients and 50 health controls, and the metabonomic variation between patients with EC and healthy controls analyzed. OPLS-DA analysis might correctly separate all plasma specimens from health controls and patients with EC, leucine (0.0043 +/- 0.0006, 0.0040 +/- 0.0006), alanine (0.0039 +/- 0.0007, 0.0033 +/- 0.0006), isoleucine (0.0067 +/- 0.0010, 0.0063 +/- 0.0009), valine (0.0037 +/- 0.0005, 0.0035 +/- 0.0006), glycoprotein (0.0123 +/- 0.0043, 0.0102 +/- 0.0022), lactate (0.0342 +/- 0.0113, 0.0258 +/- 0.0085), acetone (0.0027 +/- 0.0023, 0.0017 +/- 0.0008), acetate (0.0007 +/- 0.0001, 0.0006 +/- 0.0001), choline (0.0035 +/- 0.0006, 0.0029 +/- 0.0007), isobutyrate (0.0020 +/- 0.0004, 0.0018 +/- 0.0003), unsaturated lipid (0.0072 +/- 0.0013, 0.0059 +/- 0.0018), VLDL (0.1209 +/- 0.0589, 0.0879 +/- 0.0269), LDL (0.0885 +/- 0.0328, 0.0785 +/- 0.0288), 1-methylhistidine (0.0005 +/- 0.0001, 0.0004 +/- 0.0005) decreased in EC patient' s plasma with statistical significance (r total > 0.27, P < 0.05), dimethylamine (0.0004 +/- 0.0001, 0.0005 +/- 0.0001), alpha-glucose (0.0079 +/- 0.0013, 0.0081 +/- 0.0016), 3-glucose (0.0139 +/- 0.0024, 0.0142 +/- 0.0029), citric acid (0.0044 +/- 0.0008, 0.0106 +/- 0.0058) increase in the EC patient's plasma (r total < -0.27, P < 0.05). There were clear variation between Han and Kazak patients, alanine (0.0031 +/- 0.0005,0.0029 +/- 0.0004), glutamine (0.0010 +/- 0.0001, 0.0009 +/- 0.0001), tyrosine (0.0009 +/- 0.0001, 0.0008 +/- 0.0001), 1-methylhistidine (0.0005 +/- 0.0001, 0.0004 +/- 0.0001) increased in the Han patients (r > 0.35, P> 0.05), carnitine (0.0028 +/- 0.0006) was higher in Kazak patients than in Han patients (0.0025 +/- 0.0004), which had statistical significance (r = - 0.40, P < 0.05). Unsaturated lipid (0.0059 +/- 0.0018, 0.0047 +/- 0.0011), isoleucine (0.0062 +/- 0.0011, 0.0058 +/- 0.0007), alanine (0. 0032 +/- 0.0007, 0.0028 +/- 0.0004), glycoprotein (0.0096 +/- 0.0019, 0.0086 +/- 0.0011), glutamine (0.0011 +/- 0.0001, 0.0009 +/- 0.0001), tyrosine (0.0009 +/- 0.0001, 0.0008 +/- 0.0001), 1-methylhistidine (0.0005 +/- 0.0001, 0.0004 +/- 0.0001) were increased in Uygur patients as compared with Kazak patients, having statistical significance (r > 0.33, P < 0.05), carnitine (0.0027 +/- 0.0005) was higher in Kazak patients than in Uygur patients (0.0025 +/- 0.0004) (r = - 0.36, P < 0.05). The results indicate that 1H-MR spectra of plasma analyzed by OPLS-DA statistical methods might completely separate the EC patients from health controls. The metabonomic approach should be helpful in screening of EC patients.

Expedited versus conservative approaches for vaginal delivery in breech presentation. In a vaginal breech birth there may be benefit from rapid delivery of the baby to prevent progressive acidosis. However, this needs to be weighed against the potential trauma of a quick delivery. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of expedited vaginal delivery (breech delivery from umbilicus to delivery of the head within one contraction) on perinatal outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised trials of expedited vaginal breech delivery compared with delivery not routinely expedited in women undergoing vaginal breech delivery. Two review authors independently assessed the one identified trial for inclusion.If studies are included in future updates, two review authors will assess risk of bias, extract data and check data for accuracy. No studies were included. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effects of expedited vaginal breech delivery.


Intraflagellar transport: it's not just for cilia anymore.

Electrode design for high frequency block: effect of bipolar separation on block thresholds and the onset response. The delivery of high frequency alternating currents (HFAC) to peripheral nerves has been shown to produce a rapid and reversible nerve conduction block at the site of the electrode, and holds therapeutic promise for diseases associated with undesired or pathological neural activity. It has been known since 1939 that the configuration of an electrode used for nerve block can impact the quality of the block, but to date no formal study of the impact of electrode design on high frequency nerve block has been performed. Using a mammalian small animal model, it is demonstrated that the contact separation distance for a bipolar nerve cuff electrode can impact two important factors related to high frequency nerve block: the amplitude of HFAC required to block the nerve (block threshold), and the degree to which the transient "onset response" which always occurs when HFAC is first applied to peripheral nerves, is present. This study suggests that a bipolar electrode with a separation distance of 1.0 mm minimizes current delivery while producing high frequency block with a minimal onset response in the rat sciatic nerve.

Emission pattern of semi-volatile organic compounds from recycled styrenic polymers using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The emission of low molecular weight compounds from recycled high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) has been investigated using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Four released target analytes (styrene, benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and 2-phenylpropanal) were selected for the optimisation of the HS-SPME sampling procedure, by analysing operating parameters such as type of SPME fibre (polarity and operating mechanism), particle size, extraction temperature and time. 26 different compounds were identified to be released at different temperatures from recycled HIPS, including residues of polymerisation, oxidated derivates of styrene, and additives. The type of SPME fibre employed in the sampling procedure affected the detection of emitted components. An adsorptive fibre such as carbowax/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS fibre) offered good selectivity for both non-polar and polar volatile compounds at lower temperatures; higher temperatures result in interferences from less-volatile released compounds. An absorptive fibre as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre is suitable for the detection of less-volatile non-polar molecules at higher temperatures. The nature and relative amount of the emitted compounds increased with higher exposure temperature and smaller polymeric particle size. HS-SPME proves to be a suitable technique for screening the emission of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) from polymeric materials; reliable quantification of the content of target analytes in recycled HIPS is however difficult due to the complex mass-transfer processes involved, matrix effects, and the difficulties in equilibrating the analytical system.

A prospective controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing in a men's jail. Approximately 10 million Americans enter jails annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends routine opt-out HIV testing in these settings. The logistics for performing routine opt-out HIV testing within jails, however, remain controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal time to routinely HIV test newly incarcerated jail detainees using an opt-out strategy. This prospective, controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing was conducted among 298 newly incarcerated male inmates in an urban men's jail in New Haven, Connecticut. 298 sequential entrants to the men's jail over a three week period in March and April 2008 were assigned to be offered routine opt-out HIV testing at one of three points after incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 103), early (next day, n = 98), or delayed (7 days, n = 97). The primary outcome was the proportion of men in each group consenting to testing. Routine opt-out HIV testing was significantly higher for the early (53%: AOR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.7) and immediate (45%: AOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.0) testing groups compared to the delayed (33%) testing group. The immediate and early testing groups, however, did not significantly differ (p = 0.67). In multivariate analyses, factors significantly associated with routine opt-out HIV testing were assignment to the 'early' testing group (p = 0.0003) and low (bond > or = $5,000, immigration or federal charges or pre-sentencing > 30 days) likelihood of early release (p = 0.04). Two subjects received preliminary positive results and one of them was subsequently confirmed HIV seropositive. In this men's jail where attrition was high, routine opt-out HIV testing was not only feasible, but resulted in the highest rates of HIV testing when performed within 24 hours of incarceration.

Grassroots coalition building: lessons from the field. In an era of major health care reform, nursing professionals will best impact both the politics surrounding reform as well as related health policy through well-established and effective collaborative groups. Whether the work is taking place at the local, state, or national levels, successful and powerful coalitions are the result of skill and finesse-not luck-and therefore must be built upon connecting with the right people, communicating effectively, understanding political challenges, and navigating them skillfully. The authors offer 10 success strategies for building successful coalitions based on lessons learned over a decade of involvement in grassroots nursing workforce initiatives.


Predictors of the residual disease of high-grade lesions and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix following conization.

A single pretreatment by zoledronic acid converts metastases from osteolytic to osteoblastic in the rat. Bone metastases are severe complications of cancers associated with increased morbidity, pain, risk fracture, and reduced life span for patients. Bisphosphonates emerged as a relief treatment in bone metastases. A single dose of zoledronic acid (78 microg/kg) was injected into six Copenhagen rats 4 days before receiving an intraosseous inoculation of metastatic anaplastic tumor of lymph node and lung cell (MLL) prostate cancer cells. Rat femurs were analyzed for changes by microCT and histomorphometry; trabecular volume, trabecular characteristics, osteoid parameters, osteoblastic surfaces, and osteoclast number were measured. Values were compared to a group of SHAM animals, a group of SHAM animals having received zoledronic acid and animals inoculated with MLL cells. All rats were euthanized after 1 month. MLL cells induced osteolysis in the metaphysis with extension of the tumor to soft tissues through cortical perforations. Zoledronic acid induced a marked osteosclerosis in the primary spongiosa in both SHAM and rats inoculated with MLL. Osteosclerosis was obtained in the secondary spongiosa of MLL rats. The bisphosphonate preserved cortical integrity in all animals, and no extension to soft tissues was observed in most animals. The number of osteoclasts was elevated, indicating that there was no apoptosis of osteoclasts but they became inactive. Osteosclerosis was associated with increased osteoblastic surfaces. A single zoledronic acid injection turned osteolytic metastases into osteosclerotic and preserved cortical integrity.

Diagnosis and management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, part 2: implementation of multidisciplinary care. Optimum management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) requires a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on anticipatory and preventive measures as well as active interventions to address the primary and secondary aspects of the disorder. Implementing comprehensive management strategies can favourably alter the natural history of the disease and improve function, quality of life, and longevity. Standardised care can also facilitate planning for multicentre trials and help with the identification of areas in which care can be improved. Here, we present a comprehensive set of DMD care recommendations for management of rehabilitation, orthopaedic, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastroenterology/nutrition, and pain issues, as well as general surgical and emergency-room precautions. Together with part 1 of this Review, which focuses on diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and psychosocial care, these recommendations allow diagnosis and management to occur in a coordinated multidisciplinary fashion.


The risk of psychopathology in children with craniosynostosis.

A follow up audit of pharyngeal pouch surgery using endoscopic stapling. The aim of this study is to assess patient satisfaction, success at controlling symptoms and conversion rates to open surgery in patients undergoing pharyngeal pouch surgery using an endoscopic stapler in a second cycle of audit. The design consisted of a review of patient records augmented by an electronic search of operation codes in the hospitals' theatre records. The setting was in Worcester Royal Hospital, BUPA Southbank Hospital and Hereford Hospital, UK. Participants include all patients with pharyngeal pouches undergoing endoscopic pharyngeal pouch repair by the senior author between July 2002 and July 2007. The total number of participants was 31. All patients were undergoing treatment for the first time. The main outcome measures were pre- and postoperative symptom prevalence, conversion rates to open surgery, patient satisfaction. Endoscopic pharyngeal pouch surgery was successful in the vast majority of cases, with 97% of patients being satisfied with the result. The conversion rate to open surgery was 9.7%. These figures are improved from the last round of audit. In conclusion, endoscopic surgery to treat pharyngeal pouches is safe, effective and patient selection is improving. A modified method of endoscopy using a Negus scope rather than a Baldwin scope has allowed more patients to be treated via endoscopic methods. Open surgery is still required in some patients.

Work-life conflict and associations with work- and nonwork-related factors and with physical and mental health outcomes: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine work- and nonwork- related factors and physical and mental health outcomes associated with combined time- and strain-based work-life conflict (WLC) among adult employees living and working in Switzerland as well as possible gender differences in this regard. The data used for the study were taken from wave 6 of the nationally representative Swiss Household Panel (SHP) collected in 2004. The analysis was restricted to 4'371 employees aged 20 to 64 years. Trivariate crosstabulations and multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by gender were performed in order to calculate gender-specific prevalence rates (%), beta coefficients (beta) and crude as well as multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR) as measures of association. Every eighth person (12.5%) within the study population has a high or very high WLC score. Prevalence rates are clearly above average in men and women with higher education, in executive positions or managerial functions, in full-time jobs, with variable work schedules, regular overtime, long commuting time to work and job insecurity. Working overtime regularly, having variable work schedules and being in a management position are most strongly associated with WLC in men, whereas in women the level of employment is the strongest explanatory variable by far, followed by variable work schedules and high job status (managerial position). In both men and women, WLC is associated with several physical and mental health problems. Employees with high or very high WLC show a comparatively high relative risk of self-reported poor health, anxiety and depression, lack of energy and optimism, serious backache, headaches, sleep disorders and fatigue. While overall prevalence rate of (very) high WLC is higher in men than in women, associations between degrees of WLC and most health outcomes are stronger in women than in men. This important issue which up to now has been largely neglected in public health research needs to be addressed in future public health research and, if the findings are confirmed by subsequent (longitudinal) studies, to be considered in workplace health promotion and interventions in Switzerland as elsewhere.

[Surgical treatment of hyperparathyroidism]. Hyperparathyroidism (HPT), the result of excessive secretion of the parathormone, is one of the most common endocrine disorders. In most forms of HPT, surgical parathyroidectomy is the best choice. This paper aims to examine patients with hyperparathyroidism operated in First Surgical Unit Iaşi, in terms of indications, surgical technique and postoperative results. We performed a retrospective study, in First Surgical Unit Iaşi, during 2000-2008. Clinical, laboratory, intraoperative and histopathological data were included in a MS Access Office XP database. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS ver. 15.0 for Windows (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago, Ilinois). There were examined 34 patients with HPT: 32 cases were primary HPT (94.12%), and two cases with secondary HPT (patients with renal failure). The men/women ratio was 6/28 and mean age was 50.09 +/- 2.23 years old. Clinical presentation was variable: the dominant symptoms were osteoarticular (67.6%) followed by neuropsychological (64.7%), digestive (17.6%) and renal (11.8%). Associated diseases were recorded at 47.06% of patients: arterial hypertension--32.4%, coronary heart disease--23.5%, heart rhythm disorders--17.6%, diabetes--11.8%, biliary lithiasis--5.9%, renal lithiasis--8.8% and thyroid hypertrophy--55.9%. In 8 cases, primary hyperparathyroidism was associated with other diseases of the endocrine glands: 4 cases with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 1; a patient with von Recklinghausen disease; a patient with associated hypothyroidism and diabetes; two cases that with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Positive diagnosis was supported by determining serum calcium, phosphorus and serum concentration of the parathormone (PTH). All patients were evaluated by ultrasound exam; the sensitivity of the investigation was 88.23%. 99Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy was performed in 32.35% of patients with a sensitivity of 72.72%. Parathyroidectomy was performed by Kocher's incision in 88.23% and minimally-invasive open approach in 11.76%. The following types of interventions have been performed: tumor resections (73.53%), subtotal parathyroidectomies (17.6%), total parathyroidectomies (8.82%). In patients with associated thyroid disease total thyroidectomies (26.5%) and subtotal thyroidectomies were done (11.8%). The postoperative morbidity rate was 2.9% (transient hypocalcemia). Histopathological examination revealed the presence of parathyroidian adenoma in 67.6% of patients (N=23), parathyroidian hyperplasia in 26.5% (N=9) and parathyroidian carcinoma in the others 5.9% (N=2). The diagnosis of HPT involves positive determination of calcium and PTH. The most useful imaging techniques, are 99Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy and ultrasonography, which locates in most cases, the parathyroid pathological glands. Surgical treatment is the only curative treatment of HPT, with medical treatment only role in preoperative preparation. The precise site of the parathyroidian lesion facilitates minimally-invasive approach. The postoperative follow-up is mandatory because of the increased potential for recurrence and for diagnosis of other endocrine tumors (in patients with MEN).

Central nervous system blastomycosis in a dog. An adult golden retriever was presented for progressive neurologic dysfunction. Clinical examination suggested brainstem disease. Blastomycosis was diagnosed based on fine-needle aspiration cytology of a normal sized lymph node and a positive blastomycosis urine antigen test. Systemic blastomycosis with neurologic involvement was confirmed at necropsy.


Defining the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in cancer biology and therapeutics.

Intraocular pressure changes following Descemet's stripping with endothelial keratoplasty. To evaluate the postoperative changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) following Descemet's stripping with endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK). A retrospective chart review of 45 eyes that underwent DSEK for the treatment of corneal edema induced by aphakic or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (ABK/PBK) and Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. A mean baseline IOP was obtained at three different preoperative visits using Tono-Pen XL tonometer. This baseline pressure was compared to IOPs obtained at postoperative months 1, 3, 6 and 12. Intraocular pressure increased from a mean preoperative value of 15.6 +/- 4.2 mmHg to 15.9 +/- 5.8 mmHg in the first postoperative month; 17.0 +/- 5.7 mmHg at 3 months; 18.1 +/- 6.2 mmHg at 6 months and 16.8 +/- 4.7 mmHg at 1 year. These pressure differences were considered statistically significant, p = 0.0074 (repeated measures ANOVA). Eyes diagnosed with ABK/PBK (n = 20) showed a significant rise in IOP only noted after the 3(rd) month that peaked at 6 months, p = 0.0001 (repeated measures ANOVA). A subgroup of patients with a diagnosis of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (n = 25), showed no statistically significant changes in IOP at 1 year follow-up; p = 0.9103 (repeated measures ANOVA). In a subgroup of eyes with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (n = 13), a statistically significant increase in IOP was noted after 1 year of follow-up. Mean IOP raised from a preoperative mean value of 16.0 +/- 3.7 mHg to 19.0 +/- 5.3 mmHg at 1 year; p = 0.0074 (repeated measures ANOVA). DSEK induced statistically significant IOP increases in the early postoperative period with a tendency to higher pressures after the 3(rd) month of follow-up. Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy did not show a statistically significant increase in IOP compared to a baseline mean preoperative value. The difference between statistically significant and clinically significant IOP increase is yet to be established.


Neonatal adiposity increases the risk of atopic dermatitis during the first year of life.

Two-photon permeabilization and calcium measurements in cellular organelles. Inositol trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose, main intracellular Ca(2+) messengers, induce release from the intracellular Ca(2+) stores via inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, respectively. Recently, studies using novel messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) releasing Ca(2+) from calcium stores in organelles other than endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have been conducted. However, technical difficulties of Ca(2+) measurements in relatively small Ca(2+) stores prompted us to develop a new, more sensitive, and less damaging two-photon permeabilization technique. Applied to pancreatic acinar cells, this technique allowed us to show that all three messengers - IP(3), cADPR, and NAADP - release Ca(2+) from two intracellular stores: the endoplasmic reticulum and an acidic store in the granular region. This chapter describes a detailed procedure of using this technique with pancreatic acinar cells.


Overexpression of a wheat jasmonate-regulated lectin increases pathogen resistance.

Glucose enhancement of memory is modulated by trait anxiety in healthy adolescent males. Glucose administration is associated with memory enhancement in healthy young individuals under conditions of divided attention at encoding. While the specific neurocognitive mechanisms underlying this 'glucose memory facilitation effect' are currently uncertain, it is thought that individual differences in glucoregulatory efficiency may alter an individual's sensitivity to the glucose memory facilitation effect. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function (itself a modulator of glucoregulatory efficiency), baseline self-reported stress and trait anxiety influence the glucose memory facilitation effect. Adolescent males (age range = 14-17 years) were administered glucose and placebo prior to completing a verbal episodic memory task on two separate testing days in a counter-balanced, within-subjects design. Glucose ingestion improved verbal episodic memory performance when memory recall was tested (i) within an hour of glucose ingestion and encoding, and (ii) one week subsequent to glucose ingestion and encoding. Basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function did not appear to influence the glucose memory facilitation effect; however, glucose ingestion only improved memory in participants reporting relatively higher trait anxiety. These findings suggest that the glucose memory facilitation effect may be mediated by biological mechanisms associated with trait anxiety.

Hsp70 and CHIP selectively mediate ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha but Not HIF-2alpha. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. HIF-alpha subunits are stabilized under conditions of acute hypoxia. However, prolonged hypoxia leads to decay of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha protein levels by unknown mechanisms. Here, we identify Hsp70 and CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) as HIF-1alpha-interacting proteins. Hsp70, through recruiting the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha, thereby inhibiting HIF-1-dependent gene expression. Disruption of Hsp70-CHIP interaction blocks HIF-1alpha degradation mediated by Hsp70 and CHIP. Inhibition of Hsp70 or CHIP synthesis by RNA interference increases protein levels of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha and attenuates the decay of HIF-1alpha levels during prolonged hypoxia. Thus, Hsp70- and CHIP-dependent ubiquitination represents a molecular mechanism by which prolonged hypoxia selectively reduces the levels of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha protein.

Diagrammatic analysis of the respiratory action of the diaphragm.

Telemedical assistance for in-flight emergencies on intercontinental commercial aircraft. We have conducted a three-year prospective study of medical incidents on a commercial airline. A telemedicine service was available via an on-board satellite phone. During the study period there were 3364 medical incidents. The most common incident was collapse (n = 2310, 57%). Telemedicine was used in 323 of the cases (9%). Neurological patients, mostly stroke and seizures, excluding psychiatric diseases, were seen in 27% of the telemedicine cases (n = 83). Most of the cases involved middle-aged people, not the elderly. The group of patients that needed diversion (n = 27) was compared to the cases staying on board (n = 275). None of the patients in the non-diversion group deteriorated. All unstable patients forced a diversion. Doctors on board used the service in more severe cases, whereas laymen used the service in less severe cases. The results of the present study demonstrate the advantage of using simple teleconsultation in cases of medical emergency on board an aircraft.

The impact of hematocrit drop on long-term survival after cardiac catheterization: insights from the Dartmouth Dynamic Registry. The long-term prognostic implication of post-procedural hematocrit drops in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization outside the clinical trial setting is not well defined. Data was prospectively collected from 12,661 patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization between July 1998 and July 2006. Patients were divided into three cohorts based upon the degree of hematocrit change: drop greater than 6, drop between 3 and 6, and drop less than 3. In-hospital major adverse events, 30-day mortality, and long-term all-cause mortality were recorded. Patients with larger reductions in hematocrit were more likely to be older, female, and have a higher baseline hematocrit, present with acute myocardial infarction, develop cardiogenic shock, require emergent catheterization, develop retroperitoneal bleeds and large hematomas, receive transfusions, have longer index hospitalizations, develop subacute stent thrombosis, and have higher 30-day and long-term mortality. An increase in long-term mortality was observed with progressive hematocrit drop. This finding is largely driven by early (30 day) mortality, as trends were no longer significant after rezeroing mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were identified as independent predictors of near and long-term mortality. Periprocedural bleeding, defined by hematocrit drop, is associated with increased near-term and long-term mortality in patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization procedures. Long-term mortality is largely driven by up front 30-day mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent predictor for near-term mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were independent predictors for near and long-term mortality.

Harms associated with psychoactive substances: findings of the UK National Drug Survey. Nutt and colleagues' 'rational' scale to assess the harms of commonly used drugs was based on ratings by a panel of experts. This survey aimed to assess drug users' views of the harms of drugs using the same scale. As users' drug choices are not solely based on harms, we additionally assessed perceived benefits. The survey was hosted at http://www.nationaldrugsurvey.org. UK residents reported their experience of 20 commonly used substances; those with direct experience of a substance rated its physical, dependence-related and social harms as well as benefits. A total of 1501 users completed the survey. There was no correlation between the classification of the 20 drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act and ranking of harms by users. Despite being unclassified substances, alcohol, solvents and tobacco were rated within the top ten most harmful drugs. There was a remarkably high correlation (r = 0.896) overall between rankings by users' and by experts. Ecstasy, cannabis and LSD were ranked highest by users on both acute and chronic benefits. These findings imply that users are relatively well informed about the harms associated with the drugs they use. They also suggest that the current UK legal classification system is not acting to inform users of the harms of psychoactive substances.

[The diagnostic value of intraductal ultrasonography for complex biliary and pancreatic diseases]. To assess the diagnostic value of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS)when the findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were not clearly demonstrated. One hundred and thirty-one cases of suspected biliary and pancreatic diseases were enrolled. IDUS was performed after unsatisfactory ERCP. Then the outcomes were correlated with the pathological results. Sixty-six benign and 58 malignant cases were clarified with additional IDUS after ERCP according to definite diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic accuracy was 94.3% and 95.1%; the sensitivity and specificity were 95.4% and 100%, 80.0% and 76.9%, respectively. Moreover, it could distinguish benign tissues from malignant ones successfully; the sensitivity and specificity were 78.7% and 88.6%. IDUS after ERCP yields higher diagnostic accuracy for complex biliary and pancreatic diseases and it is also more dependable in differentiating benign tissues from malignant ones than ERCP alone.

Rheostatic control of tryptic digestion in a microscale fluidic system. Integrated fluidic systems that unite bottom-up and top-down proteomic approaches have the potential to deliver complete protein characterization. To circumvent fraction collection, as is conducted in current blended approaches, a technique to regulate digestion efficiency in a flow-through system is required. The present study examined the concept of regulating tryptic digestion in an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER), incorporating mixed solvent systems for digestion acceleration. Using ovalbumin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin as protein standards, we demonstrate that tryptic digestion can be efficiently regulated between complete digestion and no digestion extremes by oscillating between 45 and 0% acetonitrile in the fluid stream. Solvent composition was tuned using programmable solvent waveforms in a closed system consisting of the IMER, a sample delivery stream, a dual gradient pumping system and a mass spectrometer. Operation in this rheostatic digestion mode provides access to novel peptide mass maps (due to substrate unfolding hysteresis) as well as the intact protein, in a reproducible and stable fashion. Although cycle times were on the order of 90 s for testing purposes, we show that regulated digestion is sufficiently rapid to be limited by solvent switching efficiency and kinetics of substrate unfolding/folding. Thus, regulated digestion should be useful in blending bottom-up and top-down proteomics in a single closed fluidic system.

Hyperacute ischemic stroke management: reperfusion and evolving therapies. Management of acute ischemic stroke patients is organized around several priorities aimed at ensuring optimal patient outcomes, the first of which is reperfusion therapy, followed by determination of pathogenic mechanism by provision of a comprehensive workup to determine probable cause of the ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, for the purpose of providing appropriate prophylaxis for subsequent events. Provision of secondary prevention measures along with therapies that prevent complications associated with neurologic disability, and evaluation for the most appropriate level of rehabilitation services are the final priorities during acute hospitalization. This article provides an overview of reperfusion therapies and emerging hemodynamic treatments for hyperacute ischemic strokes. Gaps in the scientific evidence that are driving current blood flow augmentation research are identified.

Case report: Fibroxanthoma: a complication of a biodegradable screw. Biodegradable interference screws in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have gained popularity because of their similar or superior fixation strength in comparison to metallic interference screws and because they do not cause imaging artifacts and do not need to be removed. We report the case of a 23-year-old man who presented with slowly progressive firm swelling of 2 months' duration at the site of the tibial tunnel 3 years after ACL reconstruction using a biodegradable interference screw. After curettage and débridement, the material was sent for histopathologic examination, which was reported as a fibroxanthoma. Reported complications are osteolysis around the screw, allergic reaction, sterile abscess formation, ganglion cyst formation, and intraarticular migration. A fibroxanthoma consists of fibroblasts and mononuclear or multinucleated cells with large lipid-filled histiocytes (foam cells). The cells are negative for S-100 and keratin and positive for anti-human macrophage marker HAM-56. Use of biodegradable screws is associated with high healing rates and low complication rates; however, awareness of their potential complications may help in early recognition and prevention of associated morbidity.

Antimicrobial lipids from the hemolymph of brachyuran crabs. The potential of marine crabs as a source of biologically active products is largely unexplored. In the present study, antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph (plasma) and hemocytes (plasma cells) of six brachyuran crabs was investigated against 16 pathogenic strains. Among the 16 strains tested maximum zone of inhibition was recorded in the hemolymph of Hyas araneus against Shigella flexineri. Interestingly Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were susceptible to all the hemolymph and hemocytes samples. Likewise, the highest zone of inhibition was exhibited by both hemolymph and hemocytes samples against Vibrio cholerae. On the basis of TLC, 1HNMR, and 13CNMR it may be concluded that the antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph extract is due to the presence of lipids. This observation is further supported by the ESI-MS of the methanolic extract of hemolymph of H. araneus. ESI-MS shows cluster of peaks in the region m/z 445 to m/z 491 due to lysoglycerolipids/glycerides and cluster of signals between m/z 216 and 246, due to fatty acids/esters present in the sample.

Anomalous neural circuit function in schizophrenia during a virtual Morris water task. Previous studies have reported learning and navigation impairments in schizophrenia patients during virtual reality allocentric learning tasks. The neural bases of these deficits have not been explored using functional MRI despite well-explored anatomic characterization of these paradigms in non-human animals. Our objective was to characterize the differential distributed neural circuits involved in virtual Morris water task performance using independent component analysis (ICA) in schizophrenia patients and controls. Additionally, we present behavioral data in order to derive relationships between brain function and performance, and we have included a general linear model-based analysis in order to exemplify the incremental and differential results afforded by ICA. Thirty-four individuals with schizophrenia and twenty-eight healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning during a block design virtual Morris water task using hidden and visible platform conditions. Independent components analysis was used to deconstruct neural contributions to hidden and visible platform conditions for patients and controls. We also examined performance variables, voxel-based morphometry and hippocampal subparcellation, and regional BOLD signal variation. Independent component analysis identified five neural circuits. Mesial temporal lobe regions, including the hippocampus, were consistently task-related across conditions and groups. Frontal, striatal, and parietal circuits were recruited preferentially during the visible condition for patients, while frontal and temporal lobe regions were more saliently recruited by controls during the hidden platform condition. Gray matter concentrations and BOLD signal in hippocampal subregions were associated with task performance in controls but not patients. Patients exhibited impaired performance on the hidden and visible conditions of the task, related to negative symptom severity. While controls showed coupling between neural circuits, regional neuroanatomy, and behavior, patients activated different task-related neural circuits, not associated with appropriate regional neuroanatomy. GLM analysis elucidated several comparable regions, with the exception of the hippocampus. Inefficient allocentric learning and memory in patients may be related to an inability to recruit appropriate task-dependent neural circuits.

Inducing active and passive immunity in sheep to paralysis caused by Dermacentor andersoni. Arcott sheep were evaluated as a model for studying active and passive immunity to tick paralysis caused by Dermacentor andersoni (Stiles). The incidence of tick paralysis in sheep increased from 0 at doses < or = 0.33 ticks per kg to 100% at > or = 0.8 ticks per kg. The dose required for 50% paralysis was 0.42 ticks per kg. Expressing dose as a ratio of initial ticks per unit body weight removed differences in response due to sheep weight. The interval from infestation to paralysis decreased from >12 d at 0.4 ticks per kg to <8 d at 1.3 ticks per kg. After exposure to a paralyzing doses of ticks, the incidence of paralysis varied among sheep that were naive (six of six, 100% paralysis), previously paralyzed (zero of six, 0% paralysis), and passively immunized with an intravenous treatment of 300 ml of serum from immune cattle (two of six, 33% paralysis). Sheep that were actively immunized by previous exposure had antibodies to a greater number of tick salivary antigens compared with those that were not immune. Antibodies to a 43.3-kDa antigen had 72% agreement with immunity to paralysis, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.60 and 0.88, respectively. In conclusion, previously paralyzed sheep had developed antibodies against D. andersoni and were not susceptible to subsequent paralysis, whereas passive immunization conferred protection against paralysis in only some sheep.

Time for new indications for statins?

Chemical and Genetic Diversity of Ligularia hodgsonii in China. Ligularia hodgsonii was found to be diverse in China. Furanoeremophilanes were isolated from samples collected in Yunnan Province, while such compounds were absent from samples from Sichuan, Gansu, and Chongqing. DNA sequencing showed that the Yunnan samples were also genetically distinct. γ-Humulene and a new bisabolane sesquiterpene were isolated.

[Contasure Needleless: a single incision tot for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence]. The aim of this study is to describe the surgical technique, and assess the complications and middle-term results of the Contasure Needleless (Neomedic International), a single incision TOT sling for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence. The main concept of this device is that it is not a mini-sling, it has 138% more surface area. We are analyzing the results of a minimally invasive solution that is a TOT like sling with the same known benefits of a TOT and the advantages of a single incision technique. The surface area to support the urethra of the Needleless is very similar to the surface area of the TOT. (16% less surface area of tissue ingrowths) It is 100% macroporous polypropylene without any additional material. 120 patients were evaluated retrospectively. They were all treated of SUI with the Contasure Needleless.Female patients were evaluated under clinical study protocol consisting in cough test, urodynamic and Quality Of Life questionnaire, before and after the procedure. patients with genuine SUI and patients with SUI plus concomitant procedures as prolapse. patients with ISD and or neurogenic incontinence. Anesthesia used: general (30%) or epidural (70%), patients with associated pathology. The 114 mm long and tension-free mesh was placed beneath the midurethra. The central part is 12 mm wide. The sling can be repositioned during surgery due to the 22 mm wide T-Pocket Positioning System located at the 2 edges. These pockets fixed the sling to the surrounding tissue in order to have the proper tissue in growth and anchoring. A 20mm sub urethral incision was made to dissect the paraurethral spaces only up to the ischiopubic ramus. A surgical forceps with the T-pocket folded was inserted into the dissected spaces and penetrates at the contra lateral side, like the standard transobturator technique. The forceps was introduced until the fascia of the Internal Obturator muscle was perforated. Then the forceps is opened to extend the pocket inside the muscle fibers for fixation. 120 patients with a mean age of 55 years (from 36 to 79) and a mean number of deliveries of 3 (0-7). Follow-up period: 24 months. SUCCESS RATE: 100 patients (84%) Improved rate: 10 patients (8%) Failure rate: 10 (8%) Mean operating time of sling procedure alone: 9 minutes (4-12). 3 patients had mesh extrusion solved with estrogens and 2 patients required short term catheterization due to voiding difficulties and no patients had inguinal pain. The results of the study suggest that the Contasure Needleless can be considered a minimally invasive TOT with no-needles and maintaining the same cure rate than our TOT cases at 2 years follow up.

Breast-conserving surgery in 201 very young patients (<35 years). Surgical treatment of breast cancer in very young patients (<35 years) is still a matter of debate, since age is a predictive factor of local recurrence after breast conservation. We retrospectively evaluated outcome and prognostic factors of 201 consecutive patients treated with breast conservation followed by whole breast irradiation between 1997 and 2004 with special attention paid to local control. The average follow up was 72 months (range 13-133 months). The mean age was 32 years (Range 20-34). Invasive ductal carcinoma was found in 175 (87.1%) patients. Two (1%) patients had invasive lobular carcinoma. One-hundred and eighteen patients (58.7%) had tumors of 2 cm or smaller. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 105 (52.2%) patients. One-hundred and ten (54.7%) patients had node-negative disease, 68 (33.8%) patients had 1-3 positive nodes and 23 (11.4%) +4 positive nodes. Eighteen patients (9.0%) developed a local recurrence, 25 (12.5%) developed distant metastases and 23 patients (11.4%) died during follow up. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of local events were 8.2% and 12,3% respectively. The univariate analysis did not identify any variables affecting local disease-free survival. Breast conservation in very young patients achieves an acceptable local control rate. No prognostic factors were associated with local events.


Comparison of the effects of L: -carnitine and alpha-tocopherol on acute ureteral obstruction-induced renal oxidative imbalance and altered energy metabolism in rats.

Zebrafish con/disp1 reveals multiple spatiotemporal requirements for Hedgehog-signaling in craniofacial development. The vertebrate head skeleton is derived largely from cranial neural crest cells (CNCC). Genetic studies in zebrafish and mice have established that the Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway plays a critical role in craniofacial development, partly due to the pathway's role in CNCC development. Disruption of the Hh-signaling pathway in humans can lead to the spectral disorder of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), which is often characterized by a variety of craniofacial defects including midline facial clefting and cyclopia 12. Previous work has uncovered a role for Hh-signaling in zebrafish dorsal neurocranium patterning and chondrogenesis, however Hh-signaling mutants have not been described with respect to the ventral pharyngeal arch (PA) skeleton. Lipid-modified Hh-ligands require the transmembrane-spanning receptor Dispatched 1 (Disp1) for proper secretion from Hh-synthesizing cells to the extracellular field where they act on target cells. Here we study chameleon mutants, lacking a functional disp1(con/disp1). con/disp1 mutants display reduced and dysmorphic mandibular and hyoid arch cartilages and lack all ceratobranchial cartilage elements. CNCC specification and migration into the PA primorida occurs normally in con/disp1 mutants, however disp1 is necessary for post-migratory CNCC patterning and differentiation. We show that disp1 is required for post-migratory CNCC to become properly patterned within the first arch, while the gene is dispensable for CNCC condensation and patterning in more posterior arches. Upon residing in well-formed pharyngeal epithelium, neural crest condensations in the posterior PA fail to maintain expression of two transcription factors essential for chondrogenesis, sox9a and dlx2a, yet continue to robustly express other neural crest markers. Histology reveals that posterior arch residing-CNCC differentiate into fibrous-connective tissue, rather than becoming chondrocytes. Treatments with Cyclopamine, to inhibit Hh-signaling at different developmental stages, show that Hh-signaling is required during gastrulation for normal patterning of CNCC in the first PA, and then during the late pharyngula stage, to promote CNCC chondrogenesis within the posterior arches. Further, loss of disp1 disrupted normal expression of bapx1 and gdf5, markers of jaw joint patterning, thus resulting in jaw joint defects in con/disp1 mutant animals. This study reveals novel requirements for Hh-signaling in the zebrafish PA skeleton and highlights the functional diversity and differential sensitivity of craniofacial tissues to Hh-signaling throughout the face, a finding that may help to explain the spectrum of human facial phenotypes characteristic of HPE.


Environmental proteomics: analysis of structure and function of microbial communities.

Current Practices and Opportunities in a Resident Clinic Regarding the Care of Older Adults with Multimorbidity. Multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) affects more than half of all older adults. The American Geriatrics Society developed and published guiding principles for the care of older adults with multimorbidity in 2012. Improved clinician training in caring for older adults with multimorbidity is needed, but it is not clear what opportunities arise within clinical encounters to apply the guiding principles or how clinicians at all stages of training currently practice in this area. This project aimed to characterize current practice and opportunities for improvement in an internal medicine residency clinic regarding the care of older adults with multimorbidity. Qualitative content analysis of audio-recorded clinic visits. Thirty clinic visits between 21 internal medicine residents and 30 of their primary care patients aged 65 and older with two or more chronic conditions were audio-recorded. Patients' mean age was 73.6, and they had on average 3.7 chronic conditions and took 12.6 medications. Transcripts of the audio-recorded visit discussions were analyzed using standard techniques of qualitative content analysis to describe the content and frequency of discussions in the clinic visits related to the five guiding principles: patient preferences, interpreting the evidence, prognosis, clinical feasibility, and optimizing therapies. All visits except one included discussions that were thematically related to at least one guiding principle, suggesting regular opportunities to apply the guiding principles in primary care encounters with internal medicine residents. Discussions related to some guiding principles occurred much more frequently than others. Patients presented a number of opportunities to incorporate the guiding principles that the residents missed, suggesting target areas for future educational interventions.

Effect of dietary Spirulina on reduction of copper toxicity and improvement of growth, blood parameters and phosphatases activities in carp, Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton, 1822). The effect of Spirulina supplementation on reduction of copper toxicity based on food utilization, phosphatases activities and selected haematological parameters was studied in a freshwater cultivable fish C. mrigala. Metal concentration in medium, body tissues and fecal matter was also analysed. Sublethal exposure of C. mrigala fed Spirulina-free diet significantly reduced the consumption and growth rates, phosphatases activities and haematological parameters. However, the above parameters enhanced in the copper exposed fish fed with Spirulina supplemented diets. A significant positive correlation was obtained for the relationship between supplementation of dietary Spirulina and copper defecation through feces. Among the doses of Spirulina supplementation, 6% addition has been considered optimum for C. mrigala since this dose produces maximum elimination of copper from the body and feces and better improvement on growth, phosphatases activities and haematological parameters.

Multiparametric MRI Improves Accuracy of Clinical Nomograms for Predicting Extracapsular Extension of Prostate Cancer.

Altered lymphocyte trafficking and diminished airway reactivity in transgenic mice expressing human MMP-9 in a mouse model of asthma. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is hypothesized to facilitate leukocyte extravasation and extracellular remodeling in asthmatic airways. Careful descriptive studies have shown that MMP-9 levels are higher in the sputum of asthmatics; however, the consequence of increased MMP-9 activity has not been determined in this disease. We induced asthma in transgenic mice that express human MMP-9 in the murine lung tissue macrophage to determine the direct effect of human MMP-9 expression on airway inflammation. Transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice were immunized and challenged with ovalbumin. Forty-eight hours after the ovalbumin challenge, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was measured, and inflammatory cell infiltration was evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Baseline levels of inflammation were similar in the TG and WT groups of mice, and pulmonary eosinophilia was established in both groups by sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin. There was a significant reduction in AHR in sensitized and challenged trangenics compared with WT controls. Although total BALF cell counts were similar in both groups, the lymphocyte number in the lavage of the TG group was significantly diminished compared with the WT group (0.25 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.53; P = 0.0032). In addition, the draining lymphocytes were found to be larger in the TG animals compared with the WT mice. Equal numbers of macrophages, eosinophils, and neutrophils were seen in both groups. IL-13 levels were found to be lower in the sensitized TG compared with the WT mice. These results demonstrate an inverse relationship between human MMP-9 and AHR and suggest that MMP-9 expression alters leukocyte extravasation by reducing lymphocyte accumulation in the walls of asthmatic airways.

[The difference in specific humoral immune responses induced with the attenuated equine infectious anemia vaccine strain and virulent strain.]. To disclose the potential roles of humoral immune response in the EIAV vaccine-induced protective immunity. In this study, major parameters of humoral immunity be compared between horses inoculated with the EIAV vaccine strain and the pathogenic virulent strain. Experimental horses were randomly assigned into the group inoculated with the vaccine strain EIAV(DLV); (the vaccinated group) and the group inoculated with sub-morbigenous dose of virulent strain EIAV(Liao); (the inapparent infection group). Humoral immunity parameters, including binding endpoint titer and avidity index of antibodies to the envelop protein (Env) and the capsid protein (P26), and the conformation-dependent index of the Env antibody, were assayed and compared between these two groups by using ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies to the EIAV vaccine strain and a pathogenic strain were simultaneously detected by using plaque forming unite assay (PFU) and reverse transcriptase activity assay, respectively. In general, all humoral parameters increased with a time-dependent manner in both the vaccinated and the inapparent infection group. However, significantly higher antibody activities for P26 binding endpoint titer and Env avidity index were detected in the vaccinated group within 2 months post infection (P<0.05). Furthermore, the conformation-dependent index of the Env antibody in the vaccinated group was significantly higher than that in the inapparent infection group throughout the entire observation period (P<0.05). The most dramatic difference between these experimental groups was in the raise of the neutralizing antibody. The antibody neutralizing both the vaccine strain EIAV(DLV); and a virulent strain EIAV(DLV34); was detected significantly earlier and in higher titers in vaccinated horses than in virulent strain-infected horses (P<0.01 for EIAV(FDDV); and P<0.05 for EIAV(DLV34);). Statistically significant differences in EIAV-specific binding antibodies and the neutralizing antibody are detected between animals induced with the EIAV vaccine strain and the virulent strain. Importantly, the significantly early and strong responses in the neutralizing antibody and the conformation-dependent Env antibody induced by the vaccine implicate special roles these antibodies playing in EIAV vaccine-induced immune protection.

[The influence of melatonin on hair physiology]. Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone and a strong antioxidant, has long been known, particularly in animal-experiment based research and the wool-producing industry, to be a potent regulatory neuroendocrine substance in relation to hair growth, hair color and hair cycle, depending on light periods, seasonal rhythms, environmental factors and reproductive rhythms. Nevertheless, the biological mechanisms of this extremely versatile hormone, especially with regard to human hair follicles, are not fully understood. In recent years, however, essential knowledge has been gained on the melatoninergic system of the skin, melatonin levels in keratinocytes and hair follicles, extrapineal intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and noradrenalin-induced increase in synthesis, as well as hair cycle-dependent expression of the membrane-bound melatonin receptor MT2 and the nuclear receptor RORalpha. Functional data on the growth of human hair both in vitro and in vivo show that melatonin might play an essential role in hair physiology.

Rehabilitation of the knee following sports injury. Rehabilitation of a knee injury is done in a criterion-based progression that is based on individual progress from one phase to another and not on a prespecified period of time. If the rehabilitation deviates from this approach, the body will react with adverse affects such as inflammation, pain, and further injury. Delay in the entire rehabilitation program will delay the athlete in meeting goals and returning to play. Phase I focuses on restoration of range of motion, pain modulation, inflammatory control, modification of activities, and gait training. Phase II is characterized by gaining full range of motion, demonstration of normal gait pattern, basic to advanced strengthening and flexibility, appropriate cardiovascular conditioning, and proprioception retraining. Phase III allows functional return to prior activity level. This phase includes a sport/occupational-specific functional progression. Utilizing a trained rehabilitation specialist will allow the athlete/individual an effective and efficient return to prior level of function.

Toxicity analysis of postoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer. To report on the acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity associated with a unique technique of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in patients undergoing postprostatectomy irradiation. Fifty patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after radical prostatectomy. Daily image guidance was performed to localize the prostate bed using kilovoltage imaging or cone-beam computed tomography. The median prescription dose was 68 Gy (range, 62-68 Gy). Toxicity was graded every 3 to 6 months according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. The median follow-up was 24 months (range, 13-38 months). Grade 2 acute GI and GU events occurred in 4 patients (8%) and 7 patients (14%), respectively. No Grade 3 or higher acute GI or GU toxicities were observed. Late Grade 2 GI and GU events occurred in 1 patient (2%) and 8 patients (16%), respectively. Only a single (2%) Grade 3 or higher late toxicity was observed. Image-guided IMRT in the postprostatectomy setting is associated with a low frequency of acute and late GI/GU toxicity. These results compare more favorably to radiotherapy techniques that do not use in-room image-guidance, suggesting that daily prostate bed localization may reduce the incidence of adverse events in patients undergoing postprostatectomy irradiation.

Population genetic structure of economically important Tortricidae (Lepidoptera) in South Africa: a comparative analysis. Comparative studies of the population genetic structures of agricultural pests can elucidate the factors by which their population levels are affected, which is useful for designing pest management programs. This approach was used to provide insight into the six Tortricidae of major economic importance in South Africa. The population genetic structure of the carnation worm E. acerbella and the false codling moth T. leucotreta, analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, is presented here for the first time. These results were compared with those obtained previously for the codling moth Cydia pomonella, the oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta, the litchi moth Cryptophlebia peltastica and the macadamia nut borer T. batrachopa. Locally adapted populations were detected over local geographic areas for all species. No significant differences were found among population genetic structures as result of population history (whether native or introduced) although host range (whether oligophagous or polyphagous) had a small but significant effect. It is concluded that factors such as dispersal ability and agricultural practices have the most important effects on genetically structuring populations of the economically important Tortricidae in South Africa.

Vascular damage in testicular cancer patients: a study on endothelial activation by bleomycin and cisplatin in vitro. Following treatment with bleomycin- and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, testicular cancer patients frequently develop vascular complications, which may result from damage to endothelial cells. Understanding bleomycin- and cisplatin-induced endothelial alterations may help to develop strategies to prevent or reduce vascular toxicity. The effects of bleomycin and cisplatin on proliferation and apoptosis of the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 were determined. In addition, modulation of drug-induced cytotoxicity by the free radical scavenger amifostine, the low molecular weight heparin dalteparin, the iron-chelator dexrazoxane, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin and the PPAR agonist troglitazone was tested. Furthermore, the effects of bleomycin and cisplatin on endothelial activation measured by the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and on two main proteins involved in fibrinolysis, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), were measured. Decreased endothelial cell survival induced by bleomycin and cisplatin coincided with the induction of apoptosis. Only troglitazone was able to protect the endothelial cells from both bleomycin- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. At high concentrations, amifostine and dexrazoxane also protected HMEC-1 from drug-induced cytotoxicity. However, due to the required high (toxic) concentrations of both modulators no absolute cell survival benefit could be achieved. Both bleomycin and cisplatin induced up-regulation of ICAM-1, tPA and PAI-1. Summarizing, bleomycin and cisplatin induce alterations in the function of endothelial cells regarding proliferation, inflammation and fibrinolysis in vitro. Strategies aimed at these functions should be developed in order to ameliorate or prevent cytostatic agent-induced vascular damage.

Extent of publication bias in different categories of research cohorts: a meta-analysis of empirical studies. The validity of research synthesis is threatened if published studies comprise a biased selection of all studies that have been conducted. We conducted a meta-analysis to ascertain the strength and consistency of the association between study results and formal publication. The Cochrane Methodology Register Database, MEDLINE and other electronic bibliographic databases were searched (to May 2009) to identify empirical studies that tracked a cohort of studies and reported the odds of formal publication by study results. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also examined for relevant studies. Odds ratios were used to measure the association between formal publication and significant or positive results. Included studies were separated into subgroups according to starting time of follow-up, and results from individual cohort studies within the subgroups were quantitatively pooled. We identified 12 cohort studies that followed up research from inception, four that included trials submitted to a regulatory authority, 28 that assessed the fate of studies presented as conference abstracts, and four cohort studies that followed manuscripts submitted to journals. The pooled odds ratio of publication of studies with positive results, compared to those without positive results (publication bias) was 2.78 (95% CI: 2.10 to 3.69) in cohorts that followed from inception, 5.00 (95% CI: 2.01 to 12.45) in trials submitted to regulatory authority, 1.70 (95% CI: 1.44 to 2.02) in abstract cohorts, and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.80 to 1.39) in cohorts of manuscripts. Dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process. Publication bias appears to occur early, mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences or submission of manuscripts to journals.


Anxiety-like responses in adolescent rats following a 10-11-day withdrawal period from repeated cocaine administration.

[Evaluation of the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment]. Treatment of breast cancer generally involves quadrantectomy and mastectomy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on indication. The object of the present study was to verify the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment and the influence of the type of surgery (quadrantectomy and mastectomy). A total of 90 women submitted to surgery for breast cancer in the Region of Catanduva, Brazil and a control group of 20 women without surgical compromise were evaluated. The extents of bilateral flexion and abduction movements of the shoulders were assessed by goniometry. The non-matched student t-test and Fisher exact test were utilized for statistical analysis with an alpha error of up to 5% being considered acceptable. Differences of 20 degrees or more in the extent of movement of the shoulders of women submitted to surgery were seen in 47.7% of the cases for flexion and in 56.6% for abduction. The compromise to the movement of the shoulder in the control group was less than 20 degrees in 9 (45%) of the women. On comparing the incidence of alterations in the movements of the arms of women submitted to surgery with the control group, a significant difference was identified for both limbs (p-value < 0.01). The articular mobility of both arms of patients submitted to treatment for breast cancer can be affected.

Quantitative proteomics by metabolic labeling of model organisms. In the biological sciences, model organisms have been used for many decades and have enabled the gathering of a large proportion of our present day knowledge of basic biological processes and their derailments in disease. Although in many of these studies using model organisms, the focus has primarily been on genetics and genomics approaches, it is important that methods become available to extend this to the relevant protein level. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is increasingly becoming the standard to comprehensively analyze proteomes. An important transition has been made recently by moving from charting static proteomes to monitoring their dynamics by simultaneously quantifying multiple proteins obtained from differently treated samples. Especially the labeling with stable isotopes has proved an effective means to accurately determine differential expression levels of proteins. Among these, metabolic incorporation of stable isotopes in vivo in whole organisms is one of the favored strategies. In this perspective, we will focus on methodologies to stable isotope label a variety of model organisms in vivo, ranging from relatively simple organisms such as bacteria and yeast to Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis up to mammals such as rats and mice. We also summarize how this has opened up ways to investigate biological processes at the protein level in health and disease, revealing conservation and variation across the evolutionary tree of life.

BDNF, via truncated TrkB receptor, modulates GlyT1 and GlyT2 in astrocytes. Glycine transporters (GlyT), GlyT1 and GlyT2, are responsible for the termination of glycine-mediated synaptic activity through removal of neurotransmitter from synaptic cleft. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates its high affinity tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors, namely TrkB, which includes full length (TrkB-FL) and truncated (TrkB-T) isoforms. In this article we evaluated the influence of BDNF upon the activity of glycine transporters in astrocytes. We report that BDNF decreases GlyT1- and GlyT2- mediated [(3) H]glycine transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. BDNF decreased Vmax but not Km values of transport, which suggests that BDNF induces transporter internalization. Accordingly, dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin/clathrin-dependent endocytosis, prevented the influence of BDNF upon GlyT-mediated transport. While quantifying mRNA and protein levels, we detected a predominance of truncated isoforms over the TrkB-FL receptor. The effect of BDNF was not abolished by specific inhibitors of PLCγ, PI3K and MAPK, indicating that it did not occur through TrkB-FL canonical pathways. However, BDNF action was lost in the presence of a Rho family-specific blocker (toxin B), a signaling pathway that has been associated to TrkB-T1. Furthermore, the effect of BDNF was abolished upon TrkB-T knockdown in astrocytes by RNA interference. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed an increased GlyT expression in endosomes upon BDNF incubation, which was prevented in the presence of either dynasore or toxin B. We conclude that BDNF, acting on TrkB-T1 receptors, inhibits glycine uptake in astrocytes by promoting GlyT internalization through a Rho-GTPase activity dependent mechanism.

The anticancer effects of actinoporin RTX-A from the sea anemone Heteractis crispa (=Radianthus macrodactylus). Four isoforms of actinoporins were isolated in 2002-2004 from the tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa (=Radianthus macrodactylus). Their potent hemolytic activities and effects on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma bearing mice were also studied. In this study, the individual actinoporin (RTX-A) demonstrated potential cancer-preventive activity at extremely low and non-cytotoxic concentrations. The substance suppressed the malignant transformation of mouse JB6 P(+) Cl41 cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in soft agar with the inhibition of number of the colonies C(50) (INCC(50))=0.034 nM. Actinoporin RTX-A also was shown to inhibit the phenotype expression of HeLa human cancer cells with an INCC(50)=0.03 nM. The cytotoxic effect of RTX-A against JB6 P(+) Cl41 cells and HeLa, THP-1, MDA-MB-231, and SNU-C4 human tumor cell lines was high (IC(50)=0.57, 2.26, 1.11, 30.0 and 4.66 nM), but significantly less than their capacity to suppress tumor cell colony formation or phenotype expression. RTX-A also induced apoptosis and inhibited basal AP-1, NF-kappaB, and p53-dependent transcriptional activity in JB6 Cl41 cells. These results confirmed that actinoporin RTX-A from H. crispa, at least partially, might exhibit cancer-preventive and anticancer cytotoxic properties through the induction of p53-independent apoptosis and inhibition of the oncogenic AP-1 and NF-kappaB nuclear factors activity.

[What underlies NYHA class in elderly patients with heart failure? Role of diastolic dysfunction, functional mitral regurgitation and abnormal ventilation during exercise]. Color-Doppler ecocardiography and cardiopulmonary stress test are pivotal in the evaluation of patients with heart failure. Besides determining systolic function through left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), color-Doppler ecocardiography evaluates the presence and degree of functional mitral regurgitation and the severity of diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, in addition to the aerobic capacity indicated by peak O2 consumption, other parameters of cardiopulmonary stress have proven useful for diagnostic purposes, such as the peak VE/VCO2 ratio or ventilatory efficiency. Since in elderly patients with heart failure the functional impairment often is a combination of the effects of aging with those of disease, the relationship between symptoms, i.e. the NYHA class, ventricular pump function and aerobic performance is sometimes difficult to estabilish. In 60 elderly with systolic heart failure (75 +/- 3 years, EF 30 +/- 6%), we correlated symptoms (i.e. NYHA class) with [1] degree of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) determined by color-Doppler echocardiography; [2] degree of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, measured by Doppler analysis of transmitralic and pulmonary veins flow; [3] VO2 and VE/VCO2 at peak exercise at cardiopulmonary test. In all patients, NYHA class was only weakly related with EF and peak VO2, with wide overlap of individual values among patients with different NYHA class. Instead, we observed a tight relationship between NYHA class, FMR degree, and severity of diastolic dysfunction and VE/VCO2 ratio at peak exercise (p<0.001), with a more evident partition among patients in different NYHA classes. In elderly heart failure patients, the reduced effort tolerance expressed by the NYHA classification is only weakly associated with reduced aerobic capacity and pump function, but rather is related with the presence of mitral regurgitation, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and a poor ventilatory efficiency during exercise.

Increased serum levels of C-reactive protein precede anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a severe complication following colorectal surgery. C-reactive protein (CRP) is considered to be an indicator of postoperative complications. Between August 2002 and August 2005 342 colorectal resections with primary anastomosis were performed at the Department of General and Vascular Surgery. Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt. For this retrospective study serum CRP was measured daily until postoperative day 7, and in cases of AL it was excluded from statistical analysis beginning with the day on which the AL was diagnosed. Twenty-six of 342 (7.6%) patients developed AL at a mean of 8.7 days postoperatively. The in-hospital mortality was 3.5% for all patients and was significantly higher in the AL group (11.5 versus 2.8%). The CRP level in the two groups showed a peak on day 2.5 and day 2.2, respectively. In case of postoperative AL the CRP level did not show a marked decline during the next few days. Compared to the cases where AL did not develop, there was a significantly higher increase in CRP from the preoperative level to the levels measured on postoperative day 3, 5, 6 and 7. Higher CRP levels were observed in patients experiencing pneumonia or urinary tract infection, but the decrease of CRP values was not as slow as in cases of AL. This study shows serum CRP level to be a relevant marker in detecting postoperative complications in colorectal surgery. Prolonged elevation and a missing decline in CRP level precede the occurrence of AL.

Impact of nutritional support on clinical outcome in patients at nutritional risk: a multicenter, prospective cohort study in Baltimore and Beijing teaching hospitals. To evaluate the impact of nutritional support on clinical outcomes in patients at nutritional risk defined by the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002. In this prospective cohort study, hospitalized patients from three departments in Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and two teaching hospitals in Beijing were recruited from March 2007 to May 2008. Data were collected on the nutritional risk screening, application of parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition, surgery, complications, and length of stay. There were 1831 patients recruited, with 45.2% of them at nutritional risk. Of the "at-risk" patients, the complication rate was significantly lower in the nutritional-support group than in the no-support group (20.3% versus 28.1%, P = 0.009), mainly because of the lower rate of infectious complications (10.5% versus 18.9%, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed the complication rate was significantly lower in the enteral nutrition group (P < 0.001) but not in the parenteral nutrition group (P = 0.29) when compared with the no-support group. Of the patients without nutritional risk, the complication rate was not different between the nutritional-support group and the no-support group (P = 0.10). Multivariate analysis showed nutritional support was a protective factor for complications in at-risk patients when adjusted for confounders (odds ratio 0.54, P < 0.001). No difference in length of stay was found. The findings suggested that nutritional support was beneficial to the patients at nutritional risk according to Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 by a lower complication rate.

Cell cycle effects of fatty acid derivatives of cytarabine, CP-4055, and of gemcitabine, CP-4126, as basis for the interaction with oxaliplatin and docetaxel. To bypass resistance due to limited entry into the cell derivatives of cytarabine (CP-4055, elacytarabine) and gemcitabine (CP-4126) containing a fatty acid chain at the 5' position of the nucleoside were developed. CP-4055 showed an increased retention of the active metabolite, the triphosphate. This characteristic was supposed to favor combinations, such as with the tubulin antagonist docetaxel, the platinum oxaliplatin and the antifolate pemetrexed. The role of the cell cycle effects of CP-4055 and CP-4126 on the efficacy of the combination with docetaxel or pemetrexed was determined. The combination of CP-4055 with oxaliplatin and docetaxel was also evaluated in a mouse xenograft model. CP-4055 induced a G2/M and S phase accumulation and CP-4126 an S phase accumulation. Both analogs induced a dose-dependent cell kill (apoptosis and necrosis). None of the docetaxel combinations induced a synergistic effect. The combination of docetaxel with CP-4055 or CP-4126 induced a G2/M accumulation in the A549 (lung cancer) cell line, but a G0/G1 accumulation in the WiDR (colon cancer) cell line. Preincubation with docetaxel induced an increased cell kill in both cell lines. The combination with oxaliplatin showed a synergistic effect in both cell lines. Combinations with pemetrexed were antagonistic in both cell lines. In the A549 cell line pemetrexed with CP-4055 led to an increase of the G0/G1 phase and the S phase. In WiDR the combination of pemetrexed with CP-4055 increased the G0/G1 phase and increased the cell kill. Pemetrexed with CP-4126 induced an increase in the G0/G1 phase and the S phase in the A549 cell line. In the xenograft study, on a colon cancer and a lung metastasis model, the combination of CP-4055 with docetaxel showed the best results. Treatment with CP-4055 followed by docetaxel after 4 h resulted in a reduction in metastasis in a lung metastasis model, and a favorable toxicity profile was observed. In conclusion, the combinations with oxaliplatin showed a synergistic effect in the combination studies. Although the combinations with docetaxel did not show an enhanced effect in the in vitro studies, this combination revealed an increased effect in the xenograft model.

Changes in bone mass, biomechanical properties, and microarchitecture of calcium- and iron-deficient rats fed diets supplemented with inulin-type fructans. Feeding mineral-deficient diets enhances absorptive efficiency as an attempt of the body to compensate for the lack of an essential nutrient. Under certain circumstances, it does not succeed; and nutritional deficiency is produced. Our hypothesis was that inulin-type fructans (ITF), which are known to affect mineral absorption, could increase Ca and Fe bioavailability in Ca- and Fe-deficient rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 48, 4 weeks old) were assigned to 1 of 8 groups derived from 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with 2 levels of added Fe (0 and 35 mg/kg), Ca (0 and 5 g/kg), and ITF (0 and 100 g/kg) for 33 days. The Fe status (hemoglobin, serum Fe, total Fe-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, liver minerals) was evaluated. Tibia minerals (Ca, Mg, and Zn), bone strength, and histomorphometry were determined. In nondeficient rats, ITF supplementation did not affect Fe status or organ minerals, with the exception of tibia Mg. Moreover, ITF improved bone resilience and led to a reduction in eroded surface per body surface and number of osteoclasts per area. In Ca-deficient rats, ITF increased liver (Fe and Zn) and tibia (Zn) mineral levels but impaired tibia Mg, yield load, and resilience. In conclusion, ITF worsened the tibia Mg levels and elastic properties when supplemented in Ca-deficient diets. In contrast, although bone Ca was not affected in nondeficient rats under the present experimental conditions, bone quality improved, as demonstrated by a moderate reduction in femur osteoclast resorption and significant increases in tibia Mg content and elasticity.

The interleukin-6, serotonin transporter, and monoamine oxidase A genes and endurance performance during the South African Ironman Triathlon. Previous studies have identified an association of genetic variants believed to alter physiological and biochemical processes locally within the skeletal muscle and therefore performance in the Ironman triathlon. There is growing evidence that the serotonergic system and circulating interleukin (IL)-6 levels are also involved in mediating endurance capacity. Investigators have demonstrated that recombinant human IL-6 administration and serotonergic neurotransmission manipulation, with 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors, prior to exercise, can alter running performance, consistent with a central governor hypothesis. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations of functional polymorphisms within the IL-6, 5-HTT, and MAO-A genes with endurance performance of Ironman triathletes. Four hundred sixty-eight male Caucasian triathletes who completed the 2000 and (or) 2001 South African Ironman Triathlon and 200 healthy Caucasian male controls were genotyped for the -174 IL-6 G/C, 5-HTT 40 base pair (bp) insertion-deletion and 30 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) MAO-A gene polymorphisms. There were no significant differences in the relative genotype distributions within the IL-6 (p = 0.636), 5-HTT (p = 0.659), and MOA-A (p = 0.227) polymorphisms when the fastest-fnishing, middle-finishing, and slowest-finishing triathletes, as well as the control groups, were compared. There were no direct associations between the IL-6 -174 G/C, 5-HTT 44 bp insertion-deletion, and MAO-A 30 bp VNTR gene polymorphisms and endurance performance in the 2000 and (or) 2001 South African Ironman Triathlons. The neurogenetic basis of the central governor requires further investigation.

Hippocampal-related memory deficits and histological damage induced by neonatal ionizing radiation exposure. Role of oxidative status. Ionizing radiations induce oxidative stress on target tissues, mainly through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, there are few data available on the behavioral effects of moderate doses of ionizing radiation. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of adult rats irradiated at birth in different hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks and to establish a relationship with the oxidative status and histological changes in rat hippocampus (Hip). Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5 Gy of X rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. Thirty days later, rats were subjected to open field, object recognition and inhibitory avoidance tasks. In addition, oxidative status markers as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activity and histological changes were assessed in control and irradiated Hip. Results show an impairment in recognition and habituation memories in 30-day-old animals exposed to neonatal ionizing radiation, both at short- (ST) and at long-term (LT), whereas an improvement in associative memory was observed at ST. In addition, histological alterations were observed in irradiated Hip. Although an increase in ROS levels and PKC activity were found in irradiated Hip, no changes in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were observed. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that an increased PKC activity, induced by neonatal ionizing radiation on rat Hip, could play a role in the generation of an imbalance between ROS levels and antioxidant systems and might underlie radiation-induced hippocampal histological damage as well as the Hip-dependent behavioral changes found in irradiated rats.

Fever is not a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis. In the chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) definition of the RhinoSinusitis Task Force (RSTF) of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, fever is one of the minor symptoms. In the EP3OS definition, fever is not mentioned as a contributing factor. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role of fever in CRS. Patients with CRS, scheduled for surgery were compared with a control group consisting of patients without CRS, suffering from esthetic complaints or obstruction of the nose. Temperature prior to surgery was measured and analyzed. In both groups, hundred patients were included. In the CRS group the mean temperature was 36.94 degrees C, with a maximum of 37.8 degrees C. The control group revealed a mean temperature of 36.87 degrees C. Analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the mean temperatures of the CRS patients and the controls (p = 0.306). Additional analysis, correcting for possible confounders, did not reveal significant differences between both groups either. There have been several attempts to define CRS in the past, but an all including definition or classification system for this disorder does not currently exist. Fever is a factor under discussion. We found no significant difference between the preoperative body temperature in CRS patients and controls. These results suggest that fever is not a relevant symptom in CRS.

[Studies on the predictors of response to immunosuppressive therapy in severe aplastic anemia patients]. To assay the factors that may predict the response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in severe aplastic anemia patients. The blood samples were collected from 37 patients diagnosed as severe aplastic anemia in West China Hospital of Sichuan University and West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University during February, 2006 to March, 2007. Twenty healthy blood donors were used as normal control. The plasma levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and the gene phenotype of HLA-DRB1 * 15 and HLA-DRB1 * 1501 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primer. The expressions of CD55 and CD59 on the cellular membrane of red blood cell and white blood cells also were measured. The response rate in the patients who had higher IL-2 level before IST was significantly better than that in the patients with lower IL-2 level (66.7% vs 28.6%, P<0.05), while similar result was observed to IFN-gamma (73.7% vs 25.0%, P<0.05). The response rate in the patients with positive HLA-DRB1 * 15 was higher than that in those negative patients (62.5% vs 44.4%, P>0.05), but there was no different found in different HLA-DRB1 * 1501 phenotypes (50% vs 50%, P>0.05). The response rates in the patients with deficient CD55 and CD59 expression were higher than those expressed CD55 and CD59 normally (80.0% vs 40.0%, P>0.05); the response rate of patients younger than 40 years was higher than those older than 40 years (60.0% vs 14.3%, P<0.05); the response rate in female patients was higher than male patients (62.5% vs 42.9%, P<0.05). The concentration of IL-2, IFN-gamma before IST, and age can be used as the predicting factors to immunosuppressive therapy, while the predicting value of HLA-DRB1 * 15, HLA- DRB1 * 1501 and CD55, CD59 to the response of IST still remain unclear.

Sex-related differences in cisplatin-induced neuropathy in rats. Cisplatin is used as an anti-neoplastic agent against several cancers. Neuropathy is one of its major side effects that contributes to patients' intolerance to the standard regimen. Sex-related differences have been reported in nerve injury and neuropathies. However, there has been no study on cisplatin regarding this issue. Compare various abnormalities in cisplatin neuropathy between sexes. Two mg/kg of cisplatin was administered intraperitoneally twice a week for five consecutive weeks. Body weight, heat latency of hind paw and sciatic motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), pathological alterations in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) including the level of NGF in the sciatic nerve were examined. Untreated rats of both sexes were used as controls. Weight loss, prolonged heat latency, and slow MNCV in the treated rats of both sexes with higher severity in males were showed. Furthermore, reduction in myelinated fiber diameter, myelin thickness, and myelinated fiber density was more severe in females, whereas, atrophy of neuronal cell body, nucleus, and nucleolus was more striking in males.

Is inpatient admission necessary following removal of airway foreign bodies? To determine the need for postoperative admission following airway foreign body retrieval by examining the preoperative presentation, operative details, and postoperative recovery. Inpatient admission following foreign body removal is common, however little evidence supports this practice. In the era of cost containment and prudent utilization of hospital resources, careful examination of the postoperative course following airway foreign body removal is required. A retrospective review of cases over a four year period from a pediatric tertiary care pediatric hospital was performed. All children presenting with concerns for airway foreign bodies were included. Children without identification of an airway foreign body during bronchoscopy were excluded. Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with airway foreign body extraction was performed. Details concerning demographics, operative findings, and pre and postoperative course including pulse oximetry were collected. All respiratory events, intubations, and persistent oxygen requirements were investigated. Thirty five children underwent successful airway foreign body removal. The mean age was 3.2±2.6 years with a preponderance of males (68.6%). The retrieved items included: nuts (31.4%), popcorn (14.3%), seeds (8.6%), and inorganic materials (34.3%). Mean operative time was 29.7±25.6min. The mean length of stay following surgery was 1.3±1.9 days. Most patients (31/35) (88.6%) were extubated prior to transfer to recovery. 30/35 (85.7%) patients required no supplemental oxygen without desaturations following post anesthesia care unit (PACU) recovery. One patient developed laryngospasm requiring reintubation within 15min of surgery. Two patients were intubated prior to transfer for respiratory distress and remained intubated following surgery. Two patients breathing spontaneously prior to surgery were left intubated following surgery secondary to prolonged pneumonia treatment or multifocal foreign bodies with airway edema. All patients subsequently extubated without complication. In total, 30/31 (96.7%) of patients extubated in the operating room returned to room air oxygenation within 2h of surgery. PACU observation and discharge is feasible in select children following airway foreign body extraction. Patients carefully monitored in the recovery unit without oxygen requirement are candidates for discharge. Inpatient monitoring is advised in 'children with preoperative respiratory distress or a complicated operative course.

Structural insights into tail-anchored protein binding and membrane insertion by Get3. Tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins are involved in a variety of important cellular functions, including membrane fusion, protein translocation, and apoptosis. The ATPase Get3 (Asna1, TRC40) was identified recently as the endoplasmic reticulum targeting factor of TA proteins. Get3 consists of an ATPase and alpha-helical subdomain enriched in methionine and glycine residues. We present structural and biochemical analyses of Get3 alone as well as in complex with a TA protein, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (Ramp4). The ATPase domains form an extensive dimer interface that encloses 2 nucleotides in a head-to-head orientation and a zinc ion. Amide proton exchange mass spectrometry shows that the alpha-helical subdomain of Get3 displays considerable flexibility in solution and maps the TA protein-binding site to the alpha-helical subdomain. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP-Mg(2+)- and ADP-Mg(2+)-bound crystal structures representing the pre- and posthydrolysis states are both in a closed form. In the absence of a TA protein cargo, ATP hydrolysis does not seem to be possible. Comparison with the ADP.AlF(4)(-)-bound structure representing the transition state (Mateja A, et al. (2009) Nature 461:361-366) indicates how the presence of a TA protein is communicated to the ATP-binding site. In vitro membrane insertion studies show that recombinant Get3 inserts Ramp4 in a nucleotide- and receptor-dependent manner. Although ATP hydrolysis is not required for Ramp4 insertion per se, it seems to be required for efficient insertion. We postulate that ATP hydrolysis is needed to release Get3 from its receptor. Taken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into posttranslational targeting of TA membrane proteins by Get3.

Coxibs interfere with the action of aspirin by binding tightly to one monomer of cyclooxygenase-1. Pain associated with inflammation involves prostaglandins synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways while thromboxane A(2) formed by platelets from AA via cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) mediates thrombosis. COX-1 and COX-2 are both targets of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) including aspirin whereas COX-2 activity is preferentially blocked by COX-2 inhibitors called coxibs. COXs are homodimers composed of identical subunits, but we have shown that only one subunit is active at a time during catalysis; moreover, many nsNSAIDS bind to a single subunit of a COX dimer to inhibit the COX activity of the entire dimer. Here, we report the surprising observation that celecoxib and other coxibs bind tightly to a subunit of COX-1. Although celecoxib binding to one monomer of COX-1 does not affect the normal catalytic processing of AA by the second, partner subunit, celecoxib does interfere with the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin in vitro. X-ray crystallographic results obtained with a celecoxib/COX-1 complex show how celecoxib can bind to one of the two available COX sites of the COX-1 dimer. Finally, we find that administration of celecoxib to dogs interferes with the ability of a low dose of aspirin to inhibit AA-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib are widely used for pain relief. Because coxibs exhibit cardiovascular side effects, they are often prescribed in combination with low-dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis. Our studies predict that the cardioprotective effect of low-dose aspirin on COX-1 may be blunted when taken with coxibs.

Factors Associated with Awareness, Attitudes and Practices Regarding Common Eye Diseases in the General Population in a Rural District in Bangladesh: The Bangladesh Population-based Diabetes and Eye Study (BPDES). To assess the awareness, attitudes, and practices associated with common eye diseases and eye care utilization in a rural district of Bangladesh. Data were collected using a multilevel cluster random sampling technique from 3104 adults aged ≥30 years from the Banshgram union with a questionnaire assessing the awareness, attitudes and practice about diabetes and common eye diseases, educational attainment, socio-economic status, and medical history. Participants were aged between 30 and 89 years with a mean (SD) age of 51 (12) years and 65% were female. The majority of participants had heard of cataracts (90%), trachoma (86%) and Pterygium (84%), yet only 4% had heard of diabetic retinopathy (DR), 7% of glaucoma and 8% of Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, 58% of participants did not know vision loss could be prevented. Factors associated with lower awareness regarding common eye diseases were increasing age, lack of formal schooling, and lower socio-economic status. A lower proportion (57%) of people with no schooling compared to those who had attained at least secondary school certificate education (72%) reported that they knew that vision loss could be prevented (p<0.001). Overall 51% of people had heard of at least six (67%) out of nine items relating to awareness of common eye diseases. This included 41% of participants aged 65 years or older compared to 61% of those aged 30-35 years (p<0.001). Only 4% had an eye check at least once a year and higher education and better SES were associated with higher frequency of eye checks. In rural Bangladesh awareness of cataract, trachoma and pterygium was good but limited in relation to the potentially blinding conditions of glaucoma, DR, and AMD. The results show a large gap between public awareness and treatment practices about common eye diseases. Public health promotion should be designed to address these knowledge gaps.

Reduction of circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 plays a significant role in renal dysfunction-associated aggravation of atherosclerosis. Renal dysfunction is commonly accompanied by a worsening of atherosclerosis; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. We examined the role played by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an endogenous antagonist of the proatherogenic cytokine placental growth factor (PlGF), in the worsening of atherosclerosis in patients with renal dysfunction and in an animal model of renal failure. In this study, 329 patients who received cardiac catheterization and 76 patients who underwent renal biopsy were enrolled. Both plasma sFlt-1 levels and renal sFlt-1 mRNA expression were positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (P<0.01). The PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio was negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (P<0.01), whereas plasma PlGF levels were not affected by it. The PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio was significantly higher in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease than in patients with single-vessel or no coronary artery disease. The reduction of circulating sFlt-1 and renal sFlt-1 mRNA levels was confirmed in five-sixths (5/6)-nephrectomized apolipoprotein E-deficient mice that developed experimental renal dysfunction. Atherosclerotic plaque area and macrophage infiltration into the plaque were significantly higher in 5/6-nephrectomized apolipoprotein E-deficient mice than in control mice, but replacement therapy with recombinant sFlt-1 significantly reduced both plaque formation and macrophage infiltration. The present study demonstrates that a reduction in the circulating levels of sFlt-1 is associated with the worsening of atherosclerosis that accompanies renal dysfunction.

Treatment of psoriasis with anti-TNF drugs during pregnancy: case report and review of the literature. Published experiences of TNF-alpha inhibition during pregnancy consist of a limited number of case reports, series and ongoing registry data in patients with arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. A 28-year-old woman - with psoriasis vulgaris since she was 8 years of age and generalized pustular psoriasis during her first pregnancy (partially controlled with ciclosporin, oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids, when lupus anticoagulant was detected at another hospital) - presented 4 months after delivery with severe psoriasis (PASI = 15.4) that did not respond to ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day). Ten days after the first infusion of infliximab (5 mg/kg), when the patient became aware that she was pregnant again, there was PASI75 response, and the patient wished to continue this treatment after being fully informed. Complete blanching was achieved by week 6 of treatment, and was maintained thereafter until the moment of writing (19 months after the start of treatment). She gave birth by caesarean delivery to a healthy female baby, who was breastfed for 1 month and has developed normally. The current report extends the available evidence on successful infliximab treatment in pregnant women, with the first case of a patient with psoriasis who presented impetigo herpetiformis during her previous pregnancy. No detectable adverse effects were detected in the neonate, despite potential exposure to infliximab throughout gestation and breastfeeding. Even though absolute safety is difficult to prove, available data suggest that women who become pregnant while taking infliximab or other anti-TNFalpha agents can be reassured regarding the continuation of pregnancy.

Comparison of the Prevalence and Predictors of Depression in Taiwanese and American Older Patients With Arthritis. To compare the prevalence and predictors of depression in Taiwanese and American older patients with arthritis. A secondary analysis was conducted to assess 151 Taiwanese and 70 American arthritic patients in Taipei, Taiwan and Chicago, USA. The prevalence of depression of Taiwanese and American older arthritic patients was 34% and 40%, respectively. Depression was explained by life satisfaction and functional ability in Taiwanese patients, and by life satisfaction and level of pain in American patients. Nurses should assess patients' level of pain and functional ability, as well as their life satisfaction and depression.

Bioactive Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactams from Lysobacter enzymogenes and Their Absolute Configurations by Theoretical ECD Calculations. Two new polycyclic tetramate macrolactams, lysobacteramides A (1) and B (2), together with HSAF (heat-stable antifungal factor, 3), 3-dehydroxy HSAF (4), and alteramide A (5) were isolated from a culture of Lysobacter enzymogenes C3 in nutrient yeast glycerol medium. Their structures were determined by MS and extensive NMR analysis. The absolute configurations of 1-5 were assigned by theoretical calculations of their ECD spectra. Although HSAF and analogues were reported from several microorganisms, their absolute configurations had not been established. The isolation and the absolute configurations of these compounds revealed new insights into the biosynthetic mechanism for formation of the polycycles. Compounds 1-4 exhibited cytotoxic activity against human carcinoma A549, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values ranging from 0.26 to 10.3 μM. Compounds 2 and 3 showed antifungal activity against Fusarium verticillioides with IC50 value of 47.9 and 6.90 μg/mL, respectively. 

Annexin IV is differentially expressed in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. To investigate the genes that were differentially expressed between clear cell carcinoma (CCC) and serous carcinoma (SAC) of the ovary with complementary DNA microarray. Complementary DNA microarray was carried out in 8 CCCs and 8 SACs of the ovary. Differentially expressed genes were identified and verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of the protein was also verified with immunohistochemistry and Western blot in cells and tissues of ovarian CCC. Comparison of the gene expression profiling identified 21 genes with more than 2-fold different expression between CCC and SAC of the ovary. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes were 9 and 12, respectively. The verification of Annexin IV in the cell line and tissues was in accordance with the result of the microarray. The complementary DNA microarray technique is a feasible way to explore the difference of the gene expression profiling between the 2 types of ovarian carcinoma. The overexpression of Annexin IV may be an ovarian CCC-specific molecular marker.


Microsurgical vasoepididymostomy for obstructive azoospermia.

Review: Time-space translation regulates trunk axial patterning in the early vertebrate embryo. Here, we review a recently discovered developmental mechanism. Anterior-posterior positional information for the vertebrate trunk is generated by sequential interactions between a timer in the early non-organiser mesoderm and the Spemann organiser. The timer is characterised by temporally colinear activation of a series of Hox genes in the early ventral and lateral mesoderm (i.e., the non-organiser mesoderm) of the Xenopus gastrula. This early Hox gene expression is transient, unless it is stabilised by signals from the Spemann organiser. The non-organiser mesoderm (NOM) and the Spemann organiser undergo timed interactions during gastrulation which lead to the formation of an anterior-posterior axis and stable Hox gene expression. When separated from each other, neither non-organiser mesoderm nor the Spemann organiser is able to induce anterior-posterior pattern formation of the trunk. We present a model describing that NOM acquires transiently stable hox codes and spatial colinearity after involution into the gastrula and that convergence and extension then continually bring new cells from the NOM within the range of organiser signals that cause transfer of the mesodermal pattern to a stable pattern in neurectoderm and thereby create patterned axial structures. In doing so, the age of the non-organiser mesoderm, but not the age of the organiser, defines positional values along the anterior-posterior axis. We postulate that the temporal information from the non-organiser mesoderm is linked to mesodermal Hox expression. The role of the organiser was investigated further and this turns out to be only the induction of neural tissue. Apparently, development of a stable axial hox pattern requires neural hox patterning.


"Should I tell my employer and coworkers I have arthritis?" A longitudinal examination of self-disclosure in the work place.

Neural signal sensing, transmission and functional regeneration on different toads' bodies. The presence of neural signals is the most important feature of animals' life. Monitoring, analysis and regeneration of neural signals are important for the rehabilitation of paralyzed patients. In this paper, the neural signal regeneration between the proximal and the distal end of an injured nerve is introduced. In the experiment a microelectronic module is used as a channel bridge. The regeneration of nerve signals is realized from one toad's sciatic nerve to another's. Corresponding neural signals and EMG were recorded and analyzed. It will be a reference to further study on the neural signals and the relationship between a neural signal and the muscle locomotion.

Expression of interferon-alpha and Mx protein in the livers of pigs experimentally infected with swine hepatitis E virus. Expression of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and Mx protein in the livers of pigs experimentally infected with swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) was examined immunohistochemically. Five infected and five non-infected pigs were killed at 3, 7, 14, 21, 29 and 50 days post-inoculation (dpi). Tissues were collected from each pig at necropsy. Multifocal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis (P=0.042) and focal hepatocellular necrosis (P=0.037) were significantly more frequent in the swine HEV-infected pigs than in the non-infected control pigs. Immunohistochemical analysis detected expression of IFN-alpha and Mx protein by macrophages/Kupffer cells, lymphocytes and hepatocytes in the livers of infected pigs.

Predictors of global cognitive impairment 1 year after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and impact on functional outcome and quality of life (QOL) of global cognitive impairment 1 year after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We prospectively evaluated global cognitive status 3 and 12 months after hospitalization with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in 232 subarachnoid hemorrhage survivors. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of 30 or less (scaled 0 = worst, 51 = best). Logistic regression was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for impairment at 1 year. Basic activities of daily living were evaluated with the Barthel Index, instrumental activities of daily living were assessed with the Lawton scale, and QOL was evaluated with the Sickness Impact Profile. The frequency of cognitive impairment was 27% at 3 months and 21% at 12 months. After the effects of age, education, and race/ethnicity were controlled for, risk factors for cognitive impairment at 12 months included anemia treated with transfusion (AOR, 3.4; P = 0.006), any temperature level higher than 38.6 degrees C (AOR, 2.7; P = 0.016), and delayed cerebral ischemia (AOR, 3.6; P = 0.01). Among cognitively impaired patients at 3 months, improvement at 1 year occurred in 34% and was associated with more than 12 years of education and the absence of fever higher than 38.6 degrees C during hospitalization (P = 0.015). Patients with cognitive impairment at 1 year had worse concurrent QOL and less ability to perform instrumental and basic activities of daily living (all P < 0.001). Global cognitive impairment affects more than 20% of subarachnoid hemorrhage survivors at 1 year, is predicted by fever, anemia treated with transfusion, and delayed cerebral ischemia, and adversely affects functional recovery and QOL.

Effects of sildenafil on maternal hemodynamics and fetal growth in normal rat pregnancy. It has been suggested that the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil may be useful in the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. However, we have reported a selective increase in renal inner medullary PDE5 that participates in the sodium retention of pregnancy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether oral sildenafil treatment impairs maternal plasma volume expansion and/or fetal growth during rat pregnancy. Rats received sildenafil (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), 50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), or 90 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle on days 4-20 of pregnancy. On days 14-19, rats were housed in metabolic cages for collection of urine and measurement of food and water intake. Terminal hemodynamic and fetal measurements were taken on day 20. None of the sildenafil doses lowered blood pressure, and although all doses increased plasma cGMP concentrations, only the highest dose increased aortic and inner medullary cGMP content. Sildenafil had no effect on maternal weight gain; however, the highest dose decreased both plasma volume and renal sodium retention. The pup number and size were similar among the groups. Therefore, these studies suggest that low doses of systemic sildenafil may be safe during pregnancy in the rat, but higher doses may interfere with the physiological sodium retention and volume expansion of pregnancy. The effects of systemic sildenafil on blood pressure and sodium retention during hypertension in human pregnancy remain to be examined.

[Effects of Kaempferol on activation, proliferation and cell cycle of mouse T lymphocytes in vitro.]. To study the effects of Kaempferol on activation, proliferation and cell cycle of murine T lymphocytes, and to elucidate the mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of Kaempferol. Lymphocytes were prepared from lymphoid nodes of mouse, and were stimulated with polyclonal activators ConA, and then were co-cultured with Kaempferol of different final concentration. The effect on the expression of CD69 (the early marker of the activated T cells) on T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry combined with two colored monoclonal antibodies flow cytometry. While, the effect of Kaempferol on the proliferation of T lymphocytes in response to ConA stimulation was determined by MTT, cell cycle was detected by PI staining. Kaempferol (final concentration is 10, 20 and 40 mumol/L) can inhibit the expression of CD69 on activated T lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The expression rate of CD69 on T cells in response to ConA was (39.11+/-1.17)%. After treatment with Kaempferol, the expression rate of CD69 reduced to (30.64+/-0.23)%, (27.95+/-0.04)% and (5.63+/-0.37)%, respectively (P< 0.05); The result of MTT showed that Kaempferol can inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05); The result of PI staining showed that Kaempferol can arrest cell cycle at S phage and G2/M at all experimental concentration (P<0.05). Kaempferol can effectively inhibit the activation, proliferation of mouse T lymphocytes in respond to ConA, arrest cell cycle at S phage and G2/M in vitro.
