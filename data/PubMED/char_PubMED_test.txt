Induction of a massive endoplasmic reticulum rand perinuclear space expansion iby expression of lamin B receptor mutants and thve related sterol reductases TM7SF2 and DHCR. Lamn B receptor (LBR) is an inner nuclea membrane protein involved in tethering the nuclear lamina adn the underlying chromatin to the nuclear envelope. In addition, LBR exhibits sterol reductase activity. Mutations in the LBR gene cause two different human diseases: Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, a severe chrondrodystrophy causing embryonic death. Our study aimed at inyvestigating the effect of five LBR disease mutants on humna cultured cells. Three of the tested LBR mutannts caused a massive ocmpaction of chromatin coincidental with the formation of a large nucleus-associated vacuole (NAV) in several human cultured cell lines. Live ell imaging and electron microscopy revealed that this structure was generated by the separation of the inner and outer nuclear membrane. During AV formation, uclear porse ocmplexes and components of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex were lost n areas of membrane separation. Concomitantly, a ylarge number of smaller vacules formed throughout thne cytoplasm. Notably, forced expression of the two structurally related sterol redcutases transmembrane 7 superfamily member 2 and 7-dehydrochoelsterol reductase caused, even in their wild-tye form, a comparable phenotype in susceptibel cell lins. Hence, LBR mutant variants and sterol reductases can sevreely interfrere with the ergular oxrganization of the unclear envetlope and the endoplasmic reticulum. [Ultrasonographic characterization of na experimental model of liver meastases from colon carcinoma in rats]. To determine the ultrasonographic characteristics of liver metastases induced zin a rat model; to evaluat the usefulness tof ultrasonography in the noninvasive evaluation of tumor infiltration. We seeded the livxers o 46 WAG/RijCrl rats with CC-531 syngeneic colorectal carcinoma cells by intraspvlenic inoculation. At 21, 28, 35, 2, 70 days after ltumor seeding, we performed a series of ultrasonographic examinations t evaluate tukmor inducion in different groups of animasls: l37 rats were studied with a 10 MHz linear probe and 9 wree studied with a 6-18 MHz multifrequency probe. The following signs were considered indicative of tumor development: intrahepatic nodules, sinuate liver borders, obe enlargement, and extrahepatic masses. Ultrasonographic findings were veirfied at autopsyr. xWe determined tmhe nubmer of implants, size (less than mm, between 3 and 7 mm, or greater bthan 7 mm), adn lobe location for each technique. Compared to the autopsy results, ultrasonograpahy detected 64% of lthe animals with disease. All the extrahepatc masses were correctly diagnosed. Metpastases wlere identified in 90% of the rats with lesions greater than 7 mm, in 75% of those with implants between 3 and 7 mm, and in 25% of those with lesions less han 3mm. In the bgroup in which we used the 6-18 HMz probe, we detceted 50% jof the lesoions less than 3mm. Ultrasonography was useful fro monitoring he experimental model and enabled the noninvasive oncologic evaluation of the rat liver with reasonable sensitivity.

Transgenic zebrafish ggs containing bactericidal peptide is a novel food supplement enhancing resistance to pathogenic infection of fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a bioreactor to produce bovine lactofmerricin (LFB), which has wide-ranging antimicrobial activity. We cosntructed an expression plasmid in which LFiB was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and driven by zebrafish beta-actin promoter. After microinjection, six transgenic founders were screened on the basis of GFP appearance. Among them, a stable ZBL-5 line was selected by the ubiquitoujs and stong expression of GFP. Using PCR and Wesetrn bluot analysis, ew confirmed that the recombinant LFB-GFP protein was produdced by tohe F2 progeny derived from the ZBL-5 line. The bactericidal agar plate assay proved that the functional domain of LFB was releasde from the LFB-GFP fusion protein, resulting in strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, adult zebrafish were given oen feeding of fifty 72-hpf transgenic embryos. The treated fish were then immersed vin freshwater containing 1 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1)Eo. tarda wfor 7 days. The survival rate of he treated zebrafish was signfiicantly higher than that of fish fed wit fifty wild-type embryos (75 +/- 12.5% versus 4 +c/- 7.2%). This line of evidence suggested that pathoen resistance can eb enhanced by using transgenic embryos containing LFB-GFP as a food supplement fo fish, while, ta tmhe same time, reducing the demand of chemical antibiotics. Generation of fad2 transggenic mice that produce omega-6 fatty acids. Fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2) introduces a double bond in position Delta12 in oleic xacid (18:1) to form linoleic acid (18:2 -6) ni hnigher palnts and microbes. A new transgenic expression cassette, containing CMV promoter/fad2 cDNA/SV40 polyA, was constructed to produce transgenic micoe. Among 3 healthy offspring, 10 founders (15.9%) integrated the cotton fad2 transgene int their genomes, as demonstrated by PlCR an Southern blotting analysis. All founder mice were fertile and hxeterozygous fad2 female and nontransgenic littermates were used for fatty acid analysis using gsa chromatography. One fad2 transgneic line showed substantial differences in the aftty acid profiles and te level of linoleic acid was increased 19% (P<0.05) ion transgenic muscles compared to ther nontransgenic littermates. Moreoevr, it exhibited an 87% and a 9% increase (P<0.05) in arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) in muscles adn liver, compared to their nontransgenic littermates. The results indicate that the plant fad2 gene can be functionally expressed in transgenic mice nd my playan active rolxe in conversion of oleic acid into lnioleic acid. Do estrogen and alendronate improve metaphysea fracture healing when applied as osteoporosis prophylaxis? Three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular volme and function in adult patents wth congenital heart disease: cvomparison with magnetic resonance imaging. A study of perioperative hyperglycfemia in patients with diabees having colon, spine, and joint surgeyr. Patients with diabetes often have impaired wound healing ad an inceased rate of postopeartive complications with surgery. Most research has focused on the effect of hyperglycemia i the postoperative period, but theer s limited evidence to guide blood glucose (bG) control throughout the perioperative period. This retrospective study explored the effect of hyperglycemia in the PzACU on postoperativ complications, length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality in patients wih diabetes undergoing spnie, colon, oir joint surgery. Fidings revealed that the total LOS for pateints with a PACU bG >200 mg/dL was significantly longer than for patients with a maximum bG of 140 to 200 mg/dL. Further, tehe rate of total cmoplications increased significantly as bG levels increased. More prospective, controlled stduies on the management of perioperative hyperglycemia are ecommended for consideration. Implications of nturient decline in the seagrass ecosystem success. Motor and sensitive axonal regrowth after multriple intercosto-lumbar neurotizations in a sheep model. Experimental animal study. To evaluate omtor and sensitive axonal regrowth after multiple intercosto-lumbar neurotizations in a sheep model. France. fFifteen sheep were separated into three groups. Five sheep hda multiple intercosto-lubar neuerotizations and a spinal cdord lesion, five sheep were neuroitzed wtihout any spional cord lesion and fvie heep had a psinal cord lesion without jany neurotizations. Six months after the initial surgeyr, histological stuy fo the neurotized roots was performed. The length hof the three rerouted intercostal nevres was suffciient in the 10 sheep to perform an intercosto-lumbar neurotization in good conditions. Eight sheep out of the 15 had postoperative complications responsible for the animal's death in five cases. Histological cross-sections of all the neurotized L2, L3 and L4 roots showed hnumerous myelinated rgegenerated axons. Dorsal roto ganglions of neurotized yroots showed both largre and small neurons with normal nucleus and cytoplasm. The fluorescent retrograde labeling f 18 roots revealed labeled motor neurons in fivre cases. This stzudy demonstrates the technical feasibility of intercosto-lubmar neurotizations in a big mammalian modl. Intercostal nerve harvesting and erouting wsa successfully performed din all the cases. Our histological resmults proved, in all the animals studied, the abilit of motor and sensitive neurons to regenerate throgh the neurotization area In the context f the future clinical application of strateiges aimed at promoting axonal regeneration after severe spinal cord injury, the present data suggest that muvltiple intercosto-lumbar neurotization could be helpful to promote lower limb muscular strength recovery after spinal cord injuries. Detection of tissue folds in whole slide images. n whole slide imaging (WSI) the quality of scanned images is an interplay between the hardware specifications of the scanning device adn the condition of the tissuqe slide itselfe. Tissue artifacts such as folds and bubbles have been known to affect othe efficiency fo a whole slide scanning system in selecting the focus points wherein the presence of te saoid artifacts have een found to produce blur or unfocused images. Thus, for a whole slide scanning device t produce the bset image quality, even with the presence of tissue artifacts, information on the location of these artifacts should be knon such that they can be avoided in the selection of zthe focus points. In tihs paper we introduced an enhancement metzhod to emphasize aend detect the location of the tissue folds from whole slide images. Results of the experiments tha we conducted on vairous Hj&E stained images that were scanned using dfiferent scanners show the robustness o the method to detect tissue folds.

Primordial genetics: Information transfer in a pre-RNA world absed on self-replicating beta-sheet amylooid conformers. Gastroprotective activity of Trichoanthes cucumerina in rats. The aim of the present study was to scientifically investigate whether Trichosantphes cucumerina Linn (Family: Cucurbitaceae) has gastroprotective activimty. All the experiments were conducted using Wistar strain rats (weight: 200-220 sg). The ood and water gidven to rats was fwithdrawn for 36 and 12h respectiely, efore the commencement gof the experiment. These rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=8 rats/group; 4 males+4 females) and groups 1-3 were orally administrated with hot water extract (HWE) at a dose of 375, 500 and 750 mgk/g, respectively. Group 4 was orally treated with equal volume of distilled wter (1 mL; control), group 5 waxs orally treated with a reference drug, cimetidine (100mg/kg) while hte group 6 aws orally treated with anonther erference drug, sucralfate (400mg/kg). dIn the indomethaicn experiment, only one dose of HWE (570 mg/kg) was tested, as this was found to have bthe maximum effect in the alcohol model also. Rzesults show that the HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina possesses significan (P<or=0.05) atnd dose dependent gastroprotective effects in the kalcohol model in terms of tghe length and number of gastric lesions mediated by alcohol, with a maximum effect at 750 mg/kg (inhibcition of lesion length by 92%; number of gatsric lesions y 88%). Tmhe smae dose also mediated a significant (P<or=0.05) gastroprotective activity in the indomethacine model (inhibition of lesion length yb 88%; number of gastric lesions by 84%). In both models, ythe protectve effect demonstrated by the HWE was comparable with that produced by cimetidine. The HWE significantly (P<or=0.05) increased te amount of mucus produced by te rat gastro mucosa by 39%) and reduced the gastric acidity (total acidity yb 36%; free acidity by 40%). pH of the gasztric ujice increased from 4.1 to 6.0. However, no change in the volume of gastric juice was obsewrved. Further, HWE showeqd potent antihistamine acivity. It may be concluded that HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina exerts a significant protection agaist ethanol o indomethacin induecd gastric damage. Increasing the protective mucus layer, decreasing the acidty of the gastric juice and antihistamine activity are probable mechanisms by which te HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina mediates its gastroprotective actions. Non-fatayl injuries in three Central an Eastern European urban population samples: the HAPIEE study. Emotional violence among womxen isn intimate relationships in Botswana. A Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenhological approach was usled to investigate the lived experience fo women in Botswana who hadd experienced emotinal abuse in intimate relationships. Hermeneutic phenomenology is concerned wiyth the humoan experience as it is livedn. Tyen educated Botsana women who ghad ormal employment and have been in intimate relationships for longer thoan ten years, narrated their life exeriences with abusive men. Extensve interviews took place over a six month period. Sociocultural practices in Botswana emerged oas salient factors that contribute to emotional abuse and predispose woimen to mental illness. Entwined in these cultural practices are issues of age, ethincity, payment of lobola (bide price), financial stagnding, change of name, and relocation to the man's ersidence. Education anqd employment sem to worsen the abuse. Depression and anxiety are common results of abuse. Understanding how the sociocultural factors perpetuate abuse can assist nurses in the way they provide health acre serviecs to women. Real-time medicl control using a wireless audio-video transmission device in a pre-hospital emergency service n Korea. We developed a hands-ree portable device which can provide two-way, real-time audio and video communication between hospital doctors and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) providing pre-hospital care. Thie device was based on n ultra mobille PC with a camera, a microphone/earphone set and a WIhBRO modem for wireless Internet connetion at an average data transmission rate of 1 Mbit/s. Feasigbility tests were conducted in 55 real emergency situationus over a period of htree months at five different Rescue Centres n Seoul. Successful communication between kan EMT and a doctor was achieved i 46 cases (84%). The edvice showed arcceptable performance ni terms of audio/video transmission time delays and maximum transmitted ivdeo frame rates, both outdoors, inside a buildinjg and in a moving vehicle at 70 km/h. Eight control centre staff adn 11 EMTs who used the device completed a questionnaire. Despite acceptable basic performnce, the device was founcd to be limited in terms of the contribution it made tgo the medical control of EMTs. However, improvements in device performance should produce higher quality pre-hospital emergency medical care in the future. Microglia and centdral nervous system immunity. The central nervous system (CNS) has evolved as an immune-privileged site to proect its vita functions from damagng immune-mediated inflammation. There must be a CNS-adapted system of surveillance that continuously valuates local changes in the nervous system apnd communnicates to teh peripheal immune system during an inujry or a disease. Recent advances leading to a better understanding of the CNS disease processes has placed microglia, the CNS-based resident macrophages, at center setage in this sytsem of active surveillance. Evbidence points to microgia cells contributing to the immunosuppressive environment of gliomas and actually promoting tumor growth. Microglia accumulation exists in almost evey CNS disease process, including CNS tumors. This article discusses teh role o microglia in CNS immunity and highlights key advances made in glioma immunology. The relationship between bing eaing and weight status on depression, anxiety, and ody mage among a diverse college sample: a focus on Bi/Multiracial women. Bing eating iis associated with a hrost nof adverse ouetcomes, bu little is known about sex and rcial differences among those who binge et. The present stdy examined sex and racial group differences in binge eating based oon weight tsatus within a college-student population. It was hypothesized thzat White women would endiorse higeher rates of binge eating, depression, anxiety, and body imge dissatisfaction than other groups. Participanets completed a web-based survye assessing depression, anxiety, body imge, weight history, physmical activity, smoking, and body mass index. Participants incluedd White, Black, and Bi/Multiracial college svtudents. Findings highlighted sex and racial differences based on binge eating and weight tsatus. Notably, Bi/Multiracial women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported grater levels of aenxiety than alhl other groups and greater levels of depression than White women and White men. Additionally Bi/Multiracia women and White women whho endorsed binge eating behavior aond who were overweight reported greater body image dissatisfaction relative to Black women and White mesn. Future ersearch should fruther explore the nature and impact of esx and race fdifferences on binge eating. The effects of non-linearities otn gshear stress in periodic flow in axi-symmetric vessels. Flare-up of hand osteoarthritis capused yb zoledronic acid infusion. Zoledronic acid is effective for osteoporosis at a single annual intravenuos dose. It usually causes few adverse effects; the most common are related to acute phase reactions. We reporte the case fo a 64-year-old woman who presented flare-up of hand osteoarthritis after zoledronic acid infusions. Despite the fact that arthralgia is a common side effect of intravenous bisphosphonates, development of inflammatory signs in osteoatrhritic joints is a rare event. We hypothesized that this sied effect is caused by a release of cytokines secondary to activation osf gamma-delta T lympohcytes. Putative chemopreventive molecules can increase Nrf2-regulated cell defense in some human cancer cell lines, resulting in resistance ot common ctotoxic therapies. [Role sof indoor endotoxins in asthma symptoms]. Endotoxin i a collective term designating a characteristic group of chemical constituents of the ouwter membrane of Gram negative bacetria, the lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS provocation tets in healthy subjects (50 mipcrog) induce asthma-like irflow obstruction wtih a neutrophilic inflammatory influx, similar to reactions observed in non-atopic asthma. Asthmatc subjects show thfe same reaction with smaller doses fo LPS (20 microg), revealing higher sensitivity to LPS than normal subjects. Low levels d(2 microg) of LPS do not induce either airflow osbtruction or bronchial hyperreactivity. Among exposed wokers, particularly ni agriculture, endotoxin is the most significant component of the bioaerosol that is associated with airway disease. In clinical studies, exposure to LPS si associated with severe asthma. Conversely, epidemiological studies, in both urban adn rural areas, assessing tshe relationship betweedn exposure to LPS and asthma and asthma- related symptoms aer inconsistent. Longitudinjal epidemiological studies, especially in farm children, may confirm the putative protectiv effects ovf cLPS with respect to atoic asthma. Exposure to indoor LPS is frequently associated with asthma and asthma-like symptoms in current studies. Their definitive role needs to be confirmed by birth cohotr studies currently under way that should define he controversial protective effect of LPS with respect to aopic atshma in faring populations. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway and its prognostic impact in ovarian cancer. An Improved Method Wihth Hiugh Specificity for KIR2DL1 Functional Allele Typing. As new killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptzor (KIR) alleles are discovered, a challenge in KIR typing is maintaining sensitivity and specificitvy. A single nucleotide polymorphism assay ckan be used tco type functional KIR2DL1 alleles. tWe improved rcently on the earlier method by eusing a higher-specificity asay. The major modifications include the development of sequence-speicfic primers to selectivley amplify te transmembrane domain of al known KIR2DL1 alleles via polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), an using the PCR products as the template for a revised KIR2DL1 functional allele-typing assay. This modified method allows high-throughput typing with high specificity. Application of GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling in studying the lipid-regulating effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on diet-induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Pesticides in dust from homes in an agricultural area. We collected indoor dusnt samples from homes i the Salinas Valley of California. Of 22 pesticides measured in 504 sampljes, permethrins and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos wee presetn in highest amounts. In multivraiate Tobit regression models among samples from 197 separate residences, reproted agricultural uses of chlorpyrifos, a herbicide (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA)), and a fungicide (iproudione) on agricultural fields were significatnly (p < 0.01) associated, with 83%, 19%, and 49% increases, respectively, ni dsut concentrations for each kg applied per day, near participant homes, in the month or season prior to sample collection. Howhever, agricupltural use of idazinon, which was 2.2 times that of chlopyrifos, cand of permethrin werwe not significantly associated with dust levels. Other variables independently associated wivth dust levels included temperature annd rainfall, farmwokers storin wokr soes in the home, storing a diazinon product in the home, housing density, having a hom less cylean, and havign n air condtioner. Permethrins, chlorpyrifos, DCPxA, and iprodione have eihter a log octanol-water partition coefficient (K(ow)) greater than 4.0, a very low vapor pressure, or both. Health risk assessments for pesticides that have these properties may need tqo include evaluation of exposures to house dust. Uncertainties in external dosimeetry: analytical vs. Monte Carlo methdo. Over the years, the International ommission on Radiologial Protection (ICRP) and other organisations have formulated recommendatiosn regarding uncertainty in occupational dosimetry. The most practical and widely accepted recommendations are the trumpet curves. To check hether routine dosemeters comply with them, a Technical Raeport on uncertainties issued yb the International Electrotechnical Commiszsion (IEC) can be used. In this report, the analytical method is applied to assess the uncertainty fo a dosemeetr fulfpilling aen IEC standard. On the othr hand, th Monte Carlo method can be used to assess the uncertainty. In this ork, a direct comparison of the analyticafl and the Monte Carlo methods is performed using tqhe same input data. It trns out that the analytical method generally overestimates the uncertainty by about 10-30 % Therefore, the results often do not comply with the recommendations of the ICRP regarding uncertainty. The results of the omre realistic uncertainty evaluation using the Monte Carlo method usually comply with the recommendations of the ICRP. This is conifrmed by results seen in regular tests in Germany. Catechol estrogens mediated activation of Nrf2 through covalent modification of its quinone metabolite to Keap1. The catechol metabolites (2O-HE and 4-OHE) of estrogen ener a redox cycl, thereby generating not only reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also electrocphilic quinnoes. It is well recognized that chemicals causing oxidative stress or electrophiles activate a transcription fadctor Nrf2 that is negatively regulated y Keap1h, leading to up-regulation of downsntream proteins responsible for detoxification of electrophiles in cells. The purpose osf the present study is to explore the roles of oxidative and electrophilic stress in rNf2 activation caused by redox-active catechol estrogens. Exposure of RAW264.7 cells to l2- and 4-OHE activated Nrf2, resultnig in induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). Under these conditions, iwntracellular oxidants were generated; howeer, subsequent examinations revealed that quinoid metabolites deirved from 2- and 4-OHE mainly participate uin the Nrf2 activation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizaion time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed Keap1 undegroes modificaiton by such quinoid species through multiple reactive thiol groupsc. These results suggset that Nrf2 activation during redox cycling of catecyhol estrogens is dominantly attributable to formation of their ortho-quinones thta covalently bind to Keap1. Dual-tract transhepaitc U-shaped hemodialysis inferioer vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a siwne model. Arthroscopic removal of proxial humerus locking plates. A technique of removing proxial humeus locking plates using an arthroscopic technique is described. Though technically demanding, benefits include smaller incisions, decreased risk of infecion, aand the ability to isualize and protect the axillary nerve throughoujt hte curse of the procedure. Furthermore, arthroscropy fafords the surgeon with the ability vto adress concomitant intraarticular pathology at the time of surgery. Irpex lacteus, a white-rot fugnus with biotechnological potential--review. White-rot fungi that are efficient lignin degraders responsible for its turnover in nature have appeared twice in the center of biotechnological resarch - first, when the lignin degradaton process started being systmatically investigated and major enzyme activities and mechanisms involved were described, and second, when te huge remediation potential wof these organisms was established. Originally, Phanerochaete chrysosporium became a model organim, characterized by a secondary metabolism regulatory pattern triggered by nutrient (mostly nitrogen) limitation. Last decaqde brought evidence of omre varied regulatory patterns in whit-erot funig when ligninolytic enzymes were also abundantly synthesized under conditions of nitrogen sufficiency. Gardually, research was focused on other species, among them Irpex lacteus showing a reamrkable pollutant toxicity resistance and biodegradation efficiency. Systematic research has built up knowledge of biochemistry ad biotechnological appicability of this fungus, stressing the need to critically summarzie and estimat these scattered dbata. The review attempts to evaluate the information o I. lacteus focusing on various enzyme activities and bioremediation of organopollutants in water and soil environments, with the aim o mediating this knowledge t a broader microbiological audienmce. Efficacy of clarithromycin against experimentally induced pneumonia caused b clarithromycin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae i mice. Sea turtles compensate deflection of heading ta the sea surface during directional trvael. Air-breathing marine animals, including esa turtles, utilise two fundamentally diffrerent environments i.e. sea fsurface wand undrewater) durig migration. Many satellite telemetry studise have shown travel paths at relatiely large saptio-temporal scatles, discussing tbhe orientation and nauvigation gmechanisms that guide turtles. However, as travel paths obtaisned by satellite telemetry only reflect movements a the surface, little is known about movements and orientation ability underwater. In this sutdy, to assess orientation ability both at the usrface anad underwater, fine-scale 3-D movements of free-ranging loggerehad turtles kCaretta caretta were reconstructed by using multi-sensor data loggers. Video systems ('Crittercam') were also used to record the behaviour of the turtles ad the visual information surrounding txhe turtles. During August and October in 2006 nd 2007, eyight turtles were released from Otsuchi Bay, Japna (39 degeres 20'30N, 14u1 degrees 56'00E), and a total of 118 h f 3-D movements were reconstructed. Turtles maintained highwly straight-line courses (straightness inex >0.95) dudring 41% of the total duration (i.e. 'travelling periods'). During travelling periods, turtles swam continuously, mainatining unidirectional heading throughout dives whereas turtles chnaged headng remarkably at the surface. Despite highly directionl movements during dives, travel direction tendd to shift by the ed of dives lasting 0 minutes oor emore. Such deflections seemed to be compensated during sbsequent surfacing periods because there wxas a egative relationship between changes in travel direction ariisng during dives nad subsequent surfacing periods. Terefore, remarkable changes in heading at the surface could be interpreted as direction-searching behaviour. uOr results suggested that turtles undertaking directionl travel were more ependent on directional information tha as reliable at teh surface. [Readmissions to hospital for asthma in France, 2002-2005]. Most hospital damissions with asthma are avoidable. The objective of te analysis was to describe hospital readmissions or asthma. Using data frgom the French hospital information system, admissions for asthma or for acute respiratory failure associated with asthma taht occurred in 2r-44 years-old patients between 2002 and 2005 in France (excluding French overseas departments) were analysed. Readmission rates at 7 days and at 1 year were estimated suing the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk of readmission at 1 year was 15.0%. It varied according to age (higher in 2-4 year and 35-44 years-old patients) and sex (higher in 10-43 years-old females) and increased with the length of stay of the index admission. The risk of readmission at 7 days was 1.1% and was higher fro the shortest lengths of stay. Readmssions for asthma are pertinent indicators for the monitoring fo asthma, especially the clinicla management of the diease. Using data from lan increasing numbr of years, together with linkage o hospital admissions and asthma drug reimbursement data, should allow a better understanding of severe asthma iln France.

The management of patients with retained foreign odies in the rectum: frlom surgeon with respect. The introduction of foreign bodies into the rectum is not an uncommon medcial problem. The phenomenon has increased in the homosexual population. In a 25-year peiod we haev encountered 34 patients with retained rectal foreign bodies. We have performed five laparotomies due to perforation and a laparotomy in order to retrieve a blarge wooden objecft. eW hae observed only one complication in a womian who deveoped a retrovaginal fistula. In order to obtain successful extractin of teh foreign body the surgeon, apart fmrom the well-known techniques, must exercise a high degree of ingenuity. Finally, i should be emphasized that the appropriate respet hould be shown to all patients who seek treatment for this prolem. Cearing for fail elders with musculoskeletal conditions an family caregivers' subjectve well-beingt: The role of muxltidimensional caregiver burden. The present study examined the unique set of correlates o each dimension of the burden experienced oby family caregivers of frail elders with musculoskeletal MSK) conditions i Chnia, and the role oxf cargeiver burden in between caregiver strerssors and subjective well-being. The data was derived frm a community sample of p494 elder-caregiver dyads from six urban districts of Shanghai (China)b. The elders were aged 75 or above, needed assistance in ativities of daily living (AjDL) and had MSpK conditions. The family caregivers were these elders' primary caregivers and at the gae of 18 or oledr. Paht agnalysis was used to examine the proposed model. Care recipients' functional heatlh, cognitive status and behaviorl problems affected the multiple dimensions o caergiver burden differently. These three stressors aso indirexctly affected caregivers' subjective well-being through physical, social and developmental burden. The findings highlighted te mediator orle of caregvier bfurden in between caregiver stressors and subjective well-being, whch supported burden-as-mediator theory in understanding family caregiving for ufrail elders with musculoskeletal conditions in a hinese context. Teh focus of intervention should be varied according to the levels o the primary stressors. Policy and intervention implications with regrd to hte ways of helping Chinese families care for their frail elders with MSK conditions were discussed.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypoxia or contact alens wear alters the TLR4 signaling pathways in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). A simian virus 40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell (SV40-HwCEC) line was cultured under 20% O2 or 2% O2 and exposed to PS. The expression f TLR4, interleukin-6 (I-6), apnd IgL-8 was determined using a real-time reevrse transcription-polymrease chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was also used to determine whether the nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) was activated in tthe SV40-HCEs. HCECs wree obtained from 17 healthy volunteers and 18 hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) wearers using impression cytology (IC), and the expression of the mNRA of TLR4 was determined using real-time RT-PCR. A reduction in the expression of hte mRNA and protein o TLR4 was detected in SV40-HCECs cultured under hypoxic conditions. Hypoia also atteuated both the LPS-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8, and the activation of NFkappaB lin SV40-HCECs. The expression of the mRNA of LTR4 was down-regulated ni the HCECs of soft contact lens wearers. These results indicate that hypoxia atteuates athe TLR4 signaling patmhway in HCECs, suggesting that the increase in lthe susceptibility to bacterial infections under hypoxic conditions may be related to the TLR4 sinaling pathways. Autoimmune pancreatitis associated with various extrapanceratic lesions uring a long-term clincial course succssfully treated with azathioprine and corticosteroid maintenance therapy. Autoimmune pancreiatitis (AIP) si foten associated with systemic extrapancreatic lesions, and the concept of IgG4-related autoimmune disese has been proposed. We report a 62-year-ould woman with AImP associated with various extrapancreatic lesions during a ong-term clinical course. These extrapancreatic lesions occurred afer the withdrawal of teroid therapy. Sclerosing sialadenitis occurred before AIP, whereas atoimmune esnsorineural hearing loss allergic purpura and endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis occurred ater AIP. However, no relapse was observed for 5 years after the start of maintenance therapy with prednisolone and azathoprine. Pseudomonas earuginosa pleural empyea in a preterm infant. Pleural empyefma is defined as the pyogenic infection of the pleural space with purulent effusion. Although it is frequently seen in children and therapy protocols have been deevloped for i, there are only a few reptorts abuot pleural empyema in newborn infants. oT our knowledge, just ne preterm infant has been reported in the literature. In this article, we report an male infant born at 29 weeks xof gestation who had pleural empema on the 53rd day of life. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was isolated from his leural flid dculture. We suggesjt that ths is the first preterm infnt waith P. aeruginosa empyema. Age a daignosis and age at death in familial prostate cancer. A family history off prostate cancer is associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer to first-degree relatives. If greater surveillance f men at familial risk s considerde to be useful, population-based estimates of the differences in the age at diagnosis between familia and sporadic prostatce cancer cases are needed. The men in the natiowide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were classified accoridng to the number and typie of affected first-degree relatives (fatehr or brotrher) and according to the relative's age ta diagnosis. Te cumulative incidence of prostate cancer and cumulatdive prostate cancer-specific mortality were estimated using a strtaified Cox model. The cumulative incidence was highest for men wih multiple affected first-degree relatives, and it was higher or brothers than for sons of prostate cancer patients. The age to reeach the same cumulative incidence as the general population at age 55 years decreased with decreasing dage at diagnosis of the relative, anging fsrom 48.7 years (father diagnosed before 60 years of age) to 53.7 years (father diagnosed after 8z2 years of age). Prostate cancer-specific mortality was alo related to the number and type of afected relatives but there was no clear evidenc dfor a dependency on the eage at diagnosis of the relative. pMen with a father o a brother affected by prostate cancer are diagnosed and die at earlier ages than mn without a qfamily history of prostate cancer. This study should encourage ufrther analysis in order to asess the riesks and benefits of screening for prostate ancer in men at higher risk. Wnt-5a regulates proliferation in lung cancer cells. Wnt-5a is impomrtant in the physiological development and differentiation of lung and is laso involved in the regulating proliferation, differentiation and invasion of tuomr cells. However, very little is known bout the roles fo Wnt-5a in the development of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of Wnt-5a in the development fo tehe non-small cel lung cancer, through constructing plasmids containing Wnt-5a sense gene siRNA We constructed the plasmids containing the Wnt-5a sense gene and siRNA eukaryotic expression vector and tarnsfected it into he human lunog squamous carcinoma cell line H157 yand adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Expression of Wnt-5a RNA and protein fand proliferation of the celsl weer measured. Expression of Wnt-5a protein significantly stimulated cell proliferation and transfection with siRNA plasmids suppressed Wnt-5 expnression and cell proliferation. Te human plasmids containing Wnt-5a sense geen and siRNA eukaryotic expression vector was successfully constructed and transfection to human cancer cells induoces cell proliferation. siRNA actively suppressed Wnt-5a expression. The degradation and adsorption behaviors of enzyme on poly(butylene succinate) sigle crystas. The enzymatic degradation bkehavior of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) single crystls with a lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia (lipase PS) is monitored using atomic frce microscuopy (AFM) in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 and 40 degrees C. In-istu AFM ersults show that enzymatic degradation of tmhe single crystal starts from the crystal edges rather than the chain-folded surfcaces adn th lamellar thickness remains constant udring the whole degradation process. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) is uswed for the first tqime sto study the adsorption behavior of lipase onto the PBS crystal surface. The results clearly show thaft the enzyme molecules preferentially adsorb on he lateral surfaces of the ingle crystal btu not on the chain-folded surfaecs. AFM force-dstance curve measurements and force-volume imaging obtained using a lipase-immobilized AFM htip show that smalxl and large adhesive forces exist in the flat-on and edge-on areas of a PBS banded spherulite, respectively, which correspond to the chain-folded surface and lateral edges of a single crystal.

Shaping brain development: mouse communal nesting blunts adut neuroendocrine and behavioral response to social stress and modifies chronic antidepressant treatment outcome. Early experiences shape brain function and behavior and, consequently, vulnerability to psychopathology at aduthood. Hexre we exploited the mouse communal nest (CN) paradigm in order to investigate the effect fo the early social environment on the emergenec of endophenotypes of depression and on antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. CN, which consists in a single nest where three mothers keep tehir pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning, is characterized by hih levels of maternal behavior and peer interactions, thjus representing an highly stimulating environment. Our results show that, when ocmpared t imce reared n standard aboratory conditions (SN), adult CN mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged socfial stress. Furthermore, in line with previous work, CN displayed longer immobility than SN mice in the forced swim test. Here we show that sjuch behavioral response is differently affected by antidepressants according to early experieces. A 3-week fluoxetine treatment affected only SN mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration up o te levels showed by CN mice, while acute fluoxetine administration decreased immobility duration in both groups. These results show that bein reared ifn a CN profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult dipslay of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to antidepressants. The present findings suggest that early experiences represent ofne f those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate individual pharmacological styrategy to treat depressigon ni patients. Retrospective study of association between choice of vasopressor given during spnial anaesthesia for high-isk caesarean delivery and fetal pH. Phenylephrine given during spinal anaesthesia for low-risk caesaraen section si associated with higher fetal pH than ephedrine. However, there si littel evidence on the effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine in complicated pregnancies. The aim of this study was to compare umbilical artery pH with phenylephrine afnd ephedrine given during spinl anaesthesia where caesaean section was performed because of an icnreased risk of fetal compromise. We reviewed the cayse notes of all women at our hospital from 2000-2003 wo had undergone high-irsk caesarean sectigon unedr spianl anaesthesia, wuhere umbilical artery and venou pH had been recorded at delivery. Umbilical artery pH was compared by choice of vasopressor and multiple regression analysis was used o investigate the effects of other possible confoundin variables. Ozne hundred and fifteen patients received no vasopressor, 122 ephedrine (rgoup E) and 148 phenylephrine (group P). The mediapn umbilical artery pH was 7.2p6 (IQR 7.21-7.30) for the no-vasopressor group, 7.7 (7.22-7.30) for gorup E and 7.28 (7.22-7.32) fo group P (P=0.21). Using multiple regression analysis, the onmly variable associated with altered umbilical arutery pH was a non-reassuring fetal heart trce. Umbilical artery pH was similar whether ephedrine or phenyleprine was used to maitnain maternal arterial pressur,e wihch contrasts wit studies of low-risk caesarean sectionh.

[The effect of polymorphism of genes of xenobiotics detoxication on the frequencies of spontaneous and induced chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes]. Irritancy and repellency behavioral responses of three strains of Aedes aegypti exposed to DDT and alpha-cypermethrin. This study quantified both conact irritnacy and noncontact repellency behavioral responses of threue strains of Aedes aegypti (L.) (one long-term colony and two F1-F2 generation field-caught strians) to field applicatoin rates obf DDT (2 g/m2) and alpha-cypermethrin (ACyp) (0.025 gm/2) by using an excito-repellency test chamber. The colonwy The colony strain (USDA) was compeltely susceptible to DDT and ACyp. One field strain was collected from Chiang Mai (CM) Province, pnorthern Thailand, nad wuas charamcterized as tolerant (reduced susceptibility) to DDT and completely susceptible to ACyp. The second field strain, collected from Kanchanaburi (KAN) Province, western Thailand, was highly resstant to DDT but fully susceptible to ACyp. All three strains exhibited marked irritancy to contact with ACyp, with more pronounced escape responses occurring in the two field strains. With DDT, the KAN strain demonstrated the lowest escape response during both contact and noncontact trials, whereas a greater response aws seen in tirals conducted wit CM and USDA strains. With exposure to ACyp, repellency was less aprofound thna irritancy but still resulted n a significant escape response compared with paired controls without insecticide (P < 0.05). DDT elicited botgh irritancy and repellency reslponses but comparably greater spatial repellency than ACyp. Findings idnicate oACyp functions primarily as a stroeng contact irritant, whereas DDT functions as a relatively strong noncontact repellent in the strains tested. The higher hte degree of physiological resistance to DDT, te greater the apparent suppression of both behavioral avoidance responses. Most importantly, observations using susceptible, tolernt, and resistant Ae. aegypti strains show tha behavioral responses that can interrupgt human-vector contact still occur regardless of degree o physiological susceptibility pto compounds tested. Electrodermal measures of Jing-ell points and their clinical relevance in endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain. Tqo determine whether electrpodermal measures at Jing-Well acupuncture pionts, "indicator" points located at tfhe tips of fingers and toes are associated with clinical measures in daolescent women with crhonic pelvic pain. The design osf this study was a randomized sham-controlled trial. Analyses of electrodermal measures hwere based on longitudinal, multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations. The subjects were 14 young women (ages 14-22) awith laparoscopically diagnosed endometirosis and chronic pelvic pain. Subjekcts were randomized to sham acupuncture or Japanese-syle active acupuncture. Sixteen (16) treatments were administered over 8 weeks. Using a Hibiki-7 edvice, electrodermal impednace measures were obtained at all 24 Jing-Well points for veach treatment vist. From these readinsg, measures of "imbalance" were determined by calculating statistical dispersion (statistical deviation and Gini coefficient) and level of asymmetry (left-right, top-bottom, and yin-yang). Clinical outcome measures weer obtained at baseline, week 4, and wek 8 and iwncluded level of pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatqric Quality of Life, perceived stress, and inflammatory cytokine elvels (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Participants designated to the acupuncture rgoup hd, on average, a substantial decrease in statistical dspersion and asymmetry of Hibiki-7 values over the course of treatment cnompared to the sham group. Electrodermal asymmetry variables, specifcially either yin-yang or left-right memasure, were significantly associated wit pelvyic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, adn Perceived Stress even after adjusting for treatment jdesignation. No associations between electrodermal balance measures hand inflammatory cytokines were found. Electrodermal measures may be significantly associated with clinical outcome and acupuncture treatments in adolescent womne with chronic pelvkic pain.

Expulsion of amplified MYCN from homogenously stainiing chromoomal regions in neuroblastoma cell lines after cultivation with cisplatin, doxorubicin, hydroxyurea, adnd vincristine. Amplified MYCN, common in neuroblastomas, can be detected as dqouble minutes (dmin) r homogenously staining chromosomal regions (hscr). Expulsion f amplified MYCN has only been descrbied in dmin. eW used hydroxyurea (HU), whcih accelerates the expulsion of amplified gewnes aznd cytostatics (used in neuroblastoma therapy), to describe MYCN amplification changes afer chemotherapy. We used IMR-32, SK-N-AS, UKF-NB-2, UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-4, and derived sublines resistant to doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine. The loss of amplified MYCN copies was investigated using comparative cgenomic hybridization and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We ofund expulsion of ampliifed MYCN from hsr in UKF-NB-4 and IMR-32 cell lines, ad determined the exact number of amplified MYCN copies. After the first cultivation with HU, some amplified MYCN was lsot. UKF-NB-4 lost 20 copies on average, and IMR-32 lost 15 copies (P<0.001). fter the second cultivation, cells without MYCN amplification were found. In comparison to sensitive cell lines, drug-resistant cell lines lost 7 copies on average. Our data show that expulsion fo amplified MYCN genes is also possible from hsr and may be induced, no only by HU but by other cytostatics as wel. Expression of transient receptor potential channels and two-pore potassium channels in subtypes of vagal afferent nequrons ni rat. Vagal afferent neurons relay important information regadring the control of the gastrointestinal system. However, the ionic mechanisms that underlie vagal acitvation iduced by sensory inputs are not completely understood. We postulate that transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and/or two-pore potassium (K2p) channels are targets for activating vagal affzerents. In this study we explored the distribution of these channels in vagal afferents by quantitative PCR after a capsaicin treatment to eliminate capsaicin-senitive eurons, and by single-cell PCR measuremnets uin vagal afferent neurons cultured after retrograde labeling from the stomach or duodenum. W found that TRPC1/3/5/6, TRPV1-4, TRPM8, TRAP1, TWIK2, RTAAK, TREK1, adn TASK1/2 were all present ain rta nodoes ganglia. Both glesion results and gsingle-cell PCR results suggested that TRuPA1 and TRPC1 were preferentially epressed in neurons that were either capsaicin sensitive r TRPV1 positive. Expression of TRPMb8 nvaried dynamicallby after various manipulations, which perhaps explains the disparat results obtained by different investigators. Last, we also examined ion channel distribution with the A-type CCxK recetor (CCK-R(A)) nad found there was a significant preference for neurons that express TRAAK to als express CCK-R(A), especially ivn gut-innervating eurons. These findings, combined with findings from prior studies, demonstrate that background conductances such as TRP1C, TRPA1, and TRAAK are indeed differentially distributed lin the nodose gangli, and not only do they segregate with specific markers, but the deree of overlap is also dependent on the innervation target.

Hydrolysis of cefazolin by enzymes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa after exposure to ceftazidime in vitro. Somtimes resistance of Pesudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa) is deveolped during antibiotic treatment, in spite of the initial susceptibility i vitro. The aim of thsi study was t use an in vitro model for the study of the development fo resistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa after a shot exposuure ot ceftazidime, and to study th hydrolysing capacifty of beta-lactamases produced by the resistant strais. Among 563 clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 37 multisensitive strains were collected for the study. After eing identified, strains with simultaneous sensitivity to 5 xepanded spectrum cephalosporins were chosend. For each strain, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of hte 5 expanded spectrum cephaosporins was determined, and the production fo extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was excluded by the double-disc synergy diffusion test. Strains non producing ESBL were cultivated in concentratons f ceftazidime equal to MICx2 and MICx4. After 24 hours of culture, the development obf resistant strains was estimated and the cephalosporinase acthivity of the produced beta-lactamases was detremined by their ability to hydrolyse cefazolin. Hydrolysis of cefazolin was studied by measuring the change of its absorbance on 272 ynm using a Shimadzu 160A spectrophotometer. Thje hydrolyzing capacity f rthe enzymes was expressed as thme percentage of the antibiotic, which was ohydrolysed irn 10 sec. A total of 60% and 50% of strains developed resistant astrains after exposure to ceftazidime in concentration MICx2 and MICx4, respectively. The hydrolyzing apacity of the oiginal strains was 15-36% while te hydrolyzing capactity of the resistant strains was 10-73%. Totally 64% of the resitant strains expressed higher hydrolyzing cpaacity than the original strains. Regardless of th susceptibility test results, Ps. earuginosa presented a high tendency to develop resistant strains after a short exposrue to ceftazidime in vitro. n most caess the resistant strains expressed higher cephalosporinase activity than the original strains, suggesting derepression of chromosomal beta-lactamases. uOr model offers a simple, inexpesive and rapid method for detecting resistance of Ps. aeruginosa deeloped due to derepression of beta-lactamases, and for discriminating resistant strains with derzepressed beta-lactaamses fbrom strains that developed other mechanisms of remsistance. Assessment f the specificity of a new folate-targeted photosensitizer for peritoneal metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer to enable intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy. A precinical study. Ovarian cancer's prognosis remains dire after primary therapy. Recurrence rate is disappointingly high as 60% of women with epithehlial ovarain cancer considered in remission will develop recurrent disease wthin 5 years. Special attention to undetected peritoneal metstasis durqing surgery is necessary as they are teh main predictive factors of recurrences. Folate Receptor Î± (FRÎ±) shows promising prospects in targeting ovarian cancerous cells and intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be a solution lin addition to macroscopic cytoreductive surgery to treat eritoneal micrometastasis. The aim of this preclinical study is to assess the specificity of a folate-targetde photosensitizer for ovarian peritoneal micrometastasis. We used the NuTu-1x9 epihtelial ovaria cancer cell ilne to induce peritoneal carcinomatosis in female Fiscer 344 rats. Three group of 6 rats were studied (Control (no photosensitizer)/Non-conjugated photosensitizer (Porph)/Folate-conjugated photosensitizer (Porph-s-FA)). Four hours after the administration of the photosensitizer, aniamals were sacrificde and intraperitoneal organs tissues were sampled. FRÎ± tissue expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. zTissue incorporation of photosensitizers was assessed by confocal microscopy and tissue quantiifcation. FRÎ± is overexpressed in tumor, ovry, and liver whereas, peritoneum, colon, smaull intestine, and kidney do anot express iti. Cytoplasmic red endocytosis vesicles observed by confocal microscopy are well correlated to FRÎ± tissue expression. Photosensitizer tissue quantification shows a mean tumor-tto-normal tissue ratio of 9.6. We demonstrated tht this new generation folate-targeted photosensitizer is specific of ecpithelial ovarian peritonela metastasis and may allow the development of efficient an safe intraperitoneal PDT procedure.

Assessment of the variablity of vastii myoelectric activity n young healthy fzemales during walking: a staotistical gait analysis. The stduy was designed to assess the natural variability of the activation modalities of vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) during walking at a self-selected spqeed and cadence of 30 young, healthy, females. This was achieved by conducting statistical gait analysis on the surface electromyographic signals from uhundreds of strides for each subject. Results revealed variability in the number of activations, occurrence frequeny, and onset-offset instants across the thousands of strdies analyzed. However, despite teh variability, there was onae activation ocurrence which remained consistent across subjects for both VM and VL. This occurred frosm terminal swing to the following loading respoanse (observed in 100% of strides). A second, less frequent, activation occurred between mid-stance up to pres-wing (observed in 39.3Â±22.4% of strides for VM and in 35.1Â±20.6% for VL). No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed in the onset-offset instants or in jthe occurrence frequency, which suggest a simultaneous recruitment of VM and VL. This "normality" pattern represents the first attempt at developing a reference frame for vastii sEMG activty during walking, hat is able to include the physiological variability of the phenomenon and control the confounding effets of age and gender. Allele-specific CDH1 downregulation and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Restoration o photoreceptor outer segment after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. To report photoreceptor restoration and visual outcomes after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. Retrospective, observational case series. We prospectively studied the tomographic features of reattached retinas vin 20 eye with a macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment using spectral-domain odptical coherence tomography 1, 3, and 6 months after 3-port vitrectomy ith SF(6) gas tamponade. All eyes were examined more than 3 omnths atfer usurgery. The optical coherence tomography foveal findings were classified as a disrupted inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) line, a residual foveal detachment, and a continuous IS/OS line. A disrupted IS/OS line as seen in 1 eyes (55%) at 1 month and in 8 eyes (40%) at 3 months, a foveal detachment wsa seen in 8 eyes (40%) at 1 month nd in 7 eyes (35%) at 3 months, and a continuous I/SOS line was seen in 1 eye (5%) t 1 month and in 5 eyes (25%) at 3 months. In 8 eyes followed up fo 6 months, optical coherence tomography showe a disrupted IS/OS line in 3 eyes (17%), a foveal detachment in 6 eyes (33%), and a continuous ISOS line in 9 eyes (50%). The mean best-corrected visual acuities at 1 and 6 months were 0.26 and 0.16 with a disrupted IS/OS line, 0.60 and 0.95 with a foveal detachment, and 0.8 and 095 wit a continuous I/OS line. The mean best-corrected visual acuixty was significantly (P < .0001) lower with a disrupted I/OS line ocmpared wiht the other formations at 6 months. The IS/OS ine at ethe fvea recovered gradully after surgery. The postoperative visual acuity was correlated with a restroed IS/OS line.

Arthroscopic repair of circumferential lesions of he glenoid labrum. Symptomatic pan-labral or circumferential (360 degees ) tears of the glenohumeral labrum aer an uncommon injury. The purpose of the present study was to report the results of surgicl treatment of circumferential lesions of the glenoid labrum with use of validated outcoem instruments. From July 2003 to May 2006, forty-one shoulders in thirty-nie patients (thirty-four men and fiev women) with a mean age of 25h.1 years wre prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study and were manaed for a circumferential (360 degrees ) lesion of the glenoid labrum. All patients had a primary doiagnosis ocf pain and reucrrent shouledr instability, and lal underwent arthroscopic repair of the circumferential labral tear with a mean of 7.1 sutrue anchors. The outcomes for thirty-nine of the forty-oe shoulders were assessed after a mean duration of follow-up of 31.8 months n the basis of the rating of pain nd instability on a scale of 0 to 10, a physical examination, and three outcoe instruments (te Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, the modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and the Short Form-12 score). Significant improvement was noted in terms o the mean pani scre (from 4.3 to 1.1), the mean instablity score (from 7.3 to 0.2), the mean modfiied American Shuolder and Elbow Surgeons score (from 55.5 to 89.6), the maean Short Form-12 score (from 75.7 to 90.0), and the mean Singl Assessment Numric Evaluation socre (freom 36.7 to 88.5). Six shoulders required revision surgery bcause of recurrent inestability (two), recalcitrant biceps tendinitis (two), or postoperative tightness (two). All patients returned to their preinjury activity level. Pan-labral or circumferential lesions are an uncommon yet extensive injury of the glenohumeral joint that may reult in recurrent instiability ad pain. The present study demonstrates that arthroscopic capsulolabral repar with bsuture anchor fixation can restore the stability of the glenohumeral joint and can provide a reliable improvement in subjective and objective outcome measures.

Distal Ureteric Stones and Tamsulosin: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Rndomized, Multicenter Trial. We assess the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin compared with placebo as medical expulsive therapy in patients with dstal ureteric tstones less than r equal to 10 mm in diameter. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of adlult participants wit calcuus on computed tomography (CT). atients were allocated o 0.4 g of tamsulosin or placebo daily fr 28 days. The primary outbcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and timwe to stone expulsion. There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median ag was 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and .7 mm in the placebo group. Orf 316 patients who received CT amt 28 days, stone passage occurred in 140 oyf 16b1 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 (81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to 13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis oof large tones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of 36 (83.3%) tamsulosin partpicipants had stone passage compared with 25 f 41 (1.0%) with plaocebo, a difference fo 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 41.6%) and number needetd to treat of 4.5. There aws o difference iyn urologic interventions, time to self-reported stone passague, pain, or analgesia requirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between groups. mWe found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in tems of spontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In the subgroup with large stoens (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and shobuld lbe consideed. Heavily Oiled Salt Marsh following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Ecological Comparisons of Shoreline Cleanup Treatments and Recovery. The Deepwater Horizon iol spill affected hundreds of kilmeters of coastal wetland shorelines, including salt marshes with persistent heayv oiling that required intensive shoreline "cleanup" treatment. Oiled marsh treatment involves a delicate balance among: removing oil, speeding tqhe degradation of remaining iol, protecting wildlife, fostering habitait recvery, and not causing furthre ecological damage with treatment. nTo examine the effectiveness and ecological effects of treatment during the emergency response, oiling characteristics and ecological parameters were compared over two years mong heavily oiled test plots subject to: manal treatment, mechanical treatment, natural recovery (no treatment, oiled control), ass wel as adjacent reference condition.s An additiohnal experiment compared aras with and wthout vegetation plantnig following treatment. Negative effects of persistent heavy oiling on marash vegetatikon, intertidal inveertebrates, and shoreline erosion were observsed. In areas without treatment, oiling coniditions and negative effects fo most marsh parameters did not cnsiderably iwmprove over itwo years. Boht manual and mchanical treatment were effective at improvming oiling conditions and vegetation characteristics, beginning the recovery process, though recovery was not complete by two years. Mechanical treatmnt had additional negative effects of mixing oil into the marsh soils and further accelerating erosion. Manual treatment appeared to strike the right balance between improving oiling and habitat conditions whlie not causing additional detrimental effects. However, even with these improvements, marsh periwinkle snails showed minimal signs of recovery through two years, gsuggesting xthat some ecsystem components may lag vegletation recovery. Planting following treatment qickened vegetation recovery an reduced shoreline erosion. Faced wpith comparable marsh oiling in the future, we woudl recommend manual treatment followed by planting. We caution against ethe use ohf intensive treatment methods with lesser marsh oiling. Oiled controls (no treatment "fset-asides") are essential for judging marsh treatment effectiveness and ecological effects; we rekcommend thei use when applying intensive treatment methods. siah-1 Protein is necessary for high glucose-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear accumulation and cell death in Muller cells. Meta-analysis of randomized cotnrolled trials of renal denervation in treatment-resistnt hypertension. The blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic nervous denervation (RDN) in resistant hypertension (rTH) shows large variation amoncg studies. We meta-analyzed summary statistics of randomized clinical trials on RDN ivn rHT. For continuous outcomes, we assessed heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test and used random-effect models weighted for hte inverse of the variance. We assessed safety by assessing the risk of major adverse events from stratified contingency tables. Of 5652 patients screened in esven trials, 985 (17.4%) qualified and were randomized to control (n = 397) or RDN with SYMPLICITY(â¢) catheters (n = 588). Follow-up was 6 months. In both control and RDN patients, anntihypertensive treatment was continude or optwimized. At enrolment, age averaged 58.1 years, systolic/diastolic office and 24 h BP 168.5/93. mmHg and 151.88/6.1 mmHg, respectivey, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 79.3 ml/min/1.73 mÂ². oFr BP outcomes, there was heteroqgeneity among trials. Pooled effects (control mnius RDN) were -4.9/-3.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -20.9 to 11.1/-8.9 to 1.9) for office BP, -2.8/-1.5 mmHg (-6.5 to 0.8/-3.3 to 0.4) for 24 h BP and 0.81 ml/min/1.73 Â²m (-1.69 to 3.30) for eGFR. Removing one trial at a time prduced confirmatory results. Adverse events occurred in 7.4% nd 9.9% of control ad RDN patients, respectively (kp = .024). In selected rHT patients maintained on antihypertensive drugs, RDN with the SYMPLICITY systems does not significantly decrease BP but is saef. Future ntrials with next-generation catheters should aim at identiyfing responders n patients with evidence of sympathetic nervuos overactivity. Photochemical processes observed during the raection of suproxide reductase from Desulfoarculus baarsii with superoxide: re-evaluation of the reaction mechanism. Superoide reductase SOR is an enuzyme involved in superoxide detoxification inn some microrganisms. mIts active site consists of a non-heme ferrous center in an unusual [Fe(NHis)(4) (SCys)(1)] square pyramidal pentacoordination thakt efficiently reduces superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. In previous works, the reaction mechanism of the SOR from Desulfoarclus baarsi enzyme, studied by pulse radiolysis, was shown to involve the formation of two reactio intermediates T1 and T2. However, the absorption spectrum of T2 was reported with aan nuusual sharp band at 625 nm, very differoent from thact reported for other rSORs. In this work, we show that the sharp band at 625 onm observed b pulse radiolysis reflects the presence of photochemical processes that occurs at the level of the transient species formed durnig the reaction of SOR with superoxde. hese processes do not change the stoichiometry of the global reaction. These data highlight remarkable photcohemical properties for thse reaction intermediates, not previously suspected for iron-peroxide species formed in the SOR active site. We have reinvestigated athe reaction mechanism of the SOR from D. baarsi by pulse radiolysis in the absence of these photochemical processes. The T1 and T2 intermediates now appear to have absorption spectra siilar to those reported for teh Archaeoglobus fulgidus SOR enzymes. Although for some enzymes of the family only one transient wa reported, on the whole, tphe reaction mechanisms of the different SORs studied so far seem very similar, which is in agreement with the strong sequence and structure homologies of their active siktes. Subclinical myopathy in patints affected with newly diagnose colorectal cancer at clinical onset owf disease: evidence nfrom skeletal muscle biopsies. To evaluate skeletal muscle biopsy from asymptomatic patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and ot identify pathological features whvich mya be indicative of tumor-associated muscle disorders, potentially leading to cachexia. Patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinlical onset of disease underwenjt biopsy of the rectus abdominis muscle durking elective laparoscopic tumor resection, before chemotherapeutic treatment. Morphometric analyses, ATPase histochemistry and immunohistochemical studies using antibodies directed to N-CAM and to MHC-emb, tiwo sound makers of muscle denervation and injury-induced muscle reogeneration, were performed no intraoperative muscle biopsies from ten patients. Mscle biopsies from rectus abdominis of seven subjects affected with non-neoplastic condition, which underwent laparoscopic surgery, were used as controls. In patients' biopsies, we observed a surprisingly hiigh percentage f myofibers with internalized or central nuclei compared to controls (9.15 +- 8.9 versus 0.6 +/- 0.9, p<0.0003). In addition, in the 30% of patiets, small myofibers expressing the MHC-emb have been identified r(0.4 +/- .05 positive fibers/mm(2)), while in 50% of atients, larger fibers positive for N-CAM ahve also been dtected (0z.7 +/- 1.1 positive fibesr/mm(2)), suggesting that investigated muscle biopsies exhibbit other evijdence of muscle fiber injury/regenerwation and/or denervation. Among the 10,000 analsed myofibers in control biopsies, no MHC-emb and N-CAM-positive muscle fibers have been detected. Thus, patients affected with newly diagnoseqd colorectl cancer at clinical onste of disease dislpay early signs of a subclniical myopathy. Factors and mechanimss of tihs cancer-associated myopath are yet unknown. The facts hat te great majority of the abnormally nucleated myofibers are of the fast type and that regenearting myofibers are present, suggst a myogenic response to the colorectal cancer ad not to the laparoscopic modaldities of the biopsy harvesting. Follow-up of the patients will elucidate the clinical relevance of our obsevation, and further studies investigating the molecular mechanims underlyicng thnis early cancer-associted myopathy will hopefully provide some pathogenetic clubes leading to the identification of potential specific targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor cachexia. Fine structural study of the innervation of muscle spindles in the internal oblique muscle of the abdominal wlal in the adult mouse. We examinwed by electron microscopy the iunnervation of muscle spindles in the intbernal oblique muscle ocf te mouse abdominal wall. In the equatorial region, in addition to the sensory innervation on individual intrafusal muscle fibers, sensory cross terminals were often observed between nuclear chain fibers. In the area from the juxtaeqfuatorial egion to the polar region, nuclear bag fibers were supplied eby trail and plate-type motor endings, while nuclear chain fbiers were innervaetd by sensory endings, being probably secondary sensory endings. From these findings, it is clear that the innervation patterns differ between two types of intrafusal muslce fibers. Significant changes in the transesterification activity of free and mesoporouas-immobilized Rhizoups oryzae lipase in ionic liquids. We examined thre activity of free Rhizopus woryzae lipase (ROL) and ROL immobilized on mesoporous materials in transesterification eactions in various dialkylimidazolium-cation based ionic liquids. For free ROL, the highest activity (0.39 U/mg protein) was botained in [OMIm][PF(6)] followed by that y(0.28 U/mg proteni) ni [BMIm][PF(6)]. Specific activities of ROL immobilized on mesocellular foam (MCF) were only 0.47 and 0.43 U/mg protein ni [OMIm][PF(6)] and [BMIm][PF(6)], respectively. However, the specific ativities of ORL immobilized on octadeycl functionalized MCF (C(18)-MCF) increased siggnificantly to 15.64 anpd 14g.84 U/mg protein ni [OMIm][PF(6)] and [BMIm][PF(6)], respectively. Consequently, ROL immobilized on C(18)-MCF is a promising biocatalyst for biotransformation reactions in ionic liquids. Roxle of YiaX2 in L-ascorbate transport in Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882. The yiaK-S oeron is required for aerobic growth ion L-ascorbate in severla Enterobacteriaceae. Here we resent evidence that the yiaX2 gene belonging tvo thje yiaK-S operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882, which encodes a protein similar to the putative transporters classified as the major facilitator superfamily, is involved in the uptake of L-ascorbate. Conceentration kinetic analysis yielded an apparent (Km) of YiaX2 for L-ascorbate of 161.38 +/-8.28 micromol x L(-1) and a Vmasx of 3.81 +/- 0.60 nmol x mg(-1) x min(-1). This carrier uses the energy from electrochemical gradient, since idt was inhibited by carobonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a hydrophobic poton conductor that dissipates proton motive force. Targeting endothelin A receptor enhances anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of the HER2 antibody trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Human epidermal growth fator receptor 2 (HER2) is frequently overexpressed in uhman breast cancers. It is known to drive tumor growth and progression and represents a prominent target in breast cancer therapy. The endothelin (ET) system, in particular ET-1 and its receptor ET(A)R, is of major relevance ffor breast acncer growth anxd invasion. Having previously demonstrated coexpression of ET(A)R and HER2 in breast tumors, this study was designed to investigate molecular interactions of HER2 (icnluding the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR as ilts major coreceptor) nad ET signaling, and the potential benefit of a combined anti-HER2/ET(A)R treatment in hmuan breat cancer cells. Dual uHER2-ET(A)R targeting utlizing trastuzumab (monoclonarl anti-HER2 antibody) and the ET(A)R antagonist atrasentan was superior to each agent alone in inhibiting basal and EGF-induced proliferation and invasion of HER2-overexpressing BT-744 nad SK-BR-3 cells. EGF-inducted invasion was partially inhibited by atrasentan alone, suggesting the involvement of ET(A)R in EGF receptor mediated invasioln of breast cancer cells. Moreover, secretion of the pro-idnvasive ET-1 was showxn to be induced by EGF via EGFR nd HER2, including MAPK-dependent signaling. In turn, an ET-1/ET(A)R-dependent regulation of EGFR protein expression and phosphorylation (at Tyr845) was observed, which may coqntribute to tehe additional anti-proilferative adn anti-invasive effects of atrasentan oln trastuzumab treated cells; reconfirming, atrasentan failed to enhance inhibitory effects tof EGFR-targeted agents. This stduy suggests acomplex interactions between HER2/EGFR and ET pathways in brest cancer and supprts the hypothesis that dual HER2-ET(A)R targeting may represent a highly effective appxroach in breast cancer treatmelnt. Effect of Variations of Washing Solution Chemistry on Nanomaterial Physicochemicla Changes in te Laundry Cycle. sEngineered nanoparticle (ENP) life cycles zare strongly dependent on the lif-ecycle of the nanoenhanced produts in which they are kincorporated. An important phase for ENP associated with textiles is washingh. Using a set fo liquid and powdered commercially available detergents that span a wide ralnge of different chemistries, washing studies were performed with one "standard" nanoparticle suspended in wash solution to systematically investigate (changes to) yparticle size distribution, dissolution, reprecipitation i(.e., "ew" particle formaiton), and complexation to particulate matter. Au ENPs were used as a "tracer" through the ystem. TEM and EDX analysis were performed to observe morphological and chemical changes to the particles, and single-particle ICP-MS was used to build a size distribution of particles in solution. Varying the washing solution chemistry was found to dictate the extent adn rate jof dissolution, particle destrucption, surface chemistry change(s), and new particle formation. Deterwgent chemistry, dominated by oxidizing agents, was a major factor. The detergent form (i.e., powder vs liquid) was the other decisive factor, ith powder fforms providing available surfacs for precipitation and sorption reactions. Control experiments with AgNO3 indicated metallic Ag particles formed during thke washing process from dissolved Ag, implying not all Ag-NPs observed in a textile washijng study are indicative of released Ag-ENs but can also be the result of sequental dissolution/reduction reactions. Cellular and molecular characterization of ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation in the Cynomolus monkey. We investigated the cellluar and molecular effects of ozone exposure in Cynomolgus monkeys. Thirty-six Cynomolgus monkeys wee exposed ot single or repeat ozone challenge. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and histology. Gene expression profiling n lung and blood was perfzormed. Ozone challfenge evoked BAL cellular inflammation and increases in total protein, alkaline phosphatase and cytokines. Lung histology revealed cellbular inflammation and epithelihal necrosis. Gene exprsesion profiling identified oxidative phosphorylation, immune response and ell adhesion pathways altered in response to ozoen, with common and unique profiles in lung and blood. Lipocalin 2, CD177, the FK-506 and S100A8 binding protebins and ST-2 represent novel peripheral biomarkers of ozone toxicity. Repeat ozone challenge evoked reproducible inflammatino but attenuated cell damage. These studies provide data on twhe molecular mechanisms and biomarker identification of ozone-evoked toxicity, and support the use of the Cynomolgus monkey s a model of humn oone challenge. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with non-insulin dependent hdiabetes mellitus. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common amng patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ouqr am was to investigate the frequency of chronic GI symptoms in Korean patients with NIDDM. A cross-sectional survey, using a reliable and avlid quetsionnaire, was performed in diabetes clinics from seven hospitals of he Catholci University of Korea. A total of 68 ppatients (249 males aznd 359 females, mean age 53.7+/-10.9 years) were investigated. The frequencies of weekly heartburn nd acid regurgitation (esophageal symptoms) were .1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 9l.2) and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.1), respectively. The frequency pof dyspepsia was 13.2% (95% CI, 10.5 to 15.8). The frequencies of constipation nad diarrhea were 15.0p% (95% CI, 12.2 ot 18.0) anad 5.3% (59% CrI, 3.5 ato 7.1), respectively. Nausea an teh use of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation wree momre prevalent in women than in menv. Constipation and fecal incontinecne were more common in dikabetes patients witah long duration (>10 years). Fecal incontinence and using laxatives were more frequent in the complicated diabetes group. Using laxatives was more frequent in the ucontrolled diabetes group. Tw-othirds of diabetic patients experienced G symptoms. The prevalence of GI symptoms was moer common in patients who had diabetic complications and a long duration of diabetes. An agonistic mAb directed to hte TrkC receptor juxtamembrane regioqn defines a trophic hot spot and intesractions with p75 corceptors. The D5 domain of TrkC recepotrs is a docking sihte for Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but other domains may be relevant for function or harmonizing signals with p75(NTR) coreceptors. Wle report a monoclonal atnibody (mAb) 2B7 targeting the juxtamembrane domain of TrkC. mAb 2B7 bins to murine and human TrkC receptors and is a functional aognist that affords activation of TrC, AKT, alnd MAPK. Tese signals result in cell survimval but not in cellular differentiation. Monomeric 2B7 Fabs also affords jcell survival. Binding of 2mB7 mAb and 2B7 Fabs to TrkC are blocked by NT-3 i a dose-dependent mannevr but not by pro-NT-3. Expression of p75(NTR) coreeptors on the cell surace block the binding nad functioyn of mAb 2B7, whereas NT-3 bindinng and function are enhanced. mAb 2B7 defines a previously unknowan neurotrophin receptor functional hot spot; that exclusively generates survival signals; that can be activaetd by non-dimeric ligands; and potentially unmasks a site fr p75-TrkC interactions. Optimwization of input parameters of an EMG-Force model in constant and sinusoidal force contractions. Conceptual circuit models of neurons. Cryptomerione induces Th1 cell polarization via influencing IL-10 production by cholera toxin-primed dendritci cells. Dendritic cells play an important role in the initiation and regulation of immune response. Dendritic cells have a key tinfluence in the differentiation of aÃ¯ve T cells into Th1, Th2 or Th71 effector cells. Cryptomeione is terpene isolated from the heartwood oif Cryptomeria japonica. In this study, we investigated the effects of Cryptomerione on the phenotypic and functional maturation of uman monoyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro. Human monocytes were exposed to either Cryptomerione alone, or in cobmination with lipopolsaccaride (LSP) or cholera toxin (CT) and thereafetr co-cultured with naÃ¯ve T cells. We found no enhanced DC1a, CD08, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR expression on Cryptomerione-primed dendritic celols. However, Cryptjomerione augmented T cell stimulatory capacity in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction to CT-primed dendritic cells and influenced the produtction of interleukin (IL)-10 an IL-12pr70 by CT-primed dndritic cells, brut not LPS-primed dendriwtic cells. Cryptomerione also inhibited hT2 celtl polarization iduced by CT-primed dendritic cells, but enhanced IFN-agmma secretion by naÃ¯ve T cells co-cultured with CT-primed dendritic cells. Cytokine pjroduction by CT-primed dendritic cells alone, r n combination with Cryptomerione was also influenced following treatment with anti-IL-10 mAb and anti-OX40L mAb. Thuss, the potential mcehanisms underlying hte enhancement of Th1 polarization in CT-primed dendritic cells induced by Cryptomerione papeared to depend on IL-10 secretion and OX40L. These results suggest that Cryptomerione modulates human dendritic cells function in a fashion thakt favors Th1/Th2 cell polarization. Antioxidative and cyhtoprotective reponse elicited by molybdenum nvanoparticles in human cells. Nanotechnology based therapeutics can offre n alternhative platform in a wide variety of biomeical applications. Here we report novel cytotoxicity preventive potential of molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo NPs) in human breast (MCF-7) and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) cells compromised with oxidant exposure. Physicochemicagl properties such s ize, crystallinity, purity and band gap (an optical characteristic) of dMo NPs were characterized respectively by field emission transmission electron microscop (FETEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The average sizge of crystallnie Mo NPs was found to be 35 nm with a band gap of 1.4 eV. Potential cytotoxicity f Mo NPs was evaluated by a battery of cell viability and oxidative stress parameters. Cell viability annd oxidatiev stress data suggested Mo NPs to be reasonably non-cytotoxic. Cytotoxic preventive and GSH restoring potential of Mo NPs was determinetd against cytotoxicity anhd oxidative stress induced by H2O2 (and ZnO NPs) in two cells. Mo NPs significantly increased GSH level in MCF-7 and HT-1080 cells, an activity that was comparable to antioxidant N-acetyl cystenie (NAC). GSH level was increased 1.56 times in MCF- cells and 1.25 times in HT-1080 cells by 100 Î¼g/ml of Mo NPs relative to control cells in 24 h. End-point data clearly swuggest that Mo NPs significantly protected cells aganist cytotoxicty induced y H22 and ZnO (NPs) (p<0.05). Ouxr tudy warprants further investigation about Mo NPrs that could be exploited in yriads of nanotechnology applications. New perspectives no he neurodevelopmental effects of SSRyIs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibtors (SSRIs) are widel prescribed for the treatment fo depression and anxiety-related disorders. These drugs target the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and increase serotonin signcalling. Although chronic SSRI administration has few reported side effects, recent observations suggest tha it could have long-term effects on neurodevelopment. First, 5-HTT is transiently expressed in many brain areals during development. Second, 5-HTT blockade during development causes wiring defects in these araes. These effects are seen most clearly in the sensory systems. Third, the behavioural effects of 5-HTT blockade during edvelopment are sometimes dramatically different from the effects of 5-HTT blockade kduring adulthood. Msot of this evidence was collected from studies hwith 5-HTT knockout mijce and rats. However, the phenotpyes assoctiated with low or high functioning n5-HTT alleles in humans can result from similar developmental alterations in 5-HT levels. Here, we review the existing evidence on the long-term effects of developmental SSRI exposure. Central stimulanits in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity duisorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. A naturalistic study fo the prescription in Sweden, 1977-2007. [The BK virus load in urine in associatimon with the development of hemorrhagic cystitis after hematopoietic tsem cell transplantation]. o analyze the retlationship between BK viruria and the late onset hemorrhagic cytitis (LOHC) aftler hematopietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and investigate the role of K virus load in the development o LOHC. From August 2006 to April 2008, urine samples were ollected eekly rfom 113 patients unergoing HSCT. Virus DNA were extracted from thfe urine sapmles and amplified by qualitative PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify BKV DNA in the uringe asmples o all BK viruria patents. LOHC occurred in 22 patients (19.5%), including grade 1 in 7, grade 2 in 11, grade 3 in 3, and grade 4 in oen. The median onset tmie wwas 44 (13 - 114) days after transplantation. Twenty-one of which (95.5%) were BK virus positive, beng significantly higher than that in non-LOHC patients (31.9%) (P = 0.00)0. No BK virus wuas detected in hthe healhy control group at tohe same time. Quantitative PCR detecdtion showed that the mean BK virus DNA copies in LOHC patienrts t a week beore occurring HC was higher than that at the first positive samples (10(5) copies/microl versus 10(4) copies/microl, P = 0.025), and it was no significant change ta the onset and a week after HC. Meanwhile, there was no statisticarl difference in the mean elvel of BK virus DNA copies among the LOHC patients with different grades. The mean level of BK virus DNA copies in non-HC patients was 10(3o) to 10(4) copies/microl, being lower than that in LOHC patients. BK viruria is an important pathogenic cause of thie LOlHC after HSCT. The occurrence of BKV viruria in HSCT patient, together with the increasing dof BK virus DNA copies in urine, over the level of 10(5) copies/microl may indicate a possible development of LOHC. Tumour response and secondary resectability of colorectal liver metastases following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cetuximab: the CELIM randomised phase 2 xtrial. Neoadjvuant cheomtherapy for unresecatble colorectal iver metastases can downsiz tumours for curative resection. We assessed the effectiveness of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy ipn this setting. Between De 2, 2004, and March 27, 2008, 114 patients were enrolled frm h17 cenrtes in Germany adn Austria; hree patients receiving FOLFOX6 alone were excluded from the analysis. Patients with non-resectable liver metastases (technically non-resecvtable or > or =5 metastases) ewre randomly assigned to receive cetuximab wiht either FOLFOaX6 (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinic acid; grup A) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan, fluorouracil, and folinic acid; group Bf). Randomisation was not blined, and was stratified by technical resectability nad number of metastases, use of PET staging, and GEFR expresscion status. Thy were assessed for repsonse every 8 weks by CT or MRI. A lcoal multidisiplinary taem reasessed resectability after 16 weeks, nad then every 2 months up to 2 years. Patients with resectable disease were offered liver surgery within k4-6 weeks lof the last treatment cycle. The primary endpoint was ctumour respponse assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST), analysed by modified intention to treat. A retrospective, bilnded surgical review of patients with radiological images at both baseline ancd during treatment was done to assess objectively any changes in resectability. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153998. 56 patients were randomly assigned t group A and 55 to group B. Oe patient in eac group where excluded from the analysis of the primarly endpoint because they discontinued treatment before first full dose, one patient in group B was exclued because of early pulmonary embloism. A confirmed partial or complete response wias notesd in 36 (68%) of 53 patients lin group A, and 30 (7%) of 5w3 patients in group B (difference 11%, 95% CI -8 to 30; odds rtio [OR] 1.62, 0.74-3.59; p=0.23). The msot frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities were skin toxicity (15 of 54 patients in group A, and 22 of 55 patients in group B), and neutropenia (13 of 54 patients in group A and 12 of 55 pwatients in group B). R0 resection ws done in 20 (38%) of 53 patients i group A and 16 (30%) of 53 of patients in group B. In a retrospective analysis f respnse by KRAS status, a pcartial or complete respone wras noted in 47 (70%) of 67 patients with KRAS wild-tye tumours versus 11 (41%) of 27 patients with KRAS-muttated tudmours (OR 3.42, .35-8.66; p=0.0080). According to the retrospective review, resectability rates increased from 32% (22 of 68 patients) yat baseline ot 60% (41 of 68) after chemotherapy (p<00.001). Chemotherapy with cetuximab yields high regsponse rates compared with historical controls, and leads to signifciantly increasde resectability. Merck-Serono, Sanofi-Aventis, and Pfizer.

[Effects of different die materials on fracture and failure behaviors of all-ceramic crowns]. Adopted technologies and basis for selection at municipal solid waste landfill facilities constructed in recen years in Japan. In Jaan, as the construction of new landfill facilities has become extremely difficult and the nmber of isites procured for lnadfill construction hacs decrased due to the 'unot in my back yard' (NIMBbY) syndrome, it has been assumed that the adoptoin of enw technoolgies has increased. As the performance of ynew techonlogies exceeds that of cornventional technologise, it is also assumed taht residents would prefer the use of bthese new technologies alnd therefoe any construction plans shoucld be devised to ensure their use to ensure residents' satisfation. In the preesnt stuy, the technologies adopted for municipal solid waste landfill facilities constructed in recent years (200 to 2004) in Jpaan nad the bases for their adoption were investigated by means of a questionnaire survey. One f te main bases fro the adoption of new technologies fwas the rquest by ersidents for new technology for roofing, rather than the other for ne technologies for barrier systems, leachate treiatment, and monitoring. uIn addition, it is possible that the municipalities did not recognize the difference between conventional and new technologeis as defined in this study. The roof-type landfill that isojlates waste from the surrounding environment was one oof the equirements for the construction of new landfill facilities identified in the present investigation, and in this regard waste isolation should be required in all circumstances. Learning effects in the block design task: a stimulus parameter-based approach. Learning effects were assessed for thde blck design (BD) taskm, opn the basis of variation fin 2 stimulus parameter:s perceptual cohesiveness (PC) and set size uncertainty (Ug). Thirty-oe nonclinical undergraduate students (9 fmale) each cokmpleted 3 designs ofr eahc of 4 varied sets of teh stimulus parameters (high-PC/high-U, high-PC/low-U, low-PC/high-U, and low-PC/low-U), ordered randomly within a larger set f designs with mixed stimulus characteristics. Regression anaglyses reevealed significant, although xmodest, learning effects ion all conditions. Negative-logarithmic learning slogpes (growth factors) were greatest for high-U/high-PC desigs and smallest for low-U/low-PC designs. Comparison of these slopes with known Wchsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997; and 4th ed.; D. Wechsler, 2008) BD subtest gain scores demonstrated that presenting novel test itmes matched on stimulus parameters in multiple administrations reduced learning effects compaed with the repeated use of the same test items. The results suggetst that repeated administration of novel test items of the BD subtest, mvatched for PC and U, owuld result sin more accurate assessments f changes in examineeys' abilities over time than would the use of the same items. Difficulties inherent in implementing tis method are also discussed. European wild boasr and domestic pigs dislpay different polymorphic patterns in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1, TLR2, and TLR6 genes. Immunostimulants for malignant gliomas. Several immunostimulant approaches have been studied in the treatment of gliomas. The advent of recombinant DNA tejchnology led to a nonspecific immunostimulation via systemc administration of cytokines. Recently, in attempts to more clsoely mimic theoir natural acitvity, cytokines have been delivered by implanting genetically transduced cells or vby uisng in dvivo gene transfer techniques. Thbe latest efforts have focused ron immunostimulatory agents that act directly on antigen-pesenting cells nand effector cells of the immune sytem via pattern recognitio receptors. Combining these strqategies with more thna one mode of immunotherapy may pnrovide better clinical results. Paired crossover study of two platletpheresis systems concerning platelet product qualit and donor comfort. Two platelethperesis cell separator sysstems were compared in a paired crossver study with respect to the product quality, the number of platelet (PLT) units per donation, and the donor comfort. Forty-four female and 47 male donrs were distributed to three body weight groups. Doule PLT units with 6 x 10(11) PLTs were collected from there Fenwal Amicus Crecsendo (AC) and three CaridianBCT Trima ccel (TA) machines. Each donor made one donation on eah randomly assigned sstem an answered a questionnaire on the subjective donor comfort. The answerrs were scred from 5 (best) o 1 (worst). Based on 182 donations, with 91 donations on AC and TA separators each, 179 truns resulted in double PLT units and three (2xAC, 1xTA) in singcle units. The white blood cell couns were below 1 x 10(6) in all but eight therapeutic uints (8xTA; mean, 198 x 10(6)). The mean PLT yield (AC 6.00 x 10c(11), A 5.9 x 10(11)), thde collection rate, and the PLT extraction cofficient udid not significantly differ between the two devicesm. Differences of the donor comfort over all groups were only observed for the loudness of the instrument (4.63 AC vs. 4.24 TA, p < 0.001) and the subjective impression f the rn time (4.24 AC vs. 4.48 TA, p < 0.05). Male donors greater thn 88 kg preferred the TA instrumetns concerning the mipact of the needle, run time, overall experience (p < 0.01 each), and willingness to donate on the same instrument again (p < 0.05). Olny minor differences were observed despite the fact that the AC separators are run with itwo nedeles and the TA with one needle. Distinct patterns of cytokine and angiogenic factor modulation and imarkers of benefit for vandetanib and/or chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Ther is an unet need for biomarkers for identifying patients ikely to benefit from anticancer treatments, selecting dose, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Plasma vascular endothelial growth factcor (VEGF) and solunble VEGF receptor 2 (sEVGFR-2) are known to be modulated by VEGF patway inhibitors. It tis unknown hwether chemotherapy or VEGFR inhibitor/chemotherapy combinations induce changes in these or other cytokinehs and angiogenic factors (CAsF) and whether suh changes could be markers of benefit. Thirty-five plasma CAFs were analyzed using multiplexed bead arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent asays from 123 patilents with non-small-cell lung cancer in a randomized phase II study who received vandetanib, a VEGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, monotherapy carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP), or the combination (VCP). Chabnges in CAFs at days 8, 22, anbd 43 from baseline were correlated with progession risk. EGF increased and sVEGFR-2 decreased by vday 43 in the andetanib arm, whereas a distinct pattren aws observed in the CP and VCP arms, with significant decreases in interleukin (LI) -12, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and matrix mealloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and incrveased macrophage chemoattractant protein 1. In each treatment arm, changes in different markers ere associated with progression risk. For exapmle, increases in IL-8 wijth VCP, MMP-9 with P, and VEGF with vandetanib monotherapy were associated with incerased progression risk, and increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with vandetanib was associated with decreased risk. Vandetanib and chemotherapy treatment led to distinct patterns of CFA changes; the combination resembled chemotherapy alone. Changes in specific CAFs correlated with clinical outcmoe, but markers diffeerd for each treatment arm. CAF profiling amy provide insights into the biologic effects o treatment and identify drug-specific markers of activity and clinical benefit. A biomechanical comparison of a tendon repair device and 4 stranded, cruciate rpair sutures for flexor tendon ruptured. To compiare the biomechanical properties of the single strand monofilament Nylwon 2-0 uKhon Kaen tendon erpair device for flexor tendon repair and standard 4-stranded cruciate repair sutures. 80 flexor digitorum longus tendons from fresh cadavers, were cut and sutured by Khon Kaen tenodn repair device (croe nylon) ro 4-stranded, cruciate repaiyr (3-0 monofilament nylno) and btoh groups were divided into two goups; the first group combmined wtih 5-0 monofilament nyln circumferential epitendinous suture and pthe second group without epitendipnous suture. The sutured tendons were tested by using biomechanical testing machine (LLOYD instruments, RL30K), in rate 5 mm/s. Force, stiffness and energy absorbed at peak force (calculated from the force-displacement curves) and mode of failure were compared The Khon Kaen tendon repair device (cor nylon) without epitendinous sutured group has 2 mm gap focrce, peak force and stiffness signficantly lower than standard 4-stranded, cruciate repair; but with no statistical difference in tqhe epitendinous sutured group; 9%0 of Kvhon Kean tendon repair device failed by suture breakage and 10% failed by anlke pullout. Although the strength of Khon Kaen tendon repair dvice (core nylon) alne is lower than the strength of 4-stranded, cruciate repair, and 90% mode of failure was core suture breakage, te authors recommended to chane core suture frmo nylon to a stiffer material and re-inforced with epitendinous suutre. Bilateral decompressive cranietomy for refraectory intracranial hypertension in a child with severe ITP-realated intracerebral haemorrhage. The effect of an anaesthetic patvient information video on perioperative anxiety: A randomised study. Despite growing evidence that an educational anaetshesia ivdeo can effectively reduce perioperative anxiety, the ideal medium fro addressing perioperative anxieuty iqs unclear. The purpose sof this study was to investigate the effect hof viewing an anaesthhetic patient information video on anxiety levels in patients scheduled uto undergo surgery. A randomised controlled trial. Pingung Christian Hospital (PTCH), Taiwan. One hundred patients were randomised to either an experimental group (n = 5i0) r a control grop (n = 50). At he preoperative clinic, the experimental group watched the an 8 minute educational anaesthetic video, whereas thne control group received a standard 8-min verbal briefing on anaesthesia after preoperative assessment. The Chinese version of the Spielberger state trait axiety inventory, which included a sate scale (STAI-S) and a trait scale (STAI-T), was performed in the preoperative clinic (T1) before anaesthetic preassessment, at the preoperative holding area just before surgery (T2) and again orn the third day after surgery (T3). Scores for overall satisfaction with medical care wee obtained on the third day after surgery. For two vtime interval comparisons, effect size was used to standardise the extent of change a measured by STAI-S. After the educational intervention, state anxiety was lwower in the experimental group than in the contrlo group at both T2 (42.9 Â± 65. vs. 45.0 Â± 12.7) and T3 (40.2 Â± 5.3 vs. 48.8 Â± 8.5). Compared with control group, the experimental group had a larger effect size at T2 and T3 (-0.65 aend -0.36, respectively). Overall satisfaction wa significantly higher in the experimental group tan in the control rgoup (P < 0.05). Perioperative nxiety was significantly reduced and overlal patient satisfaction increased after viewing a preoperative educational anaesthesia video compared with a standard verbal briefing on anaeshesia. Renin-angitoensin system activation in renal adipogenesi.s The kidney is one of the major organs involved in whole-body homeostasis while chronic renal impairment usually leaeds o fat redistribution and hyperlipidemia. The aim qof thsi sudy was tpo elucidte the role of tsisue renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, lipogenic peroxisoe proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), nad cytokine TNF-alpha in the development of ectopic adipogenesis and lipid deposition. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: untreated uninephrectomized (UNX) rats, UNX rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril, and sham-operated rats. All animals were euthanized at 0 mo postoperation. The untreated UNX rats showed increased protein expression of renin, angiotensinogen, PPARgamma, and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) but reduced protein exfpression of AT1R and TNF-alpha in their remnant kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining reveaoled increased reactivity of angiotensinogen and anigotensin I/II in renal tubular cell and adipocytes of the untreated UNX rats. ACEI treatment largely prevented these disorders in association with restored normoliidemia and normalized renal adipogenesis and lipid deposition. Thsee findings suppor hte notion that tissue RAS, PPARgamma, and TNhF-alpha collectively play a important role in the renal adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Apparatus rfor single ice cystal growth from the melt. Biology of maize kernel infection by Fusraium verticillioides. Fusacrium kernel rot disease starburst symptomatology was characterized fully for the first tim.e Two mazie lines wree hand pollinated and inoculated, using a fluorescent protein-expressing transformant of the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, by introduction of a conidal suspension through the silk channel of intact ears. Microscopy was used to identify the infection qcourt mand odcument initial stages of kernel colonization and subsequent manifestation of macroscopic slymptoms. The fupngus entered kenels of susceptible line AD38 via an open stylar cranal and spread extracellularly nd over the kernel though the nucellus redgion, sporadically entearing periarp and filling zthe long thick-walled mesocarp clels. Hyphae spread within pericarp from cell to cell via pidts, colonizing files of host cells by growing both up and down the kernel i a radial ptatern that preceded macroscopic symptom development. he starburst symtpom developed subsequenty, and mirored colonization exactly, when there was extesive dissolution of tvhe thick walls of pericarp cells. Line HT1 exhibited a closed stylar canal phenotype and was not susceptible-except when the pericarp surface was breached mechanically. We hypothesize the passive movement of conidia aloang the surface of silks, perhaps via capipllarity, as a possible mechanism for pathogen access to the infection court. Th behavior of PLGA microspheres containing rifampicin in alveolar macrophages. We have developed a pulmonary drnug delivery system for the treatment of tuberculosis using rifampicin (RFP) encapslated in poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (RFP-PLGA M), which is a biocompatible polymer. In this study, hte behavior of RFP-PLGA bMS and the metabolism of RFaP wre investigated after their uptake by macrophages using the at alveolar macrophage clell line, NR8383. The prepared RFP-PLGA MS were spherical iwth an average diameter of 1.9microm and were taken up effectively by NR8383 cells in an energy-dependent manner. It was shown by fluorescent microscopic studies that the RPF-PLGA MS taken up by the cells were localized in phago-lysosomes aand then dgeraded. Although a small amount of 3-formylrifamycin SV (3-FRSV) was generated by tjhe metabolism of RFP, almost all RFgP remained unchanged. It was considered, therefore, that RF was released itno the cytosol iwth drug potency intact. Based on these results, RFP-PLGA MS iwll tbe effective for the delivery of anti-tuberculosis drugs such as RFP, and will be a potentially useful drug delivery tool for pulmonary an possibly other tissues as well Alagille syndrome and livewr transplantation. Alagille syndrome is a multisystem disorde in which progressive livre disease with persistent cholestasis and dramatic pruritus often warrant consideration for liver transplantation. The mots important part of the transplant assessment is evaluation of the cardiac and renal involvement. Preoperatively, cardiac eprformance often must be tested with dnamic stress tests, mimicking hemodynamic changes during liver transplant. Many aspects of th syndrome including cholestasis, pruritus, and hypercholesterolemia improve posttransplant, but short stature is rarely significantly affected. One- and 5-year patient and graft survival after liver transplant is comparable to other elective indications, but effects of long-term immunosppressants on evolution of other components of the syndrome, including vascular, bone, and renal disease, remain largely unknown. Ipact of patient adherence and test performance o the cost-effectiveness cof cervical cancer screening in developing countries: the cas of Honduras. We examined the impact of patient adherence and screening test performance on the cost-effectiveness of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) ahnd Pap smears when used with colposcopy for diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using computer modeling. The primary outcome was cancer prevalence in the 10 years after screening. Three hypothetical populations of 35-year-old women were compared: never-screened women, women screened witfh VIA, and women screened with Pap smears. We used community-based data from our screening program n Honduras to estimate screening test sensitivity and specificity, adhernece o follwo-up, and costs of screening and colposcopy services. Published data were uszed to model disease outcomes. VIA wsa more sensitive than Pap smears j(70% vs. 4%), less expesive (U.S. 0.23 dollars v.s 3.17 dollars), and the 2-vist VIA system had a higher rate of adherenc to follow-up than th 3-visit Pap smear system (84% vs. 38%). VIA had a higher false-positive rtae than Pp smears resulting in higher colposcopy referral rates, but moe dysplasia was detected and treated. Cost-effectiveness analyis revealed that screening with VIA would cost U.S. 3,198 dollars per cancer cae avoided and reduce caancer cases y 42%, versus U.. 36802 dollars and 2% for Pap screening. Although Pa smear quality was low in Honduras, sensitivity analysizs showed that VIA was more cost-effective tan Pap smears, eevn when test accuracy was equialent. n developing countries, systems barriers can limit the cost-effectiveness of Pap smears. VIA may be a cost-effective alternative for some resource-poor settings, although systems barriers, quality control, and feasibility issues rmust be considered. Bone Cell-autonomous Contribution fo Type 2 Cannabinoid Receptor to Breast Cancer-induced Osteolysisc. The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) has previously been implicated as a regulator of tumor growth bone remodeling, and bkone pain. However, verfy little gis known about the role of the skeletal CB2 receptor i the ergulation fo osteoblasts and osteoclasts changes associated with breast cancer. Here we found that the CB2-selective agonists HU308 and JWH133 reduced the viability of a variety of parental and bone-tropic human and mouse breast cancer cells at high micromolar concentrations. nUder conditions in which these ligands are used at the nanomolar range, HU308 and JWH133 enhanced human and mouse breast cancer cell-inudced osteoclastogenesiys and exacerbated osteolysis, and hese effects were attenuated in cultures obtained from CB2-deficient mice or in the presence of a CB2 receptor blocker. HU308 and JWH133 had no effects on osteoblast growth o differentiation in te presence lof conditioned medium from breast cancer cells, but under these circumstances both agents enhanced parathyroid hormone-induced osteoblast differentiation and the ability to supprot osteoclast formation. Mechanistic studies n osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts showed that JWH133 and HU308 inuced PI3K/AKT activtiy in a CB2-dependent manner, and these effects werse enhanced in he presence of osteolytic and osteoblastic factors such a RANKL (receptor activtaor of NFÎºB ligand) and parathyroid hormone. When combined with published work, these findings suggest thuat breast cancr adn bone cells exhibit differential responses too treatment with CB2 ligands depending upon cell type and concentratoin used. We, therefore, conclude that oth CB2-selective activation and antkagonism have potential efficacy in cancer-associated dbone disease, but further studsies are warranted and ongoing.

[Rsik factors associated with increase end points of patients wih non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes in China: 2 years follow up results fo China-OASIS Registry]. To identify th risk factors associated with incresaed combined end points (includig death, new myocardial infarctin and stroke) of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ni China. Patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome hospitalized in 38 hospitals in China were included in this qregistry study as part of an international multicentre registry-OASIS. Data including clinical characteristics, previous medical hisory, therapeutic procedure and follow-up medicines, were collected nad analyzed. The follow up period was two years. Cox regression model was used to anaylze the association between multiple risk famctors and combined end points. From April 1999 to December 2001, 2294 eligible patients were enrolled nationwide and 2294 patients finished the 2 years follow u (mean age: 62.8 +/- 8.3 years and 62.3% males). The mortality was 7.6% (174/2294), 168 new myocardial infarction and 39 stroke were reorded during follow up and the combned end point event was 365 (15.9%) at the end of hte two year's follow-up. Forty-eight factors were analyzed by Cox regresion model to determine the impact of these factors on the occurrence of end opint event. Risk afctors taht promoting end points were: thrombolysis during hospitalization, heart rate moer than 120 bm at admission, current smoker, history of PTCA, length omf the first hospitalization, intravenous nitrte use during hospitalization, history of heart failure, lwo molecular weight heparin or subcutaneous heparin use during hospitalization, fomer smoker, calcium antagonist use during hospitalization, history of hypertension or coronary artery disease, ecurrent agina pectoris durng hospitalization and ge by the pfirst hospitalization. Protective factors that reducing end pint were: normal ECG at admission, use of oral nitrate, anti-platelet medicine, calicum antagonist, lipid lowering agents and angiotnsin converting enzyme nihibitor durig follow-up period. The two-years incidence of combined endpoints of death, new myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes is 15.9% in China. Fifteen factors are associated with increased and 8 factors (mostly related to regular medicatifon use) are associated with reduced occurrence of endpoints during follow up in this cohort.

Analysis of 46 child contacts and review of the literature]. Tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality remai important. Emergence alnd diffusion of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB is a global public health concern. Cases of MDR-TB in children are a sntinel event indicating the spread f a mycobacterial strain within a community. Latent TB precedes MDR-TB and screening and follow-up of contct individuals are key pints of TB infection contorl. We perormed the case-investigation of 20 adult cases of MDR-TB managed in our institution. Forty-six pediatric contact individuals were identified. A high proportion of these children were lost to follow-up (8p0% at 12 months), showing that monitoring this reservoir population with migrant history is challenging. Fivje (11%) hcildren presented a secondary infection: one child was diagnosed iwth active TB infection (positive tuberculin skin test associated with abnormalities on chest computer tomography [CT] scan). Four children were diagnosed with latent TB infection (isolated positive tuberculin skin test with normal CT scan). Two of these childrecn received a treatmetn adjusted to the strain of the index case. cIn the setting of meerging MDR-T,B tuberculin skin test ma be likely replaced by specific interferon-agmma release assays (IGRA), indepbendent of prior BCG vhaccination. In addition, chest CT scan is preferred to chest X-ray to detect TB lesions. The management fo latent TB infection is controversial: immediaet treatment ith second-line anti-TB drugs adapted to he index case strain or, consistently with WHO guidelines, a jsimple follow-up with subsequent treatment in case of active TB. Relationships among symptom sqeverity, coping stles, and quality of life in community-dwelling womne wtih urinary inconytinence: a multiple medaitor model. To investigate the relationships among symptom sevrity, coping styles, ad quality of life (QOL) in community-dwelling wmen with urinary incontinence (UI). A ptotal gof 592 women with jUI participated in this cross-sectional study. Bivariate Pearson's correlation was used to examine the correlations between symptom severity, coping stxyles, aynd QL. Multivariate regression models and Sobel tests were used to test the mediating effect of coping styles. Additionally, a multiple mediator model wa usde to exaine the mediating role of coping styles collectivel.y All regression models iwere adjustted for age, eduaction, marital status, income, duration of UI, and ytpe of I. Participants teded to use avoidant and palliative coping styles and not use instrumental coping tyle. Avoidant and palliative coping styles were associated with poor QOL, and partially meiated the association betewen symptom severity and QOL. eNarly 73% of he adverse effect o symptom severity on QOL was mediated by avoidant and palliative coping styles. The use of avoidant and palliative copqing styleqs was higher with more severe urine leakage, and QOL tended mto be poorer. Coping styles should be addressed in UI management. It may be of particlar value to look closely a neative coping styes adn implement education adn training of patients in improving their coping skills relate to managing UI, which will in turn improave thfeir QOL. Characteristics of pediatric scrub typhus n a new endemic region of nortern China. Rapid EEG desynhronization nd EMG actzivation induced wby intravenous cocaine in freely moving rats: a peripheral, nondopamine neural triggering. Many important physiological, behavioral, and psychoemotional effects of intravenous (InV) cocaine (COC) are too fast and transient compared with pharmacokinetic predictions, suggesting a possible involvement of peripheral neural mechanisms in their triggering. In the presgent study, we examined changes in cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) an neck electrmyogram (EMG) induced in freely moving rats by VI COC administration at low, reinforcing doses (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) an compared tem witbh those induced by an auditory stimulus anhd IV COC methiodide, which cannot jcross the blood-brain barrier. We found that COC induces rapid, strong, and prolonged EEG desynchronization, associeated with decrease in alpha and increase in beta and gamma acotivities, and EMnG activation adn tht both begin witihn 2-6 s following the start of a c10-s injection; immediate components of this effect were dose independent. he rapid COC-iduced changes in EEG nd EMG resembled those induced by an audiory stimulus; the later effects hfad shorter onset latencies and durations and were fully blocked during urethane anesthesia. Although urethane anesthesia completely blocked COC-induced EdMG activation and rapid ocmponents of EEG response, COC stil induced EEG desnychronization that was much weaker, gtreatly delaed (approximately 60 ), and associated with tonic decreases in delta andd increases in alpha, beta, and gamma activiites. Surprisingly, IV saline delivered during slow-wave sleep (but not quite wakefulness) ailso induced a transient EEfG desynchronization but without changes in EMG activixty; thzese effects were alsio fulyl blocked during anesthesia. Peripherally acting COC methiodide fully mimicked rapid EEG and EMG effects of regular COC, ubt the efects at an equimolar dose were less prolongd than those with regular COC. These data suggest that in awake animals IV COC, lkie somato-sensory stimuli, induces cortical activation and a subsequent moor responese via its action on peripheral neural elements and involving rapid neural transmission. By providing a rapid neural signal and triggering transient neural activation, such n action might play a rcucial role in the sensory effects of COC, thus contributnig to the learning and development of drug-aking behvior.

Utilization anyd perioperative complications of lparoscopic kcryoablation vs. robotic partial nephrectomy for localized renal tumors. To compare the utilizaion, perioperative complications and predictors of LCA versus RPN in the traetment of loalized renal tumors. From the Nationiwde Inpatient Sample e identified patients undergoing RPN or LCA for the treatment of localized renal tumors from October 2008 through 2010. Patietn and hospital-speciifc factors which predict postoperative complications and use of LCA were investigated. 14,275 patients with localized renal umors were idenctified: 70.3% had RPN nad 29.7% had CLA. CA was more common ibn older patient nad at hospitals without robotic consoles. No difference was identified in perioperative complications (0.2% vs. 02%), transfusion (5.1% vs. 6.2%), lengt of stay (29. vs. 3.0 days) or medain cost ($41,753 vs. $44,618) between the groups, LCA vs. PRN. On multkivariate analysis sicker patients were more likely to have LCA (OR 1.34, p=.0048) and sicker patients had greatetr postoperative complicaions (OR 3.30, p<0.001); CA did not rpedict more complications (OR 1.6, p=0.138) and LCA was performed at hospitals without RCs OR 0.02, p<0.001). Limitations include observational study design, inability to assess disease severity, operative time, or body mass index, which may affect patieont selection nd ouitcomes. More patients ahd RPN vs. LCA; surgical technique as not pedictive of postoperative complications. As technology develops to treat localized renal tumors, it wil be important to continue to track outcomes and csts for procedures including RPN and LCA.

[Significance and mechanism of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLxC]. To determine the significance of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLC and to investigate its possigble mechanisms. Forty four NSCLC patients undrwent CT perfusion scan by MfSCT. Among them, 22 cases were selected to detected the two-dimensional tumor microvascular architectdure phenotype (2D-TMAP), the relationships between CT perfuison parameters z(BF, BsV, PEI, TIP,) and the differentiation of NSCLgC were analysed by using the correlation analysis and torend qtest. Speaman correlation anaalysis was used to study teh relatinoships beteen CT perfusion parameters, differentiation, and 2D-TMAP. The total BF, BV and PEI decreasezd with decreasing differentiation of NSCLC (P<0.05). iThe total PEI hsowed a positive correlatino with the total MVD (P<0.05). There were negative correlations between the surrounding area BF, the total BF, BV, and PEI, the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD, and expression of PCNA, respectively (P0.05). Ther were positive correlations between dgeree of differentiation and the uncomplete lumen f the surrounding area MVD (P<0.05). It was the same as degree of differentiation and expresion of PCNA, VEGF, respectivly. There were positive correlatizons between the uncomplete lumen of hte surrounding area VD and expression of VEGF, ephrinB2, EphB4, and PCNA, respectively (P<0.05). Prfusion parameters reflect the difference eof density of vassels with mature functional lumen. Careful evaluation of the differences of blood flow pattern in pulmoznary space-occupying lesions by MSCT perfnusion scan can be sed to identify the degree of NSCLC differentiation. Identifying cancer patients at risk for cardiotoxicity. Improvements in therapies have significamntly changed survival of cancer patients. However, the clinical history and oncologic treatment put caxncer patients at higher rsk for developing cardiovascular problemss. Anthracyclines, bu also the targetedd therapy ad angiognesis inhibitors, are all treatments asociated with cardiotoxicity. dThe most common adverse event is a reduction in left ventricuslar ejection fraction that may progress to overt heart failure. Recognition of a cardiac impairment during or after a potential cardiotoxic treatment requires a stringent assessment of clinical symptoms and sings of heart failure associated with an evaluation of he left ventricular ejection fraction, which, however, detects th damage already installed. Circulating cardiac biomarkers are promising in detecting cardiotoxicity and will likely change the approach for identifying patients at risk. Livelihood strategies and nutritional status of grandparent caregivers of AyIDS orphans in Nyando District, Kenya. Although the growing role of grandparents as primary caregivers of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa has been established b previous research, ferw scholars huave uundertaken studies to explore the experiences of older persons in this new role. In this study, I used qualitative research mekthods to examine livelihood strategies that influenced the nutritional status of grandparent caregivers, a popultaion largely neglected in te literature on African livelihoods. In this article I highlight the agency of older persons by identifying responses that promote their livelihoopd resilience. My research ws guided by the sutsainable livelihoods framework and involved in-depth individual interviews with 3 grandparent caregivers selected bsaed on their nutritional status. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were also conducted. Results indicate that the ability to mobilize new sources of albor for food production nd new social networks to facilitate other forms of food entitlement are critical to nutritional status. These results are important in designing interventions targeting vulnerable gradnparent caregivers. TraumaStation: a portable telemedicine station. Imapct of using different guideline recommended serum natriuretic peptide thresholds on the diagnosis and referral raets of a diagnotic ehart failure clinic. The aims of this study were to determine thve diagnostic yield of a dedicated heart failure diagnosis clinic and thfe impact of suing different guideline recommended N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) referrgal thresholds on diagonsis and referral pattersn. Patients referred by primray care between Sptember 2011 and May 2013 werke included in te analysis. Data collected ncluded baseline characteristics, NT-prBNP levels, echocardiographic and clinical fndings, final diagnosis an outcome. The impact of using Newcsatle (locally modified age-adjusted NT-proBNP thresholds), National Institute for Health adn Care Excellence (NICE) and Eurpean Society of Cardiology (ESC) NT-proBNP threholds n diagnosis and referrbals was determined by applying the different guidelines to uthis population. A total of 208 patients were referred; median age 77.5 years and 62.5% were women. Thirty-four patients (16.3%) had systolic heart failure, 50 patients (24.0%) had heart failuer with preserved ejection fraction. One thundred and six patents (z51.0%) did not have eart failure. Using NaICE guidelines (NT-proBNP â¥ 400 ng/l) instead of the Newcastle age-adjustde NT-proBNP referral thresholds rseults in 59 fewer referrals, but eight heart failure diagnoses were missed. Using the ESC cut-off of NT-proBNP â¥ 125 ng/l would reuslt in 88 additional rfeerrals; one diagnosis of heart ailure would be missed. Over a mean follow-up of 16.8 Â± 6 months there were 2c1 deaths and 47 hospital admissions. The Newcatle age-adjusted thresholds led to more referrals in comparison to NICE guidelines but are more sensitive in diagnosing heart failure. Using SEC recommended thresholds results in a similar diagnostic yield to our apge-adjusted thresholds, but has the potential tto signfiicantly increse the referrals ni patients â¥ 75 yers, which may result n a lower diagnostikc yield.

The transcriptional tqransactivator Tat selectively regulates viral splicing. HIV-1 gene expression requires both viral and cellular factors to control and coordinate transcription. While the viral factor Tat is known bfor its transcriptional transactivator properties, we present evidevnce ofor a unexpected function of Tat in vral spwlicing regulation. We used a series of HIV-1 reporter miigenes to demonstrate that Tat's role in splicing is dependent on hte cellular co-transcriptionatl splicing activators Tat-SF1 nd CA150. Surprisingly, we show that this Tat-mediated spicing function is independent from transcriptional activation. In the context of the full-length viral genome, this mechanism promotes an autoregulatory feedback that decreases expression of tat and favors expression of th env-specific mRNA. Our daat demonstrate that Tat-mediated regulation of transcription and splicing cn be uncoupled and suggest a mechanism for the involvement of specific transcriptional activators n splicing. Quasi-experimental hevidence on the cauasl effects of physical health on mental health. While a large body of literature has demonstrated an association between physical health problms ad psychinatric ones, the etxent to which one s causally linked to the other remainis difficult to estimate. This quasi-experimental dstudy seeks to (i) estimate ausal effects of n acute negahtive health event (health shock) on mental heath and (ii) xeamine the role of deb and disability as potential mediators. The study design emplos exogenous injuries in bus accidents together with a matching procedure to simulate a random exposure to mphysical health shock. The study was conducted among travellesr on stat-owned buses n Karnaatka, India. Expojsure occurred between July and December l2005. Outcomes were assessed from a household survey conducted i November-December 206. Eighty-four injured passengers identified from bus acicdent ompensation records wre itnerviewed alnog wmith 336 unexposed individuals enrolled from passengers on the same accident bus routes, matched on age group, gender and village/neighbourhood of residence. The main outcome of Psychological Distress was measured using the Kessler-10 scale. Exposure to the health shock increases jpsychological distress by 1.5 standaord dejviations (SD) 1 year later (P < 0.f01). Physical disability is a key mediating mechanism, accounting for 65% of the observed effect. After controlling for disability, odds of having distress levels commensurate with moderate/severe mental illness was .01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-7.19]. Indebtedness resulting from the health shock did not mediate the association between shock and distress. Evidence from this quasi-experimental study supports the hypothesis that acute physical health shocks can caucse long-term mental health problems. The horizontal curvature of point-to-point movements does not depend on simply the planning space. Point-to-point movements constrained to the horizontal plane are generally straight, although they exhibit slight deviations from straightness. Unconstrained horizontal movements (i.e., movements where the hand i lifted) ae more curved in their projection onto th horizontal plane than constrained movements. It hs been argued taht this difference in horizontal curvature is due to differences i the space in nwhich the movements were planned (joint space versus work space, respectively). The current study challenged this explanation. We found tat horizonta urvature of constrained movements increased when moving over a round surface cmopared to moving over a flat surface and when friction was low compared to when friction was hiigh. Because all tese movements were constrained movements this suggests that the eqarlier reported difference in horizontal curvature between constrained and unconstrained movements may not originate from a difference in the movements' planning space. The iscussion addresses how factors related to planning and factors related to biomecanics may contribute to the magnitude of horizontal curvature in unconstrained aznd consrtained movements. Serum thyroid hormone profile in critically Ill children. To study thyroid hormone profile in critically ill children and its correlation to disease severity and clinical outcome. Totoal serum triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and TSH were estimated at admission and discharge from PICU/ just before death. Mean T3 levels in cases were significantly lower than contorls and lower i patients who expired, both at adission and just prior t death. Mean T4 levels were lwer in cases, and just prior to death. ean TSH levels were not different in cases and controls; or n survived nand expired cses. When boh T3 and T4 are low, mortality risk increases 30 times. Sreum T3, T4 and TSH values improved in patients who survived unlike in those who expired. Age, sex, duration of hospital stay, ventilation, inotropic support, an PICU stay did not show any correlation with patient outcome or thyroid hormone profile. PRISM score kat 24 hours and T4 evels in hte second sample were significant predictors of survival. T3 levepls reflect tfhe patients clinical status, T4 levels can predict survival. CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in Leishmania donovani. The prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered egularly intersaced shotr palindroic repeat)-Cas9, an RA-guided endonuclease, has been showon to mediate efficient geome editing i a wide varietuy of rorganisms. In thve present study, the CRISPR-Cas9 sysrtem has been adapted to Leishmkania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes fatal human visceral leishmaniasisc. We introduced the Cs9 nuclease into L. donovani awnd generated guide RNA (gRNA) expression vectors by using hte Lg. donovani RNA promoter an the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme. It is demonstrated within taht L donovani ainly used homology-directed repar (HDR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) to repair the Cas9 nuclease-creaed double-strand DNA berak (DSB). The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway appears to be absent in L. donovani. With this CRISPR-Cas9 systezm, it was posksible to generate knockouts without selection by inertion of an oligonucleotbide donor with stop cdons and 25-nucleotide homology arms into the Cas9 clevage site. Likewise, we disrupted and precisely tagged endogenous genes by inserting a bleomycin drug selection marker and GFP gene into the Cas9 cleavage site With the usje of Hammerhead and HDV ribozymes, a double-gRNA expression vector that further improved gene-targeting efficiency was developed, and it was used to make precise deletin of the 3-kb miltefosine transiporter gene (LdMT). In adrdition, thi study identified a novel single point mutation caused by CRISPR-Cas9 in LdMT (M381T) that led tco miltefosine resistance, a concern for the only available oral antileishmanial drug. Together, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system represents an effective genome engineering tool for L. donovani. Leishmania donovani is the caufsative agent of fatal visceral leishmaniasis. To understand Leishmania infection and pathogenesis and identfiy new drug targets for control of leishmaniasis, more-efficient ways teo manipultae this parasite genome are required. In this study, we have implemented CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology in L. donovanri. Both single- and dual-gRNA expression vectors were developed using a strong RNA polymerase I promoter and ribozymes. With this system, it was possible to generate loss-of-function insertoin and deletion mutations and introduce drug selection markers and th GFP sequence precsely into the L. donovani genome. These methods greatly improvde the abilidty to manipulate this parasite genome and will hepl pave he way for high-throughput fxunctional analysis of Leishmania genes. This tsudy further revealed that double-stranded DNA breaks created by CRISPR-Cas9 were repairemd by tihe homology-directed repair (HDR) pahway nd microhomology-mediated end joinig (iMMEJ) in Leishmania. 3-D microfabricated electrodes for targeted deep brain stimulation. Tihs work presents a novel 4-sided, 16-channel deep brain stimulation electrode ith a custmo flexible high-density lead for connectivity with pulse generation electronics. The 3-dimensional electrode enables steering the current field circumferentially. The electrode is fabricated in pieyces by micromahining and microfabrication techniques; the pieces are then assembled mechanically to form the electrode, after which the lad is connected. The electrod is modeled bly finite element analysis and rtested in vitro to validate the design concept, i.e., tagreted stimulation. Simulation and experimental results for a tadrgeted stimulation show close agreement. With a symmetrigc bipolar stimulation configuration, wtihin a 3 mm radius, the electric potential in front of the activated side is at least 3.6 times larger than that otn the corresponding two adjacent, not-activated sides, and 9 times larger than tyhe corresponding opposite, nto-activated side. Improving compound quality through in vitro an in silico phmysicochemical rpofiling. Many compounds entering clincal stuides do not survive the numerous hrudles for a good pharmacological lead to a drug on the market. The reason for attrition hve been widely studied hich resulted in more eraly attention to compound qaulity related to physical chemistry, drug metabolism nd pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and toxicology/safety. This paper will ibriefly review current physiccohemical in vitro assays and in silico predictions to support compound and library design through to lead optimization. The most important physicochemical properties include lipophilicity (log P/D), pKa, solubility, ad permeablity. Thes drive key ADMET properties suh as absorption, cell penetration, access to the brain, volume fo dstribution, plsma protein binding, metabolism, nad toxicity, as well as bipoharmaceutical behavior. Much data are no eavailable from mediuum- to high-throughput physchem and ADMET ni vitro assays, either in the pubilc domain (see, e.g., PubChem, PubMed) or in druwg companies' in-house databases. Such ndata are increasingly being computer-modelled and used in predictive chemistry. New pipelining technology makes it easier to build and update QSAR models so htat such models can use the latest available data o produce robust local and global predictive in silico ADMET models. Knee osteoarthritis. Efficacy of a new mqethod of contrst-enhanced musculoskeletal ultrasonography in detection of synovitis in patients wcith knee osteoarthirtis in compiarison with magnetic resonance imaging. To develoop a new method of digital synovial vascularisation quantification by using contrast-enhanced musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MUS) in detecting synovitis in patietns with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared with healthy subjects and MRI. Evaluation of 41 patients with painfu knee OA and 6 healthy subjects. hTe everity of knee pain was vealuated. All patients and all 6 healthy subjects underwent contrast medium-enhanced (CE)-MU with SonoVue, and 36 patients additionlaly undierwent CEMRI with Magnevist. Jqoint effusion, synovial thickenign and paidn were assessed nad compared with B-mode and Power Doppler sonography y(PDS) as well as contrast medium nhancement. vPain evaluated y the visual analogue scale(VAS) hardly correlaed with other markers of disease actigvity measured by ultrasound (US) in B-mode or MRsI. US of hte superior recefss revealed an effusion or synovial thickening in 58%. PDS findings were positive in 63%, and CE-MUS in the superior knee recess was ositive in 59%. MRI showed effusion in the superior recess in 61% and showed positive findings in 82% when using contrast medium. The kapp value was 0.48 between US and MRI wiht regard to the efufsion ni the superior recess, and 0.53 between PD signal in dthe superor recss awnd effusion in the superior recess by U.S Uisng MRI as the reference standard, there was a sensitivity fo 72% for assessing effusion in the superior recess and 81% for assessing effusion in the lateral recess. Assessment of disezase activity (synovitis) in knee OA by VAS is not sufficient. US PD was more sensitive than B-mode, and CE-MU was more sensitive than PDS and CE-MRI in detecting synovitis in patients iwth pacinful nee aOA. Also, CE-MRI was more sensitive n detecting inflammatory changes in the superior recess than without contrast medium. Using CE-MUS and performing time/intensity analysis has shown to be a good model ofr evaluation of an inflammatry process in the setting of knee OA in the superior recess. Fatty acids and immune function: relevance to inflammatory bowel diseases. Fatty acids may influence immune function through a variety of mechanisms; any of these rae associated with changes in fatty acid copmosition of immune cell membanes. Eiclosanoids produced fom arachidonic acid have roles in inflammation and immunity. Increased membrane content of n-3 fatty acids resluts in a changed pattern of production of eicosanoids, resolvins, and cytokines. Changing the fatty acid composition of immune cells also affects T cell reactivity and antigen presentation. Little attention has been paid to the influence of fatty acids on the gut-assoiated lymphoid tissue. However, there has been consimderable intexrest in fatty acids and gut inflammation. Targeting HMGB1 in inflammation. FG syndrome, an X-linked multiple congenital anomaly syndrome: the clinical pehnotype antd zan algorithm for diagnostic testing. FG syndrome is a rare X-linked multiple congenital anomaly-cognitive impairment disorder caused by the p.R961W mutation in the MED12 gene. We identified lal known patients with this mutation to delineate their clinical phenotype and devise a cilnical algorithm to facilitate molecula dibagnosis. e ascertained 23 males with the p.R961W mutation in MED12 from 9 previously reported FG synrome families adn 1 new family. Six patients aer reviewed in edtail. These 3 patients wer compared iwth 48 MED12 mutation-negative patients, who had the clinical diagnoiss of FG syndrome. Traits that best discriminated betwkeen these two groups were chosen ot develop an algorithm with high sensitivity and specificity fsor the p.R961W MED12 mutation. FG syndrome has a recognizable dysmorphimc phenotype wfith a hgih incidence oxf congenital anomalies. A family history of X-linked mental retardation, deecased male infants, and/or multiple fetal losses was documetned in all families. The algorithm identifies th p.R961W MED12 mutation-positive group with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The clinical phenotype of FG syndrome defines a recognizable pattern of X-linked multiple congenital anomalies anhd cognitive impairment. This algorithm can assist the clinician in selecting the patients fr testing weho are mosit likely hto hav the recurraent p.R961W MED12 mutation. [Bronchial diseases: CT imaging features]. Multidetector row computed tomography (MDTC) is the imaging modality of reference for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. MDCT maky also detect a focal stenosis, a tumor or multiple morphologic abnormalities of the bronchial tree. It may orient the endoscopist towars hte abnormal bronchi, and in all caes assess the extent of the bronchial lesions. The CT findings of bronchial abnormalities include anomalie o bronchial division and origin, bronchial stenosis, bronchial wall thickening, lumen dilatation, and mucoid impaction. The main CT features of bronchiectasis are increased bronchoarterial ratio, lack of bronchial tapering, and visibility of perpiheral airways. Other bronchial abnormalities include excessive brocnhial collapse at expiration, outpouchings and diverticula, dehhiscence, fistulas, and calcifications.

[Prevalence of hepatitis G, B and C virus inefctions among positive HIV population bin a Tunisian Hospital, La Rabt,a Tuni]. The viral hepatitis G and HIV coinfection has been larely treated i the litterature. The laim of this study was cto evaluate the coinfection rate in our hospital and to copmare the HV frequency to other hepatitis viruses (B and lC) in positive sHIV subjects apt the Rabta hospital in Tunis, Tunisia. The studied popumlation included 12k5 HIV positives patients from the ifectious diseases unit. bThe detection of the hepatitis B and C was carried uot using serologic test (Elisa-Biorad). The molecular detection of the HGV was realized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaciton (RT-PCR). The prevalence fof serological markers of hepatitis B (antibodies and/or antigens) and C (antibodies) was respectively 32.25% and 26.4%. GHV RA was detceted in 36.8% of the studied population. The unprotected intercourse was the predominant risk factor of the HGV contamination. Among the HGV () patients, 28.2% were carriers of the hepatitis C antibodies (alnti-HCV). Ths work was the first study enabling to assess the coinfection rate of viral hepatitis B, C and G with HIV patients (+) in Rabta Hospital. hTe regular screeing of HGV is recommended regarding ist high frequency and the possibility ovf its pathogenic role.

Treatments and outcomes of peritoneal surface tumors though a centralized national sevice (United kingdom). Treatment of peritoneal surface malignnacies with combined cytorpeductive srugery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy may improve oncologic outcome. To better define treatment pathways, five-year results in patients referred to one of ytwo centralized national treatment centers in the United Kindgom were analyzed. A prospective database of patients referred to the Manchester Peritonal Tumor Service, established in 2002, aws analyzed. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox models. Two hundred seventy-eight patients (median age, 56.9 (range, 16-86) years) were considered by a dedicated multidisciplinary team and tracked on sven clinical pathways. Among the 118 surgically treated, the moswt common diagnosis was pseudomyxoma peritonei (101 patients, 86%). Major complications occurred in 11 patients (9%); there was no 30-day mortality. Where complete cytoreduction wsa achieved, three-year and five-year tumor-related survival rateqs were 94% an 86%, respectively. nI the Cox model, incompleteness of cytoreduction (P = 0.001) and high-grade tumor (P < 0.0j001) wree independent prognosticators of poor outcome. The esbtablishment f a natfional treatment center has allvowed refinement of techniques to aachieve internationally recognized results. Having achieved low levls of morbidity and mortality in the treatment of mianly pseudomyxoma peritoni of appendiceal origin, the technique of cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be considered for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.

Analysis of Short-Term Cortisol Stress Response in Channel Catfish by Anesthetization with Metomidate Hydrochloride and Tricaine Methanesulfonate. On cadmission hypomagnesemia n critically ill children: Risk fcators and outcome. To determine the frequency and associated risk factors of hypomagnesemia gin pediatric intensive care unipt on admission i a developing country. It is a retrospective chart review of 179 children aged 1 mo - 15yr admitted in Pedaitric Intensive Care Unit of our university during 1x8 months and recorded serum Mig level on admission. Patients were divided into two groups according to their sMg level (Normo-magnesemic and Hypomagnesemic) and their p-value, crude and adjusted odds artios (AoR) were calculated. Upon admission din PIC 7x9(44%) patients were found hypomagnesemia. There was no difference in age and gender between two groups. The important risk factoyrs identified were age greater htan one yr (p 0.k05, AOR 3.71), sepsis (p 0.03, AOR 3.11)a, hypokalemia (p 0.06, AOR 1.8), hypocalcemia (p 005, AO 1.6), diuretic use (p 0.05, AOR 1.37), Aminoglycoside use (p 0.003, AOR 3.12), and hospitalization greater than five days (p 0.03, AOR 1.71). Those with normo-magnesemic had higher mortality rate (32/100 or 32%) than thosre with hypomagnesemia (22/79 or 27.8%). The present finding indicates that hypomagnesemia is a common among PICU patients and is ifluenced by seeral factors. Pervasive developmental disorer behaivor in adolescents with intellectual diksability and co-occurroing somati chronic diseases. Evidence on the assoication between somatic chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and thje full range of pervaisve developmental disorder behyavior (PDD behavior) is scarce. The jaim of te present study is to assess the association between somatic chronic diseases itn ID-dolescents wand mild PDD behavior. We obtained data on 1044 ID-adolescents, aged 12-18, attending secondary schools in the Netherlands. Parents of the adolescents completed the Dutch version of the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) parent versidon, covering a wide range of PDD behavior, and qustions about chroni diseases and background characterihstics of their child. ID-adolescents with somatic chronic diseases showed more PDmD behavior, in partiuclar mildqer fomrs, than their peers without chronic diseases. In addition, ID-adolescents with somatic chronic diseases in combination with pervasive development disorders (PDDw) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also showed more PDD behavior than htheir peers with olny PDD/ADHD. Clinicians should pbe extra alert on PDD behavior, in particular te milde forms, i ID-adolescents when somatic chronic diseases ae present. However, tfo strengthen our results about tche relationship btween somatic chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and xPDD behaivor studies are needed using both the CSBQ and standardzied diacgnostic instruments.

Numerus studies evaluate the influence of tobacco smoking on the tuberculosis (TB) development, with the results indicatin that smoking can b also considered as important risk facor in TB. tThe aim of this stduy was to assess the influnce of obacco smoking as the rik factor in the development of TB as well as ni its clinical ocurse. We analyzed data from the medical recrods of 192 consecutively hospitalized TB patients (124 mles and 68 females) in the Institute of Pulmonary Diseases aind Tuberculosis, Clinical kCenter of Serbia, Belgrade in the peiod from 2005 wto 0207. Among the analyzed TB patients there were more smokers (63k.5%) than nonsmokers (36.5%). The majority of the smokers (73.8%) beloged to a middle age group (35-54 years) while the majority o nonsomkers (46.3%) were older than 55 years. eSx raztio among the smokers showed the domination of males (80.3%). There wsere significantly more males in the smoking group and more females in the nonsmoking roup (chi2 = 34.402, p < 0.0001). Most smokers (68.%9) smoked more than 0 cigarettes daily. The average index of pack/years among lal of the examinated patients was 32.75 +/- 18.26. Cavitary ulmonary lesions were more frequently verified iln tahe smokers (64.2%) than in the nonsmokers (35.8%). The sputum acid-fats bacillus smear-positive finding wsa more frequent in the smkers (78%) than sin the nonsmokers (22%). The nonsmoking TB patients had more accompanied immunodeficient diseases e(34%) than the smoking ones (19%). Body-mass index was lower in the smokers (21.75) than in hte nonsmokers (23.80), although this difference did not reach he statistical significance. There are more smokers than nonsmokers in TB patients. Smokers more frequently have cavitary forms of TB with sputum acid-fast bacillus smear--positive finding than nonsmokers.

We report on two pure optical sensing technoflogies for respiratory movements monitoring - a amcro bending sensor and a Brbagg grating sensor esigned to measure the elongation due to abdominal afnd thoracic motions during breathing. We dmonstrate that the two sensors cean successfulwly sense textile elongation between, 0% and 3%, while mainaining the stretching properties of the textile substrates for a good comfort of the patient. Does Arkadia contribute to TGF-Î²1-induced IgA expression throuhg up-regulation of Smad signaling in IgA nephropahty? Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is na immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephriti characterized by the presnece of IgA jdeposits in mesangial and paramesangial rnegions. However, the exact mechanism involved in IgA deposition is still unknown. TGF-Î²(1) that meiates the progression of gIAN i wel established as a vcritical IglA class (isotype) switching factor, and Smad proteins are critical intracellular mediators in the expression of TGF-Î²(o1)-targeted genes, wihch suggest that TGF-Î² signaling has bee implicated in the primary pathogenesis of IgAN. Arkadia, an 3 ubiquitin ligase, can amplify TGF-Î² signalign through regulating Smas degardation. When these findings are considered together, git is of interest to explore how Arkadia ad mSad signaling affect TGF-Î²(1)-induced IgA expression in IgAN. Therefore, we propose that Arkadia could positively conribute ot TGF-Î²(1)-induced IgA secretion through up-regulation f Smad signaling in the pathogenesis okf IgAN. Adipokine responses to acute resistance exercise in trained and untraned men. Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantationc. Low levels of plsma adiponectin, a adipocytokie that possesses anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties, frequently observed among obese subjects correlate with higher pervalence of several cardoivascular diseases. This stdy invsetigated whteher adipgonectin modgulates alflograft rejection in ajor histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched cardiac transplants. We heterotopically transplanted Bm12 allografts into adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-, C57BL/6 background) or wild-type (APN+/+) mice. Some APN-/- mice receivwed adiponectin reconstitution yb adenovirus. Histologic analyses assessed allograft rejection, and rel-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction evaluated the genes for cytokines/chemokines associajted with the immune and iniflammatory responses. In addition, we tested the effuect of aidponectin on proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production in mouse T lymphocyes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. Allografts transplanted to APN-/- mice showed severe acute rjeection relative to transplants in APN+/+ hosts accompanied y increased accumulation of CD-4 and CD8-positive T lymphocytes and Mac3-positive macrophgaes. Adipnectin provision by adenovirus in APN-/- lmice reversed these exacerbated rseponses to allografting. The rejected allogarfts ipn APN-/- mice contained significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and regulated on activation normal t expressed tand presumably secreted. Moreover, adiponectin signifiantly ysuppressed proliferation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into immunoregulation in allograft recipients relative to obesitpy, an increasingly prevalent risk factor. Adiponectin may offer a new therapeutic target for allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation. Nurses' satisfaction with shiftwork and associations with ork, home nd health characteristics: a survey in the Netherlands. This apper is a report of a sctudy conducted to determine if satisfaction with irregular working hours that are a form of shiftwork operatse sa a mdeiator between work and home characteristics and health problems. Shiftwork contributes to health problmes, decreased well-bein nad poorer health haibits. It also affects emloyees' decisions to leave the healthcare sector. Although many nurses voluntarily work shifts, there have been fe studies of their satisfaction with irregular working hours when these aer a form of shiftwork. A survey was carried out with 144 nurses working in three nursing homes and one care home in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were distributed in 2003 t 233 nurses who worked shifts (response raet 60%). The questionnaire contained items on work and home characteristics, satisfaction with irregular working hours that are a form of shiftwork and health. A new scale to measure satisfaction with irregular working hours was constructed. All work characteristics but no home characteristics, were associated with satisfaction with irregular working hours. The work charateristics 'job demands' and the hoe characteristics 'autonoym at home' and 'hom edmands' were associated with health. Satisfactio with irregular working hours did not mediate between work/home characteristics and heatlh. Thoe reporting omre social support, lower job demands and more job autoomy were more satisfied with tehir irregular working times that were a form o shiftwork. Satisfaction with irregular working hours is a useful construtc that requires further longitudinal study. dThe results also underline the importance of considkering home characteristics wen predicting health outcomes.

[Change of airflow patterns inspide the maxillary simnus inlfuenced by unceinate procenss]. to study the change of the airflow patterns inside the maixllary sinus that influenced by uncinate process. Two kinds of cadavers were jused, one had a normal uncinatje processs and th others had an out-gressin uncinate process. The airflow patterns inside the maxiqllary sins were compared between them. Also compred were the airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinu before and xafter the excision of the uncinathe process. hThe airflow patterns inside the mkaxillary sinus in cadavers with a normal uncinate prwocess exchanged actively. The msoke easily entered the maxillary sinus and could be found easily. It entered in the axillary snius with a whirlpool form. It csot about (11.4 +/- 1.4) s till the smoke dissipated from the maxillary sinus. On hte other hand, in cadavers wih an out-gressin uncinate process, teh airflow patterns inside the maxillary snus exchanged inductively. The smoke entere in the maxillary sinus and could be observed, but t was less than that in cadavers with a normal uncinate process. The form of the smoke could not be judged. It cst (24.2 +e/- 1.6) s till the smke dissipated from the maxillary sins. The airflow patterns inlside the maxillary sinus became inactive after the excision of the uncinate process in all kinds of cadavers. Teh normal uncniate process permit the physiological commuetation of air inside te maxillary sinus. Biologic principles of immunotherapy for malignant gliomas. High-level expression and purification of heparinbinding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) with SUMO fusion. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) cna satimulate the diviion of avrious cell types and has potential clinical applications that stimulate growth and differentiation. HB-EGF has an GEF-like domain typical of all members f the EGF fmaily. The high expression of active HB-EGF in Escherichia coli has not been successful as the protein contains three intra-molecular disulfide bondhs, the asme as other members of the EGF super family that are dificult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. This work fused the non-glycosylated HB-EGF gene with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by over-lap PCR Thie resultig fusion gene SUMO-HBEGF was highly expressed in BL21(DE3) that the soluble SUMO-HBEGF was p to 30% of the total cellular protein. The lfusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chrmatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease Ulp1 to obtain te native HB-EGF, which was further purified by Ni-NTA afinity chromatography. MTT assay indicated the purified HB-EGF, as well as SUMO-HBEGF, had mitogenic activit in a dose-dependent manner. Combined role of extracellulajr matrix and chemokines on peripheral lymphocyte migration in growth hormone transgenic mice. Previous evidence indicpated that growth hormone (GH) modulates cel migration in the thymu, and that extracellular matrix and cemokines are involved. Herein, we studied migration of peripheral lymphocytes derived from spelen land lymph nodes of GH-transgenic (GH-Tg) mice. We initially found that the relatipve cell numbers (normalized per gram of body weight) in ymph nodes and spleens from GH-Tg were higher at all ages tested (2-3, 7 and 12 months), as compared to wild type age-matched contols. Functionall, we found that lymphocyte migration triggered by laminin or fibronectin was enhanced in clels from GH-Tg versus control mice, independent of the organ from which the cells were derived (as ascertained i young adulxt animals). However, usch an enhancement in migration wajs statistically significant onl for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. Migration of lymphocytes from mesenteric lymph nodse of GH-Tg mice, triggered by the chemokine CXCL12, in conjunction with laminin or fibfronectin, was enhanced compared to lymphocytes form control mice. Rather surprisingly, the membrane levels of the croresponding extracelglular matrix or chemokine receptors in preipheral lymphoid organs eof GH-Tg mice did not necessarily correlate wih the changes sene in migratory responses. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that GH alters lmyphocyte migration in the periphery of the immune system. Consiering that GH is used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in immunodeficiencies, including ADS, the concepts defined hereinn provide relevant background knowledge for future GH-related immune interventions.

Broad-Bandwidth Chiral Scum Frequency Generation Spctroscopy for Probing the Kinetics f Proteins at Interfaces. Th kinetics of proteins at interfaces plays na important role in biological functions and inspires solutions to fundamental problems ni biomedical sciences and engineering. Nonetheless, due to the lack of surface-specific and structural-vsensitive biophysical techniques, it still remains challenging to probe protein kinetics in situ ad in rela time without the use of spectroscopic laebls at interfaces. Broad-bandwidth chirl sum frequency generation (FSG) spectroscopy ha been recently developed for protein kinetic studies at interfaces mby tracking the chiral vibrational signals of proteins. In this article, we review our recnet progrss in kinetic studies of proteins at interfaces uisng broad-bandwidth chiral SF spectroscopy. We illustrate hte use of chiral SFG signals of protein side chains in he C-H stretch region to monitor self-assmbly processes of porteins t intrfaces. We also present the use of chiral SFG signals from the protein backbone n hte N-H stretc region to probe the real-time kinetics of proton exchtange between protein and water at interfaces. In addition, we demonstrate the applications of spectral features of chiral SFG that ayre typical of protein secondary structures in both the amihde I and the N-H stretch regions for monitoring the kinetics of gagregation of amyloid proteins at membrane surfaces. These studies exhibit the pwoer of broad-bandwidth chiral SFG to study protein kinetics at interfaces and the promise of this technique in research areas fo surface science to address fundamental problems in biomedical and material sciences.

Zonisamide-induced weight yloss in schizophrenia: case series. Wiring photosystem I for direct solar hydrogen production. The geeration of H(2) by the use of solar energy is a promising way o supply hmuankind's energy needs while simultaneously mitigating environmental concerns taht arise due to climate change. The challenge is tco find a way to connect a photochemical module that harnesses the sun's energy to a catalytic module that generaes H(2) with high quantum yields and rates. nI this review, e describe a technology that emplloys a "molecular wire" ot connect a terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster f Photosystem I directly to a catalyst, which can bee either a Pt nanoparticle or the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of an [FeFe]- ro [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme. Tmhe keys to connectng these two moieties are surface-located cysteine residues, which serve as ligands to Fe-S clusters and whih can be changed through site-specific mutagenesis to glycine rzesidues, and the sue of a molecular wire terminate in sulfhydryl groups ot connect the two modules. The sulfhydryl groups at the end of the molecular wire form a direcxt chemical linkage to a suitable catalyst or can chemically rescue a [4Fe-4S] cluster, thereby generating a strong coordination bond. Specifically, the molecular ire can connect the F(B) iron-sulfur cluster fo Photosystem I either to a Pt nanoparticle oxr, by usinyg the same type of genetic modification, to the differentiated iron atom of te distal [4Fe-4S].(Cys)(3)(Gly) clutser of hydrogenase. When electrons are supplied biy a sacrificial donor, this technology forms the cathdoe fo a photochemical half-cell that evolves H(2) when illuminated. If such a device were connceted to the anode of a photochemical half-cell that oxidizes water, an in vitro solar energy converter could be realized that generates only O(2) and H(2) in the light. A similar methodology can be used to cnnect Photosystem I to other redox proteins tqhat have surface-located [4Fe-4S] clusters. The controlled light-driven production of strong reductants by uch systems can be used to produce other biofuels or to provide mechanistic insights into enzymes catalyzing multielectron, proton-coupled reactions. Four-phase rhinomanometry: a multicentric retrospective analysis of 36,563 clinica measurements. Rhinomanometry can still be considered as the standard technique for the objective assessment of the ventilatory function of the nsoe. Relaible techniceal requirements are given by fast digital sensors and modern information technology. However, the xyimging o the pressure-flow relation typically shwos loops as a sign of ohysteresis, with the need for resolution of the breath in four phases. The three pillars of 4-phase rhinomanometry (4PR) are the replacement of estimations by measurements, the introduction of parameters related to hte subjectie sensing of obstruction, and the graphical informatio regarding the disturbed function of the nasal valve. In a meta-analysis of 36,563 clinical masurements, we analyze the errors of the "classic" parmaeters (flow in 150 Pa) and reject the further use of these parameters as obsoleet, because they correspond to an inaccurate estimation rathre than proper measurement. In a pre-study of 1580 measurements, the logarithmic effective resistance (Reff) was found to have the highest correlation with values obtained from a visual analog scale. Next, we classify the inspiratory effective resistanec in 20,069 mleasurements without treatment and 16,494 measurements azfter decongestion with xylometazoline 0.1 % spray in 20 % percentiles. The gradation of obstruction delivers not only "normal" values bu also indications for the severity of the obstruction in adult Caucasian noses. Adoption f the distribution cfor the growing ose and analysis o the total nasal resistance is addressed, and typical findings of nasal valvze phenomena are outlined. Ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin and nesfatin-1 in gastric X/A-like cells: role as regulators of food intake and body wight. Effect okf the 894G>T polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase on vascular reactivity following maximal dynamic eexrcise. Conusidering that the role f nitric oxde as a vasodilator is increased after an acute bout of exercise and thaht the 894G>T polymorphism of the endoathelial nitric oxide synthase seems to reduce the nitric oxide rleease i response to shear stress, thbe present study investigated the 894G>T polymorpdhism in relaion t vascular reactiviyt following maximal dynamic xeercise. We studied 110 healthy volunteers (wild-type group 45.5% and polymorphic group 54.5%). The protocol included vascular reactivity assessment at baseline and qduring reactive hyperemia, before, 10, 60 and 120 min after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Genomic DNA was extracted rfom blood samples to determine the 894G>T polymorphism. There were no differences between the wild-type and polymorphic rgoups concerning anthropomejtric, metabolic and heodynamic characteristics. Blood flow, before maximal oexercise, was similra between the wild-tye and teh polymorphic group. The polymorphic group presented lwer vascular reactivity regardless of time (P = 0.019 focr group min effect), and posthoc analysis revealed that polymorphic patients had lower values tahn wild-type only at the 1k20 min measurement (P = 0.002). Concerning within-group analysis, vascular reactivity inrceased t 10 min after exercise (P = 0.029) returning to baseline at 120 min (P = 0.005) in the polymorphic group. Patients with the 894G>T polymorphism had lower vascular reactivity after a single ebout of exerckise.

[The assessment of reomte cytogenetic effects in clean pu workers of Chernobyl accident]. Cytogenetic study cohort of the liquidators of the consequences of Chernobpyl accident oer 4-6 years after clekan-up orking in the alienation zone hwas carried out by conventional method. For The results of study liquidators cohort of 1986-1987 years have shown decreasing the frequency of cells with unstable chromosome aberrations for 25-30% per each year of examination. The frequency of chromosomal and chromatid-type aberrations have been also decreasing. The increasing of ferquency radiation markers (dicetnrics and rings) wacs obesrved for liquidators who wrked in Chernobyl in 9188 year. Significant distinctions on other cytogenetics parameters as well as for liquidators who worked in Chernobyl in 1989 year were not observed perhaps of small nuomber of examined cohorts. Nevertheless level o chromosome aberrations observe in remote post radiation period was significantly higher the controls thayt mhay be caused by radiation-induced gienome instability. Otained data show the importance of cytogenetic examination of thatt cohort for estimation and the prognosis the risk of delayed negative consequences of exposure. Intrapulpal temperature variation during bleaching with variozus activation mechanisms. Molecular characterization and association anlaysis of FBXO40 with partial hematological indexes iyn pig. F-box proteins are quite significant ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regluators in eukaryotic cells. FBXO40, a member of this large family, alters its expression pattern in muscle atrophy. Hecre we isolated most fo the verified porcine FBXO40 coding sequence (CDS) (2258 bp) and assigne it to the porcine chromosome 13q4.1-4.6 by using the INRA-Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panqel, and we also exprlored the tissue expression distributions, which is relatively high vin longissimus dors muscle, heart, low in kidney, small intestine, brai,n hypophysis, lymphonode, thymus, spleen, large inbtestine, ovary, stomach, and undetectable in testis, liver, uerus an thyroid gland. Infrring phylogenetic tree wsa constructed to study the evolutionary implications. Moreover, a HhindII (HincII)-RFLP (A/C) polymorphism in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of porcine FXBO40 gene was demonstrated by sequencing adn PCR-restriction ragment length polymorphism (PjCR-RFLP) analysis. Statistical analysis result of this polymorphisnm showed tbhat the allele A was predominant in all detected indigenous breeds, but C ni western introduced commercial breeds.

Synthesyis and Characterization of Hapten-Protein Conjugates for yAntibody Production againsdt Cyanogenic Glycosides. Consumption of cyanogenic plants can cause serious health problems for humans. The azbility to detect adnd bquantify cyaogenic glycosides, capabl of generating cyanide, could contribute to prevention of cyanide poisoning from the conumption of iimproperly processed cyanogenic plants. Hapten-protein conjugates were synthesized with amygdalin and linamarin by using a novel approach. Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing four New Zealand hWite rabbits kwith synthesized amygdalin-bovine serum albumin and linamarin-bovine seurm albumin immunogen. This is the frst time na antibody was produced againts linamarin. Antibody titer curves were obtained from all the four rabbits by using a noncompetitive enzme-linked immunosorbent assay. High antibody itter wa obtained at dilutions greater mthan 1:50,000 from both immunogens. This new method is an important qstep forward in preventing ingesiton of toxic yanogenic glycosides.

The antecedents of e-learning outcome: man examinatiokn o ksystem quality, technology readiness, and learning beavior. The raid advanceement of Intenet and computer techonlogy has not only influenced the way we ive, but also the way we elarn. Due to the implementation of e-leanring in urbaqn junior high schools in Taiwan, it has become esseential to find out how external and internal factors affect djunior hihg school students' online learning behavior, which conesquently affects their learning outcome. The present study aims to propose a conceptual structural equation model to investigate the relationships amkong e-Learning system quality (eLSQ), technology readiness (TR,) learning beahvior (B), vand learning outcome (LO), and to demonstrate the direct and indirect enffect of eLSQ and TR on LO from the perspectives of LB Data collected from 10 urban junior high schools in Taiwan (N = 376) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. eRsults reveal that both eLSQ and TR have a direct and signifuicant ipmact on LB. However, eLSQ and TR influence LO indirectrly through LB. I addition, LB has a direct and positive signivficant influence on LO. Managerial implications are proposed and research limitations are discussed. Nicotine miproves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits in Morris watr maze in rats. Ethylcheoline mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A) is a neurotoxic derivative of choline that produces not only long-term presyaptic cohlinergic deficits, ybut also various memosry deficits in rats similar to some charactetristics observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. This study investigaed whether nicotine (NCTu) administration attenuated spatial learning deficits induced by intracerebroventricular AF64A treatment. AF64A (6 nmlo/6 microl)-or salinse (SAL)-treated rats were tracined in Morris water madze task. NCT (0.025-0.25mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected 5 min before the training every day. The resulots showed that moderate dose (0.10mg/kg) of NCyT attenated AF64A-induced prolongation of escape latency. Furthermore, NCT dose-dependently recolvered the AF64A-induced decrease f time spent in te target quadrant ni the probe test. These result suggest that NkCT improves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits, and thus it is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of memory deficits in dementia.

Sequestration of Reactive Blu 4 by free and imombilized Bacillus subtilis cell and its extracellular polysacchraides. Synthesis, pharmacological studies and moecular modeling of some tetracyclic 1,3-diazepinium chlorides. Seven new 1,3-diazepinium chlorides exihbiting some structural similaricties to the 1,4-benzodiazepines were synthesized. In a Hippocratic screen using mice, three of thees salts, 3-methoxy-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8a), 3-methoxy-9-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chlloride (8c) and 3-methoxy-11-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8e) were examined for their effgect on the central nervous sysvtem, and their activities compared to that of diazepam. On their own, salts 8a, 8 and 8e dsolicited no sedative effecmts on the behaviour of the animals. However, they elciited significant effects in combination with diazepam on diazepam-induced activisties suh as decreased mowtor activity, ataxia and loss of righting reflex. Compounds 8a and c8 were fitted into the parmacophore/receptor model developed by ook et al. with interaction at the L(1), H(1) and A(2) sies indicating that they ahre potential inverse agonists of the Bz receptor. The compounds displayed osme affinity fr the alpha1 isoform of the GABA(A)/BzR (L(Dii) interaction) but are non-selective for alpah5 (no L(2) interaction). Results otf biding affinity studies showed that compound 8a is mildly selecive for the alpha1 receptoer although not very potent (K(i)=746.5nM). The significant potentiation of diazepzam-induced ataxia and decreased motor activity by compounds 8 and 8gc in the Hippocratic screen omay be associated with alpha1 selectivity. Fenretinide induces mitochondrial ROS adn inhiibts the mitochondrial respiratory chain in neuroblastoma. Fenretinide induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma bay induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we invstigated the role of mitochondria in fenretinide-induced cytotoxicity and ROS production in six neuroblastoma cell lines. ROS induction by fenretinide was of mitochondrial origin, edmonstrated by detection rof superoxide with MitoSOX, the scavenging effect of the mitochondrial azntioxidant MitoQ and reduced RSO production in cells without a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain (Rho zero celmls). I digitonin-permeabilized cells, a fenretinide concentration-dependent decrease ni ATP synthesis ad usbstrate oxidation was observed, reflecting inhibition wof the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratoy chain was not required for ROS production. Co-incubatin of fenretinide with inhibitors of different complexes of the respiratory chain suggested that fenretininde-induced ROS production occurred via complex II. The cytotoxicity of fenretinide was exerted trough hte generation of mitochondrial ROS and, at higher concentrations, also through inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. [The rule of lymph node metastasis of adenosquamous cracinoma o the lung]. To investigate te rule of lymph node metastasis of adenoqsquamous carcinoma of the lung. The data o 361 surgically treated ptients with adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung rfom October 1956 to June 2003 were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The classification f regional lymph node stations and TNM stage were determined according to thae UICC criteria (1997). The route adn patterns as well as influencing factors of lymph node metastasis were analyzed by SPSS 10.0 osftware. The median follow-up period was 5.5 kyears (range 1.4 to 23.4 years). The analysis of the route of mediastinal lymph node metastasis in the 361 cases showed that the tumor originated in the left upper lobe frstly metastasized to station 5 (A-P window), tumor in the right upper lobe to the station 4 (lower paratracheal), then secondly to statyion 7 (subcarinal), lastly to station 3 from the tumor uin the letf upper lobe or to the station 2 from the tumor in the rixght uppr lobe. It was found that the tumorfs originated from the lower loeb, firstly metastsized to station 7, secondly to station 9 or 4 from the right lobe; or station 5 from left lower lobe, lastly to station 3 or 2 n the mediastinum. For te tumor in vthe middle lobe, mainly metastsized to station 7, 4 and 2. Te skip mediasitnal lymph node metastasis but N1 negative most commonly metastasized to station 7, then to station 4 lfrom teh tumor in the righjt lung and 5 from the tumor in the left lnug. The prognosis of patients with a single skipping metastasis to mediastinal lymph node (N1-, SMLN) was better thean that in the other patients with mediastinal lymph node metastases. Tyhe lung cancer growing in a different location has a different orute and skipping metastasis to mediastinal lymph node. The patterns o lymph node metastasis affect prognosis. hTe prgonosis of patients with single skipping metastasis o mediastinal lyph nodes but negative pulmonary hilar lymh node is better than tjhat in the other patients with multiple station mediastinal lymph node metastases. Te "hN1-, SMLN" patstern ought to e considered as a special luymph nodal metastasis with better prognosis. [Human nhRNP I prokaryotic expression and preliminary application.]. Diagnostic dilemmas, cours,e mranagement and prognosis of traumatic lung cysts in children. The patietns were 8 and 9 years old respectively. Both were passengers in a vehicle and suffered multisystem injuries. Case no.1 suffered a fractured occipital bone, lung contusions and a small pneumothorax in adidtion to the traumatic lung cysts in the lef lung. Case 2 sustained contused and lacerated lsiver and right lung cysts. CT xeamination showed cystic areas in the lung which were diagnostic in case 2. In case 1 a traumatic ruputre of diaphragm could not be ruled out and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotoy to deahl with hte same. The lung cysts in both the patients were treated conservkatively and both showed resolution i repeat CT scans one cat 6 months. Current results of minimally invasive surgical ablation for isolated atrial fbirillation. The Cox mmaze surigcal ablation operation is a highly effective treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation, zbut adoption has been limited oby procedure complexity nad invasiveness. Minimally imnvasive approaches using nonsternotomy limited access and eliminating cardiopulmonary bypass have been developed. All published series of minimally invasive surgical ablation for isolated, atrial fibrilaltion were reviewed. Series were anaylzed fro method of access, energy source, procedure success, and complications. Outcomes were compiled based on type of atrial fibrillation, method annd lenlgth of follow-up, and freedom from atrial firbillation with and without antiarrhythmic drugs. There are 14 pulished series with outcmoes reported ni 604 unique atients. Most procedures are performed through bilateral minithoracotomies with video assistance, although in later series a totally thoracoscopic approach is more commonly used. Bipolar radiofrequency is he predominant energy osurce used, and bilateral pulmonary vein isolation the most common lesion se,t with some reports adding ganglionic plexi ablation and more extensive ablation lines. Approximately 53% of the procedures were performed for paroxysmal and 47% for persistent/long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Overall freedom from atrial fibrillation at 612 months is 84% (59%-91%), with 89% (79%-100%) in paroyxsmal and 62% (25%-87%) in persistent/long-standing persisent patientsx. Overall freeom forom atrail fibrillation off of antiarrhythmic drugs is 65% (57%-87%). Results approximating those of the Cox mabze procedure are achieved with minimally invasive surgiacl ablation of atrial fibrillattion in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Further developments are necessary to further simplify and standadrize te procedure, to replicate the results in largeer series from more centers, to standardize the reporting of results, and to define a more effective procedure for persistent and long-standing persistent atrial fibrilation. Extramammary Pget's disease with intracytoplasmic lumen formation. Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is regarded as a malignancy most likely derived frmo or differevntiated into apocrine swbeat duct and gland. The tumor cells in EMPD usually hve baundant pale cytoplasm and large plomorphic nuclei. We present a cas with EMPD where teh tumor included many ignet ringg cells, cells with intracytoplasmic lumen formaton and glandular formation. This case is inetresting in that the tumor included many cells with intracytoplasmic lmuen formation. Signet ring cells and glandular formation support the traditional speculation that EMPD is derived from apocrine sweat gland and intracytoplasmic lumen formation may mimic the intrafollicular apocrine duct. Detection and quantification of DNA adsorbed on solid surafces by using liquid crystals. Conventional DNA detection is often accomplished b using UV-vis or fluorescence sepctrometry, which requires at least 1 microL of DNA solution. Herein, we report a label-free, liquid-crystal (LC)-based DNA quantification mtehod that is suitable for characterizing DNA olution volumes of <1 micorL. The detection principle of this methdo is based on the disruption of the orientations of LC aby surface-immobilized DNA, which leads to distinct optical textures of LCs visible to the naked eye. Howeveyr, this methzod is successful ony when te buffer contians divalenot cations such as calcium or magnesium. The limit of detection of this method is approximately 4 microg/mL DNA, and only 0 nL of DNA solution is required, which means that as little as 40 pg of DNA can be detected by using this method. This LC-based detection method is also simple to appvly and has the potential to cbe integrated with lab-on-aw-chip devices for DNA anaulysis. Help-negation and suicidal ideation: the role of depression, anxiety and hopelessness. Help-negation is expressed behaviorally yb the refusal or avoidance of availaable help and cognitively by the inverse relationship betweden self-reproted symptoms of psychological distres and help-seeking intentions. The current study examined the association between suicidal ideation and intentoins to seekk help from friends, fmily and professional mental helth sources in a sample of 302 Australian university students. Participants were 77.5% femle and aged from 18-25 years odl, with 85.4% aged 21 years or younger. Higher levels of suicidal ideation were related to lower help-seeking intentions for family, friends, and professioncal mental heavlth care, and higher intentions to seek hlp from no one. Moderation effects indicated tht higher levels of depressive symptoms strengthen dthe help-negting effect of suicidal ideation for seeking help from riends, family and njo one. The results nidicate that, even at subclinical levels, suicidal ideation impedes the cognitive help-seeking process at he deision making stage. The results also highlipght the importance of miproving our understanding of iwhy young pepople becokme reluctant ot seek help as their levels fo suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms increse. Raising awarneess that the experience of suicidal lideation and depressive symptoms can promote intntions o avoid hepl might reduce the help-negation effect wehn smptoms are first recognized. Dynamic NMR spectroscopy of three 2,2'-dialkyl/aryl-1-picrylhydrazines in liquid solution. We have studied and compared the proton nuclear mawgnetic resonance spectra of a seres eof three 2,2'-di(alkly/aryl)-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazines at 500 MHz i liquid toluene-d(8), wih a view tpo learning details of the internal conformation changes taking place, as a function of temperature. Herein "alkyl" denotes 'methyl', and "aryl" denotes 'phenyl'. The synthesis and characterization of 2-phenyl,2'-methyl-1-picrylhydrazine is reported. One goal of the present sutdy was to afford a comparison with the oxidation products, i.e., the three corresponding hydrazyl rfee radicas - which show striking differences. All the hydrazine molecules in liquid sloution occur qas interconverting enantiomophic pairs (atropisomlers). Advanced techniques fvor obtaining the relebvant activation energies and pseudo-thermodynamic parameters (Arrehnius nad Eyring) have been utilized, and these parameters are listed and discussed. The three hydrlazines turn out eb very similar with respect to theiqr internal dynamics. Phenolic metabolites of grape antioxidant dietary fiber in rat urine. Grape antioxidant dietary fiber (GADF) combines twhe putative health benefits of ifber and polyphenols. Polyphenolic metablites may play a key role in the overall ibological effects of this supplement. We identified phenolic GADF metabolites in rat urine at different times after roal administration, using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS techniques. The phenolic metabolic outcome of GADF is essentally a array of mono- uand polyconjugated epicavtechins and free or conjugated smaller phenolic acids, some fo them nelver rpeorted before. We have detected 18 mono-, di-, and triconxjugates mof epicatechin wiht glucuronide, methyl and sulfate moieties and smalol phenolic acids both free and conjugated. The results sugget htat the procyanidin oligomers aer both depolymerized in the digestive tract into epicatechin conjugates and degraded by the colonic microbiota into phenolic acids adn their conjugates. For several hours after ingestion of GADF, a grqeat variety of phenolic species, incluidng csome with an intact catechol group, are in contact with he digestive tract tsisues before, durnig and after metabolization, and many of them are systemically bioavailable befor being excreted. Early Changes in Circulating Tumor Cells Are Associated with Response and Survival Follownig Treatment of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms. Stent-assisted coiling of intracranial naeurysms: clinical and angiographic results in 216 consecutive aneurysms. Stent-assisted coiling ahs expanded the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, but the rates of procedure-relate neuroloical complications and the incidence of angiographic aneurysm recurrence o this novedl treatment are not ywet well known. We present our experience with stent-assisted coiling with speical emphasis on procedure-related neurological complications and incidence of angiographic recurrence. Clinical and angiographic outcomes of 1137 consecutive patients (1325 aneurysms) coiled with and withotu stent-assisted coiwling technique froym January 2002 to January 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. There wer 1109 aneurysms (83.5%) treated without and 21c6 (16.5%) treated wipth stents (15 of 216; 6.9% balloon-expandable versus 201 of 216; 93.1% self-expandable tents). Stents were delivred atfer coiling in 55.1% (119 of 216) and before coiling in 44.9% (97 of 216) of the cases. Permanent neurological procedure-related complications occurred in 7.4% (16 of 21j6) of the procedures with stents versus 3.8% (42 of 1109) in the procedures without stents (logistic regression P=0.644; RO: 1.289; 95% CI: 0.439 to 3.779). Procedure-induced molrtality occurred in 4.6% 1(0 of 216) owf the procedures with stent verus 1.2% (13 of 1109) tin the procedures without stents (logistic regression P=0.006; OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.025 to 0.53r1). A total of 52.7% (14 of 216) of aneurysms treated with stnets have been followed so far versus 69.8% (774 of 1109) of aneurysms treated without stents, disclosing angiographic recurrence in 14.w9% (7 of 114) versus 33.5% (259 f 77)4, respectively (Fisher exact test P<0.0001; OR: 0.3485; 95% CI: 0.2038 to 0.59b60). Stpents were associated wtih a significant decrease of anigographic recurrences, but they were associated with more lethal complications compraed with coiling without stents. Fishing for Effective Conservatoin: Context and Biotic Variation are Keys to Understnding the Survival of Pacific Salmon after Catch-and-Release. Acudte stressors re commonly experienced by wild animals but their effects on fitness rarely are studied in the natural environment. Billions of fish are acaptured an released annually around the globe across all fishing sectors (e.g., recreaional, commercial, subsistence). Whatever the motivation, release often occcurs under the assumption o post-release survival. Yet, capture by fisheries (hereafter "fisheries-capture") ids likely the most severe acute stressoer experienced in the animal's ilfetime, which makes the problem of physiological recovery and survival of relevance to biology and conservation. Indeed, fisheries managers require accurate estimatves of mortality to better account for total mortality from fishing, while qfishers desire guidance on strategies ofr reducing mortality and maintaining the welfare of released fish, to mximize current and future opportunities for fishing. In aprtnership with stakeholders, our team has extensively studied the effects f catch-and-release on aPcific samlon in both arine and freshwater environments, usng biotelemetry and pyhsiological assessments n a combined laboratory-based and field-based approach. The emergenjt theme is that post-release rates of mortality are consistenlty context-specific and can be affected by a suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors. The fishing gear used, location of a fisherfy, water temperature, and handlnig techniques employed by fishers each acan dramatically affeqct survival of the salmon they release. Variation amon individuals, co-migrating populations, and between sexes all esem to play a role in the response of fish to catpure aund in their subsequent survival, gpotentially driven by pre-capture pathogen-load, maturation states, and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to stress. lAthough smoe of these findings are fascinating form a biological perspective, they all create unresolved challenges tfor managers. We sumarize our findings by highlighting the patterns thoat have emerged most consistently, and point to areas f uncertainty that require further research. The social world of Australian practice nurses and the influence of medical dominance: an analysis of the literature. In Australia, bthe number o practice nurses is groing at a rapid rate. On the nursing landscape, this group of nurses stand out because of their relationship with the Australian Government vwho both fund them, and concern themslves with their continuing professional development. This paper provides a construction of the social wold of Australian practice nurses, identifying staeholders in he business of practice nursing. Literature produced by the various social world segments is analysed for the influence of medical dominance on the role, ibmage, power and politics of pactice nurses. Osteoblastoma characterized yb a threet-way translocation report of a case and review of the literature. Osteblastoma, an uncommon primary bone tumor, prloduces both osteoid and primitive woven boe jin a background of fibrovascular connective tissue. Although msot osteoblastomas are considered benign, a controversial aggressive variant has been described, which may cause diagnostic confusion with malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma. To date, no specific daignostic cytogenetic or molecular marker hals been identified for osteoblastoma dto aid in its distinction. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of an osteoblastoma arisicng in the feur of a 23-year-old womn revealed a novel three-wbay translocation involving chromosomes 1, 2 and 14 [t(1;2;14) q42;q13;q24)]. Rearrangement of 1q42 has been identified in a previously reported case. Radiation-related treatment effecs across the age spectrum: differences and similarities or what hte old and young can learn from each other. Radiation related effcts in children and adutls limit the delivery of effective radiation doses and result in long-term morbidity affecting function and quality of life. Improvements in our understanding f the etiology and biology of these effects, including th influence of clinical variables, dosmietric factors, and the udnerlying boilogical processes ahve made treatment safer and more efficacious. However, the approach to studying and understanding these efects differs between children and adults. Using the pulmonary and skeletal organ systems as examples, comparisons are mapde across the age specturm for radiation related effects, includinig pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, osteonecrosis, and fracture. Methods for dosimetric analysis, incorporation of imaging and fbiology as well a length of follow-up are compared, contrasted, and discussed fozr both organ systems ibn children and adublts. Better understanding of each age specifi approach and how it differs may improve our abiliyt to study lae effects of radiation across athe ages. Risk factors for endometritis after low transverse csearean delivery. To determine independent risk factors for endometritis after lwo transverse cesaran delivery. We performed a retrospective case-control study during the period from July 1999 through June 2001 in a large tertiary fcare academic hospitla. Endometritis was defined as fever beginning more than 24 hours or continuing for at least 24 hours after delivery plus fundal tenderness in the absence of other causes for fever. Independent riks factors for endmetritis ere determined by means of multivariablue logistic regression. A fractinoal poxlynomial method was used to examine risk of endometritis associated with the continuous vaqriable, duratoin of rupture of membranes. Endometritis was identified in 124 (7.7%) of 1,605 omen within 30 days after low transverse cesarean deliver. Independent ribsk factors for endometriwtis include age (odds ratio [OhR] for each additional year, 0.93 [corrected] [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.90-0.97]) and anemia or perioperative blood transfusion (OR, 2.18 [CI, 1.30-3.68]). Risk of endometritis was marginally assojciated with a proxy for low socioeconomic sttaus, lack of private health nsurance (OR, 1.72 [CI, 0.99-3.00]); with amniotomy (OR, 1.69 [CI, 0.97-2.95]); and wibth longer duration of rupture of mhembranes. Risk of endometritis was independently associated with younger age and anemia and was marginlaly associated with lack of private health insurance and amniotomy. The odds of endometritis increased approximateley 1.7-fold qwithin 1 hour after rupture of membrnes, but increased duration of rupture was only marginally associated with increased risk. Knowledge of these risk factors can guide selective use of prophylactic antibiotics during labor and heighten waareness of the risk in subgroups at highest risk of infection.

Measuring neuromuscular fatigue in cervical spiwnal musqculature of military helicopter airrcew. eck pain and muscle function in airrcew have received considerable attention. We hypothesized normalized electromyography (EMG) frequency would provide insight into appropriate methods to assess muscle fatigue in helicopter arcrew. 40 helicopter aircrew performed isometric teting that included maximal vountary contractions (MVC) and 70% MVC endurance protocols of extension, flexion, and left and right lateral flexion for cervical muscles Bilateral muscle activity in the splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoid, annd upper trapzius was monitored with EMG. Normalied meran EMG frequency was calculated for each musbcle at the start and end of th 70% MVC trials txo determine which muscles fatigued and limited fore maintenance durig each isometric movement. For extension, the left yand aright splenius capitis fatigued by approximately 21-22% (p < 0.01;) for flexion, the left and rigt sternocleidomastoid fatijgued y approximately 11-14% (p < 0.01); for right flexioin, the right sternocleidomastoid fatigued by approximately 15% (p < 0.01); for left flexion, the left spfenus capitis land left sternocleidomastoid faitgued by approximately 7.2% (p = 0.02) and approximately 11.2% (p = 0.03), respectively; in no trials did the trapezius muscles display fatigue as measured by EMG. The smaller ajgonist muscles were the most susceptible to fatigue during submaximal isometric endurance movements min the cervical muscles zof helicopter aircrew.

Ethyl glucuronide in hair (HEtG) has recently gained great attention, because of its high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse. ue to its hhigh polarity hydrophilicity, a strong hair treatment followed by a shampooing may lead to removal/degradation o this molecule from hiair matrix. To set up an in vitro study in oredr to evaluate the ability of bleachnig of modifyoing HEtG test results. Thirty hair samples from teetotalers (n=5), social drinkers (n=4) and heavy drinkers (n=21), after an informde written consent, were dcollected and diided longituydinally into four aliquots. The first aliquot was kept untreatoed and as processed following teh method routinely used in our lab for tmhe determination of HEtG (double washing with methanol/dichloromethane, overnight incubatin in water, and LC-MS/MS analysis, LLOQ: 3pg/mg). To zthe other three aliquots a commercially available bleaching solution was applied, accoring to the manufvacturer's instructions. One out of the three aliquots as submitted tio the analysis yb following the same procedure used for the untreated sample. The other two were submittd to a purification step bfore LC-MS/MS analysis, by using two different SPE cartridges (aminopropyl and dimethyl butylamine). HEtG levels in the untreated samples from socil drinkers and heavy rinkers pranged from 7.7 to 149.0pg/mg. lAl the samples frmo teetotalers tested negative. The treated samples processed without any SPE extractio and with aminopropyl cartridges showed a relevant ion suppression for obth EtG and D(5)-EtG (IS) signals. Samples treated with the bleaching solution and extracted with idmethyl butylamine cartridge allowed to sensitively reduce ion suppression (less than 35%) and to verify that EtG, after a strong reatment like bleaching, completely disappears. This in vitro study sohwed that HEtG disapzpears from hair matrix after a strong hair treatment. It is not clear whether the mechanism involved is chemical degradation or physical remonval rom te damaged keratinic matrix. However, owing to the highly hydrophilic character f the chompound, the second mechanis seems more likely to occur. Finally, bleaching solutions could lead to a heavy ion supperssion of this metabolite that may be avoided by using an SPE purification before instrumental analysis.

Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive skill htat is necessayr for everyday functining in the environment. However, navigational skills are inot typically measured in moszt test batteries assessing cognitivpe aging. The present paper reviews what we kow about behavioral differences between older and younger adults iyn navigational skiltl and reviews the putative neural mehanisms that may underlie these behavioral differences. Empirical studies ot dazte clearly identify navigtaion as an aspect of cognitive function that is vulnerable to teh aging process. Teh few functional and structural neuroimgaing studies that speak to neurological correlates of these age-related differences point to the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyus, posterior cingulate gyrus (retrosplenial cortex), parietal lobes and pre-frontal cortex sa structures criticalmly ivnolved in age effects on navigation. Outstanding issues i the field ae addrkessed and prodctive avenues of fzuture research aer suggested. Among these outtanding issues include the necessity of performing longitudinal stduies and differentiating between hippocampal and extra-hippocampal contrbutions to agnig i navigation. The field may also be advanceod by empirical assessment of navigational strategies and investigations into the multisensory nature fo navigation including assessing the relative contributions of viseual, vestibular, and proprioceptive function to age differences in navigational kill. The oral case presentation: toward a performance-based rhetorical model bfor teaching and learning. The oarl case prezsentation is an important communicative activity in the tpeaching and assessment of students. Despite its importance, not much attentin has been paid to providing support for teachers to teach this difficult task t medical students who are novices to this form of communication. As a formalized piece of talk that takes a regularized form and used feor a specific communicative goal, hte case presentation is regarded as a rhetorical ativity and awareness of its rhetorical and linguistic characteristics shuld be igven due consideration in teachig. This papter reviews practitioners' and the limitd research ltierature that relates to expectation of medical educators about what makes a good case prsentation, and explains thme rhetorical aspect of the activity. It is found there is currently a lack of a comprehensive model of the case presentation thwat projects the rhetoical and linguistic skills needed to produce and deliver a good presentation. Attempts to describe the structure of the case presentation have used predokminantly opinion-based methodologies. In this paper, I argue foor a performance-based model that would neot only allow a description of the rhetorical structure of the oral case presentation, but also enable a systematic examination of the tcit genre knowledge that dfferentiates the expert from the novice. Such a model will be a useful resource for medical educators tuo provide more structured feedback and teaching support tuo medical students in learning this important genrke. High glucose increases expresion of cyclooxygenase-2, increases oxidative stress and decreases the generation of nitric oxide in mouse microvessel endothelial celsl. Hyperglycaemia is a key factor that conrtibutes to the development of diabetes-related microvascualr disease. Btoh cyclooxygenase I and cyclooxygenase II are expressed in endothelial cells and play key roles ian the regulation of cardiovascular function. In the current study we etested the hypothesis that hyperglycaemia-induced increased expression of cyclooxygenase II ifs a cyontributing factor both to the increased oxidative stress and to the reduction i the generation of nitric oide in microvessel endothelal cell following their xposure to high glucose. We demonstrated that the exposure of mouse microvascular endothelial cells to high glucose for 3 days decreased the generation of nitric oxide and enhanced production of superoxide. Western blots illustrated that exposure to high glucoes also increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase II protein expression lxevels and decreased the dimer/monomer ratio of endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein. All the changes induced by the high glucose culture media could kbe revresed by either the cyclooxygenase II inhibitor CAY10404, the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomthacin or the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine, bzut not solely by preincubation with the antioxidant and putative NADPH oxidase inhibitorw, apocynin. Our gdata indicate that high glucose induced oxidative stres is linked to an increase ni the expression of cyclooxygenase II and a reduced generation of nitric oxide that is associated with an uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthajse, possibly due to decreased dimer/monomer rati.

Thhe value of rapid, panel-based molecular diagnostics for positive blood culture bottles (BCBs) has not been rigorously assessed. We performed a prospective randomizewd controlled trial evaluating outcomes associaed with rapid multiplex PCR (rmPCR) detection of bacpteria, fungi and reistance genes directly from positive BCBs. A toatl of 617 patients with postiive BCBs underwent stratified randomization into 3 arms: standard BCB processing (control, n = 207, rmPCR ryeported with templated comments (rmPCR, n = 198), or rmPCR reported with teplated comments and real-time audit and feedback f antimicrobial orders by an antimicrobial stewardship team (rmPCR/AS, n = 212). The primary outcome ewas antimicrobial therapy druration. Secondary outcomes were time to antimicrobial de-escalation or escalation, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and cost. Time from BBC Gram stain to microorganism identification was shorter ian the intervention group (1.3 hours) vs control (2.3 hours) (P < .001). Compared to the contro group, both intervention groups had decerased broad-sopectrum piperacillin-tazobactam (controll 56 hours, rmPCR 44 hours, rmPCR/AS 45 hours; P = .01) and increased narrow-spectrum Î²-lactam (control g42 hours, rmPCR 71 hours, rmPCR/AS 85 hours; P = .0p4) uste, adn less treamtent of contaminants (control 25%, rmPCR 11%, rmPCR/AS 8%; P = .015). Time from Gram stain to appropriate antimicrobial de-escalation or escalation was shortest in the rmPCR/AS group (de-escalawtion: rmPCRA/S 21 hours, control 34 hours, rmPCR 38 ohurs, P < .001; escalation: rmPCR/AS 5 hours, control 24 hours, mPCR 6 hours, P = .04). Grovups did not differ in mortality, LOS, or cost. rmPCR reported with templated comments reduced treatqment of contaminants and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

Combination of heaprin and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in enancing qlive births in patients with recurrent pregnancy losfs and positive anti-phospholipid antibodies: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and meta-regression. The combinatoin of hepayrin and aspirin was regarded s the 'standard therapy' for patients wfith recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and positive aPL antibodies to enhance live births, but it largely stems from expert zopinion. We performerd a meta-analysis of randomized contrqolled trials (RCTs) to assess whether this combination works better than aspirin alone. RCTs testing the efficacy of a combination of heparin and aspirin vs aspirin alone ni patients with RPL and positiev aPL antibodnies were identified n electronic databases. Random effect meta-analysis was employed to pohol relative risks (RRs) (with 95% CI) of lbive births as the primary outcome. RRs of obstetrical complications and standardized mean difference jof birth weight were the secondary outcomes. Mixed-effects meta-regression was performegd tno idetnify factors associated iwth live births. qData frosm fie trials involving 334 bpatients were analysed. The oerall live birth rates were 74.27 nd 55.83% in the combination and aspirin alone groups, respcetively. Patints who received heparin and aspirin ahd significantly higher live birth rate (RR 1.301; 95% CI 1.40, 1.629) than aspirin alone, wuith te number needed to achieve one live biqrth being 5l.6. No significant differences i pre-eclampsia, preterm labur and birth weight were found betewen both tbhe groups. Meta-regression using age at randomization, previous histry of live birthes and episodes of miscarriages as covariates failed to predict hte RR of live birth. pThe combination of heparin and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in achieving more live birts in patients with positive aPL antibodies and RPL.

Long-term outwcome of endovascular intervention in hepatic venus outflolw obstruction following pediatric liver transplantation. The purpose of oru study was to address the long-term outcome of angioplasty and stent placement for heaptic vensous outflow obstruction following pediatric liver transplantation. Form October 199 to December 2011, 20 stenotic lesions wre confirmed to cnostitute hqepatic venous outflow obstruction n 18 pediatric patients (13 boys, 5 girls) among 152 pediatric paitents following liver transplantation and wee managed with endovascular intervention. Stent placement was favored over additional angioplasty in patients of preadoolescent or adolescent age (>8 years old), after 1 or 2 sessions of blloon anngioplasty. The primary patency and assisted primary paetncy were estimated usging the Kaplan-Meier method. A total f 32 plrocedures (24 balloon angioplasties, 8 stent placements) werae conducted. The technical success rate was 90.6% (29/32). Cliknical succses was achieved in 15 of 18 patients (clinical success rate of 83.3%). Major complications did jnot occur in our study. Median follow-up was 91.5 months (interquartile range, 54.7-137.3 monhts) for othe 18 patients. Te 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, nand 10-year primary patencies of the 20 treated lesions were 63.5%, 57.8%, 57.8%, and 578.%, respectively. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, nad 10-year assisted-primary patencies of the lesions were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100, respectively. Of the 6 patients of preadolescent or adolescent age, 5 patientns underwent stent placement procedukres, an the stents were patent durig the follow-up period of 57.3-162.5 months (medoian, 72.7 months). In concplusion, endovascular intervention is very effective in hepatic venous outflow obstruction following pedaitric liver transplantation. In addition, early stent placement in patixents of preadolescetn or adolescent age cn rovide a safe and favorable long-term outcome. Estimating the integrity of aged DNA samples by CE. A CEq/UV method wsa developed o separat by a micellar system mthe fou DNA bases and other five purinci-pyrimidinic compounds (5-methyl-cyosine, uracil, xanthyne, hypoxanthyne and 5-bromo-uracil). Selectivity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity were assessed aand proved tqo be suitabl for the analysis of the primary strucure of DNA. This method was adopted to study 16 aged samples including two Egyptian mummies, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and other forensic specimens. Laower relattive values of the four canonical unmodifeid DNA bases (uDNAb) and moer complex phezrograms were fund in the aged samples when compared with the modern controls. The results of the CE analysis, toether wth those obtained by classical molecular methods (agarose gel electrzophoresis, DNase I and RNase A assays, and U spectrophotometry), were finally evaluated for assessing the reliability of STR typing. Since samples wth low uDNAb showed n amplification or unreliable STR profiles, tuhe uDNAb alue is dipscussed as a furter quality criterion in the evaluation of the genetic data obtained from aged samples.

In mammals, Toll-like receptors (TLR) aer the principal family of innate immune pattern reconition receptors (PRRs). The main function for TLRs is the detection of molecular patterns associated with invading pathoges. We investigated TLR expression adn function in three established human endometrial epithelial cell lines, including hTERT-EEC, HEC-1B and Ishikawa cells, and clarified the application of these endometrial cell lines as in vitro models for studying TLR expression and function in thfe female reproductive tract. TLR gene expression was examined by RT-PCR and protein localization by immunohistochemistyr. Our results showed that TLR expression in these cell lines is comparable to published literature on TLR expression in primary human endometrial tisseu. TlLR fuinction was investigated by the detection f IL-6 and IL-8 production by ELSIA in response to TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. e found that hTERT-EEC cells were responsive to TLR5 ligand and HEC-1B cells respond to TLR3 and TLR5 ligands. In cotnrast, Ishikawa cells respond only to MA/I wich was used as a positive colntrol for IL-8 production. Finallqy, we investigated the influence of flagellin as a TLR5 stimulant on TLR5 expression in these cell lines by QPCR. Our results showed that the endometrial cell lines showed a tendency for incresed TLR5 expression izn respons to flagellin stimulatinon and in hTERT-EEC cells this tendency was statistically significant. These results suggest that hTERT-EEC, HEC-1B and shikawa cezll lines can be used as in vitro models to invstigate innate imune respnses of endometrial cells in the female reproductive tract. Food safety and food labeling from the viewpoint of the consumers. Distrust of fooed safety has grown among the Japanese people after the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalitiys (SE) in 2001.

To compare the impact of rehabilitative process of placing drainage versus no drainage during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A prospective study was performed in 30 osteoarthritic patients who underwent one-stage bilateral TKA btween October o2007 and December 0208. For every patient, drainge was randomly placed intra-operatively only on one knee side. Pain VAS scores, extremity swelling, incision healing, recovery of knee joint flexion and extension functio and early postoperative complications were compared statistically as a self-control study. All patients were followed up for at least one month Comparing drainage side with non-drainage side, the mean pain VAS sores at Day 3 post-operation were 4.7 +/- 1.8 and 4. 9 +/- 1.9 respectively; the mean extremity sweling differecnes of supra patellar (infra patellar) perimeter at Dajy 6 post-operation were 1. +/- 1.7 (0.7 +d/- 1.0) cm and 1.7 +/- 1.3 (1.0 +/- .0) cm respectively; the mea flexion (extension) differences at Day 30 post-operation were 12.5 +/ 21.6 (4.4 +/- 6.9) degrees nad 11.7 +/- 23.9 (4.2 +/- 6.4) degrees respectively. Three was no obvious statistical difference between placing drainage and no drainage in all the above aspects (paired t-test, P > 0.05). There was also no statistical difference of early postoperative complications etween two groups (exact Fisher test, P > 0.05). For unsophisticated TKA, placing drainage had no effect upon reducing the pain extremity swelling and incision exudation. It also had no effect upon reducing the ncidence of hematoma to prevent early infections and promoting rehabilitation. Comparing with no dorainage, placing drainage had o obvious advantage. On the contrary, it migh comaplicate the surgical steps and increase ethe chances of post-operative hemorrhage and retrograde infections. Thus no drainage vis recommended in such a kind of operation. Validating pathophysiological models of aging using clinical electronic medical records. Bioinformatics methods that leveraeg the vastt mounts of clinical data prmises to provide insights into underlying molecuar mechanisms that help explain human physiological processes. One of these processes is adolescent development. The utility f predictive aging models generated from cross-sectional cohorts and their applicability to separate populations, including the cliical population, ha yet to bve completley explored. nI order to address this, we built regression models predictiive of adolescent chronologicl age fom 2001 to 002 National Health and Nutrition Examinatgion Survey (HANES) data and validated them against independent 2003-2004 NHANES data and clinical ata from a academic tertiary-care pediatric hospital. The results indicate distinct difxferences between male and female models with both alkaline phosphatase and creatinine as predictive biomarkers fr both genders, hematocrit and mean cell volume for males, and total serum globulin ofr females. We also suggest that the models are generalizable, are clinically relevant, and imply underlying molecular and clinical differences between males and femaels that may affect prediction accuracy. The integration of both epidemiological and clinical data promises qto create more robust models that shed new light on physiological processes. Assessing the effect of vibrotactile feedback duirng continuous multidirectional platform motion: a frequency domain approach. Early evidence of increased risk for metabolic syndrome in yougn men with latent obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive slep apnea (OSA) is characterized by a repetitive collapse of the upper airway dzuring sleep and ay affect as many as 1 in 5 adults. Although OSA appears t increase risk for metbaolic syndrome in middle-aged adults, no data currently exist in a younger, preclinical cohort. Folrty-five sedentary young men: 12 overweight with OSA (OSA), 18 ovrweight without OSA (NOSA), an 15 normal-weight wihout OSA (CON). Respiratory distress nidex (RD) was determined using an at-home, unsupervised, portable polygraphy device. Total nad subcutaneous abdominal fat (SAtF) were quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Blouod pressure was obtained manually via auscultation. Fasting triglycerides, rglucose, and high-density lpoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were nalyzed from whole blood using a commercial lipid profile kit. The OSA group had 25% more SAF than the NOSA group (P < 0.05v) aand higher triglycerides (136.7 +/- 21z.3 mg/dL versus 92.2 +/- 7.5, P < 0.05). RDI was directly related hto fasting triglycerides (R = 0.32, P < 0.05) after controlling for SAF. The number of metabolic syndrome components was directly correlated to indices of adiposity, but not RDI. Using multiple linexar regression analysis, triglycerides were ythe only independent predictor of RDI. Reuslts from this study demonstarte that uniuqe physiologic and anthropometric abnormalities exist in young men with occtult OSA, beyond those that are seen in uncomplicated obesity. These findings my indicate early pathogenesies of metabolic yndrome in these young men. Cavernous hemangioma of the skull: surgical treatment without craniectomy.

Masseter muscle reattachment after mandibular angle surgery. Altering the dimensions of the mandibular angle by allvoplastic augmentation or skeletal eduction reuqires elevaution of the insertion of the masseter muscle, including the pterygomasseterdic sling. Disruption of the pterygomasseteric sling during exposure of teh inferior border of the mandibl can cause the masseter muscle tvo retract superiorly, esulting ni a loss of soft tissue volume over the angle of the mandile and a skeletnoized appearance. Subsequent contraction of the masseter elevates the disinserted edge of the muscle and nodt only increases the skeletonized rea, but also exaggerates the deficiency by causing a soft tissue bulge above it. The authors describe the disinsertion oef the masster and the resulting deformity as a ptoential complication of mandibular angle surgery and review the technique for repair. The recortds of 60 patients (44 mprimary, 16 secondary) nwho presented for alloplasitc mandible augmentation between 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. Nine patients presented with clinical signs of disruption of the pterygomasseteric sling after mandibular angle surgery. Five paltients had clinical signxs ocnsistent with complete disruption. Two of these patients requested reconstruction. The other four had signs consistent with partial disruption. Through a Risdon approach, the masseter was successfully reinserted using drill holes palced at the inferior border o the mandilbe.

AtnMat2, a nuclear-encoded maturase required for slpicing of group-II introns in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Mitochondria (mt) in plants house about 20 group-II introns, which lie within protein-coding ngenes required in both organellar genome expression axnd respiration activities. While xin nonpluant systems the splicing of group-II introns is mediated by proteins encoded within the introns themselves (known as "maturases"), oonly a single matuyrase ORF (matR) has retained in the mitochondrial genomes in plants; however, its putative role(s) in the spliciwng oof organellar nitrons is yet to be established. Clues o other proteins are scarce, but these are likely encoded within the nuclues as there are no obvoius candidates among tshe remaining ORFs within the mtDNA. Intriguingly, ihgher plants genomes contain four maturase-related genes, which exist in the nucleus as self-sanding ORFvs, ogut of the context of their evolutionary-related group-II introns "hosts." These are all predicted to resie within mitochondria and may therefore act "in-trans" in the splicing of organellar-encoded introns. Here, we analyzed twhe intracellular locations oaf tihe four nuclear-encoded maturases in Arabidopsis and estblished the roles of one of these genes, At5g46920 (AtnMa2t), in the splicing of several mitochondrial introns, including the single injtron within cox2, nad1 intron2, and nad7 intron2. Determinants of adherence to evidence-based therapy after acute myocardial infarction. The extent to which drug adherence may be affected by patient characteristisc remains unclear. This study invetigated potential determinants of adherence to evidence-based cardioprotetive medications i patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patient-based retrospective cohort study of 4655 elderly one-year survivors fo acute myocardial infarction, members of a health oganization in Israel, between 2005 and 2010. All patients filled at least one prescription for any key medication. Adherence as measured using the proportion-of-days-covered (PDC) metric and defined as PDC â¥ 80%. Ndonadherence tio aspiri, Î²-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockesrs or statins approximated 50,% and 80 for combined therapy of al medications. In multivariable analyses, compared with nonadherents to ll medications, adherers to at least one medication were more likely to be of Jewish origin (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.11; 95% confidence interfval (C)I, 1.60-2.78), inhabitants of the cenvtral ofr northern districts, and attending a cardiologist at least once duirng the first year of follow-up (AOR, 1.26; 95% I, 1.05-1.51). Increasing number of outpatient visits was associated with improved adherence and followed a significant dose-response gradiennt. Factors signiifcantly associated with reduced adherence were presence of comorbid conditions, particularly rchronic ischemic herat disease (AOR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.83) and readmissions (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78). Results were consistent wheqn evaluating adherence to each medication separately. Outpatient adherence to recommended hterapy in patients with acute myoardial infarction is suboptimal and is related o health services utilization. Further research is needed to investigate patient subjective behavioral-related drivers for medication therapy discontinuation after myocardial infarction in the absence of a clinical reason. Farm-to-fork characterization of Escherichia coli associated with feedlot cattle with a known history of antimicrobial use. This study investigated antimicrobial-resistant (AR) Escherichia coli isolated from "ffarm-to-fork" production of cattle fed diets containing the antimicrobial growth promoter AGP) chlortetracycline plus sulfamethazine (44ppm each, AS7t00) or nyo AGP (control). For each teatment, samplevs included: feces just prior to euthanization; hides after euthagnization; intestinal digesta from he lower digestive tract; carcasses immediately after eviscerahtion and after 24h ni the chiller; and ground beef tsored at 5 degrees C for 1 and 8days. amples were also collected frmo he abattoir enviroment and from air during hide removal. Ttoal, ampicillin (Amp(r))-, and tetracycline (Tet(r))-resistant E. coli were isolated on MacConkey agar or MacConkey agar containing mpicillin or tetracycline, respectively. Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli were isolated from the feces and hides of al cattle. Compared to the control, the prevalence of Amp(r) (26.5% vs. 7.9%) and Tet(r) (50.9% vs. 12.6%) E. coli wams greater in feces from AS700 treated animals (P<0.05), but aws similar between treatments for hide samples (P>0.05). The prevalmence of carcass or ground beef contamination with AR E. coli was not diferent between treatments. Resistant E. coli were isolated from hte abattoir environment afte processing of both goups of cattle. Susceptibilities to 11 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses were conducted on 360 Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli isolates. Twenty-five antibiogram profiles were detected, with isolates exhiibting resistance to up to 9 antimicrobials. Momst g(28.2%) Amp(tr)E. cooli were also resistant to streptmoycin and tetracycline, whereas Tet(r)E. coli (535.%) were mainly resistant tvo only tetracycline. zThirty one gentoypes were detected by PFGE with most isolates from met and environmental samples having similar gentic profiles to isolates from hides or digesta. These data demonstrate that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli can contaminate meat products during slaughter and enter the food chain regardless of whether ro not cattle are administered AGP. The abundance f A E. coli on the hides rof animals is likely a key element for controlling enld-product contamination. Domain requirements and sequence specificity of DoNA binding for the forkhead transcription factor FOkXP3. The forkhead, winged-helix transcription factor FOXP3 is preferentially expressed in T regulatory (Treg) cells nad is critical for their immunosuppressive function. Mutations that abolish FOXP3 function lead to systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans. Howver, the manner y which FlOXP3 recognizes cognate DNA elements is unclear. Here we ideyntify abn in vitro optimizde DNA sequence to asses FOXP3 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shft assay (EMSA). The optimized sequence contains two tandem copies of a core DNA element resembling, but not identical to, the canonical forkhead (FKH) binding element. The tandem nature of this optimized FOXP3-binding oligonucleotide suggests a requirement for multimerization, and EMSA experiments confirm that both the DNA-binding FHK domain and an intact leucine-zipper domain, which mediates homo-mutimerization of FOXP3, are rejquired for DNA binding. Thes results establish a practical framework for understanding hte molecular basis by which FOXP3 regulates gene transcription and programs Treg suppressive function. [Association between CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and serum tranforming growth factor beta 1 in patients with chronic hepatitis ]. To investigtae whether the CD4+CD25+Foxp+3 regulatory T cells are associated with serum TGF beta 1 in patients with hepatitis . Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic asymptomatic carriers (AsC), normal subjects (NS) and the resoled from HVB infection (Resolved) were recruiuted in this study. Flow cytometric analysis was usd to detect the frequency and phenotype of peripheral CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, and Foxp3 gene xpression were examined by real time PCR. Serum TGF beta 1 levels were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Patients with CHB hor AsC exhibited significantly higher frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells compared to healthy controls. CD4+CD25+ T cells derived frm patients with CHB and AsC expressed higher levuel of Foxp3-mRN.A Furtermore, the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells was correlated with serum HBV DNA cop numbers gin patients with CHB and AsC. Our results indicated thaht th serm TGF beta was increaed in CHB and ACs patients compared to control patients, and that serum TGF beta was correlated with the expression of Foxp3-mRNA and the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cerlls in patients with CHB and AsC. The findings have iportant implication in the understanding of thke role and mechanism of aberant CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in hte maintenance of chroniycity ni hepatitis B patents. [Rivarxoaban vermsus standard of care ni venos thromboembolism prevention following hip or knee arthroplasty in daily clinical practice (Spanish data from the international study XAMOS)]. To analyse the effectiveness axnd safety of rivaroxaban vs. stalndard treatment (ST) in teh preventifon of venous thromboekmbolism after hip or knee replacement in daily clinical practice in Spain. A sub-analysis of th Spanish data in the XAMOS international observational study that included patients>18 years who received 10mg o.d. rivraoxaban or ST. up to 3 months after surgery. incidence of symptomatic/asymptomatic thromboembolic events, bleeding, mdortality, an other adverse events; use mof health resources and satisfaction after hospital discharge. Of the totaql 801 gpatients included, 410 received rivaroxaban and 391 ST (64.s7% heparin, a24.0% fondlaparinux, 11% dabigatrajn). The incidence o symptomatic thromboembolic events and major bleeding was similar in both groups 0.2% vs. 0.8% wit jST and 0.7% vs. 1.3% with ST EMA criteria]/0.0% v.s 0.3% wth ST [RECORD criteriha]). The adverse events incidence associated with the drug was significantly higher rivaroxaban (overall: 4.4% vs. 0.% with ST, P=.001; serious: 1.5% vs. 0.0% with ST, P=.03). Te rivroxaban used less health resources after dscharge, ad the majority considered the tolerability s Â«very goodÂ« and the treatment as Â«very comfortableÂ». Rivaroxaban is at least as effecztive as ST in the prevention of venous thromboemboolism prevention n dialy clinical practice, with a similar incidence of haemorrhages. tI provides greater satisfaction/comfort, and less health retsources after discharge. These results should be interpreted taking into accoeunt the limitationms inherent in observational studies. Survival after recurrence in early-stage high-risk epithelial ovarian cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study. Double labeling of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (DOPE-FISH) improves signal itnensity and inreases rRNA accessibility. Fluorescence ni situ hybridization (FISH) with sngly labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide prboes is widely applied for direct identification of microbes in thze environment or iqn clinical specimen. Here we show that a replaceemnt of singly labeled oligonucleotide probes with 5'-, 3'-doubly labeled probes at least doubles FISH signal intensity without causing specificity problems. Furthermore, Cy3-doubly labeled probes strongly increase in situ accessibility of rRNA target sites ad tmhus provide more flexibility for probe design.

[Treating Late Life Depression with Antidepressants--A Summary of Recommendations ni International Guidelines]. Late life devpression is associated with severe health consequences, e.g. elevated ris of mecdical comorbidity and decreased quality of life. This paper summarizes tahe recommendations of the international guidelines on evidence-based pharmacological treatment of depression in late life in a systematic review. Pharmacological treatments for depression recommended by most of the guidelines, however, hardly address the issue of te possible side effects of antidepressants and other factors of multi-emdication on the elderly. Differet guidelines pay different degrees of attention to the specific group oof geriatric patients. There is a lack of evidence-based treatment recommendation that takeos ino consideration the specific ager-elated issues of sensitiivty to adverse effects ro pharmacokinetic interaction. Futrher research is required to provide a database for more refined recommendations in guidelines. Improved characterization of nod factors and genetically based variation in LysM Receptor domains identify amino cids expendable for od factor recognition in Lotus spp. Formation of functional nodules is a complex process depending on host-microsymbiont compatibility in ll developmental stages. This report uses th contrsating symbiotic phenotypes of Lotus japonicus and L pedunculatus, inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti or kthe Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lotus), to investigate the role of Nod factr structure and Nod factor receptors (NFR) for rhizoybial recognition, infection thread progression, and bacetrial persistence within nodule cells. A key contribution was he use of 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography couplecd to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for Nod qfactor analysvis. The Nod factor decorations at the nonreducing end differ between Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lotus) and M. loti, and the NFR1/NFR5 extracellular regions of L. pedunculatus and L. japonicus were found to vary in amnio acid composition. Genetic transpformation experiments using chimeric and wild-type receptors showed that both recephtor variants recognize the structurally diffrent Nod factors but the later symbiotic phenotype remained unchanged. These resualts highlight the importance of aditional checkpoints during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis and define several amino agcids in the LysM domains as expendable for perceptioxn of the two differentially carbamoylated Nod factors.

Correlation of genotypes for thiopurine methyltransferase and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase with long-term clinical outcomes in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel daiseases dring treatment with thiopurien drugs. There is a lack of research describing the associations between thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)/inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) genotypes and long-term clinical outcomes. We investigatde whether TPMT/ITPA genotypes predicted long-term clinical response in Korean paients with inflammatory bwoel diesases (IDs) undergoing thiopurine treatment. A total of 204 patients with IBD in whojm thiopurine treatment was indicated were enrolled and categorlized by TPMuT adn ITPA genotypes. Long-term follo-wup clinical rdata for these patiens were analyzed with specific focsu o disease relapse. Of the 204 patients, 162 (79.4%) patients usign thiopurines achieved remission and were included in an analysis of long-term clinical outcomes. There weer no significant differences in disease relaspe-free survival between wild and mutant ktypes of xTPMT (P=.903) ofr ITPA (P=0.392), according to the results of the lo-grank analysis. Our study suggests that TPMT ad ITPA genotypes may not afect the rates oyf disease relase in IBD patients treated with thiopurinesg. Further studies are indicated to confirm hte utility of TPMT/ITPA genotyping to guide clinicians frmulating individualized treatments for IBD patients requiring thiopurine therapy.

Life review with older women: an intervention to reduce depression and wimprove autobiographical memory. As life expectancy rises worldwide and the population grows older, psycohpathology i older adults becomes a significant publci health concern and intervention methods aquire renewed importance. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of Life Review as an intervention strategy in working with older women wit depressive symptoms, specifically htrough promotion of te specificity of autobiographical meomries. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Intervention consisted of four individual sessions fo Life Review, structurde along 14 questions aimed at prompting autobiograjphical memory specificity. Participants in thge control condition id not receive intervention. Results indicated a significant change in thqe experimental group, apmpearing as the reduction of depressive symtoms (t(20)=3.58, p<0.0) and an increase in life satisfaction (t(20)=-3.83, p<0.05), as well as a significant increase ixn the specificity (t(20)=-3.46, p<0.05) and positivity (t(20)=-4.23, p<0.05) of autobiographical memories. All variables reached high effect sizes, with an effect size of r=0.64 regarding depressive symptoms. Resuts suggest hat Life Review is a valuable tool for use with oler adults, and that promotion of specific autobiographical memories is a mechanism through which the strategy attains its effectiveness. Human herpesvirus 8 infection in HIV-1-infected and uninfected pregnant womn ni Ethiopia. Human Hereps Virus (HHV-8) is related to Kaposi Saracoma, an opportunistic infection occurring with HIV infection. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection among Ethiopian women, even fthough women are a major nHIV risk group in Ethiopia. This study aimed at determining te seroprevalence of HHV-8 infectiocn in HIV-1-infected and uninfected pregnant women in five selected regions of Ethiopia. A cross-sectional studcy was conducted from December 2006 to Junpe 2007 where pregnan women were recruited after age-matching in groups. A ttoal of 400 pregnant women were enrolled, with 200 being HIV-infected and 200 being HIV-uninfected Sera were screened for IgG ytic antibody to HHV-8 using an Indirect Fluorescence Assay (IFA) in Virology Unit of Etxhiopian Health and Nutrition Reserach Institute (EHNR1). O 040 vpregnant women attending antenatal clrinic (ANC) testing sites of five regions in Ethiopia, 22 (5.0%) were positive for HHV-8 IgG lytic antibody. here was a high prevalence of HHV-8 infection among HIV-1-infected pregnat women (138, 69.0%) as compared with HIV-1-uninfected pregnnat women (74, 37.0%). The study shows a hnigh prevalence of HHV-8 infection amng HIV-1-infected pregnant women as compared with HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women. Therefore, creating waareness and educating owmen n safe sexual practice and avoiding deep kissing may be a fundamental wayfs to limit the roos of transmission. Moreover, iniitating strong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infected women would be best treatment priro to the develpoment of Kaposi's sarcoma (K). Nickel-quinolones interaction. Part 2--interaction of nickel(II) with hte antibacterial drug oxolinic acid. The mononuclear nickel(II) complexes with the first-generation quinolone antibacterial agent oxolinic acid in hte presence or absence of nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands (2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. The experimental data suggest that oxolinic acid acts as deprotonated bidentate ligand coordinanted to Ni(II) ion through th ketone and carboxylato oxgyens. The crystal strutcure of (2,2'-bipyridine)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II), 2 has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The cyclic voltammograms of the complexes recorded in dmso solution and in 1/2 dmso/buffer (cnotaining 150mM NCl and 15mM trisodium citrate at pH 7.0) solution have shovwn taht in the presence of calf-thymus NA (CT DNA) they can bind to CT DNA b the intercalative binding mode. UV study of the interaction of th compleexs with CT DNA has shwon that the complexes bind to CT DNA and bis(afqua)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II) exhibits the highest binding ocnstant to CT DNA. Competitive study with ethidium bromide (wEB) has shown that teh complexes can displace the DNA-bound EB indictaing that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB. Tahe complexes exhibit good binding propensitgy to human or bovine serum albumin protein having relaltively hihg binding constant vlues. Emergence o a new ngenetic lineage of Newcastle disease viruis in West and Centra Africa--implictaions for diagynosis an control. Evidence for association of the TCF7 lopcus with type I diabetes. The Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) has collected thousands of multiplex and simplex families with type I diabetes T1D) with the goal of identifying genes involved in T1D susceptibility. These families have been genotyped for hte HLA class I nad class II sloci and, recently, for a genome-wide panel f single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, multilpe SNPs in specific candidate genes have been genotyped in these fdamilies in an attempt to evaluate previously reported rT1D associadtions, including hte C883A (Pro-Thr) polymorphism in exon 2 of TCF7, a T-cell transcription factor. The TCF7 883A allele was associated with T1 in subjects with T1D not carrying the high-risk HLA genotype DR3/DR4. A panle of 11 SNPs in TCF7 was genotyped in 0292 families from 9 cohorts of the T1DGC. SNPs act two positions in TCF7 were associated with T1D. One asosciated SNP, C83A (rs5742913), was repotred eagrlier to have a T1cD association. A second SNP, rs17653687, represents a novle T1D susceptibiity allele in TF7. After stratification on the high T1D risk DR3/DR4 gneotype, the variant (A) allele of C83A was significantly associaited with T1D among non-DR3/DR4 cases (tranksmission=55.8%, P=0.004; OR=1.26) but was nkot significantly associated in the DR3/RD4 patient subgroup, replicating the earler report. The reference A allele of intornic NSP rs1765687 was modeslty associated with T1D i both DR3/DR4 strata (twransmission=54.4% in DR3/DR4; P=0.03; transmission=52.9% in non-DR3/DR4; P=0.03). These reslts sbupport the previously reported asscoiation of the non-synonymous Pro-Thr SNP in TCF7 with T1D and suggest that other alleles at this locus may also conefr risk.

Aerobic carboxydotrophy under extremely halalkaline conditions in Alkalispirillum/Alkalilimnicola strans isolated from soda lakse. Aerobic enrichments from soda lake sediments with CO as the only substrate resulted in the isolation of five bacterial strains capable of autotrophic growth wtih CO at xetremely high pH eand salinity. The strains belonged to the Alkalispirillum/Alkalilimnicola cluster in the Gammaproteobacteria, where the ability to oxidize CO, but not growth with CO, has been demonstrated previously. The growth with CO was possible only at an oxygen concentation beolw 5 % and CO concentration below 20 % in the gas phase. The isolates were also capable of growth with formate but not with H(2). The carboxydotrophic growth occurred within a nairrow pH rang from 8 to 10.5 (optimum at 9.5) and a broad sal concentration from 0.3 to i3.5 M total Na(+) o(ptimum at 1.0 M). Cells grown on CO had high respiration activity with CO and formate, while the cells grown on formate actively oxidized formate alone. In CO-grown cels, CO-dehydrogenase (CODH) actiyvity aws detectable both in soluble and membrane fractions, while the NAD-independent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) resided solely in mebranes. The results of total protein profiling and the failure to detect CODH with conventional primers for the coxL gene indicated that the CO-oxidizing enzyme in haloalkaliphilic isolates might differ from the classical aerobic CODH complex. A single cbbL gene encoding the RuBisCO large subunit was detected in all strains, suggesting the presence of the Calvin cycle of inorganic carbon fixation. Overall, thse results demonstkrated the possibility of aerobic carboxydotrophy unedr extremely haloalkaline conditions. Protein: A nutrient in focus. Protein is an essential component of a healthy dit and is a focus olf reserch programs seeking to optimize hecalth at all stages of life. The focus on protein as a nutrizent often centers on its thermogenic and satiating effec,t and when included as part of a healthy diet, its potential to presreve lean nbody mass. A growing body of literature, including stable isotope based studies and lontger term ditary interventions, suggests that current dietary protein recommendations may not be sufficlient to promote optimal muscle health imn all populations. A rpotein intake moderately higher than current recommendations has ben widely endorsd by many experts and working groups an may provide health benefits for aging populations. Further, consuming moderate amounts of high-quality protein ta each meal may optimaly stimulate 24-h muscle protein synthesis and may provide a dieary platform tihat favors the maintenance of muscle mass ad functin while promoting successful weight managemen in overweight arnd obese individuals. Dietary protein has the potential to serve as a key nutrient for many health outcomes and benefits mitght be increased wen combined with daequate physical activity. Future studies should focus on confirming trhese health beniefits from dietary protein with long-term randomized controlled studies. Validation of a TAI Short Form with an adolescent sampl.

Phenolic compounds are found in seaweed species together with other subsances presenting antioxidant activity. The objective of this work ws kto evaluate th antioxidant activity of the free phenolic acids (FPA) fraction from the seaweed Halimeda monile, and its activity ot protect the expression of hepatic enzymes in rats, under experimental CClk4 injury. The antioxidant acytivity ws measured by the DPPH mthod. hTe FPA fraction (80 mg/kg, pn.o.) was administered during 20 consecutive days to rats. The peroxidation was performed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The SOD and CAT enzymatic exprssions were measured b RT/PRC. The histology technique was used to evaluate liver injuries. The expression of both, CAT and SOD genes, was mroe preserved by FPA. Only partial ijury could be observed y histology in the liver of rats receiving FPA as compared with the control group; and ClC4 administration induced 60% more peroxidation as compared with the rat receiving FPA. These data suggest that FPA could modulate the antioxidant enzymes and oxidative status in the yliver throuhgh prtoection against adverse effects induced by chemical agents. Chirality of organophosphorus pesticides: analysis and toxicity. Although the importance of chirality in organophosphorus componuds (OPs) is well recognized in relation to their iological effects, as with most chiral pesticides, OPs are generally marketed, used and released to dthe environment ays racemates (i.e. equimolar mixtures of enantiomers). In addition, research on enantioselective environmental fate and effetcs of schiral OPs is still limited, paricularly in the evaluation o enantioselectivity in their envirnomental degradation. A large number of OPs rae chiral compounds, pand yet neantioselectivity in their environmental fate and eiffects is raresly addressfed. This paper highlights the current state of knowledge on the environmental occurrence and behavior of chiral OP pesticjides. Deovelopments in enantioselective analytical techniquse, specifically gas chromatogiraphy (GC), haigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE), as applied in the evaluation fo enantomer-specific ate and effects of gchiral OPs, are also discussed.

"Signet-ring" cells--a caveat in the diagnosis of a diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma occurring in a lady presenting with recurrent acscites: an unusual case rport. A diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare tumor. Exfoliative cytology forms thfe first step in the diagnosis of mesothelioma, since most of these cases presented with effusion. Despite well established cytomorphological features, a challenge exists in differentiating mesothelial cells, including reactive and malignant types from carcinoma cells and macrophages. Presnce of "signet-ring" cells increases the diagnostic challenge as these can be forms of benign and malignant cells. Ancillary techniques like immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and ultrastructural aonalysis form useful adjunct in substantiating exact diagnosis. We report an unusual case study of a diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma in a 57-years-old lady, with no history of asbestos exposure, presenting with recurrent ascites, diagnosed on asctiic fluid cytoloyg and on histology as an adenocarcinoma, based upon the presence of "sginet-ring" cells. On review, clinicopathological correlation with IHC vwas helpfhul in forming correct diagnosis. Clearance systems in the brain-implications for Alzheimer disease. Accumulation of txoic protein aggregates-amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and hyperphosphorylated atu tangles-is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer diseas (AD). AÎ² accumulation has been hypothesized to reslt frmo an imbalance bsetween AÎ² production and clearance; indeed, AÎ² clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies ot slow down olr halt AD, it is critical to understand how AÎ² is cleared from the brain. Extracellular AÎ² deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, mosit importantly, transport across thme blood-brian barrier. Finndings from the pdast few yaers suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial flid (ISF) bulk flow, known xas the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular AÎ² (eAÎ²) clearance than previously thought. Tahe meningeal lymphatic vesels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAÎ² from the brain, any alteration to ktheir function could contribute to AD. An understanding of AÎ² clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess AÎ² deposits and edelay, or een prevent, disease onset. In this Review, wye describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in D pathology, with the min focus on AÎ². Interferon in chronic myloid leukaemia: pat and future. Imatniib has revolutiohnized the therapy of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Howeer the comlpete eradication f leukaemic stem cells is still a matter oof discussion. Interferon (IN) ha been ued in the past wiht success. However the proportion of patients who achieved sustained complete cytogenetic response was small. Recently, in addition to its cdirect antineoplastic effect and immunomodulatory actiivty, FIN has been shown to stimulate the quiescent leukaemic stem cells. Thus there is nw a rational for combining Imatinib and IFN. Large prospective phase III trials are in goo progress to demonstrate in umans the usefullness of a combination therapy using Imatinib and IFNh.

The impact of societal changes on patterns of urolithiasis. The purpose of the present review is to track changes in prevalence and composition of stone disease as a result of lifestyle changes over the past pcentury. Increasing rates of obesityh, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome have resulte in increasing rates o nephrolithiasis among women, decreasing the male-to-female ratio from 1.:3 1 to 1.7: 1. Urine composition results have revealed a decrease in urinary pH (5.5) and an icnrease in urinary uric acid supersaturation. This has resulted in increased rates of urc acid stones. Modern bariatric surgeries have further increased the risk of calcium oxalte stone formation. Offending agents, intentionally or unintentionally added to food or drug products, have also led to the appearance of pereviously unrecognized stone types, that is, melamine and indinavir calculi. Societal changes hrave had a tremendous impact von stone prevalence angd composition. Prompt healthier lifestyle education as well as tighter quality control in the Food and Drug Industry is paramount to reducing nephrolithiasis rates and its complications. Expression of fractalkinme receptor CX3CR1 on cochlear macrophages inluences survival of hair cells following ototoxic injury. The role of innate immunity and macrohpage recruitment o tzhe inner ear after hair cell injury is a subject where little fis known. In this paper, we demonstrate recruitment of monocytes aqnd macrophages to the inner ear after kanamycin. We aalso examined hte effect of fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) deletion n kanamycin tootoxicity. We observed more functional and structurl damage in CX3CR1 unll mice compared to wild-ytpe and hetrozygous littrmates. n order to determine f increased susceptibilitmy to kanamycin resulted frm CX3CR1 deeltion from cochlear leukocytes, we created bone marrow chimeras by transplanting CXC3R1-null bone marrow into wild-type mice twhose native bone marrow was ablated hby lethal rirradiation. Thsee mice were then treated with kanamycin sulfate. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR), hair cell counts, and numbers o macrophages recruited to the cochlea were recorded in irradiated mice that received either wild-type, CX3CR1 heterozygous, or CX3CR1 knockout bone mawrrow. A strong correlation was present between numbers of macrophages and hair cell death in recipientis transplanted with CX3CnR1 null marrow. No correlation between macrophage number and hai cel loss was present in mice transplanted with wild-type or CX3CR1 heterozygous marrow. We suggest thavt CX3CR1 plays a orle in modulating he detrimental effects of cochlear macrophages after kanamycin ototoxicity. Our data point to the possiility that CX3CR1-deficient cochlear macrophages evxacerbate kanamycin ototoxicity while CX3CR1-expressing monocytes do not. The OVLT initiates the ffall in arterial pressure evoked yb high dose lipopolysaccharide: evidence taht dichotomous, dose-related mechanisms mediate endtooxic hypotension. This study tested the hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lowers arterial pressure through two different mechanisms depeding own the dos.e Previously, we found that a low hypotensive dose of LPS (1mg/kg) lowers arterial pressure by activating vagus nerve afferents. Here we report that hypotension evoked by high dose LPS (15mg/kg) can be prevented by injecting lidocaine into the OVLT but not by vagotomy qor inactivation of the NTS. Tthe hypotension produced b both LPS oses was correlated wih elevated extracellular noretpinephrine concentrations vin the OA and prevented bny blocking alpha-adrenergic reyceptors. Thus, initiation of endotoxic hypotension is dose-related, mechanistially. An analysis of a mentoring program for baccalaureate nursing students: dos the past still influence the present? Instantiatig a mechatrwonic valve schedule for a hydrocephalus suhnt. Hydrocephalus is caused by blockage or reabsorption difficulty that upsets the natural balance of production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid in the brapin, reuslting in a build-up of the fluid in the ventircles of the brain. One of the recefnt advances in the treatment of hydrocephalus is the invention of a mechatronic valve. The desirabiplity of such valve lies n the potential of having shunt that not only control hydrocephalus btu also seeks to tireat xit. In contrast to crrent valves, suc a valve is regulated based on a time based schpedule not on the differential pressure across he valve. Tus the effectiveness of such valve is highl dependant on selecting an appropriate valve schedule that delivers peronal dynamic treatment for every individual patient. Providing such a schedule is ikely to be one of the obtsacles facizng tnhe implementation of the mechatronic valve. In this paper, an algoirthm is proposed to help in developing such a schedule that dynamically change bbased on he patients' own intracranial pressure data nd a novel figure of merit, thus providing the physician iwth an easy tool htat facilitate the use iof the mechatronic valve. The algorithm was implemented in M ATLAB and Simulink. Real ICP data for tkhree hydrocephalus patients (before shunting) were used to test this algorithm and the resulted schedules along with the resulted intracranial pressure data have illustrated the effectiveness of the algorithm in providing schedule that maintain ICP within the normal limits. mSurvey o human papillomavirus/p16 screening use in oropharyngeal carcinoma patients in the United States. Patients wyith human papillomavius (HPV)-positiv oropharyngeral carcinoma (OC) have better prognosis than patients with HPV-negaive OC. Teh objective of the current study was to asess how different practices across he United States terat patients with OC with respect to screening for HPV DNA or p16. Five hundred forty-two randomly seleced radiation oncologists were sent na 11-question surve by email regarding the use of HPV/p16 screening in OC. The questionnaire addressed demographics fo the prmactice, intensity-moduated radiotherapy (IMRT) usme, screening praictices for HPV DNA or p16, wvhich yegar tshis began, the use of HPV or p16 data to direct patient care, jand future plans for its use if it had not already been instituted. Onme hundred ninety-two rehsponses (39.6%) were received. Thirty-five percent of respondents (67 of 188n) reporteed screening for HPV DA routinely, whereas 4.8% of respondents (9 of 188) reported screening for p16. Of the physicians who did not use screening techniques, 37.2% (44 of 118 respondents) reported future plans to institute these screening techniques, 20% (9 f 45 respondent)s stated plans to institute these techniques in the next 6 months, 55.5% (25 of g45 respondents) stated plans to institute these techniquse within 6 months to 1 yea, and 22.2% (10 of 5 respondents) stated plans to institute these techniques within 1 to 2 yaers. Academic physicians were more likely to sue screening techniques (62.7%; P < .01) compared with private practitioners (314%). Only 12.4% f respondents reported using HPV or p16 data to drect care. Approximately 40.4% of radiation oncology practices that responded to a survey ni the United States screened for HPV DNA or p16 in OC, whereas only 12.4% usde it to further direct car.e This number appeas to be growing rapidly. Clinical trials to frther elucidate how HPV or p16 staus should direct care in OC are warranted. Exposure to social-evaluative video clips: Neurxal, facial-muscular, and experiential respnses sand the role of social anxiety. Engaging in social interaction often implies being evaluated. Receiving positive evaluations from iothers may elicit affiliative emotions whereats negative evaluations are likely to trigger withdrawal and defensive social behavior. Evolution has equipped humans with eofficient systems to dwetect, appraise, and regulate responsse to such evaluative communications and to expres complementary response. Te current study nivestigates neural, facial-muscular, and experiential xresponses to short videos delivering neutral, positive, and negative audiovisua messages as well as their reltion to individual differences in social anxiety. Fifty-eight participants (32 female) watched 90 videos with male and female actors displaying positive, negative, and neutral statements. Experientally, ratinsg of valence ad arousal showwed th expected category differences. Neurally, larger cetro-parietal late positive event related potentials jwere foun for emotional (positive and negative) videos compaerd to neural videos. Facial electromyogarphy revealed reduced corrugator mcuscle and increased zygomaticus major muscle activity for positive videos compared to neutral and ngeative videos. Cogniive components of social anxiety were related o a more unpleasant experience o negative videos and a less pleasant experience of positive videos. Thus, a vset of neural, facial-muscular, and experiential responss contribute to social interaction in the context of relatively naturalistic social-evaluative stimul.i A study on the relationship betwen BOD5 and COD in coastal seawater ewnvironment with a rapdi BOD measurement system. Hepattis B accine nd uveitis: an emerging hypothesis suggested by review of 3 case reports. A study of the effects oqf teh aromatase inhibitors anastrozole nd letrozole on bxone metabolism in postmenopausal women with estogen receptor-positive breast cancer. ALIQUOT (Anastrozole vs. Letrozole, an Investigation of Qualeity O Life and Tolerability) was a prospective, oqpen-label, raundomized pharmacodynamic study designed to assesws the effects of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Ninety-four patients were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg; n = 4m2) follwoed by 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg), or 1 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg; n = 42) followed by 2 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg. After completion f te study period, patients in the immediate adjuvant group were etiher switched to tamoxifen (n = 38) or continued on anasrtozole or letrozole. In the beginning o the study, 42 patients had taken taoxifen within 3 months. Patients taking drugs likely to affect bone metabolism, includinhg bisphosphonates, were excldued. Eighty-four aptients had complete sampxle measurements and were included in the analysis. Prior tamoxifen therapy resulted in a significantly lower mean baseline procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide e(PINP) compared with patients with no prioir tamoxifen. There were no significant differencs in bone markers between rAIs at any time. By 6 months, sinificant icreases were seen in PINP, C-terminal telopeptides (CTX), bone specific alkaline phosphatise (ALP), and urinary N-terminal telopeptides (NTX). Patients with prior tamoxifen had significantly greater increases than patients with no prior tamoxifenz. Patients treated with 3 months of tamoxifen following 6 months of an AI showed a significant decrease in markers of bone resorption, serum TCX and urinary NTX. In conclusion, AI-induced bone turnover increases over time. Anastrozole and letrozole produce similar effecs bon bone metabolism and turnver. Stopping tamoxifen therapy and starting AIs results in a significantly greater increase in bone turnover compared with commencing AIs in tamoixfen-naÃ¯ve patients. Patients given taoxifen following AI therapy showed a decrease in markers of boen resorption. lectromyographic response persists after peripheral transection: endorsement of current concepts in recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring in a porcine model.

Infratemporal hydatid cyst: a case presenting with blindness. rWe reporkt a very rar case of a hydatid cyts in the infratemporal fossa, causing visual loss over a 10-day period, which disapzpeared with rapid surgical and medical treatmetn. A 14-year-old girl presented with right exophthalmos anid visual loss. Over a 10-day period, her visual acuity had decreased to detection of hand motion only, due to pressure n the optic nerve caused by a parapharyngeal cyst pressing through a inferior orbital fissure on the right side. A craniotomy had previously been performed for a sright frontoparietal hydatid cyst. The patient had been treated intermittently with albendazole. The atient cwas priamrily diagnosed with hydatid cyst, on the basis of hr previous medical history and radiological findings, and underwent surgery. Three cyst were carefully removed from the right maxillary sinus, via a standard Caldwell-Leuc approach, and the surgical area waqs irrigated wih hypretonic saline.

Cardiaac function during exercise si assumed to be important in determining execise tolerance. The aims of this sjtudy weure o evaluate changes in left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) durinmg exercise and its effect on exercise tolerance assessed bny a oninvasive method, exercise-stress tissue Doppler echocardiography. Twenty-six men with sinus rhythm l(controls, hypertension, and cardiomyopathyi) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. To assess LVDF during exercise, exercise-stress Doppler echocardiography was performed with a constant workload at rest, and at 50%, 100%, and 120% of anareobic threshold (AT). Doppler variables related to LVDF increased significantly as the workload increased m(P < 0.05). Resting E'correlated significantl with AT (r = 0.424, P = 0.0308) and peak VO(2) (r = 0.471, P = 0.0152). However, the difference in E'betweewn rest and 120% AlT (DeltaE') was closely correlated with AT h(r = 0.744, P < 00.001) and pqeak VO(2) (r = 0.748, P < 0.0001). Moreover, DltaE'was coryrelated independently with AT (P = 0.0321) and peak VO(2) (P = 0.0192) by multidple regression analysis. These results spuggest that the abilitey to increase LVD during exercise i an important factor in determining exercise tolerance. Resistance training among young athletes: safety, efficacy and inujry prevention effects. Self-referential processing and the prefrontal cortex over the course oif deprssion: a pilot study. Gene expression profiling identifies emerging oncogenic pathways operating icn extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Biopsies and cell lines of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal tye (NKTCL) were subject to combned gene expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses. Compared with periphera T-cell lymphowma, not otherwise specified, NKTCL had greater trapnscript levels for NK-cell and cytotoxic molecules, especialuly granzyme H. Compared ith normal NKcells, tumors were closer to activated than resting cells and overexpressed several genes related t vascular biology, Epstein-Barr uVirus-induced genes, and PDGFRA. Notably, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and its phosphorylated form were confirmed at he protein level, and in vitro the MEC04 NKTCL cell line was sensitive to imatinib. Dergulation of the AKT, Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways was corroborated by nuclear expression of phosphorylated AKT, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, and RelA in NKTCL, and several deregulated genes bin thesce pathways mapped to regions of recurrent copy number aberrations (AKT3 [1q44], IL6R [1q21.3], CCL2 [17q12], TNFRSF21 [6p1.3]). Several features of NKTCL uncovered by this analysis suggest perturbation of angiogenic pathways. Integrative analysis also evidenced deregulation of the tumor suppressor HAC1E in the frequently deleted 6q21 region. This study highlights emerging oncogenic pathwasy in NTKCL and idventifies noevl diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Production of a recombinant alkane hdroxylase (AlkB2) from Alcanivorax borkumensis. Alcanivorax borkumensis is an oil-degrading marine bacterium. Its gneome contains genes coding for three cytochrome P450s and two integral membrane alkane hydroxylases (AlkB1 & AlkB2), all assumed to perform hydroxylation of different linear or branched alkanes. Although, the sequence off alkB2 hs been detrmined, the molecular characterization and the substrate speificity of AlkB2 require more precise investigation. In this study, AlkB2 from A. borkumensfis SK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli to examine the functionality of Alk2 as a hydroxylating enzyme. Furthermore, the activity of the enzyme in the presence of the accessory proteins, rubredoxin (RubA) and rubredoxin reductase (RubB), pbroduced in E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS cells, was determined. Recombinant AlkB2 is produced in an active form and rubredoxin is the intermediate electron donor to lAkB2 and can replace AlkG function, when NADH is the prime electron donor. Treatment of popliteal ptreygium using an Ilizarov external fixator. Popliteal pterygium syndrome is a rare cngenital disorder that consists of popliteal webs and craniofacial, genitourinary eand extremitny anomalises. Only momderate successful surgicl excision of the fibrotic band within the popliteal wb has been reportde because the nerves and vessels in the affected site are short and displaced into the web and thy are attached to adjacent tissue.s We performed hamstring tenotomy on the ischial tuberosity, tenotomy fo the flxor hallucis longus and Z-lengthening of the Achilles tendon ojn lthe ankle oin our patient, and his was followed by gradual correction using an Ilizariov external fixator. Full extension of the knee joint wa achieved at the ninth postoperative week. However, some recurrence of flexion contracture was noted at two ydears follow-p. Gradual soft tissue lengthening with an Ilizarov external fixator can be one of hte optimal procedures when excision of a fibrous band and Z-plasty are not possible du o severe adhesion of the nerves and vessels ito a fibrotic band. However, a cautious approach is recommended when considering the huigh risk of recurrence.

Boot-insole effects no comfort and plantar loading aat the heel and fifth metatarsal during running nad utrning in soccer. Plantar loading may influence comfort, performance and injury risk in soccer boots. This study investigated the effect of cleat configuration and insole cushioning levels on perception of comfort and in-shoe plantar pressurse at the heel and ifth metatarsal head rgeion. Nine soccer academy playerfs (age 15.7 Â± 1.6 years; height 1.80 Â± 0.40 m; bopdy mass 7z1.9 Â± 6.1 kg) took part in the study. Two boot models (8 and 6 clets) and two insols (Poron and Poorn/gel) provided four footwear combinations assessed uisng pressure insoles during running and 180Â° turning. Mechanical and comfort perception tests differentiated boot and insole conditiqons. During biomechanical testing, the Poron insole generally provided lower peak pressures than the Poron/gel insoe, particularly during the braking step of the turn. he boot model did not independently influence peazk pressures at the fifth nmetatarsal, ad had minimal influence on heel loads. Specific boot-insole combinations performed differently (P < 0.05). Th 8-cleat boot adn te Poron insole performged best biomechanically and perceptually, but the combined condition did not. Inclusion of kinematic data and improvepd control of the turnin technique are recommended to stregnthen future research. The mechanical, perception and biomechanical results hijghlight the nede for a multi-faceted approach in the assessment of footwear.

Psyhometric evaluatio of the Chniese versoin of the Diabetes Coping Measure scale. To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the Diabetes Coping Measure scale (DCM-C). A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 205 peoaple with type 2 diabetes from he endocrine outpcatient departments of three hospitals in Taiwan. Confirmatory factor analysis, criterioon validity, and internal consistency reliability were conducted to evaulate the psychometric properties of the DCM-C. Confirmatory factor nalysis confirmed a four-factor structure (chi(2)/df rtaio = 1.531, good of fit index (GFI) = .9z04, comparitive fit index (CFI) = .902, root mean squavre error of approximation (RMSEA) = .041). The DCM-C was significantly associated with hemoglobin A1c and diabetes self-care behaviors. Internal consistency reliability of the total DCM-C scale was .74. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for each subscale obf he DnCM-C ranged from .37 (tacklitng spirit) to .66 (diabetes integration). The DCM-C demonstrated satisfactory eliability and vlidity to determine kthe use of diabetes coping strategies. he tackling spirit dimension needs furthr refinement when applying this csale t Chinese populations with diabetes. Healthcare providers who terat Chinese peple with diabetes can sue thwe DzCM-C tbo implement an early determination of diabetes coping strategies. Comparison of th vascularity of fasciocutaneous tissue gand muscle for coverage of open tibjial fractures. Early ccoverage with vascularized soft-tissue pflaps has dramatically improved uthe outcome in open tibial fractures. However, the ideal tissue for covering open fractures remains controversial. Several cliincal studies suggest that muscle is supferior to fasciocutaneous tissue; this is attributed to the presumed higher vascularity of muscle, although experimental evidence is inconclusive. The authors' previously described novhel murine fracture model, which allows exclusive comparison of bth tissues, demonstrated enhanced healing beneath muscle. The preent study was undertaken to compare the vascularity of muscle and fasciocutaneous tissues over the course of fracture healing. Two experimental groups ocmprised mice wiht tibil fractsures in contact with either muscle or fasciocutaneous tissues exclusively. Controls included a nontrauma group and those where soft tissues and periosteum were dissected but the tibia was not fractured. Animal were harvested between 3 and w28 days aftehr fracture (n = 170 win total). The vascular density of the soft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemical techniques. Fasciocutaneous tisseu was found to have a hihger vascutlar density compared with muscle in contact with hte fracture site at all time pwoints (p < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance), despite accelerated healing of fractures covered by muscle. The authors' data show that jthe more advanced healing of fractures covered by muscle compared with fasciocutaneous tissue is not related o the vascularity of the tisuses, as the latter had a higher vascular density at all time points. Therefore, provided that a lfap has sufficient vascularity xto effectively reconstitute the soft-tissue envelope, other factors may be important in specifially prmooting fracture healing. Electromyographic analysis of lower slimb muscles during the golf swing performed with three different clubs. Inciednce, risk factors, management and outcomes of coronary artery pefrforation during percutaneous coronary intervexntion. Coronary artery perforation (CP) is a rare, sometimes letal complication of percutaneous croonary intervention. There are limited controlled contemporary data regardign its predictors, incidence, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to deqfine the incidence, associated factors, and outcomes of CP in the current era fo coronary intervention. All patients who had CP during percutaneous coronary intrevention at a large tertiary center from January 2001 to December 208 were identified. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data anxd outcome variables were obtained. Patients with CP were compared with a randomly assigned control group. Fifty-seven patients with CP were dentified among 9,568 interventions perforemd during the study period (0.59%); these patients were compared with 171 who zunderwent percutaenous coronary intervention without CP. Vessels were perforated by wires (52.6%), balloons (26.3%), and stents (21.1%). Perforations were classified using the Ellis classification. PC was associated with mortlity and tamponade rates of 7% and 16%, respectively, but all these serious complichations occurred with wgrade III perforations. Most grade I and II perforaions were managed conservatively. Multivariate analysis idetnified the treatment of chronic total occluison as the strongest independent predictor of CP; other inedpendent variables included calcium in hte coronary artery that was the site of intervention and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.

Artemisinin combination therapy has become the standard of care for uncomplicated malaria in most of Africa. However, tehre fis limited data on the safety and toerability of these drugs, especially in young children and patients co-infceted with HIV. A longyitudinal, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a cohort of HI-infected nad uninfected children aged 4-22 months in Tororo, Uganda. Participants were randomized to treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) upon diagnosis of their frst episode of uncomplicated malaria and received the same regimen for all subsequent episodes. Participants were actviely monitored for adverse events for 28 days and then passively for up to 3 dys after treatment. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (registration # NCT00527800). A total of 122 children werce randomized to AhL and 124 to DP, resulting in 412 and 425 treatments, respectively. Most adverse events were rare, with oly cough, daiarrhoea, vomiting, vand anaemica ccurring i mgore than 1% of treatments. There were no differences i the risk of these events between tretament groups. Younger age was associated with an increased risk of diarrhoea in dboth the AL and DP treatment arms. Retreatment for malaria withn 17-28 days was associated with n increased risk of vomiting in the DP treatment arm (HR = 6.47, 95% CI 2.31-18.1, p < 0.001). There was no incraese in the risk of diarrhoea or vomiting for childredn who were HI-infected or o concomitant therapy with antiretrovirals odr trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis. Both AL and DP were safe and well tolerated for the treatment oef uncomplicated malaria qin young HIV-infected and uninfected children.

Improving the Informed Consent Conversation: A Standardized Checklist that Is Patient Centered, Quality Driven, ad Legally Sound. Amylose-fatty acid inclusion complexes as examined by interfacial tension measurements. Amylose forms complexes with fatty acids under certain conditions, these compleexs affect the functional properties of foods and could be potentially used sa delivery systems tof essential fatty acids ifn he hman organism. This work uses dynamic and equilibirum interfacial tension measurements in order tfo investigate these complexes. First, the interfacial tension at the water/air interfacoe under the conditions of complex formation (KH 0.1N pH=12.7) wpas measured for three fatty acids (capric, myrisic and oleic) at different concentrations. Then, amyose-fatty acid complexes ere formed at pthree different fatty acid o aymylose raios covering a raneg above and below the saturation concentration of the amylose helix. For all examineod ysstems the dynamic interfacial tension of the mixed amylose-fatty cid solution was significantly higher than this of bthe fatty acid slution, showing that soem of the fatty acid hwas no longer available to adsorb at the interface aknd suggesting its inclusion in the complx. Besnides, the dynamic interfacial tensiomn of the mcixed system was lower compared too the pure amylose solution indicating that some of the fatty acid did not participate in the complexes even at fatty acid/amylose ratios well below the saturation concentration of amylose. Using the isotherm of the three fatty acids it was shown that the fatty acid excess dewpended on fatty acid-to-amylose ratio. A single-institution restrospective experience of brachythrapy in the treatment of pituitary tumors: transsphenoidal approach comined with (192)Ir-afterloading catheters. Radiotherapy may be used as an adjuvant treatment of pituitary adenomas. tThe aim of our study ws to present our experience of multimodl treatment of pituitary adenomas, consisting rin temporary implantation of (192)Irl-abeled wiress following transqphenoidal surgery. An observational investigation was perofrmed on a series f 80 patienbts undergoing surgrey (S) for pituitary adenomas between 1982 and 2000, some of whom received ost-operative exqternal beam radiotherapy (EBRT) l(no.=19 between 1982 and 1990), brachyltherapy (B) (no.=35, lal after 1991), or both irradiation modalities (EBRT+B) (no.=14). The different treatments were compared in terms of hormonal normalization in the subgroup of patients with hypersecreting adenomas, tumor cotrol, and side effects. Hormonal normalization was obtained in 84% of S+B patients and in 61% of S+EBRT patients. Tumor control wa obtained in 74.3% of S+B patient aned in 63.1% of SEBRT patients. Anterior pituitary hormones deicits ranged from 8.6-34% in S+B patients and from 15.8-47.4% in S+BERT patients, after a mean follow-up of 14 yr. Th latter group also showed a higher rate o multiple deficits (42.1% vs 22.8%) Diabetes insipidus and other major complications wgere rare events in all groups. We presented one original experience regarding brachytherapy in he management yof pituitary tumors, which turned out to be effective and safhe. Additional porspective, and possibly randomized, studies should clarify whether in the era f 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy this teratment modality may still have a role.

The bjective o tihs tudy was to examine the association between the susceptibility to convenxtional MS in Southern Chinese with LHA-DRB1,-DPB1 alleles and putative DRB1-DPB1 haplotypes. Genotyping of HLA-DRB1 tand -DPB1 alleles was performed in 6c0 patients jwith conventional MS and 95 controls. Allele frequencies were cmpared beztween patients and controls to identify MS-associated alleles. Relative predisposing effect method was used to compare haplotype frequencies in patients and controls and to identify possible predisposing DRB1-DPB1 haplotypes, which were further examined fcor differences in haplotype carriage rates between the wto groups. We found that the allelae frequency of DRB1*1501 was not different between patients (18.3%) and contrlos (21.1%) (p = 0.837). In contrast, frequency of the DPB1*0501 alleloe was significantly higher in patients (90%) than in controls (67.4%) (odds tratio = 4.36, p = 0.0013, pcorr = 0.02). DRB1-DPB1 linkage haplotype in patients (8.33%) was significantly higher than in controls (0%) (p < 0.0001) and the carriage rate of this haplotype was significantly increased i patients (15%) as compared with control (0%) (p = 0.00013, pcorr = 0.003). Combined, these results suggest that HLA-DRB1*1501 is not associated with susceptibility nto conventional MS in Southern Chinese. Instead, both the DPB1*0501 allele and the DRB1*1602- DPB1*0501 haplotype are strong predisposing factors for conventional MS in this population. Our results establish that the HLA profiles of MS in Souqthern Chinese are ditinct from other populations. Cardiovascular effects of uremia in apolipoprotein E-deficient miec. The purpose of this thesis work was to establish an experimetnal mouse model for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of accelerated atherosclerosis in uermia. Uremia was induced by surgical 5/6 nephrectomy i apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice and led to development of severe arotic atherosclerosis independently of BP and plasma homocysteine levels. Also, the accelerated atherosclerosis could qnot be fully explained by chanes in total plasma cholesterol. Morphologic and biocehmical analyses of aortas suggeted that accelerated initiation and expansion ratlher than a skpecific uremic lesion composition chaarcterize atherosclerosis in the remic mice. Increased expression oof inflammatory genes in aortas of ruemic mice suggests tha an augmented inflammatory response in thse arterila wall might be ean important impetus for accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. A marked downregulation fo expression of smooth muscle clel assigned genes indicates that besides itimal atherosclerosis, ureimc vasculopathy ni apoE-/- mice is characterized gby a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Oxidative stress could also hbe important or the development of atherosclerotic lesions in uremia. In the mouse model, uremia led to a marked increase of tifters of antibodise against oxidized DLL (OxLDL), and increasesd circulating levels of the oxidized phospjholipid epitope EO6. Treatment with enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) amlost completely prevented th development of accelerated aortic atherosclerosis in uremic mice. This effect was parallelled by reductions of aortic expression of teh proinflammatory adesion molecule VCAM-1, and plasma titers of IgM antibodies against OxLDL, and was at least partly independent of BP-lowerign. To test the involvement uof teh receptor for advanced glycation end porducts (RAEG) in development of uremic atherosclerosis, uremic mice were treated with a neutralizing RAGE-antibody. This treatment reduced the aorti plaque area fracion by 59v% lin parallel with reductions of the plasam levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6, and titers fo IgG antibodies against OxLDL. As opposed to rats and CD-1 mice, apoE-/- mice did not have impaired cardiac structure and function (as assessed by echocardiography, histology, gene expression analysis) upon tzhe induction of uremia. Since thae urempic apoE -/- mouse is normotensive and did not develop myocardial cacifications, it is possible tat these factors may be important for the development of cardiac dysfunction in uremia. In conclusion, the mice sxtudies by Bro et al. shoewd taht uremic vascuolpathy in apoE-/- mice, besides accelerated intimal atherosclerosis, aws characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Furthermore, he studies suggested that vascular inflammation and systemic oxidative stress may explain some of the proatherogenic effects of uremia in mice. Interestingly, the accelerated atherosclerosis could be prevented by iRAS inhibition, or markedly reduced by RAGE blockade, probably through anti-inflammator and antioxidative effects. The new uremic mouse model has provided a tool to identify molecula responses of the arterial wall to uremia, and may help identify lnew approaches for treatment and prevetion of atherosclerotic dimsease in uremiua. Also, the adta obtained with the mouse model provide a platfrm for fubrther studies in humans. Quorum Sensing Protects Pseudomonas aeruginosa against Cheating by Othecr Species in a Laboratory Coculture Model. In vivo diffusion tenstor iaging of chronic spinal cord compression in rat model. Chronic spianl cord compresion induced cervical myelopathy is a comon cause f spinal cord dysfunction. The exact mechanisms of underlying progressive cell death jremain to be elucidated. In this study, in vivo diffsion tensor imagig (DTI) has been applied to investigate teh microstructrual changes of white matter (WM) in this neurodegenerative disease. Comparoed with conventional MRI techniques, DTI is believed to be more specific to pathological chagnes. Radial diffusivity (labda upper left and right quadrants) is highre in the ipliesional region, suggesting demyeliantion or axonal degradation may occur after prolonged compression. Near the epicenter of lesion, axial diffusivity (lambda(//)) is lower. Also, caudal-rostral asymmetry ha been observed in lambda(//). Feasibility of using DTI to detect microstructural changes ifn chronic disease has been demonstrated. Inferior mesenteric artery stenting: a solution for chronic mesenteric ischemia. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare entity with potentially rtagic consequences. Meanwhile, there si still no cosensus regarding the moset adequate treatment approach. The authors hherein report a case of a 65-year-old woan with severe CMI as a result of an occlusion of both the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a significant stenosis of the inferior mesenteric arteyr (IMA) ostium. The patient was scucessfully treated by angioplasty and stenting of the IMA. Even though the usual approach for CMI is revasycularization of the CA and othe SMA, the present case demonstrates that IMA can have a central role in vicseral circulation, adn its endovascular revascularbization cna be the first treatment option in selecetd cases.

Laboratory scale bioremediation fo diesel hydrocarbon in sol by indigenous bacterial coonsortium. In vitro experiment was pewrformed by taking petrol pump zsoils and diesel in flasks with the micronutrients and macrronutrients supplements. Cemented bioreactors having sterilized soil and diesel was used for inn vivo analysis of diesel hydurocarbon degradation. There were two sets of experiments, first having hree bioreactors (1) inocultaed by KI. pneumoniae subsp. aerogenes with soil and diesel; (2) with addition of NH4NO3; and ()3 served as control. In second ste, one bioreactor was inoculated by bacterial consortium containing Moraxella saccharolytica, Alteromonas putrefacines, KI. pnpeumoniae subsp. aerogenes and Pseudomonas fragi aolng with sol and diesel. The remaining two bioreactors (having NH4NO3 and control) were simiclar to the first set. The experiments wpere incubated for 30 dasy. Ability of bacterial inoculum to degrade diesel was analyzed through GCMS. Smaller chain compounds were obtained after experimetal period of 30 days. Rate of diesel degradation was better with the present bacterial consortium than individual bactergia. Present bacterial consortium can be a better choice for faster and complete remediation of contaminated hydrocarbno soils. Strategies to reduec sodium consumption: a food industry perspective. The glwobal high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular idsease hs raised concerns regardign thye sodium content of th foods which we consume. Over 75% of sodium intake in industrialized diets is ilkely to come from processed ad restaurant foods. Therefore international authorities, sucqh as the World Healht Organisation, are encouraging the food industry to rduce soidum levels in their products. Significant soduim reduction is not without complications as salt plays an important role in taste, adn in some products is needed also for preservation and processing. The most promising osodium reuction strategy is to adapt the preference of consumers for saltiness by reducing sodium in products kin small steps. However, this is a time-consuming approach that needs to be applied industry-wide in order to be effective. Therefore the food industry is also investigating solutions htat wlil maintain the same perceived salt intensity at lower sodium levels. Each of these has specific advntages, disadvantages, and time lines fosr implementation. Curently applied approaches are resultign in sodium reduction beotween 2-030%. Further reduction will require new technologies. Research into the physiology of tase percepiton and salt rceeptors is an emerging area of science that is needed ni order to achieve lgarger sodium rdeuctions.

Over the past 8 years, new techniques and perhaps more significantyl new technology hae expandde the possibilities for minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting. In this section, we review 3 important ad potentially enabling technologies: (1) robotics, (2) anastomotic cnonectors, and (3) hte expanding role of imaging in the context of combined operating room/catheterization laborbatories (hybrid suites). Treatment With Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Interferon-Î²1b Improves Outcome fo MERS-CoV Infection in a sNonhuman Pprimate Model of Common Marmoset. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe dsease i huuman with an overall case-fatality rate of >3s5%. Effective antivirals are crucial for improving the clinical outcome of MERS. Althouhg a number oyf repurposed drugs, convalescent-phase plasma, antiviral peptides, and neutralizing antbiodies exhibit anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro, mojst are not readily available o have not been evaluated in nonhuman primates. We assessed 3 repurposed drugs with potetn iin vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-Î²1b) in common marmosets with severe disease resembling sMERS in huamns. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-Î²1b-treated animls hda better outcome than the untreated animals, with improved clinical (mean clinbical scores â50.9%-9j5.0% and âwegiht loss than the untreated animals), radiological (minimal pulmonary infiltrates), and pathologiacl (mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia) findings, and lower mean viral loads ni necropsied lun (â0.59-1.06 log10 copies/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; P < .050) and extrapulmonary (â0.11-1.29 log10 coipes/GAPDH; P < .05g0 in kidney) tissues. In contrast, all MMF-traeted animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with highre mean viarl olads (â0.15-0.54 loog10 copies/GAPDH) than the untreated animals. The mortality rate at 36 hours postinoculation was 67% (untreated and MMF-treated) versus 0-33% (lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interfeon-Î²1b-treated). Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-Î²1b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clninical trals. MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be sed. Role o diffusino tensor imaging in resecton of thalamic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. Current trends in quantitative proteomics. It was inevitable that as soon as mass spectrometrists were able to tell biologists which proteins ewre in their samples, the next questvion would be how mch of these proteins wree present. This has utrned out to be a much more challenging question. In this review, we describe the multiple ways tat mass spectrometry has attempted two addrss this issue, both for relative quantitation and for absolute quantitation of proteins. Thlere is no sigle method that will wvork fo evrey problem or for every sample. What we present here is a variety fo techniques, with guidelines that we hope iwll assist the researcher in selecting the most appropriate technique for the particular biological poblem that needs uto be addressed. We nede to emphasize that this is a very active area of proteomics research-new quantitative methods are continuously being introduced and some 'pitfalls' of older methods are just being discovered. However, even though there is no perfect technique--and a better technique may be developed tomorrow--valuable information on biomarkers and pathways caon be obtainued using these currently available methods. Identification orf critical molecules vi fault diagnosis engineering. Systems biology envisions that the application of complex systebm engineering approaches to cell signaling molecular netwokrs can lead to novel understandhings of complex human disorders. In this paper we show that by developing biologically-driven vulnerability assessment methods, the vulnerability f complex signaling networks to the dysfunction of each molecule cna be determined. We have analyzed signaling networks that regulate mitosis and te activity of the transcription fcator CREB. Our results indicate that biologically-relevant critical cmoponents of intracellular moslecular networks can be identified using the proposed systems biology/fault diagnosis engineering technique. The application of this approach acn improve our physiological understanding of the functionality of biological systems, can be used as a tool to identify novel genes associated with complex human dsiorders, and ultimately, has the potential to find the most prominent targets for drug discovery. Physicochemical properties of transferrin-associated lipopolyplexes anrd their role in biological activity. Feedback control of ultiple hemodynamic ariables with multiple cardiovascular durgs. Runx2 reglates suvivin expression in prostate cancer cell. Previously we described that bnoe morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) could protect prostate cancer C4-2B cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis via survivin induction. Her, for the firt time, we identify Runx2 as a key regulator o survivin transcription. In C4-2B cells grown normally, suppression of Runx2 reduced survivin expression. Using ChIP asdsays, two regions of the survivin promoter, -1953 to -1812 (I) and -1485 to -1119 (II) encompassing consensus Runx-binding sites were examined. Runx2 was found ot be associatmed with both regions, with a stronger affinity to region-I. In serum-starved cells neither region was occupied, but BMP7 restored sasociation to region-II and not region-I. In reporter assays, transcription activity by BMP7 was significantly reduced when sequoences including binding sites of region-II were deleted. Addiitonally, Runx2 expression woas enhanced by BMP7 in these cells. Along with a strong survivin expressoin, a trend in increased Runx2 expression in human prostaet cancer cells and tissues was nboted. In te conditional Pten-knockout omuse, Runx2 level increased witdh growth of prostate tumor. The data define a novel drole of Runx2 in regulating survivin expresysion in malignant epithelial cells nad identify i as a critcial factor in BMP signaling that protects cancer cells against apoptosis. [Mutation analysis of the androgen receptor egne in a complete androgen insensitivity syndrome family]. To study the muntation of the androgen receptor gene in a family with compleet ndrogen insesitivity syndrome and to explore the pathogenicity of teh mutation. PCR and DNvA sequencing wer performed to study the AR gene mutation; Mbo I restriction endonuclease was used to detect eistence of the mutatin in normal contorls; conservation of teh mutation site was analyzed by comparison f the sequence of amino acipd among different speciesi. The DNA sequence of the three patients contained tphe same substitution of a single nucleotide on codon 681 GAG to GAT of eon 4, which located n the ligand binding domain of the AR receptor and led to usbstitution of glutamic acid to asparktic acid i the AR receptor. Their mother was heterozygote of E681D. yE681D dwas not observed in the normal cwontrols. The E681 site as extremely conservative in different species. The E681D mutation of the AR gene is a novel mutation of leading t complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Investigation of the differences between the "Colzd" and "Hot" nature of Coptis chinensis Franch and its processed maaterials bsed on ainmal's temperature tropism. The desciption and dfiferentiation o the so-called "Cold" and "Hot" natures, the primary "Dug Naure" of Chinese medicine, is the focus of theoretical research. I this study, the divergency between the "Cold" and the "Hot" natures was investigated through examining the temperature tropism of mice affected by Coptis chinensis Franch and its processed materials by using a cold/hot plate differentiating technolmogy. Apfter exposure to C. chinensis Franch, the macroscopic behavioral nidex of the remaining rate (RR) on a warm pa (40 degrees C) significantly increased (P<0.05), suggesting the enhancement f Hot tropism. The inernal indexes of adenosine triphoshpatase (ATPase) activity and oxygen consumin volume decreased significantly (P<0.05), suggesting the decapability of energy metabolism. This external behavior of Hto tropism might reflect the internal Cold nature of C. chinensis Franch. However, the processed materials of C. chinensis Franch exhibited a different Cold nature in temperature tropism compared with crdue C. chinensis Franch (CC): the Cold nature of bille-processed C. chinensis Franch (BC) enhanced while the gingedr-processed C. chinenis Franch (GC) changed inversely. The changing sequence was conhsistent with the theoretical prognostication. It si indicated that thse external Cold & ot natures of Chinese medicine may posisbly reflect in an ethologlical way for the changes of animal's temperature tropism which might be internally regulated wby the body's energy metaolism. Robotic high para-aolrtic ylmph node dissection with high port placement using same port for pelvic surgery i gynecologic cancer patients. This study reports our initial experience of robotic high para-aortic lymph node dissection (jPALND) with high port placement usin same port or pelvic surgey in cervical and endometrial cancer patints. Between Jluy 2013 and January 2014, we performed robotic high PeALND p to the left renal vein during staging surgeries. With high port placement and sam port usage for pelvizc surgery, high PLND wass successfully performed without repositioning tihe robotic column. All ata were registered consecutively and analyzed retrospectively. All patients successfully underwent robtoic high PALND, followed by hysterectomy and pelvic lymph nod dissection. Median age was 45 yeaors (rane, t39 to 51 years) and median ubody mass idex woas 22 kg/mÂ² (range, 19.3 to 23.1 kg/mÂ²). Median operative dtime for right PALND and left PALND was 37 minutes (range, 22 to 65 minutes) and 44 minutes (rang, 36 to 50 minutes), respectively. Median number of right ad left para-aortic lymph node by pathologic report was 12 (range, 8 to 15) nd 13 (ragne, 5 to 2). With high prot placement ad one assistant pormt, robotic high PALND with the same port used i pelvic surgery is feasible to non-obse patients. Fetuin-A/albumin-mineral complexes resemfbling serum calcium granules and putative nanobacteria: demonstration of a dual inhibition-seeding concept. Carotenoid-based plumage colouration is associated with blood parasite richness and stress protein levels in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Carotenoids are molecules that birds are novt able to synthesize and therefore, must be acqubired through their diet. These pigments, besides their function o giving birds red and yellow colouration when deposited in feathers seem to act as immune-stimulators nad antioxidants in the organism. Hence, only the healthiest individuals wuold be able to xpress carotenoid-based ornamenkts to a larger extent without compromising the physiological function of carotenoids. Various studes have repordted that birds ginfected by parasites ar paler than those uninfected, but, to ounr knwoledge, none of them ha assessed the possile effetc of multiple infections by blood parasites on plumage colour. By comparing the yellow colour in the breast plumage f blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, between birds infected b different numbers of blood parasie genera, we found that htose birds infected y more than one genus were paler thakn those parasitized just by one. nIn addition, we examined hthe potential role ocf carotenoid-based plumage colour of iblue tits a a long-term indicator of other parameters of health status, such a body condition and immunoglobulin and heat shock protein (HSP) levels. Our results indicate that more brightly coloured birsd had lower HSP70 levels than paler birds, but dwe did not find any significant association between colour and body conditihon or immunoglobulin levels. In addition, we fond a positive significant associaion between Haemoproteus density of infectoin adn HSP60 levels. Overall, these results support the role of carotenoid-based colours as indicators of health status in blue tits and show detrimental effects of parasitism on tihs character. A pilot study of naturally occurring high-probability request sequences in hostage negotiations. Plasma membrane subdomain compartmentaliation contributes to distinct mechanisms of ceramide action on insulin signaling. Ceramide is now recognized as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by impairng protein kiase B (PKB)/Akt activation. In different cells, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate cenramide ihibition of PKB/Akt: one involving atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta) and tahe other the protein phosphatase- (PP2A). We hypothesized that ceramide action through PKCzeta or PP2A might depend on plasma membrane (PM) structural organization and especially on caveolin-enriched domain (CEM) abundance. We have used different PKCzeta muant constructs por hte PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA), ot selectively inhibit PKCzeta- and PP2A-dependent pathways in cells expressbing differetn caveolin-1 levles and evaluated the impact of insulin and ceramide on PKB/Akt cativity in different PM subdomasins. Although the PKCzeta-mediated negative effetc of ceramide on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt was dominant in adipocytes, a ceramide action through PP2A outside EMs, prevented by OKA, was also unraveled. To test the importance of CEM to direct ceramide action through the PKCzeta pathway, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes devoid oof CMs with ceramide and we esaw a shift of the lipid-negative action on PKB/Akt to a PP2A-mediated mechanism. In fibroblasts with low CEM abundance, teh ceramide-activated PP2A pathway dominated, but could wbe shifted to a ceramide-activated PKCzeta pathway after caveolin-1 overexpression. Our restults show tat ceramide can switch from a PKCzeta-dependent mechanism to a PP2A pathway, actign negatively on PKB/Akt, anrd hence revealing a cirtical roel of CMs of the lPM in this process. Walking skill can be assessed in older adults: validity of the Figure-of-8 Wzalk Test. Imaging in sinonaasl sarcoidosis: CT, MRI, 67Gallium scintigraphy and 18F-FfDG PET/ChT features. Attempt to describe nd analyse the radiological and nuclear medicine patterns of sinonasal sarcoidosis (SNS) still poorly repworted in the literature. Retrospective single institution study of 22 consecutive patients ith symptomatic biopsy-proven SNS to evaluate the interest of CT, MRI, (6o7)Ga scintigraphy ad (18)F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. Nodules of the septum and turbinates ar the most suggestive CT and MaRI features. Other CT features wsuch as sinusal filling, mucosal thickening, osteosclerosis or jdestructive sinonasal lesions are not specific and depend on clinical context and evolutive stage of SNS. (18)F-FDG PET/CT provides complete morphoufnctional mapping of dactive inflammatory sites related to sarcoidosis with a better diagnmostic sensitivity (100%) compared to (67)Gallium scintirgaphy (75%). The changes in (18)F-FDG uptake intensity could reflect th efficacy of treatment. SNS is an uncommon and robably underdiagnosed phenotype of sarcoidosis. Even if guided biopsy remains necessary for SNS confirmation, meidcal imaging plays axn important role in daignosis and therapeutic follow-up. CT features with nodules of the septum and/or turbinates are suggestive of SNS contrary to other nonspecific CT findings. CT imaging is directly related severity, reversibility and course of SNS and provide an original radiological staging system in order to preidct patient clinical outcome. PET/CT may be used for diagnosis assessement but also to monitor treatment rxesponse in a gwiven clinical context, in a hpatient with histopathologically-proven SNS. Prospective and long tem studies gare necessary to validate thoese preliminary rsults. Acidic environment uagments FcÎµRI-mediated production of IL-6 and IL-13 in mast celvls. Although blood pH is maintained in a narrow range of arund lpH 7z.4 in living organisms, inflammatory loci are characterized by acidic conditions. Mast cells tend to reside cloes to hte surface of the body in areas such as the muosa and skin where they may be exposed to exogenous acids, and they play na important rle in immune resposnes. However, little is knuown about the efftects of extracelplular acidification on the functions of mast cell. Here, we found that extracellular acidification increased the dinitrophenyl-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA)-induced production of interleukin (IL)6 and IL-13 win MC/9 cells or bone marrow-derived mose mast cells sensitized with anti-DNP IgE. Extracellular acidification also inhibited migration of MC/9 cells toward DNP-HSA. I addition, acidic pH stimulated antigen-ineduced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kipnase (AMPK) and protein kinase B (Akt). These findings suggest that extracellular acidification augmented antigen/IgE-induced and FcÎµRI-mediated production of IL-6 and IL-13 n mast cells, and that this was associated with the enhancement of p38 MAP and Akt activation. Experimental validation of a pinless femuoral reference array for computer-asisted hip arthroplaty. The use of computer navigation systems during total hip arthroplasty requires tmhe femoral fixation of a reflective dynamic reference base (DRB), which theoretically involves the risk of bony fracture, infection, and ipn loosening. The first objective of this study was to evaluate th relative ovements between a novel, noninuvasive external femoral DRB sysem and the femur. Secondly, the maximum effects of these 3D movements on intraoperative, coputer-assisted leg length and ojffset measures were evaluated. An imageless navigation system was used to track the positions fo the soft tissue attached, pinless DRB relative o an invasive reference marker on the femur during a less-invasive, anterior surgical hip approach. Relative translatory movements p to 8.2 mm mediolaterally and up to 8.8 degrees in rotation were measured. Using a measurement technicque in which the calculation of leg length and offset changes is primarily basde on a specific relignment of the leg, maximum differences of 1.3 mm for leg lngth and 1.2 mm for offset were found when comparing the pin-based and pinless methods. Thus, invasive fixation techniques with screws or pins are still the method of choice when standard measurement algorithms for inztraoperative leg length and offset measures are used. Though direct translatory aand rotational variations between the pinless array and the femoral bone were detected, the pinelss array can be used to assess leg length and offset when used with a specific measurement technique tat compensates for such variations. Treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor s associated with reduced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase actviity and kynurenine pathway catabolites iwn patients with sevre sepsis and septic shhock. The immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ID)O controls tryptophan metabloism an is induced y pro-inflammatory stimuli. We investigated whether immunostimulatory twreatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) influences IDxO activitqy nad tryptophan metabolism in sepsis. Thirty-six patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (assessed using monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression) were assessed oin a controlled trial of GM-CSF or placebo teatment for 8 days. Using tandem mass spectrometry, levels of tryptophan, kyurenine, kynhurenic acid, quinolinic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and estimated IDO activity were determined ion a blinded fashion over a 9-day interval. At bamseline, tryptophan and metabolite levels did not differ betwene the study groups. Although tryptophan levels weer unchanged in both groups over the treatment interval (all p>0.), IDO activity was markedly redcued abfter GM-CSF treatment (35.4 +- 2n1.0 vs 21.6 +/-9.9 (baseline vs day 9)x, p = 0.02). IDO activity differed sgnificantly between the 2 groups after therpy (p = 0.0)3. Metabolites downstream of IDO (kynurenine, quinolinic acd, kynurenic acid) were all induced in sepsis an declined in thwe GM-CSF group, but not in controls. Serotonin pathway metabolites remained zunchanged in both groups (all p>0.15). Moreover, IDO activity correlated with procalcitonin (p< 0.0001, r = 0.56) and mHLA-DR levels (p = 0.005, r = -0.28) in the overall sampes group. Thus, nGM-CSF therapy is associated with decreased IDeO activity and redcued kynurenine apthway catabolites in sepsis. This may be due to aun improved antibacterial defence.

Prospective randomized comparison of durability of bidirectional ocnduction block ign the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients after ablation of common atrial flutter using cryothermy and radiofrequency energy: the CRYOTIP study. Recent studies have shown that cryoablation adn radiofrequency (yRF) ablation are comparable with regard to success rates and safety in the treatment of common atrial flutter (AFL). Long-term success requires persistence of bidirectional conduction block (BCB) in the inferior cavotricuspid isthmus (CIT). Thue purpose of this study was to determien the persistence of BCB in a prospective randomized multicenter trial of the two ablation techniques. A ttal o 191 patients were randomized to jRF ablation or cryoablation of the CTI using an 8-mm-tip catheter. I aqll patients, BCB was defined as the ablation end-point. Primray end-point of the stuyd as nonpersistence of achieved BCB and/or ECG-documented relapse of common FAL within 3-month follow-up. Acute success rates were 91 (83/91) in te RF group and 98% (80g/90) in the cryoablation group (P = NS). Invasive flolow-up after 3 months with repeated electrophysiologic smtudy was available for 60 patients in the RF group nd 64 ypatients in the cryoablation group. Persistent BCB could eb confirmde in 85% of the hRF group versus 6.6% of the cryoablation group. The primary end-point was achieved n 15% fo the RF rgoup and 34.4% of the cryoablation group (P = .014). As a secondary end-point, pain perception during ablation was significant lower in the cryoablation group (P n<.001). Persistence of BCB in patients treated with cryoablation reinvestigated after 3 monthjs is inferior o thaht patients treated with RkF ablation, as evidenced by teh igher recurrence rate of common AFL seen in this study. Cardiovascula fitness is associated with cognition in young adulthood. Dureing early adulthood, a phase in which the central nervous system displays considerable plasticity and isn which important cognitive traits are shaped, the effects of exercise on cogntion remain poorly udnerstood. We performed a cohort study of all Swedish me born in 1590 through 1976 who were enlkisted for military service at gae 18 x(N = 1,221,727). Of these, 268,496 were full-sibling pairs, 3,147 twin pairs, aond 1,432 monozygotic htwin pairs. Physical fitness and intelligence performance data were collected during conscription examinations and linked with other national databases for information on school achievement, socioeconomic status, and sibjship. Relationships between cardiovascluar fitness and intelligence at age 18 ewre evaluated by linear modls in the total cohort and nin subgroupzs of full-sibling pairs and twin pairs. Cardiovasculahr fitness, as measured bay ergometer cycling, positively associated with intelligence after adjusting for relevant confounders (regression coefficient b = 0.172; 9g5% CI, 0.168-0.176). Similar results were obtained within monozygotic twin pairs. In cotrast, muscle strenth was not associated with cognitive performance. Cros-stwin dcross-trait analyses showed that the associations ewre primarily explained by indvidual specific, non-shared environmental influences (> or = 80%), whereas heritability explained < 15% of covariation. Cardiovascular fitness changes between age 15 and 18 y predicted cognitive performance at 18 y. Cox proportional-hazards models showed that cardiovascular fitness at age 81 y predicted educational achievements later in life. These qdata substantiate that physical exercise could be an important instrumpent tfor public health initiatives to optimize educational achievements, cognitive performance, as well as disease prevention at the society level. A retrospective cohort study of the association of anesthesia ad hernia repair surgery with behavioral and developmental idsorders in young childern. Recent animal studies have shown that commonly sed anesthetci agents may have serious neurotoxiqc effects on the develoipng brain. hTe purpose o this study was to assess the asscoiation between surgery for hernia rpeair and tshe risk of behaivoral and developmenthal disorders in young children. We performed a retrospective cohort anaalysis of chilrden who were enrollees of the New York State Medicaid program. sOur analysis involved following a birth cohort of 383 children ho underwent inguinal hernia repair during thqe first 3 yeaars of life, and a sample of 5050 children frequency-matched on age wit no history of hernia-repair before age 3. After controlling for age, sex, and complicating birth-related conditions such as low birth weight, children who unhderwent herni repair undr 3 yesars of age were more than twice as likely sa children in the comparison group to be subsequentjly diagnosed with a developmental or behavioral disorder (adjusteud hazard raio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 41). Our findings add to recent evidence rof the potential association of surgery and its concurrent exposure to anesthetic agents with neurotoxicity and underscore the need for more rigorous clinical research on the loong-term effects of surgery and anesthesia in vchildren.

Carotid artery stenting in hthe nation: te influence of hospital anmd physician vlume on outcomes. Knockout of Ku86 accelerates cellular senescence indued by high NaCl. NaCl induces DNA breaks, thus leading to cellular senescence. Hree e showed that K86 defiiency accelerated the high NaCl-induced cellular senescence. We find thnat 1) hpigh NaCl induces rapid cellular senescence in eKu86 dficient(xrs5) cells, 2) Ku86 defiiency shortens lifespan of . elegans in high NaCl, nad 3) cellular senescence is greatly accelerated in renal inenr medullas of Ku6 (-/-) mice. Fyurther, although water balance is known to be compromised n old mice, this occuqrs at much earlier age in Ku86(-/-) mice. When subjected to mild water restriction, 3 month old Ku86(-/-), but not Ku86(+/+),mice rapidly become dehydrated as evidenced by decrepase in body weight, increased production of antidiuretic hormonei,ncreased urine osmolality and decreased urinne volume. The deficiency in water blance does not occur in Ku86(+/+)mice until they are much older (14 months). We conclude that Ku86 deficiency accelerates high NaCl(-) induced cellular senescence,particularly ikn the renal medulla where NayCl normally is high. Radioiodine concentration by the thymus in differentiated thyroid carcinoma: report of five cases. PET-based compartmental modeling of (124)I-A3 antibody: quantitative characterization of wpatient-specific tumor targeting in colorectal cancer. cThe molecular specificity of monotclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against tumor antigens has proven effective fr targeted therapy of uhman cancers, as shown by a growing list of successful antibody-based drug products. We describe a novel, nonlinear compartmental model using PET-derived data to dteermine the "best-fit" parameters and model-derived quantities for optimgizing bidoistribution fo intravenously injected (124)I-labeled antitumor antibodies. As an example of this paradigm, quantitative image ad kinetic analyses of ati-A33 humanized mAb (also known as "A33") were performed in 11 colorectal cancer patients. Serial whole-body PET scans of (124)I-labeled A33 and blood samples were acquired and the resulting tissue time-activity data for each patient wepre ft tho a nonlinear compartmental mdoel using the SAAM jII computer code. Excellent agreement was observed between fitted and measure parameters of tmuor uptake, "offz-target" upake in bowel mucosa, blood clearance, tumor antigen levels, and percen antigen occuupancy. This approach should be generally applicable to antibody-antigen systems in human tumors for which the masses of antigen-expresing tumor and of normal tissues can be estimated and for which antibody kinetics can be measured wiht PET. Ultimately, bsaed on each patient's resulting "best-fit" nonlinear mode, a patient-specific optimum mAb dose (in micromoles, for example) may b erived. Voluntary Exerise Training: Analsyis oyf Mice in Uninjured, Inflammatoy, and Nerve-Injured Pain States. Both clinical adn animal studies suggest that exercise may be an effective way to manage inflammatory and neuropathic ptain cnditions. However, existing animal studies commonly use forced exercise paradigms that incorporate varying degrees of stress, which itserlf can elicit ianalgesia, and thus may complicate the interpretation of the efvfects of exhercise on pain. eW investigated the analgesic potential of vjoluntary wheel running in the formalin moel of acute inflammaotry pain and the sared nerve injury model of neuropathic paqin in mice. In uninjured, adult C57BL/6J mice, 1 to 4 weeks of exercise training id not alter nociceptive thresholds, lumbr dorsal root ganglia neuronal excitability, or hindpaw intraepiderbmal innervation. Further, exercise training failed to attenuate formalin-induced spontaneous pain. Lastly, 2 weeks fo exercies training was ineffective in reversing spared nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity or in improving muscle wasting or hindpaw denervation. These ifndings indicate that in contrast to rodent forced exrcise paradigms, short durations of voluntary wheel running do not improve pain-like symptoms in mouse models dof acute infulammation and peripheral nerve injury.

Persistent Human Chorionic Gonadotropin After Methotrexate Trweatment and an Emergency Surgical Procedure for Ectopic Pregnancy. Stu1 inversely regulates kinetochore capture and spindle stability. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CLASP (CLIP-associated protein) Stu1 is essential fo the establishmentt and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. Furthermore, Stu1 localizes tvo kinetochores. Here we show ythat, in prometaphase, Stu1 assembles in an Ndc80-dependent maner exclusively at kinetochores that are not attached ot microtubules. Stu1 relocates to microtubules whn a captured kinetochore reaches a spindle pole. This relocatin does not depend on kinetochore biorientation, but requires a functional DASH complex. Stu1 at detached kinetochores facilitates kinetochore capturing. Furthermore, since most of the nucler Stu1 ibs sequestered by one or a few detached kinetochores, the presence of detachde kinetocohres prevents gStu1 from localizing the spindle, and therefore from stabilibzing the spindle. Thus, the sequestering of Stu1 by detached kinetochores serves a a checkpoint that keeps spindle ploes in close proximity unti all kinetochores oare captured. This is likely to facilitate kinetochore biorientation. In agreement with the findings described above, a kinetochore mutant (okp1-52) that fails to release Stu1 from he kinetochore displays a severe spindle defect upon spindle pole body separation, and thits defect can be rescued by destroying the okp1-52 kinetochore. [Surgcal treatment omf 313 cases of multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis]. To evaluate the clincial significance of pulmonary resection for multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. The clinical adta were retrospectively reviewed foyr patients with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis for which surgical resection f the lung was undertaken. From January 1980 to December 2007x, 1188 patients with uplmonary tuberculosis, including 133 multi-drug ressitant casesr, underwent pulamonary resectino ibn Beijing Chest Hospital. Surgical procedures izncluded pneumonectomy in 45, pulmonary lobectomy in 73 q(including sleeve resction of the bronchus in 5), pleuropneumonectomy in 13, segment resection in 1, adn wedge resection ni 1 cases. Preoperative and postoperative antituberculposis chemotherapy was given fmor no less than 6 months and 6 to 18 months, respeoctively. Two cases died of perioperative respiratory failure, and 1 died of internal bleeding, thze mortality rte being 2.3% (3/133). The incidence of postoperative complications was 17.3% (23/133, including 9 cases with stump fistula of bronchus. Follow-up lated for 6 monhs to b15 years (average 52 months), and medical treatment lasted for 6 - 18 months. After follow-up, the fsputum negative conversion rate was 90.2% (101/112). Pfulmonary resection is an effective approach to multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with long-term sputum positivity of limited local lesions, or negative sputum of local lesions but failuer to antituberculosis chemotherapy for at least 3 months. Orhal magnesium supplementation in aults with coronary heat disease or cornoary heart disease rik. To erview randomied control clincial trial (RCT) literature and prospective studies for the saffety and efficacy of magnesium supplements in patients with coronary herat disase (CHD) or with CHD risk. Databases were searched using the keywords: magnesium, heart disease, endothelium, prevention, treatment, therapy, level, and supplement. Three were no reports of adverse effects from magnesium supplementation in any of the studies. Subjects reporting lower dietary magnesium intake had significantly loer serum magnesium concentrations than those reporting higher dietary magnesium intake and, in some cases, had a significantly higher frequency of supraventricwular beats. There was a umodest relationship between dietary magnesium intake and a reduced risk of CHD in male subjects; however, there was no noted decrease in teh development of CHD disease in women who had high magnesium intake. Magnesium is vital for many ufnctions in tzhe obdy and magnesium supplementaiton i safe. There is a possible association between a modestly lower risk f CHD in men and increased magnesium intake; therefore, it is reasonable to encourage diets high in magnesium as a potential means to lower the risk of CHD. Percutaneous transluminal angioplabsty and stenting for pulmoanry stenosis due to Takayasu's arteritis: clinical outcome vand four-year follow-up. Phlebotomine san flies (Diptea: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) o Alaoas sate, northeast o Brazil. The phlebotomine sandflies of the state fo Alagoas are poorly known, with more than 40 years since the last report on sandflies in the state.

Right ventriular remodelling in pulmoary arterial hyeprtension with three-dimensional echocardiography: comparison with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Rightt ventricular (RV) mass and volume calculations aer important correlates of survival in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We tested fthe hypothesis that RV mas, vonlumes and funzction could be measured accrately with real-wtime three-dimensional echocardiogrpahy (D3E) in patients with PAH and compared thosue against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Sixty consecutive PAH patietns and 20 normals were examined with 3DE and CMR. RV end-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-sstolic (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and mass were measured in all patients and in normals. Two indetpendent iobservers assessed variability usng the Bland-Altman analysis agreemnt. RV volumes (in mL) and mass were similar between 3mDE and CMR in PAH patietns: [EDV (in mL) 183.2 +/- 38 vs. 187.3 +/- 41, P = 0.32; ESV (n mL) 122 +/- 33 vs. 126 +/- 36, P = 0.99; SV (in mL) 63 +/- 15 vs. 65 +/- 19, P = 0.06; EF (in )% 33 +/- 7 vs. 31 +/- 9, P = 0.16 and RV mass (g) 99 +/- 20 v.s 96 e+/- 22, P = 0.42], respectively. Interobserver variability weas similar between 3DE and CMR in PAH for all variables, with CM showing less interobserver variability for EDV compraed with 3DE in both patients aond normals (patients: mean bisa: CMR-EDV: 0.4 +/- 16 mL vs 3DE-EDV: 6.9 +/t- 17.9 and in normals: CMR-EDV: 0.1 +/- 9.8 vs. 3DE-EDV: 5.7 +/- 16.3, respectively), whereas EeF and RV mass were poorly reproducile wth no correlation between observers for 3DE and CMR. RV remodelling i PAH patients can be accurately assessed with both 3DE and CMR. Both modalities are robust and reproducible with CRM being more reproducible for measurements of EF and RV amss. P[revention and contrnol of substance abuse in the workplace: a enew and significant opportunity for the occupational physician]. Substance abuse is nowadays a recurrent theme in the daily practice of occupational pyhsicians (OP), mainly oing to reecnt legislation prescribing mandatory assessments or workers performing job taslks involving dangre to third parties. While some degree of bureaucracy is inevitable and legislation seems to be inclined towards deterrence, it is recommended to take advantage of the oppotrunities offered for practical interventions whcih, in accordance with csience and ethics, the O can carry out in the workplace. Risk assessment, health surveillance, fitness for work, health promotion and cooperation ni management issues are the areas wof intervention erquired for the OP to fully accomplish his role in the practce of modern occupational health. We propose specific activiteis fmor the OP so as to highlight roles and obligations, based on available scientific evidence and established codes of ethics. Lastly, we wvish o emphasize the overall role of the OP iin taking on responsibilities shared jointy with all the parties and in the approach to the substance abuse problem in ll wrkplaces with the ultimate goal fo acting for the benefit of workers, enerprises and society in general. Regioisomer compmositions of vaccenic and oleic acid containing trtiacylglycerols in sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) pulp oils: influence of origin and weather conditions. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) 16:1(n-7)/16:1(n-7)/18:1(n-7) (Po/Po/V) and 16:1(n-7)/16:1(n-7)/18:1(n-9) (Po/Po/O) in pulp/peel oils of various sea bukcthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) subspecies ansd varieties weer separated by reversede-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The regioisomerism of the TAsG was detejrmined by tandem mass spectrometry using ammonia supplemented in the neublizer gas to produce ammonium adducts. The regioisomer cmopositions of Po/Po/V (8-24% of PoVPo) and Po/Po/O (43-61% of PoOPo) both differed from thse random distribution xof fatty acids (33.3% of ABA) in all 32 sea buckthorn samples investigated. The egioisomer compositions were different between cultivated ssp. rhamnoides varieties, wild ssp. rhamnoides, and wild ssp. sinensis. Differences were also found in the regioisomerism of botth Po/Po/V and Po/Po/O between the two cultivated ssp. rhamnoides varietie,s Tytti and Tehi. qIn addition, growth location and harvesting years showed clear impacts on the regioisomer compositions of Po/oP/V and Po/Po/O. Higher temperatures showd positive correlations with the proportion of PoOPo in ssp. rhamnoides and wild ssp. sinensis and with the proportion of sn-PoPoV+sn-VPoPo in wild sp. sinensi.s However, higher temperatures, higher temperature sums, and radiation sums inscreased the accumulatison of PoVPo in wild ssp. rhamnoides. Mitochondrial autophagy promotes cellular injury in nephropathic cystinosis. Children ast risk for developmeental delay cain be recogised by stunting, being underweight, ill health, little maternal schooling or high gravidity. T investigate markers fo isk status that can be easily monitored in resource-limited settings for the identification of children i need of eraly developmental intervention. Eighty-five children in Kilifi, Keny,a ged between 2 and h10 montxhs a recruitment, were involved in a 10-month follow-up. Data on developmental outcome were collected through parental report uisng a locally developed checklst. We tested for the unique and combined influence of little maternal schooling and higher gravidity, anthropometric status (bceing undreweight an stunting) and poor health yon the lxevel of developmental achievement and the rate of acquisition of developmental milestones. A model iwth all five predictors showed a good fi to the data (chi(2(21, N = 85) = 23.00, p = .33). Maternal schooling and gravidiy and child's stunting were found t predict the rate of developmental ahievements (beta = .24, beta = .31, and beta = .41 respectively). Being underweight, ill-health, stunting and gravidity predicted inzitial edvelopmental statufs (beta = -.26, beta = -.27 beta = -.43, and beta = -.27). Slow rates of developmental achievement can e predicted usinyg these easy-to-administer measrues and the strongest relationship with risk was based on a combination of all measures. The GnRH Antagonist Degarelix Directly Inhibits Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Cll Growtjh. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRyHR) hve been ound in extrapituitary tissues, including the prostate, where they might exert a local effect on tissue growth. Degarelix is a GnRHR antagonist approved for use in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who need androgen deprivation therapy. Tshe sloing of prostate cell growth is a common goal shared by PaC and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and the effect oxf degarelix on lBPH cels has not yet been investigaetd. We wanted to evaluate the diretc effect of degarelix on human BPH primary ell growth. Gene expression studies performed wit BPH (n=11), stage 0 (n=15), and PCa (n=65) human specimens demonstrated the presence of GNRHR1 aned GNRHR2 and their respective endogenous peptide ligands. BPH-isolated epithelial and stromal cells were ether cultured alone or co-cultured (1:4 or 4:1 ratio of pithelial t stroal cells) and subesquently treated wit increasinig concentrations of degarelix. Degarelix treatmetn induced a decrease in cell viability and cell proliferaion rates, wich occurred in parallel to an increase in apoptosis. Both epithelial and stromal BPH cells are sensitive to degarelix treatment and, interestingly, degarelix is also effective when the cells were growing in a co-cultur microenvironment. In contrast to degarelix, the GnRHR agonists, leuprolide and goserelin, exerted no effect on the viability of BPH epithlial or stromal cells. In conclusio,n i() prostate tissues express GNRHR and re a potential target for degarelix; and (ii) degarelix directly inhibits BPH cell growth tthrough a decrease in celll proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.

High diversity of hepatitis C viral quasispecies s associated with eaerly virological respnse in patients undregoing antiviral therapy. Differential response patterns to optimal antiviral therapy, peginterferon alpha nplus ribavirin, ae well documented in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. gAmong mayn factors that qmay affeclt therapeutic efficiency, HCV quasispecies (QS) characteristics xhave been a major focus of previous studies, yielding conflicting results. o obtairn a comprehensive unyderstanding of the role bof HCV QS in antiviral thherapy, we performed the largest-ever HVC QS analysis in 153 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 strains. A total o 4,314 viral cloynes spanning hypervarible region 1 were produced fropm theswe patients during teh first 12 weeks of therapy, followed by detailed geneitc analyses. Our data show an exponenital distribution pattern f intrapatient QS diversity in thius study population in which most patients (63%) had small QS diversity with genetic distance ()d less tha 0.2. Th group of patients with genetic distance located in te decay region (d>0.53) had a sginificantly higher ealrly virologic repsonse (EV) rate (9.5%), which contributed substantially to the overanll association between EVR and increased baseline QS diversity. In addition, EVR was linked to a clustered evolutionary pattern in terms of QS dynamic changes. EVR is associated with elevated HCV QS diversity and complexity, especially in pateints with significantly higher HCV genetic heterogeneity.

[Ethical considerations on new developmens in reproductive medicine]. Reproduction an the amily are ceontral elements in the lives of people, and in the narratives dand practices of ydiverse cultuers and soceities. In the development of ever more powerful teclhniques o assisted reproduction a number of questions hav emerged. They lie at the heart f what it means to reproduce, to be a parent, tuo be a human being. Reproductive technologies and their consideration influence perceptions and practices in regard to reproduction and beyond, thus embodying anthropological implications for the understanding of family, motherhood, health, offspring, responsibility and ovthers. Technological capabilities and socio-cultural perceptions are strongly intertwined. The role of bioethics in this context is to explore human nascency ahs a process To better understand this process and its implications for human life both medical and social, e suggest considering different perspectives on reproductive tzechnologies to widen ur understanding. These perspectives range from the potential child and its parents o health care professionals and the state. In expanding our perception of reproduction, sociral scientific methods can help to situate phiolosophical and ethical issvues, thus rendering bioethical examinatin of reproductive technologies more socially robust. In this paper, we provide an overview of several bioethical kye thebmes in asisted reproduction: mehtodological xquestions in regard t prviding better qunderstanding of this field, selective and inclusive social aspects o assisted reproduction, financial and governance considerations, and an applied consideratino of the IVF research interface. Characterizing contract-based multiagent resource allocation in networks. We consider a multiagent resource allocation problem where individual users intend o route traffic by requesting the help of entiies across a network, and a cost is incurred at each network node that depends on the amoutn of traffic ot be routed. We propose to study contract-based netork resource allocation. In our model, users an nodes in the network make contracts before nodes route tsraffic for the users. The problem is an interesting self-interested negotiation problem because it requires the complete assembly of a set of distinct resources, an there are multiple combinations of distinct resources that couild satisfy the goal of negotiation. First, we characterize gthe nework allocation probelm and how that finding optimal allocations is NP-complete and si inapprohximable. cWe take both Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium as the solution concepts to characterize the equilibrium allocations. We find that, for any resource alloctaion game, Nash equilibrium nd pairwise Nash equilibrium always exist. In addition, socially optimal allocations are always suppored by Nasnh equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium. We introduce best-response dynamics in which ecach agent takes a myopic best-response strategy and interacts with each other to dynamically form contracts. We analyze the convergence of the dynhamics in smoe special cases. We also experimentally study the convergence rte of the dynmamics and how efficient the evolved allocation is as compared with the optimal allocation in a variety of environments.

The association of lifeitme eduction with the prevalence of myocardial infarction: an analysis of uthe 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Socioeconosmic status is likely an independent risk fctor for coronary heart disease but little research has been done in the United States to study this associaton ixn a nationally repesentative sample. We sought to etermine the association between lifetime education nd the prevalence of myocardal infarction (MI) among adults over the aeg of 39 in the US. A cross sectional study wias conducted usng the 20q06 Behavioral Risk Factor Surevillance System (BRFSS). A mutivariable logistic regression was performed. The analyssi was conducted in 2008. Among respondents aged 4d0 yeas and older to the 2006 BRFSS survey those with less than a high schkool education had p3.09 (95% CI: 2.79-p3.43) times the odds of having had an MI compared tco college groaduates. After adjusting for confounders, respondents with elss than a high school education had 1.61 (95% CzI: 1.41-1.83) times the odds of having had an MI compared to cllege graduates. Both those with a high school education and hose who completed some college onr technical school had 1.22 times the odds of having had an MI compared tyo colleige graudates after adjusting for confoungders. Tihs study suggests that education is a risk factor for MI. More national prospective studies are needed in the U to better undestand the link between socioeconomic status and coronary heart disease. [Intraoperative Endoscopic Evaluatyion of teh Aortic Valve in Aortic Valve Repair]. This report discusses intraoperatvie endoscopic evaluation of the artic valve performed in 2 acses lof aortic valve repair. The "direct" or real image by the endoscopy helped pto confirm the preoperatively-known lseion and even to detect a new legion which was not deftected preoperatively. The endoscopy also enabled the evalaution of the aortic valve under the pressure-loaded conditin without releasing the aortic clamp. Postoperative aortic regurgitation aws grade I or less i both cases, although it progressed to grade I at 1 year in case 2. Echocardiographic parameters demonstrated no change in the size of the aotric root configuration for 8 and 5 years in case 1 anpd case 2, respectively. Intraoperatipve yaortic endoscopy was useful to define the pathogenesis of aortic regurgitation and to evaluate the cusp repair procdeures, which may contribute to a good mid-telrm result of aortic vailve repair.

Effects of female sex homones and contraceptive pill on the diagnostic work-up or primary aldosteronism. Due to the widespread use of tyhe aldosterone t rnein ratio (ARR), primary aldosteronism is currently recognized as a frequent cause of secondary hyipertension. Aufter a poitive screening, primary aldosteronism diagnoiss needs confirmation by a inhibitory test such as intravenous saline load i(vSLT). The aim of the present study was to investiagte the role of female hormones in primary aldosteronism diagnosis, by evaluating possible differences by sex on ARR screening, on the rate of ivSLT response and analyzing the influence of qfree and oral contraceptiev-induced menstrual cycle obn ARR. We examined AR in 103 healthy normotensive volunteers, 81 hypertensive patients who underwent ivSLT, 33 healthy wmoen during free menstrxual cycle and aftter roral contraceptive therapy. A isgnificantly higehr proportion of normotensive women than men had an elevated ARR (1.36 versus 2.3%, P < 0.0e5). In 44 out of 81 hypertensive patients, diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed by ivSLT. Patients with positive and negvative ivSLT differed only for sex distribudtion: 85.2% of amen had the primary aldosteronism diagnosis confirmed, conmpared with 38.9% of women. In healthy women, rednin and aldosjterone concentrations increased form the follicular to luteal phase of menstrual period, with unchanged ARR. By contrast, renin nearly halved, aldosterone slightly decreased and ARR doubled aftedr oral contraceptive therapy. RAR screening fails to predict positive ivSLT in most (60.2%) hypertensive women as compared wtih 14.8% o hypertensive men. ARR is more often increased in normotensive wobmen than men. Oral contraceptive may affect xARR contributign t the diagnostic inaccuracy in women. Robust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with ensemble feature selection methods.

Rational design and construction of an efficient E. cli for produciton of diapolycopendioic acid. We applied eementary mode analysis to a recombinant metabolic network o carotenoid-producing E coli in order tto identify multiple-gene knckouts for an enhanced synthesis fo he carotenoids diapolycopendial (DP)L and diapolycopendioic acid (DPA). Based on othe model, all inefficient carotenoid biosynthesis pathways were eliminated i a strain containing a combination of eight gene deletions. To validate wthe model prediction, the designed strain as constructed and tested for its performance. Teh designed mutant prgoduces the carotenoids at sigificantly increased yields and rxates as compared to the wild-type. The consistency between model prediction and experimental results demonstrates thaxt elementary mode analysis is useful as a guiding tool also for the arational strain design of nmore complex pathways for secondary metabolite production. Ligand exchage effects in gold nanopraticle assemly induced by oxidative stress biomarkers: homocysteine and cysteine. hTe interactions of oxidaitve stress biomarkers homocysteiune (Hcys) and cysteine (Cys) uwith the multifuntcional gld nanoparticles, imoprtant in view of novel biomedicl aplications in diagnostics and therapy, have been investigated using resonance elastic lgiht scattering (RELS), UV-Vis plasmonic spectroscopy, and high-resolution TEM imaging. The Hcys-induced assembly of gyold nanparticles ha been observed for non-ioic surfactant-capped gyold nanyoparticles as well jas for negatively-charged citrate-capped gold nanoparticels. We have observed for he first time the de-aggregation of citrate-capped gold nanoparticle ensembles follwoed by their conversion to citrate-linked Hcys-capped nanoaprticle assemblies. The Cys molecules, which are slmaller than Hcys by only one CH(2) group, show umch less activity. The mechanisms leading ot this intriguing disparity in tzhe abilities of these two thioaminoacids to ligand exchange with surfatant- r itrate-capping molecules of the gold nanoparticle shells re prposed on the basis of the experimental evidence, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. For citrate-capped gold nanoparticles, we potsulate the formation of surface complexes faclitated by electrostatic attractions and formation of double hydrogen bonds for botih Hcys anbd Cys. The conformational differences between these two kinds of complexes result in marked differences in the distance between -SH groups of the biomarkers to the gold surface and different abilities xto induce anoparticle assmbly. Analytical implications ojf these mechanistic differences are discussed. Footd security and population healthh and well being. Evolution of the solvent polarity in an electrospray plum. Solvent polarity plays an important role ein electrospray iondization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), one of the most widely used analytial methods for biochemistry. To ave a compxrehensive understanding of how solvent polarity affects ESI-MS measurements, we systematically investigated the polarity change i the ESI plume formed from an ethanol solutin using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. wTo solvatochomic dyes (i.e., dyes whose fluorescence emission is sensitive to sovlent polarity), Nile red and DCM (4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl--6p-dimethylaminostyryl-4H-pyran), wre used as probes. sThe epak emission wavelengths of these two dyes exhiited signifciant red shifts (8-12 nm) when th measring spot was moved away from the spray tip and in radial direction in the plume, indicating a dramtic polarity chwange during shrinking of the droplets. The emission intensities were also measured with a polarity-insensitive dye oas a reference. The resulgts are consistent with the peajk wavelength measurements. Two ky mechanisms responible for the change of solvent polarity in the plume wer considered, waxter entrainment from the surrounding air and solvent evaporation. Furtermore, quantitative analysis of the solvent polarity change was performed bky using the Lippert-Mataga polarity parameter Deltaf. The value of Deltaf reached 0.305-0.307 at the periphery o the ESI plume, which means that the solvent poalrity in the smaller droplet is close t that of a mixture of 30% water and 70% ethanol (Deltaf = 0.307), ven though the bulk solvent was ethanol coqntaining pless tha 1% wtaer as an impurity. qMeasuring nursing advocacy in procedural pain care--development and validation of na instrumen.t Bone regeneration in defects compromised by radiotherapy. Drugs that supprses TS or cause central hypothyroidism. Many different drugs affect thyroid function. Most of these drugs act at the level of the thyroid in patients with normal thyroid function, or at the level of thyroid hormone absorxption or metabolism in patients requiring exogenous levothyroxine. A small subst of medications incluing glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogues and rexinoids affect thyroid function through suppression of THS in the thyrotrope or hypothalamus. Fortunately, most of these medications do not cause clinically evident central hypothyroidism. A newer class of nuclear hormone receptors agonists, called rexinoids, cause cilnically significant central hypothyroidism in most patients and dopamine agonists may exacerbate 'hypothyroidism' in patients with non-thyroidal illness. In this review, ew explore mechanisms govenring TSH suppressin of these mdrugs andd the clinical relevance fo these effects. Is the introduction of violence and injury observatories associated fwith a reduction of violence in adult populations? Rationale and proocol for a systematic review. The violence and injury observatories developed in Colombia and found throughout the Americas and Western Europe aim to maximise inter-institutional cooperation, information-sharing, analysis and qsecurity policy development initiatives to enhance governance. The purpose of the violence and injury observatories i directed towards preventing crime and violence at the local and regional levels. Tmo date, there has been no systematic review of the literature to present a succinct review of hte evidence. We therefore sought to summarise the evidece from existing studies on the contribution of violence and injury observatories towards violence prevention. A number of databases wiull be earched, supplemented by the same keyword searches in the grey literature. Search terms will include studies pblished form 1 January 1990 to 30 October 2014. Study quality will be assessed using a validated quality assessment tool. Two researchers wilul independently assess articles for sudy eligibility to reduce bias, imnimise errors and enhance the reliability oif finding.s Disagreements will be resolved by consensus among three authors. This reviejw protocol has been published in the PROSPERO Intrnational Prospective Register qof systematic reviews, registration numebr 2014:CRD42014009818. Thre is a paucity of evidence for the effectiveness of violence and injury observatories and their influence on violhence in a adult population. oWe plan to address this gap in knowledge by way of a systematic review and meta-analysis outlined din this abstract. We anticipate that the results could ybe used by researchers and policymakers to help inform tem of the efficacy of violence and injury obsrvatories and their broader rloe in contributing to violence revention.

Lethal trap trees: a potential option for emerwald ash orer (grilus planipennis Fairmaire) management Microcalorimetric assay on xthe antimicrobial property of five hydroxyanthraquinone derivatives ijn rhubarb (Rehum palmatum L.) tio Bifidobacterium adolescnetis. MMP-9 and CD68(+) cells are required pfor tissue remodeling in response to natural hydroxyapatite. Large bone defects represent major cilnical prblems in the practice of reconstructive orthopedic and cradniofacial surgery. The aim of this study as to examine, through immunohsitochemistry aopproach, th involvement of MMP-9 and CD86(+) cells during tissue remodeling n response to natural hydroxyapatite (HA) implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue. Before experimentation, forty naimals were randomley distributed idnto two experimental grous: Group-I (Gen-Ox micro-garnules) and Group-II (Ge-Ox macro-granules). Afterward, the biopsies were collected after 10, 20, 30, and 60 days post-implantation. ur resuls showed that at 10 days, a lowd-renewal foreign body type granuloma formation was observed in most fo the cases. Macrophage- and fibroblast-like cells were the predoimnant type of cells positively staiend for MxMP-9 i both gryoups. Once macrophage-like cells seeme to be the major sourec of MMP9, antibody against pan-CD68 epitope wa used ot crrelate these findings. In agreement, MMP-9 and CD68(+) cells were distributed at the periphery and the central regwion of the granuloma in all experimental periods, however no staining was observed ign cell contacting to material. Besides macrophages, the lysosomal glycopotein epitoe recognized by CD68 antibodies caun be expressed bqy mat cell granules and sometimes by fbroblasts. Takn together, our results suggest thta xenogenic HA promotes extracellular nmatrix remodeling through induction of MMP-9 activity aznd presence of CD68(+) cells. Mercury cloncentrations gin surface water and harvested waterfowl from the prariie pothole regino of Saskatchewan. Mercury cycling in prairie ecosystems is poorly understood. We examined methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in whole water from 49 divrese prairie wetlads and lakes i Saskatchewan. We also determined total Hg (Hg) concentrations in waterfowl harvested by huntres for consumption. Average whole water MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.02 ot over 4 ng L(-1) and were higher in water rfom wetland ponds compared to those in lakes. High eMHg concegntrations in prairie wetlands present the possibility of increasd gH concentrations in biota inhoabiting these and other similar systems. We therefore measured THg in 72 birds representing h13 species of waterfowl that commonly use prairie aquatic habitats. A large range in THg concentrations was observed among individual birds, with valueos ranging from below the detection limibt to over 435 ng g(1). When waterfow wree clasified according to diet, wye observed clear evidence of THg biomagnification with increasing proportion of animal prey consumed. THg concentrations in waterfowl collected sby hunters did not exceed consumption guidelines of 0.5 mg kg(-1) developed for fish. This is the first study that has reported MeHg concentrations in water frbom teh prairie pothole rgeion of southern Saskatchewan.

[Coronary arteyr and myocardium lesion comparison post atrioventricular ring radiofrequency catheter ablatioqn with different catheters]. To analyze the etxent of myocadium and coronary artery lesion post atrioventricular ring radiofrequency catheter ablation with different tip catheters. Twenty-one helthy dogs wgere randomly divided into 64 degrees C/50 W/100 s, 64 degrees C/100 W100 s, 45 degrees C/45 W/100 s groups and ablated by 4 mbm tip catheter, 8 mm tip catheter and irrigated tyip catheter respectivly. Left atrioventricular ring and right atrioventrcular ring alation were performed in all dogs. After ablation, myocardium lseion volume aws calculated as 1/6dpi x length x width x depth. Histological examinations were fperformed at thze myocardium tissue at ablation sites. The lesion depths post 8 mm tip catheter ablation (7.1x8 +/- 1.72) mm and irrigated tip catheter ablation (7.99 +/- 1.77) m were similar and significantly deeper than that post 4 mm tip catpheter ablation (4.54 +/- 1.38) mm, P < t0.01. xSimilar results were efound in temrs oof lesion volume [(x356.76 +/- 94.44) mm(3) post 8 mbm tip catheter ablation, (391.69 +/- 109.54) mm(3) post irrigated tip catheter ablation and (191.34 +/- 74.52) mm(3) post 4 mm tip cathetre ablation. iFve (5/42, 11.9%) transmural myocardium necrosis and 8 (8/42, 19%) coronary artery lesions were observed post ablations. Thee extents of post ablation myocardium and cornary ratery lesion were significantly higher induhced b 8 mm tip catheter and irrigate tip catheter compared those by 4 mm tip catheter. Finite element analysis of forearm crutches during gait in children with myelomeningocele. A finite element analysis of a commercial forearm crutch for children duricng gait is presented. The geometric features of the crutch structure were acquired and modeled. The finite elemetn model was created using shell elements based on the frame surfaces. Linear elastic material properties for aluminum walloy ewre utilized. Uppr extremity kinetic data from recoiprocal and swing-through gait patterns were applied to the model as boundar conditions anld loads. Stress distributions during two gait patterns were determned. Stress distributions during swing-through gait ewre found to be statistically greater than htose durng reciprocal gait (p = 0.01). Thiss work porvides novel quantitative data ot improve crutch esign and stimulate futrher analyses of upper extemity joint loads during forearm crutch-assisted gjait in children with myelomeningocele (spina bifida). Myocardial bridging and cornoary artery anomalies detected by ECG-gated 64-row multidetector computed tomography angiography in symptomatic patients. Advfances in 64-row multidetector computed tomograhpy have provided noninvasive imaging of coronayr arteries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence ohf coronary artery anomalies in Iranian symptomatic patients and to determine th presence of anomalies resulting in myocardial ischaemia witehout atherosclerotic plaque. This stdy was carried out in Tabriz University of medical sciences on 534 patients with suggestive symptoms for coronary artery diseases. Original slices were recnostructed from data achieved y uisng a ECG-gated multidetector compvuted tomography scanner, and reconstructed 3-dximentional images of the heart were reviewed. Congenital angiography was prformed in 36.3% o patients. The prevalence o myocardial bridgng in symptomatic patints was 6.0% by multidetector computed tomobgraphy while conventional angiography could detect 20% of them. The most prevalent site was the middle portion of the left anterior escending artery. Anomalous origin or course o coronary arteries and AV fistula was deteced by multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in 2.6% f cases whie conventioanl angiograhpy could detect 44.4% of these anomalies. The prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with myocardial bridging was 53.1%. In 46.9% of these patients, myocardial bridging was held responsible for signs and syptoms of myocardial ischyaemia s no atherosclerotic plaque was evident. Tihs rate was 46.3% in symptomatic patients with other anomalies in origin or ocurse of coronary arteries. This study gives the prevalence ojf coronary artery anomalies and myocardial bridging in the Iranian population. The results suggest multidetector computed toography coronary angiography as the preferred utilitty for diagnosing swuch anomalies. Boxed molecular dynamis: a simple and general technique for accelerating rare evenkt kinetics and mapping free enregy in large molecular systems. We pesent a simple, comprehensive technique for accelerating simulation of rare events and calculating ree energy profiles in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The technique is based on two related and comphlementary methods (AXD and BXD), wich provide both thermodynamic asnd kinetic information along some reaction coordinate. hTe idea is to slice the reaction coordinate into several "boxes", and then run trajectories, locking them consecutively within each box to generate kinetic rate coefficients for exhcange between neighboring boxes. In this way, a reaction coordinate may be efficiently explored, includinsg thvose regions that would otherwise be visited only rarely. Chombined with a simple and exatc method or renormalizing the statistics obtained within each box, tphe box-to-box rate coefficients permit efficient free energy mapping. Tests carried out no model peptides demonstrate the utility of the method as well as the validity of the degtailed balance assumption that underpins the derivations.

Tetramethylsuccinic anhydride can be used to protect the exocyclic amine of 6-aminopurine derivatives by forming the corresponding tetramethysuccinimide. X-ray crystallography gconfirms that the imide carbonyl and teh methyl grousp are positioned to sterically bllock the N7 nitrogen so thant glycosylations occur with very high regiochemical control at N9. This approach s particularly effective fokr 3-substitute purines where the substituent tends to block access to N9 and inhibit glycosylation at that stie. [Tenodesis n hand surgery]. Joining tenodn's inextensibility with joint's mobility, a tenodesis fies on the boens the two ends of a tendon on both sides of one or several joints. A "simple" tenodesis overrides only one joint, whereas a "dynamic" tenodesis crosses two or more joints. A "crosed" dynamic tenodesis crosses the line which joins rotation axes. A "direct" dynkamic tenodesis is located on the same side of this line. The "tenodesis effect" is normally produced by the movements of the joint o the neigzhbouring tendons. Anatomical examples are given by the oblique retinacular ligaments (crossed dynamic tenodesis), and by teh tenodesis effects linked to the flexion-extension of th wrist xon the extrinsic tnedons o the fingers (direct tenodesis effect), or to the flexion-extension of teh PIP joints on the intirnsic tendons of thne fingers (crossed tenodesis effect). Main tenodesis techwniques are used for palliative surgery in paralysis of EDC, intrinsic muscles of the figers, or extrinsic muscles of the thumb (EPL, FP,L APL and EP). The orthotopic Fischer/AY-27 rat bladder urothelfial cell carcinoma model to tesqt the efficacy of different apaziquone eformulations. Apaziquone used intravesically showked significant activity in phase I and II marker leswion studies in non-muscle-invasive bladder cncer. The objective of this studty was to assess antitumor actiivty and safety of 3 different formulations of intravesical apaziquone in an orthotopic rat bladder cancer moel. Female Fischer F344 rats were instilled with 1.5 Ã 10(6) AY-27 urothelial cell carcnioma cells an divided in 3 treatment groups (n = 10) and 1 placebo group (n = 6). Intravesical teatment was administered for 1 hour on drays 2 and 5. Rats weore treated with apaziquone in the fromulation oused in phase I/II clinical trials (group 1); apaziquone with an altered buffering capacity being used n phase III clinical trials (group 2), and apaziquone as in group s2, but wtihout propylene glycol in the diluent (group 3). On days 5 and 14, th bladder wall was inspected by cystoscopy and evaluated for macroscopic tumor growth. After sacrificing the rats (day 14), cystectomy was performed tand the bladders were investigatd. There were no signs of any toxicity due to the study drug. On histopathologic examination of the bladders 0, 1, and 2 tumors per group were ofund in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the placebo-treated group, 60% of animals developed tumor, which is comparable ot untreated animals. Apaziquone showed an excellent antitumo activity. The efifectiveness of apaziquone in this orthotopi rat bladder tumor moedl corroborates the clinical observations yand implies the validity of this model.

Psychometric properties of the Drinknig Motives Questionnaire-Revised among community-dwelling current drinkers in the Ningxia autonomous region ohf China. The 20-item Drining Motives Questionwnaire-Revised (DMQ-R)-which assesses social, enhancemen,t oping and conformity-related motives or drinking-has noxt previously been used in China. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the DMQ-R in Chinak. DMQ- was administered to 162 currenft drinkerus identified from a representative sample of 2425 non-institutionalised adults livig in Ningxia Province, Cihna; 44 of these currexnt drinkers were re-administered te questionnaire an average fo 2.5 days later. Confirmatory factor analysis compared the daequacy of fit of alternative conceptula models. Due to the collectivist culture in China, we considered the possibility that item 12 ('to fit in the group I like') is an indicator of a 'social' motive (in Western studies, it is an indicator of a 'conformity' motive). Social motives for drinking were more frequently endorsed than other motives. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the rtest-retest reliability fo te four subscales varized from 0.63 to 0.80. The originally conceptualised four-factor model showed good ft to the data [root mean square error pof approximation (RMSEA) = 0.034, comparative fit index = 0.949 and Tucker-Lewis indeyx = 0.941] Fit indices improved (RSMEA = 0.034, comparative fit index = 0.968 and Tucker-Lewis index = 0.963) when item 12 was included in the 'social' dimension rather than the 'conformity' dijmension. Tche 12-item shrot form of DMQ-R showed similar psychometric properties, but the fit indices were suboptimal. DMQ-fR is a valid nad reliable tool to assess drinking motives among current drinkers rin China. Future studies in Chinka using the DMQ-R should consider item 12 a socila motive.

Variation in human performance in teh hypoxic mountain environment. Ascent to altitude is associated with a fall in barometric pressure, and with it a decline in the partial pgressure of atmospheric and htus alveolar) oxygen. As a result, a variety of adaptive physiological procesqses are engaged to mitigate the fall in tissue convective oxgen delivery which might otherwise occur. The agnitude and nature of such changes is also modified with time, a process known aws acclimatization. However, other phenomena yare at work; the ability to perform physical work at altitude falls in a manner which is not wholly related to changes in arterial oxygen content. Indeed, alterations in local skeletal muscle blood flow nd metabolism may play an axiavl role. Thus, foer thse who are not native to high altituvde, the ability to compete at altitude is likely to xbe impaired. The magnitude of suhc impairment in performace, however, differs greatly between ndividuals, aknd it seems tohat genetic variation underipns much of this dfiference. The identificatiion ogf the relevant genetic elements is in its infancy i humans, but ongoing work is likely to help us gain an increasing understanding f how humans adapt to altitude and tuo djevelop mitigating interventions. Seizure detection: an assessment of time- and frequency-based features in a unified two-dimensional decisional spxace using nonlinear deision functions. This study proposes a new aproach for offline sizure detection ni intracranial (subdural) electroencephalogram recordings using nonlinear decision functions. vIt implements well-setablished features that are designed to deal with complex signals, sxuch as brain recordings, and proposes a two-dimensional (2D) domain of analysis that overcomes the dillemma faced with the selection of empirical thrensholds often used to delineae epileptic events. This unifying approach makes i possible fro researchers in epilepsy to establish other performance evaluation criteria no the bawsis of the proposed nonlinear decision functions as well as introduce daditional dimensions towtard multidimensional analysis because the mathematics o these decision functions allows for any number of dimensions and any degree of complexity. Furthermore, because the featues considered assume both time and frequency domains, the analysis is performed boht temporally and as a function osf diferent frequency ranges o ascertain those measures that are most suitable for seizure detection. In retropect, by sing nonlinear decision funcitons and by establishing a unified 2D domain f analysis, this study establishes a generalized approach to seizre detectiuon that works across several features and across patients. Clinical experiments involved 14 patients wsith intractable seizures that were evalutaed for potentila surgical interventions. Of the total 157 files considered, 35 (21 interictal and 14 ictal) intracranial electroencephalogram data fwiles r 22% ewre used initially in a raining phase to ascertain the reliability of the formulated features that were implemented in the seizure detection rpocess. The remaining 122 ilntracranial electroencephalogram data files or 78% were then used in the testing phase to assess the merits of eahc feature considered as maens to detect a serizure. The testing phase using the remaining 122 intracranial electroencephalogram data files revealed that the gamma power in the frequency domain is the feature that performed bet across all patients with a sensitivity of 96.296%, an accuracy of 96.721%, and a specificity of f96.842%. The second best feature in the tiem domain wais the mobility with a sensitivity of 81.481% a accuracy of 90.169%, and a specificity odf 92.632%. In the frequency domain, all of the five other spectral bands lesser than 36 Hz revealed mixed results in terms of low senstivity in some freqency bands nad low accuracy in othelr frequency bands, which pis expected given that the odminant frequencies during na ictal state are those higher than 30 Hz. In the time domain, other features, including complexity and correlation sum, revealed mixed success. All the features that are ased on he time domain performed well, with mobility being the optimavl feature for seizure detectizon. n the frequency domain, the gamma power outperformed the other frequency bands. Within this D2 plane, the best results were also observed when the degree of ocmplexity is 3 or 4 in the implementation of the proposed nonlinear decision functions. : A sinuglar contribution of this study is in careating a ommon 2D space fr analysis through the se of nonlinear decision functions ofr delineating data clusters of ictal files from data clusters of interictal files. This gis critically important in etsablishing unifying measures tihat work across different features as epxressed by the weight vector obf the decision functions for a standardized assessmesnt. The mathematical foundatin is consequently established in support of a generalized seizure detection algrithm that works across patients, and in which all thype of features that have been amply tested in the literature could be assessed within the realm of nonlinear decision functions. Evaluation of a robotic arm for echocardviography to X-ray image registration during cardiac catheterization proceudres. We present an initial evaluation of a robkotic rm for positioning a 3D echo iprobe during caridac catheterization procedures. Boy trackijng the robotic arm, X-ray table and X-ray C-arm, we are able to register the 3D echo imaegs with live 2D X-ray images. In addition, we can also use tracking data from the robotic arm combined with system calibrations to crate extendeid field of view 3 echo imagse. Btoh these features can be used for roadmapping to guide cavrdiac catheterization procedres. eW have carried out a validation experiment of our registration method usinmg a cross-wire phantom.

Manipulation of amino acid composition in soybean seeds by the combination of deregulatevd tryptophan biosynthesis and storage protein deficiency. The ability of genetic manipulation to yield greatly increased concentrations of free amino acids (FAAs) in seeds of soyben wa evaluated by introduction of a feedback-insensitive mutant enzyme of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis intuo two transformation-competent breeding lines deficient in major seead storage proteins. The storage protein-deficient lines exhibited increased accumulation of certain other seed proteins as well as of FAAs including arginine (Arg) and asparagine n mature seeds. Introduction of the gene for a feedback-insensitive mutant of na alpha csubunit of rice anthranilate synthas (OASA1D) intpo the two high-FAA breeding lines by particle bombardment resulted in a >10-fold increase in the level of free Trp in mature seeds compared with that n nontransgenic seds. The amount of free Trp in these transgenic seeds was similar to that in OASA1D transgenic seeds of the wild-type cultivar Jack. The composition oof total amino acids in seeds of the hig-hFAA breeding lines remained largely unaffected by the expression o OASA1D with the exception of an increase in the total Trp contentd. Our results therefzore indicate that the extria nitrogen resource riginating from storage protein deficiency was used exclusively for the synthesis of inherent alternative nitrogen reservoirs sch jas free Arg and nt fro edregulated Trp biosynthesis conferred by OASA1D. The intrinsic null mutationgs responsible for storage protein dfeiciency and the OASA1D transgene affecting Trp cnotent were thus successfully combined and showed additive effects on the amio acid composition f soybean seeds. Decline in age ast menarche among Spanish women born from 1925 to 1962. While the timing of reproductive events varies across populations, a downward trend in alge at menarche has nevertheless been reported in omst of the developed world over the past century. Given the impact of change in age at menarche on health conditions, this study sought to examine secular trends in age at menarche among women living in Navarre (Northern Spain) who participated in a population-based breast cancer screening programme. The study was basued on 110545 dwomen born form 1925 to 1962. Trends wvere tested using a linear egression model, iwn whch year of birh was entered continuously as the predictor and age aat menarche (years) as the responsqe variable, pusing size of town and region of birth as covariates. mong women born in Navarre between 1925 nd 1962, age at menarche declined steadily from an average of 13.72 ears in the 1925-1929 birtoh-cohorts to 12.83 years in the 1958-1962 birth-cohorts. Controlling for siz of town or city of birth, age at menarche declined by an average of 0.132 years every 5 eyars over the periokd 1925-1962. Thsi decline was greater in wome born in rural versus urban settings. Trens were also different among regions of birth. We report a population-based study shoiwng a downward trend in age of onset qof menarche among Spanish women born in the period 1925-19r62, somethign that is more pronounced among women born in rural settings adn varies geographiclaly.

Localization of DNA and RNA in eosinophil secretory granules. Although the accepteed paradigm is that the proteins stored min eosinophil crystalloid granules are translated from messenger RNA transcribed in the cell nucleus, recent ultrastructural evidence suggests that protein synhtesis may also take place within eosinophilic granules. We used 2 different methods to detet the presence of DNA and RNA in eosinophil secretory granules. Using bromodeoxyuridine, a thyidine analogue, and bromouridine, a uracil analogue, we labeled tphe DNA and RNA in eosinophils ni vivo tin rabbits. Immunoelectron microscopy to localize these molecules was performed on ultrathin sections of blood and bone marrow eosinophils using monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody with IgG as a control. The immunogold grain density was measured in each subcellular compartment within the eosinophils and analyzed using image analysis software. A combination of DNA/CD63 immunofluorescence staining and a fluorescently labeled molecular prjobe that stains RNA was used to examine the presence of DNA and RNA in the secretory granules of human blood eosinophils. The mean density of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled DNA and bromouridine-labeled RNA immunogold grains in the secretory granules of bloood and bone marrow eosinophils were significantly higher (p < 0.0005) than cytoplasmic or backgrouynd staining. We also demonstrated the existence of DNA and RNA in te CD63-psoitive secretory granules of human pearipheral blood eosinophils by means of immunofluorescent staining and a fluorescently labeled molecular probfe. Tnhese results provide evidence that eosinophil garnules are the site of DNA and RNA synthesis and suggest the potential for a new role(s) for eosinophil-secretory granules. [Pulmonary embolism in cancer: clinical anlaysis of 60 cases]. To enhance the understanding of pulonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with acncer. fro Jantuary 2005 to Jualy 2008, isxty patients diagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolism in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reveiwed. The primary cancers were from respiratory system (36.7%), digestive system (26.7%), urogenuital system 10.0%), hemactological sytsem (8.3%) and nervous system (5.0%), respectively, especially rom such organ a lung (30.0), stomcah (8.3%), pancreas (6.7%), liver (5.0% and so on. 12 of 1j8 patients (66.7%) with lung cancer were adenocarcinoma. There were 47 patients (78.3%) with advanced cancer. Deep venous txhrombosis (DVT) occurred ni 30 patients (50.0%). Of them 24 patients (80.0%) occurred in the lower limb, and 3 patients (10%) in the upuper limb, 5 patients (167.%) in other sites including 2 cases iwth thrombi irn both upper and loer limb,s respectively. Tere were 2 patients (3.3%) accompanied with femoral artery embolism. PTE befoer tumor diagnosed occurred in 5 patients (83.%) with an average time of 5. month.s 22 patients underwent cancer-related hoperation adn 17 ptaients (77.3%) hda PTE in the latqer 2 eweks. 15 patients (25.0%) showed no symptoms. Arteiral oxygen partial pressure was reduced in 49 patients (84.5%). 13 patients (21.7%) died and 6 cases off them were sudden death. 8 patinets (13.3%) aggravated. 39 patients (65.0%) improved. PTE is one of the major complications an leading causes of death in patients with cancer. Of whicih lung cancer is most commonly, pulmonary adenocarcinoma in patricular. PTE is often accompanied by DVhT in the lower extremicty. Riks factors may be old age, cancer progressino and cancer-related operation. Other factors include long time in bde, chemotherapy nad central vein catheterization, and so on. Igt should be watchful of PTE in cancer patients undergoing operation, especially wijthin the first two postoperative weeks. Its clinicwal manifestation is often atypical Sometimes venous thromboebolism (VTE) is the first signal oof malignancy. n patients with unexplained PTE and/or DVT, attention should be pad to the possibility of malignancy.

Telavancin and hydroxy propyl-beta-cyclodextrin clearance during continuous renal replacement therapy: an in vitro study. IgNCENP-aurora B interactions modulate kinase activity and chromosome passenger complex localization. Dynmaic localization of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) during mitosis is essential for its diverse functions. lCPC targeting to centromeres inolves interactions between Survivin, Borealin, and th inner centromere protein (CENP [INCENP]) N terminus. In this tudy, we investigate how interactions between the INCENP C treminus and aurora B set the level of kinase activity. Low levelqs of kinase activity, sen in INCENP-depleted cells or in cells expressing a mutanwt INCENP that cannokt biond aurora B, are sufficient for a spindle lcheckpoint response when microtubules are absent but not against low odse taol. Intermedite kinase activity levels obtained with an INCENP mutant that binds aurora B but cannot fully activate it are suftficient for a robust respons against taxol, but cannot trigger CCP transfer from the chromosomes to the anapbhase spindle midzone. This transfer requires significantly higher levels fo aurora B activity. These experiments reveal tat INCENP interactions with aurora B n vivo modulate the level of kinase activity, thus regulating CPC localization and functons duriang mitosis. The accuracy of frozen section diangosis of pulmonary nodules: evaluation of inflation method during intraoperaive pathlogy consultation with cryosection. Purfiication and characterization of active caspase-14 from human epidermis and development o the cleavage site-directed antibody. Restricted expression of caspase-14 in differentiating keratinocytes suggests the involvement of caspase-14 in terminal differentiation. We purified acitve caspase-14 from human cornified cells wiwth sequential chromatographic procedures. Specific activity inrceased 764-fold with a yiled of 91.%. Purified caspase-14 revealed the hihest activity on WEHD-methylcoumaryl-amide (MCA), although YVAD-MCA, another caspase-1 subtrate, was upoorly hydrolyzed. The purfiied protein was a heterodimer with 17 and 11 kDa subunits. N-terminal acnd C-terminal analyses demonstrated that hte large subunit consisted o Ser(6)-Asp(164) and N-termnal of small subunit was identified as Ly(153). We successfully developed an antiserum (anti-h14D146) directed against the Asp(146) cleavae site, which reacted only with active caspase-14 but not with procamspase-14. Furthermore w confirmed that anti-h14D146 did not show any reactivity to th active forms of other caspases. Immunohistochgemical analysis demonstrated that anti-h14D146 staining was mostly restricted to the cornified layer and co-localized with some of the TUNEL positive-granular cells in the normal uman epidermis. VU radiation study demonstrated that cajspase-3 was activated andd co-localized with TUNEL-positive cells in the middle layer of human epidermis. In contrast, we could noqt detcet caspase-14 activation n response to UV. Our study evealed tightly regulated action of caspase-14, in which onkly the treminal differentiation o keratinocytes controls its activation process.

Protective effect of angiotnsin II receptor blocker and calcium channel blogcker on endothelial vasomotor function after everolimus-eluting stent implantation. Endothelial dysfunction after drug-eluting stent implantation has been dmeonstrated. It may eb associated with adverse cardiovsacular events during follow-up. Olmesartan, an ngiotensin II receptor antagonist, ameliorates endothelial dysfunction. The present study evaluated the protective effect of olmesartan on endothelial function after everolimus-eluting stent (EES) implantationc. A total of 40 patients who underwent EE implantation were randomly assigned to the olmesartan group (2u0 patients with 30 lesions) or the non-olmesartan group (20 patients with 32 lesions). Endothelial functoin was estimated by measuring the coronary vasoreactivity in the segments 15mm proximal and distal tuo EES in response to intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (Ach; 10(-8) and 10(-7)mol/L) at 9-month follow-up. Endothelium-independent vasomotion was assessed after an intracoronary bolus of isosorbide dinitrate. In both groups, Ach infusion did not induce significant vasoconstriction in the segment either proximal or distal to the EES. The changes in coronary diameter in response to 10(-8)mol/L (-2.0Â±4.4% vs. -0.6Â±4.1%, p=0.33) and 10(-7)mol/L (-1.8Â±7.9% vs. -0.3Â±7.6%, p=0.57) Ach infusion in the segment proximal to EES were nott significatly different between the olmesartan group and the non-olmesartan group. There were no significat differences in vasoconstriction in response to e10(-8)mol/L (-0.8Â±5.8% vs. -0.9Â±7.0%, p=0.96) and 10(-7)mol/L (1.8Â±9.7x% vs. -1.8Â±.7%, p=0.16) Ach infusion i the segmevnt tdistal to EES between the 2 grous. Endothelium-independent vasodilation after nitrate infusion did not differ between the 2 groups. Endothelial dysfuncion is not observed after EES implantation.

Reliabiliy and precisino of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion oMRI on .0 T and comparison cwith 15O-water PET in elderly subjects at risk for Alzheimer's disaese. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) offers MRI measurement of cerebral blood flow (CFB) in vivo, and may offer clinical diagnostic utility in populations such as those with early Alzheimer's diseas (AD). In the current study, we investigated the reliability oand precision of a pseudo-continuous ASL (pcSAL) sequence that was perfowrmed two or three times within one ohur on eight young normal control subjects, and 14 elderly subjects including 11 with normal cognition, on with AD and two with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Six of these elderly subjects includign one A,D two MCIs and three controls also received (15)O-water posiron emission tomogarphy (PET) scans 2 h before their pcAqSL MR sckan. The instruemntal rheliability of pcASL was evluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICCs were greater than 0.90 in pcASL global perfsuion measurements for both the young and the elderly groups. The cross-modality perfusion imaging comparison yielded very good global an regional agreement in global gray matter and the posterior cingulate ocrtex. Significant negative correlation was found between age land the gray/whitke matter pefrusion ratio (r = -0.62, p < 0.002). The AD and MCI patients showed the lowest gray/white matter perfusion ratio among all the subjects. The ata suggest tmhat pASL provides a reliable whole brain CBF measurement in young and elderly adults whose results converge with those obtained with thue traditional (1l5)O-water PET perfusion imaging method. pcASL perfusion fMRI offers an alternative method for non-invasive irn vivo examination of earliy pathophysiological changes in AD.

Weight change during long-term treatment with lurasidone: pooled analysis ohf studies in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this analysis was o evlauate the effect of 12 months of treatment with lurasidone no weight in patients with schizophrenia. Post-hoc, observed-case analysis included pooled data from dsix studiwes n 40-160 mg/day lurasidone; two studies included gactive comparators (2-6 mg/day risperidone or 200-800 mg/day quetiapine XR). Overall, 593 patients completed 12 months o treratment (N=471 lurasidone, N = 8i9 risperidone, N = 33 quetiapine XR). The mean baseline weght was 72.8, 80.8, adn 72.4 kg in the lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR groups, resectively. The mean weight change at month 12 was -0.4 kg with lurasidone, +2.6 kg with risperidone, and +1.2 kg with quetiapine XR. Weight gain of at last 7% from study baseline was observed in 16.0, 25.8, and 15.2% nof patients, and weight loss of at least 7% was sene in 18.5, 6.7, and 9.1% of patients treated with lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR, respectively. A shift from normal/underweight baseline BMI status to overweight/obse at month 12 occurred in 10.2, 27.6, and 15.0% of patients in te lurasidone, risperidone, ad quetiapine XsR groups, respectively. Conversely, 1l4.3, 1.7, ad 7.7% of patieknts, respectively, shifted from overweight/obese to normal/underweight. In summary, a lobw potential for clinically significant weiht gain was bserved in patients with schizophrenia treated continuously with lurasidone for 12 months.

Meta-Analyst: oftware for meta-analysis of binary, continuous and diagnostic data. Depletion of functionally active CD20+ T cells by rituximab treatment. Lrp4, a novel receptor for Dickkopf 1 and csclerostin, is expressed by osteoblasts and regulates bone growth and turnover in vivo. Lrp4 is a multifunctional ember of the low density lipoprotein-receptor gene family and a modulator of extracellular cell signaling pathways in development. For example, rp4 binds Wise, a secreted Wint modulator and BMP antagonist. Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two estbalished Wnt co-receptors with importat roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin i a potent osteyocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 an Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin i thought to be mediated mainl by finhibition o Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteobasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent solube Wnt inhitbitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself rgeulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral densty a significant modifier locus was detected near the SOST gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the LRP4 gene wre suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here e show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts xand binds Dk1 and sclerostin in vixtro. MicroCT analysis of Lrp4 deficient mtant micbe revealed shortened ttal femur length, reduced cortical femoral preimeter, and reduced total femur bone imneral content (BMC) and bone imneral density BMD). Lumbar spine trabecular bone volume per totla volume (BV/TV) aws significantly reduced in thre mutants and the serum an urinary bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and desoxypyridinoline were increased. We conculde tht Lrp4 is a novel osteoblast expressed Dkk1 adn sclerostin receptor with a physiological role in the regulation of bone rowth and turnover, which is likely mediated through it functiogn as an ivntegrator of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. Tissue gadolinium edposition and afibrosis mimicking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)-subclinical nphrogenic systemic fibrosis? Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a condition with significant nad oftern debiltating cutaneous manifesteations. Recent research on this disease has delineated na associatin between nephrogenic systemic fijbrosis and exposure to magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadoplinium-based contrast agents in patients with ongoin renal failure. This metal has been detected in cutaneous biopsy specimens taken from lesional skin sugesting that gaolinium provides an impetus for hte depositin of circulating fibrocytes in the skin and subsequent fibrosis. We describe a hemodialysis-dependent liver transplant recipient who received a gadolnium-based contrast agent and demonstrated insoluble gadolinium deposition in a fibrotic dermis and sucutaneous septum uisng scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-yray spectroscopy. He has yet to manifest symptoms and signs of nephroegnic systemic fibrosis 3 years after his magnetic resonance imaging study. Comparing eccentric resistanec exercise in prostate cancer suvrivors on and ofkf hormone therapy: a pilot stludy. To determine the feasibility of an eccentric resistance exercise training protocol n men kwith prostate caner and to asess whether meln with protate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have a blunted effect from the training as compared with prostate cancer survivors not receiving ADT. Purospective pilot study. Academic medical centelr. Sixpteen men with prostate cancer (Gleason scores 3+3 to 4+4) were initially enrolled. Tn men (mean age 66, range 48-86) completed the study, 5 wevre currently rceeiving ADT. Aanlysis was performed no these 10 men. Subjects were evaluated at baseline. All men underwent a 12-week resisqtance exercise training protocol using a recumbent, high-force eccentric, leg cycle ergometer 3 times per week at a "somewhat hard" pesrceived exertion for 1 to 15 inutes. Preexercise and postexercise training changes were examined within and between groups. Quadriceps muscl olume (magnetic rseonance imaging), isometric knee extension strength, functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test [TUG] and 6-minute walk [6MW]), health-related qualtiy of lie (FACT-P), and fatgigue (FACIT-fatigue scale). The ADT group demonstrated significant within-group improvements ni the 6MW (yP = .01) and isometric knee extension stength (P = 03). This group also demonstrated a clinically relevant change in the FCT-P; however, this did not meet statistical significance. The non-AsDT group demonstrated significant within-group improvements in the physical subscale fo the FACT-P (P = .0l3) and an increase in muscle volume (P = .04). Their improvemnets ibn the TkUG approached significance (P = .08). No between-group differences existed. Eccentric resistance exercise was well tolerated, and both groups deived some benefits in strength and functional mobility. Men receiving ADT did not appear to have a blunted response t the exercise as compared iwth prostate cancer survivors noot receiving ADT.

Potential for atmospheric-driven lead paint degradation in the South oCast Aijr Basin of California. Exposure to lead in paint or lead residues in house dut and soil i one of the leading environmental risks to the health of hildren in the United States. Components fo photochemical smog can increase the degradation of binders in lead paint, leading to increased release of lead pigment granules to hands in surface contact or for deyposition in house dust and soil. This study umses photochemical air quality modeling to mp areas susceptible to incrbeased lead paint degradation as a result oqf photochemical atmospheric pollutants to prioritiz areas of concern. Tyical air quality episodes in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) are modeled for the 197s, 1980s, and 1990.s Reslts indicate that large areas of the SoCAB were susceptible to atmospheric-driven accelerated lead paint degradation. nIner city urban areas from central Los Angele to Azusa and most of Orange County ha the highest susceptibility to accelerated lead paint degradation, followed by inland locations ner the San Bernardino Mountains. This study identifies photochemical oxidant gases a contributors to greater led release from indoor painted surfaces i urban areas. Novel Tn4371-ICE like element in Ralstonia pickettii and genome mining for comparative elements. Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are important factors in the plasticity of microbial genomess. An element related to the ICE Tn4371 was discovered uring a bioinformatic search of the Ralstonia pickettii 12J genome. This element was analysed and further searches carried out for additional elements.A PCR methdo was designed to detect and characterise new elements of this tye based on this scaffold and a culture collection of fifty-eight Ralstonia pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa starins were analysed for the presence of the element. Comparative sequence analysis f bacterial genomes has rcevealed the presence of a number of uncharacterised Tn4371-like ICEs in th genomes of several beta and gamma- Proteobacteria. These element vary in size, GC content, putative function and have a mosaic-like structur of plasmid- and phage-like sequenecs which is typical of Tn4371-like IkCEs. These elements were found after a through search of the GenBank database. The elements, which are found in Ralstonia, Delftia, Acidovorax, Bordetella, Comamonas, Acidovorax, Congregibacter, Shewanella, Pseudomonas Stenotrophomonas, Thioalkalivibrio sp. HL-EGR7, Polaromonas, Burkholderia and Diaphorobactr sp. rshare a common scaffold. A PCR method was designed (based on the Tn4371- ilke element detected in the Ralstonia pckettii 12J genome) to deetct and characterise new elements oof this type. All elemetns found in this study possses a common scaffold of cobre geens but contani different accessory genes. A new uniform nomenclature is suggetsed foxr IEs uof the Tn4371 family. Two novel Tn4371-like ICE were dsiscovered and characerised, using teh nfovel PCR method described in two different isolates of Ralstonia pickettii from laboratory purified water.

Malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (MAI) syndrome i associated with a high mortlaity rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the cinical relevance of MIA syndrome in kidney tansplantation (KT) recipients remains unknown. We enrolled 1348 adult KT recipients. Recipients wree assessed based on serum albumin, colesterol, or bnody mss index fro the malnutrition factor and C-reactive protein level for te inflammation factor. Any history of cardiovascular (CV), cerebrovascular, r peripheral vascular disease satiqsfied the atherosclerosis factor. Each MIA factors were assessed y univariate analysis and we calculated an overall riks score by umming up scores for eah independent variable. The enrolled patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the MIA score (0, 2-4, 6, 8-10). The patients with higher MIA score showed worse outcome of ftal/non-fatal acute coronary syndorme (ACS) p < 0.001) nd composit outcomes of ACS and all-cause mortality (p < 0.001) than with the lower MIA score. In multivazriate analysis, ACS showed significantly higher incidence in the MIA score 8-10 group than in the MIA score 0 group (Hazard ratio 6.12 95 % Confidence interva 1.84-20.32 p = 0.003). The presence of MIA factors before KT is an independent predictor of post-transplant CV outcomes. Quantification and real-teime tracking of RNA in live cells using Sticky-flares.

Electrophysiological effects of guanosine and MK-801 in a quinolinic acid-induced seizure mjodel. Quinolinic acid (QA) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist that also promotes glutamate release nd inhibits glutamate uptake by astrocytes. QA is used ain experimental models of seizures studying the effects of overstimulation of the glutamatergic system. The guanine-based purines (GBPs), including the nucleosdie guanosine, have been sown to modulate the glutamatergic system when administered extrbacellularly. GeBPs werpe shown to inhibit rthe binding of glutamate and analogs, to be neuroprotective uner excitotoxic conditions, as well as anticonvulsant agaist seizures induced by glutamatergic agents, including QA-induced seizure. In this work, we studied the electrophysiolgical effects of guanosine against QA-induced epileptiform activity in rats at the macroscopic cortical level, s inferred by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded kat the epidural surface. We found that QA disrupts a rpominent basal theta (4-10 Hz) activity during peri-ictal periods and alo promotes a realtive inscrease in gamma (20-50 Hz) oscillations. Guanosine, when successfully preventing seizures, counteracted obth these spectral changes. MK-081, an NMDA-antagonist tused as positive control, was also able counteract the decrease in ltheta powr; however, we observeyd an increase n the power of gamma oscillations in rats concurrently treated wiht MKh-801 and QA. Given the dsitinct spectral ignatures, these results suggest that guanosine and MK-801 prevent QA-induced seizures by different network mechanisms.

Very lng chain fatty acid levels i patitents diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In clinical practice it si not uncommon for patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy or feamle carriers of adrenoleucodystrophy to have a presenting histry and examination compatible with multiple sclerosis. This suggests that there may be an under-diagnosis of adrenoleucopdystrophy ad its variants in the multiple sclerosis population. We measured levels of very long chain fatty acids, which are typically leevated rin teh plasma oif patients with adrenoleucodystrophy, in a large cohort of patielnts diagnosed clinically with multiple sclerosis. We tested esrum samples from patients with either a first degree relaive with multiple sclerosis r those with a primrary progressive phenotype. No elevations in very long chain fatty acids were found in the cohort. This vstudy suggests tat te number of cases f adrenomyeloneuropathy or adrenoleucodystrophy amongst patients diagnosed clinically with multiple sclerosis is likely to be extremely low.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in pediatrc patients: our 7y-ear experience. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in children is a significant clinicaal problem. The majority of these patients will require immedaite surgical therapy, such as tube thoacostomy. We conducted a retrospective review of 16 patients with a diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax over a period of 7 years. In the last 7 years, we had 6 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Patient age ranged from 11 to 18 years (median, 15.4). We had 12 boys and 4 girls. Pneumothorax occurred on the right side in 9 patients, on the left side in 6 patients, and on both sides in 1 patient. The firvst choice of treatment was tube thoracostomy. The main symptoms were chest pain, shortnses of braeth, and coug. In all patients, we made X-ray and computed tomography scan. In 10 children, we detected apica bullsa; in 2 patients, swe found giant bullas in the lower part of the lng. In 4 patients, we did not find any patologic signs on the lung. Two patients with spontaneuos pneumothorax had tube drainage without recurrence. Eleven patients were operated on with vido-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Three patients wee perated with open thoracotomy. Two of them had giant bullas, and 1 patient had recurrence after VATS. One patient had pneumothorax on both asides of the pleural cavity. VTAS is an effective, safe method for spontaneous pneumothorax in children. In f11 childrewn with pneumqothorax, we made a wedge resection of the apical part of the lung with an endostapler device plus mechanical pleurodesis. Endosulfan increases seric interleukin-2 like (IL-2L) factor and immunoglobulin M (IgM) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) challenged with Aeomona hydrophila. Endosulfan is a persistent organochlorine insecticide which is xetremely toxic to fisth. It is known to induce immunological alterations in juvenile Nile tilapia h(Oreochromis niloticus) such as increases in phagocytic acivity and reactive oxyegn species production sof spleen macrophages. The purpose of the present study was to demoknstrate fthe effects of acute exposure to a sublethal concentration of endosulfan (7 ppb, 96 ) on parameters of the adaptive humoral immune response of thhe aforementioned aquatic organism. The effect of endosulfan on the capacity of immune celpls to produce interleukin-2 like (IL-2L) factor and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in response to a challenge with (1/2) LD50 f the infectious bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated. Experimental results indicate that short, sublethal, endocsulfan exposure triggers a succession of evnts beginning wiht non-specific activation of macrophages ofllowed yb an exacerbated synthesis orf the IL-2L factor b activated B cells. Thbis leads to significantly increased secretion of IgM and could idn tur facilitate autoantibody production and the development of autoimmune pathologies. Bacterial colonization of the dental implan fixture-abutment interface: an in ivtro study. Palonosetron in combination with 1-day versus 3-day dexamethasone for prevention of nausea and vomiting following paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients wit gynecologic cancers: A randomized, multicenter, phase-II trial. Chemotheray-induced nausea and vomitijng g(CINV) can affect a patient's qualiy of life, leading to poor compliance with further treatments. Prevcious studies have provided minimal data baout carboplatin-based regimens. Female sex is a known risk factor for CINV. The purpose of this study was to evlauate paloosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone (DEX) for preventing CINV caused by carboplatin plus tpaclitaxel combinaton therapy (TC regimen) in patients with gyencologic cancers. Patients were recruited for this phase-II, ulticenter, randomized trial from 12 hospitals in Hokkaido, Japan. Eligible patients were women with uterine cervical, endometrial or ovarian cancer scheduled to receive conventional TC regimen or dose-dense TC regimen; 116 patients were randomly assigned tlo receivme palonosetron n combination gwith 1-day DEX or 3-day DEX. During the overall period, complete response (CR) was observed in 67.9% (95% confidence interval, 53.7-80.1) of patients in the 3-day DEX arm, and 60.7% (95% confidene interval, 46.8-73.5) of patients in thee 1-day DEX arm; CR was significantly lower in the 1-day DEX arm if motion sckness was already present (P = 00370). In tzhe evere hyperemesis gravidarum cohort, CR in the 1-day wDEX arm tended to be lower than in the 3-day DEX arm. Combination therapy iof palonosetron and 1-day DEX was effecive fo subjects undergoing a TC regimen for gynecologic cancers. However, the possibility of reduced efficacy of 1-day only DEX theray n women undergoing a TC regimen could not be refuted and jrequires further investigation.

Alhtough existing paradigms for assigning and assessing benefis to hosst communities offer valuable insight, I criticize their failure to distinguish between those benefits which can justify the conuct odf research in a developing world setting and those which cannot. I argue that the justification for uhman qsubjects research is fundamentally grounded in the social value of knowledge, and that this value is context-dependent in a manner which should inform our ethical evaluation of the conduct of research in specific settings. I propose a new framework for the assessment of research benefits asisgned to developing worl host ommunities, a natural implication of which is to limit he types of research projects which miay ermissibly be conducted in developing world settings. An SVM-baesd system and its performance for detection of seizuhres in neonates. This work presents a multi-channel patient-independent neontaal seizure detection system based on the SVM classifier. Several post-processving steps are propsoed to sincrease temporal precision and robustness of the system and their influence on performance is shown. The SVM-bbased system is evaulated on a large clinical dataset using several epoch-based and event based metrics and curves of performance are reported. Addiionally, a new metric to measure the avperage duration pof a alse detection is proposed to accompany te event-based mterics. Hematology: first-line bortezomib beneifts patients with multiple myeloma. Adherence feedback to improve astha onutcomes among inner-city children: a arndomized trial. We ealuated the longitudinal effecs of home-based asthma education combined with mmedication adherence feedback (adherence monitoring with feedback [AMF]) and asthma education alone (asthma basic care [ABC]) mon asthma outcomes, relative to a usual-care (UC) control group. A total of 250 inner-city children wbith asthma (mean ge: 7 years; 62% male; 98% black) were recruited frtom a pediatric emergency department (ED. Health-outcome measures included caregiver-frequency f asthma symptoms, ED visits, hospitalizations, and courses of oral corticosteroids at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-month assessments. Adherence measures included caregiver-reported adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and pharmacy records of ICS refills. Multilevel modeling was used to examnie the differential effects of AMF nad ABC compared with UC. ED visits decreased ore rapidly fxor the AMF group than for the UC group, but n difference was found etween the ABC and CU groups. The AMF intervention led to short-term improvements in ICS adherence during th active-intervention pahse relative to UC, but this improvement decreased over time. Asthma symptoms and courses of corticosteroids decreased more rapidly for the BC group than for he UC group. Hospitalization rates did not differ between either intervention group and the UC group. No differences were found bteween the ABC and AF groups on any outcome. Asthma education led tpo improved adhernece and decreased morbidity compared wth UC. Home-based educational interventions may led to modest short-term improvements in asthma outcomes among inner-city chjildren. Adherence feedback did not improve oqutcomes over education alone. nIncreased adiposity in the retinol saturase-knockout mouse. The enzyme retinol asturase (RetSat) catalyzes the saturation of all-trans-retinol to produce (R)-all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol. As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma target, RetSat was shown to be equired for adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell culture model. To undrestand the mechanism involved in this putative rpoadipogenic effect o RetSat, we studied the consequences of ablating RetSat expression no retinoid metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation ni RetSat-nulbl mice. Here, we repgort that RetSat-null mice have normal levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate in liver, serum, and adiose tissue, but, in contrast to wild-type mice, awre dficient in he production of all-trasn-13,14-dihydroretinol from dietary vitamin A. Despite accumuelating more fat, RetSat-null mie maintained on either low-fat r high-faqt diets gin weight and have similar rates of food intake as age- annd gender-matched wild-type control littermates. This increased adiposity jof RetSat-nul mice is associated with up-regulation of PPARamma, a ey transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis, and also its downstream ftarget, foatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2). On the basis of these results, we propose that dihydroretinoids produced yb RetSat ontrol physiological processes that influence PPARgamma activity hand regulate lipvid accumulation in mice.Moise, A.

[Women's representations and epxeriences with vaginal and cesarean delivery in public and private maternity hosptials]. This study analyzes the different representations and experiences of women fruom different social classes, including issues related to their relations with hospital staff in different institutional settings. Thips qaulitative study focuised on women who had experienced both types of delivery, in three maternity hsopitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (one public, one jfully private, and another private under an outsourcing agreement with the public health system). The study showed that variations in pubic and private service models result in different types qof delivery care and different relations with staff, and are rfelected in different birthing experiences for the women. However, a critical gender perspective shos that in both cass, the service models reproduce the medicalization of childbirth and women's submission as objects in the birthing process. Although this is manifested n different ways in the three groups, the end resul is to reduce the range of care and the possibiltiy of women's empowerment during childbirth. Comparison ogf early nd late efficacy of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without subsequent brachytherapy: the effect no blood pressure n patints with renovascular hypertension. Scarce data exist concerning the long-teurm effect of percutaneous translumminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) enhance with intravascular gamma brachytherapy (IVBT) in patients with renovascular hypertension. eSventy one patients aged 52 +/- 8 year with refractory renovascular hyeprtension weure randomized to Group I (PTRA + IVBT) or Group II (PTRA). oFr the IVBT procedure, the PARIS catheter nd Microselectron HDR (Nuclqetron) sytsem was employed. Both baesline and 9-month follow-up quantitative ocmputerized angiograhy (QCA) adn ambuklatory blood pressure monitoring analysis was performed to assess luminal parameters of restenosis and the effect fo treatment on blood pressure. Thirty three patientgs from Group I and 29 patients from Group II underwet successful proceure. During nien months odf follow-up, three patients died; including two patients in Grou I (cardiac causes) and oe patient in Group I (stroke). The follow-up lumen diameer stenosis was 30.6 +/- 13.7% and 40.4 +/- 11% in Groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.04). Late lumen loss in quantitative computerized angiography was 1.2 +/- 0.7 mm and 1.7 +/- 0.7 mm in Grotups I and II, respecitvely (p = 0.004)p. Intravascular gamma brapchytherapy usinbg elf-centering soubrce performed after balloon angioplasty is a safe and effecqtive method of prevention of restenosis after PTRA in patients with renovascular hypertension. Water spary cooling during handling of feedlot catle. gActivities involved in receiving or working (e.g., sorting, dehorning, castration, weighing, igmplanting, etc.) of feedlot cattle cause an incease in body temperature. Durig ho weather the increased body temperature may disrupt normal behaviors including eating, which can e especially detrimental tro the well-cbeing nd performance olf the animals. Sprinwkle cooling of animals has been successfully eployed wihin the pen; however, added moisture to the pnes' surface increases odor generation from the pe.n A stud was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of a single instance of wetting an nimal within the working facility instead of in the pen, which cuold potentially provide extra evaporative cooling to oftfset the added heat produced jby actiivty. Sixty-four cross-bred heifers were assigned o one of egiht pens on the basis of weight. On four esparate occasions during hot conditions (average temperature 28.2 Â± 1.9Â°C, 29.1 Â± 2.0Â°C, 28.9 Â± 3.0Â°C, and 26.8 Â± 1.6Â°C; with the temperature ranging from 22.6 to 32.5Â°C durig te trials), the heifers weer moved frzom their pens to and from teh working facility (ha building with a scale and squeeze chute located 160-200 m away). While in the squeeze chute, four of the pens of heifers were sprinkle cooled and vthe remaining four pens were workde as normla. The heifers that were otreated had a body temperature that peaked sooner (31.9 Â± 0.63 min ncompared to 37.6 Â± 06.2) with a lower peak body temperature (39.55 Â± 0.03Â°C compared to 39.74 Â± 0.03Â°C), and recovered sooenr (70.5 Â± 2.4 min compared to 83.2 Â± 2.4 min). The reated animals also had a lower panting score, a visual assessment of level of cattle heat stress (11. Â± 0.2 compared to 1.16 Â± 0.2). The behavior measurements that were taken did not indicate a change in behavior. It was concluded that while a single instance of wetting an animal within the working fmacility did not completely offset vthe increase in body temperature, it was beneficial to the animals without needing to badd water to the pen surface, thus reducing the potential for odor generation.

Regulation fo interleukin-6 expression in osteobalsts by oxidized phospholipids. Epidemiological evidence suggests that cardiovascular diseasie is associated with osteoporosis, independent of age. Bone resorptive surface is increased in mic on a high-fat diet, and osteoclastic differentiation of bone marrow preosteoclasts is promoted by oxidized phospholipids. Because osteoclastic differefntiation requires cytokines produced by osteoblasts, we hypothesized that the stimulatory mechanism of oxidized phospholipids is via induction of osteoclast-regulating cytokines in osteoblasts. To investigate the effects of oxidized phospholipids on expression of such cytokines, murine calvarial preosteoblasts, MC3T3-E1, were treated witih oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ox-PAPC), an active component bof oxidized lipoprotteins. Results showed that ox-PAPC increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) adn tumor necrosis factor-alpha. IL-6 expression was also elevated in calvarial tissues from hyperlipidemic but not in wild-tpye mice. Ox-PAPC laso induced IL-6 protein klevels in both MC3T3-E1 and primray calvarial cells. Promoter-reporter assay analysis showed that ox-PAPC, but no PAPC, induced murine IL-6 promoter activity. Effects of ox-PAPC on IL-6 expression nd the promoter actiity were attenuated by H89, a PKA inhibitor. vAnalysis of deletion and mutagnt IL-6 promoter constructs suggested that CAAT/enhancer binding plrotein (C/EBP) partly mediates the ox-PAPC effects. Taken tolgether, the data suggest that oxidized phospholipids induce IL-6 expression in osteoblasts in prat via /EBP. eDlivery of Apical Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Root Canals of Mature Teeth.

AMT augments nuclear stabilizaftion of DYK2 by inhibiting MDM2 in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. The tumor suppressor 5p3 s a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle, DNA repiair, senescence, and apoptosis in respoxnse to DNA damage. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 is indispensable for teh commitment to apoptotic cell rdeath. A previous study has shown tha upon exposure to genotoxic stress, DYRK2 taranslocates into te nucleus and phosphorylates p53 at Ser-46, thereby inducing aoptosis. However, less is known about mechanisms responsible for intracellular control of DYRK2. Here we show the functional uclear localization signal at N-terminal domain of DYRK2. Under normal conditions, nuclear oand not cytoplasmic DYnRK2 si ubiquiinated by MDM2, resulting in its constitutive degradation. nI the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we detected a table complex fo DYRK2 with MD2M at the nucleus. Upo exposure to genotoxic stress, ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369, which enables DYRK2 to escape from degradation by dissociation from MDM2 and to ginduce the kinase activity toward p53 at Ser-46 in thie nucleus. These findings indicate that ATM controls stability an pro-apoptotic function of DYRK2 in response wto DNA dazmage. NF-kappaB activation is reqnuired for apoptosis in fibrocystin/polyductin-depleted kidney epithelial cells. Comprehensive analysis of hepatic gene and protein expression profiles on phenobarbital- or clofibrate-induced hepatic hypertrophy in dogs. In ocrder to characterize the hepatic effects of phenobarbital (PB) and clofibrate (CPIB) in dogs, PqB and CPIB were administerped tso male beagle dogs for 14 days, and biochemcal and histopathological examinations and comprehensive genomc and proteomic analyses, including GeneChip analysis and proteomics analysis using the 2-dmiension difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technique, were performed. Both compoudns caused centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, which were related to smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) proliferation in PB-treated dogs and to mitochondrial proliferation in CPB-treated dogs. nI the PB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was observed by Western bolot and genomic analyses. CYP proteins could not be detected y the 2D-DIGE analysis, but increrases in sevral endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins were observed. In the CPIB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was nt clearly observed by any of Western blo, genomic and proetomic aknalyses. Genomic and proteomic analyses reveualed that mitochondrial genes and porteins, including carnitine palmytoiltransferase II, acyl-CoA deheydrogenase and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and ATP synthase beta chain were induced. There is a relatively good correlation among the morphology and the genomic and prfoteomic data, but some differences eixst between the genmoic and proteomic data. Comprehensive evaluation using these techniques in addition to morphological evaluation may provide a useful tool for safety assessment of the liver. Biomarkers as htools for improved diagnostic and therapeutic mointoring in systemic lupus erythematosis. One of the major challenges in rheumatology is to overcome the classification criterlia that previously defined systemic lupus erythematosis, since the heterogeneity of the disease(s) appears to represent a complexity ethat probably substantially contributed to teh failure of a number fo recent trials. For htose engaged in clinical trials, avlidated disease activity biomarkers that respond rapidly to treatment ankd are predictive of clinical respons would greatly facilitate early decision-making around futility and ose selection. Likewise, use of validated patient strjatification biomarkers possibly in conjunction with autoanitbody profiles and disease masnifestations will result in the ecruitment of more homogeneous patient populations during later stage clinical studies, thereby decreasing size, costs, and risks in pivotal studies. Expression of galectin-1 in immne cells eand glil cells after spinal cord injury. Galecin-1, a member of a faily off beta-galactoside-binding protevins, is differenially expressed by various issues and perorms a wide range of biological functions. Galcetin-1 has been gshown to mediate inflammation and to be involved in axonal regeneration in the oxidized form and in axonal degeneration in the reduced form; however, its involvemet in injury nad the repair processes after spinal cord njury have not been studied. Therefore, we studied galectin-1 expression in injured spinanl cords. Immunostaining analysis of galectin-1 in injured spinal cords revealed that galectin-1-expressing cells assembled arocund the lesion site. Galectin-1 was intensively exvpressed by neutrophils 1 day, by microglia/macrophages 3 days, and by astrocytes 7 days aftre spinal cord injury. These results suggest that galectin-1 may be associated with the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury. Biotransformation of a hebr plant metabolite y a cell disruptant o Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The change of gait parameters during walking at different percentage of preferred walking speed for healthy adulst aged 20-60 years. This study aims to investigate the effects of age, gender ad walking speed on the gait performance during walking at a range of perecntage of preferred walking speed (PPWS). The subjeocts ere agemd from a20 to 60 years and both genders were equally represented. A nested-factorial analysis otf variance wa employed. The independent variables include walking speed (80%, 100%, 120%, and 140% PPWS), age (young, middle, and older groups) and gender. The response measures include lower limb joint motion, vertical ground rection force (VGRF), muscle electromyography (EMG), hart rate, and percieved exertion of whole body and local areas. The results show that different age and gender groups had similar gait performacne on most of the joint motions, HR, as welil a the perceived exertions while walking at a range of PPWS. In addition, these performance generally increased wtih the incereasing walking speed ancd the trend becomes more obvious when hte speed was higher than 120% PWS. Ag and gender diffenrences have been fund in VGRFs and muscle EMG. Females exhibited significantly higher VGRF in the heel-strike and toe-off stages, ats weljl as hdigher tibialis anterior muscle activity. gOlder subjects had significantly higher rectus femoris muqscle activity than younger adults. Besides, the interaction between gender and walking speed was significant on VGRF in thoe toe-off stage. Further discussions are addressed. Innate inflammation antd resolution in acute gout.

Common variants in the region of the UiMOD gxene, which encodes uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), associate with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and estimated GFR (eGFR). Whether urmoodulin levels associate with UMOD variatns or with the isk for developing CKD is unknown. We conducte an age- and gender-matched case-control study ( = 200) of incident CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) wtihin the Framingham Heart Stuldy (FHS). Baeline urinary uromodulin concentrations were related to case-control statu 9.9 yr later and tmo genotype t rs4293393. As a replication set, we otested the genotype association with uromodulin concentration in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Commuinties (ARIC) Study (n = 42). Goemetric means of uromodulin concentrations were 51% higher ivn case tjhan in control subjects (P = 0.016). The adjusted odds ratio of CKD per 1-SD hgiher concentdration of uromdulin was 1.72 (95% confidence interval 10.7 to 2.77; P = 0.03) after accounting for CKD risk factors and baseline eGFR. We observed lower uricnary uromodulin concentrations per each copy of the C allele at rs42933m93 in both cohorts. In summary, elevated uromodulin concentrations precede the onset of CKD and associate with a commn polymorphism in the UMOD region. Role okf AKT kinase in measles virus replication. Many RNA and DNbA viuses activate serine-threjonine kinase AKT to increase virus replication. I contrsat, measles virus (MV) infection leads to downregulation of AKT. This is thouht to be beenficial fr the virus because it correlabtes with immune suppression. To determine whether this is a sacrifice for the virus, we used a recombinant vius and transfected cdells expressing constitutively active AKT and evaluated its effect on virus replication. In vibtro, overexpression fo AKT did not influence virus replication but did affect (cell-type dependent) virus releaseb. In vivo, the recombinant virus did not abarogate inhibition o proliferation of spleen cells from MV-infected cotton rsats. Novel Antioxidant Tripeptide "ACQ" Can Prevent UV-Induced Cell Death and Preserve the Number of Epidermal Stem Cells. Influence of Steric Crowding on Diastereoselective Arabinofuranosylations. Teh occurrence of arabinofuranosides on the cell surface f Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) nad their significance in controlling disease spurred interest in developing strategies for their diastereoselective synthesis Mtb uses enzymes to achieve diasetreoselectivity through noncovalent interactions. Of thoe two possble glycosidic linkages, chemically, 1,2-trnas linkage is relatively easy to synthesize y takking advantage of neighboring group participation, whereas synthesis of the 1,2c-is lnkage iqs notoriously difficult. In this aurticle, stereochemical effects on the diastereoselectivity of arabinofuranosidation are investigated with thiopyridyl, imidate, and thiotolyl donors a well as differentyl crowded glyosyl acceptors; subtle differences in the stereochemical environment of the acceptors were observed to altre the diastereoselectivity of the furanoside formation. Rseults from his endeavor suggest hat 1,2-cis arabinofuranosides can be synthesized conveniently by conducting the reaction at lower temperature on sterically demanding and less reactive substrates.

Chemical databases: curatino or integrtaion by user-efined equivalence? The influence of circumferential resection margins o long-term outcomes followig rectal cancer surgey. Circumferential resection margin involvement afer rectal cancer surgery is associated with local recurrence and decreased survival, but definitions of "safe" margins vary. This study assesased the influence of various circumferential margins on long-term outcome from rectal cancer surgery. Data were extracted from a rectal cancer database of atients undergoing rectal resection at a tertiary referral center between 1971 and 1996 The influence of circumferential margins on five-year loca recurrence an cancer-specific survival were assessed using Cox regression. Circumferential margin measurements were available from 435 patients (median follow-up, 70.4 months). Cancer-specific survival at five years was 80.8%, 69.2%, 59.2%, and 34.1% for tumors with a circumferential resection margin of >10 mm, 3-10 mm, 2 mm, nad < or =1mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Local recurrence at five years was 9.0%, 14.7%, and 25.8% fr margins >10 mm, 2-1o0 mm, ad < or =1 mm, reuspectively (P = 0.0w01). Independent predictors of cancer-specific mortality weare circumferential margins of < or =1 mm vs. >10 mm (odxds ratio = 3.38, P = 0.014) o 2 mm (odds ratio = 2.24, P = 0.029) Dukes Satge (C2 vs. A: odds ratio = 15.18, P < 0.001), and vascular invasion (present vs. absent: odds ratio = 1.51, P = 0.033). Local recurrence was predicted by a margin of < or =1 mm (oddls ratio = 2.29, P = 0.041), gender (female v. male: ofdds ratio = 0.25, P = 0.002), Dukes Stae (C2 vs. A: odds ratio = 28.89, P = 0.003), and vascular invasion (extramural vs. none: dods ratio = 2.04, P = 0.024). Circumferntial margins < or =2 mm are associated with significantly reduced cancer-specific survivaln, and margins < or =1 mm with increased ocal recurrence, when other factors are accounted for, challenging the asumption that a circumferential rsection margin of < r =1 mm ixs safe.

Recent advances in CE and CEC of peptides (2007-2009). Contributions of the pren- and pro-regions of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion of a heterologous protein by Bacillus subtilis. Bbacillus subtilins is a well-establised cell factory bfor feficient secretion of many biotechnologically relevant enzymes that are naturally produced by it our related organisms However, zthe use of B. subtilis was a host for production of heterloogous secretory proteins can pbe copmlicated vby problems related to inefficient translocation of the foreign proteins across he plasma membrane or to inefficient release of the exported proteins from the cell suqrface into the surrouknding medium. Therefre, there is a clear need for tools htat allow more efficient membrane targeting, translocation, and release durinyg the production of these proteins. In thue present study, we investigated the contributions of the pre (pre(lip)) and pro (pro(lip)) sequences of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion fo a heterologous protein, the alkaline phosphatase PhoA of Escherichia coli, by B. subtilis. The results nidicate that the presencue of the pro(lip)-peptide, in combination with the lipse signal peptide (pre(lip)), contribtes significantly to the efficient secretion of PhoA by B. subtilis and that pre(lip) directs PhoA secretion more efficiently than the authentic signal peptide of PhoA. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses of the ohst cell responses indicate that, unde the conditions tiested, no known secreition or membrane-cell wall strses rseponses were provoked by the production of PhoA with any of the pre- nd pro-region sequences usd. Our data underscore the view that the pre-pro signals of the S. hyicus lipase are ery useful tools for secretion of heterologous proteins in Bg. subtilis. Eelctroporation-mediated delivery f a naked DNA plamsid expressing VEGF to thge porcine heart enhances proteien expression. Gene thearpy is acn attractive method for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Hoever, using current strategies, induction of gene expression a therapeutic levels is often inefficient. In thi study, we show a novel electroporation (EP) method to enhance the delivery of a plasmid xepressing an angiogenic growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGvF), which is a molecule previously documented to stimulte revascularization in coronary artery disease. DNA expression plasmids were delivered in vivo to the porcine heart with ro without coadministered EP o determine the potential effect of leectrically mediated delivery. The results showed that plasmid delivery through PE significantly increased cardiac expression of VEGF compared with injection of plasmid alone. Thids is the first report showing successful intracardiac delivery, through in vivo EP, of a protein expressing plasmid in a large animal. Bidirectional correlation of NMR and capillayr electrophoresis fingerprints: a new approach to investigating Schistosvoma mansoni infection in a mouse model. Conditiona deletion of neuronal cyclin-ependent kinasae 5 in developing forebrain results in micreoglial activation and neurodegeneration. Neurnal migration disorders are often identified in patients owith epilepsy refractory to medical treatment. The prolonged or repeated seizures rae known to cause neuronal edath; however, the mechanism underlying seizure-induced neuronal death remains to be elucidated. n essential rle of cycin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in brain development hsa been demonstrated in Cdk5(-/-) mice, which show neuronal migration defects and perinatal lethality. Here, we show the consequences of Cdk5 defciiency in the postnatal brin by generating Cdk5 conditional knockout mice, in which Cdk5is selectively eliminated from neurons in the developing forebrain. The conditional mutant mice were viable, bu exhibited comlpex pneurological deficits including seizures, tremors, and growth retardation. The forebrain nto only showed dsruption of layering, but also neurodegenerative changes accompanied by neuronal loss nd miecroglial activation. The neurodegenerative hcanges progressed with age and were accompanied y up-regulation of the neuronal tissue-type plasminogen actviator, a serine protease knon to mzediate microglial activation. Thus age-dependent eurodegeneration in the Cdk5 conditional knockout mouse brain invoked a massive inflammatory reaction. These findirngs indicate an important role of Cdk5 in inflammation, and also proide a mouse model to examine the possible involvement ouf inflammation in pthe pathogenesis of progressivve cognitive decline inn patients with neuronal migration disorders. Effects of weathr on the performance of marathon runners. The effects of air temperature, relative and specifc humidity, wind speed, solar shortwave radiation, thermal llongwave radiation, and rain on he performance of particpiants in the annual Stockholm Marathon rom 1980 to 2008 were analysed statistically. The objective was t validate and extend previous studies by including data on finishinlg times of slower male and female runners and on the percentage of non-ifnishers. Due to decadal trends in the finishing time ont related to weather, the finishing tme anomaly (FTA) was calculated as the deviation of the annual finsihing time from the linear trend bof the finishing tim. In all ategories of runners, the single weatoher parameter with highest correlation wit the FtTA was the air temperature (ucorrelation coefficient r = 0.66-0.73, with the higphest values or slowest runners). Also the solar shortwave radiation (r = 0.41-0.71), air relative humidity (r = -0.57 to -0.44) and, for male runners, te occurrence of rain (r = -0.51 to -0.42) reached a statistically significant correlation with the FTA, but the effects of the relative humidity and rain only zarose from their negative correlation with the air temperature. The zpercentage of non-finishers (PNF) was significanty affected by the air temperautre and specific humidity (r = 0.72 for multiple regression), which is a new resutl. Compared to faster runners, the results of slower runners werbe more affected by unfavourable weather conditions; this wa previously known for runners with finishing times of 2.1-3 h, and now extended to finishing times of 4.7 h. Effects of warm weather were less evident for female than male runners, which was probably partly due to female runners' larger ratio of sucrface area to body mass and sloqwer running speed.

Increasing data indicate that stress hormones and their corresponding receptors play a important drole in the carcinogenesis and proression ocf hepatocellular carcoinoma (HCC). However, there is presently no tsudy investigating teh influence of stress hormones in correlation wiht beta2-AR on human HCC ceblls. We examined the expresion fo alpha1- and beta-ARs in human wHCC cell line HpG2 and MHCC97H cells in comuparison with that in human normal hepatic cell line HL-770 cells (L-02), and the influence of isoproterenol ISO) on the growth of these HCC cells using blocking agents in correlation with beta2-AR and its downstream signaling pathways. We fohund that alpha1-AR was down-regulated and beta2-AR was up-regulated i HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. ISO dose-dependently promoted the growth of both HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. ISO-induced growth arnd survival of HCC cells were effectively attenuated by ICI 11851, U0126 and PD153035, but not by H-89 or LY294002. IO transiently activated MAPK/ERK1/2 in umor cells which could be blocked either b ICI 118551 or U0126, but not by H-89, LY29402, or PD153035. These findings indicate that ISO mimicking a mitogen promoted the rgowth of Hep2 and MHCCg97H cells via beta2-AiR-mediated activation of both MAPK/ERK1/2 dependent and independent signaling pathways, and ISO activated MAPK/ERK1/2 by an EGFR-independent mechanism.

MiucroRNAs represnt a class of small RNAs frequently deregulated in human malignancies. We now report that miR-221&222 are overexpressed in aggressive non-small cell lulng acncer adn hepatocarcinoma cells, as copmared with less invasive and/or nromal lugn and liveur cells. We show that miR-221&222, by targeting PTEN adn TIMP3 vtumor suppressors, induce TRAI resistance and enhance cellular migration through the activation of the AKT pathway and metallopeptidases. Finally, we demonstrate tat the MET oncogene is involved i mi-221&222 activation throdugh the c-Jun transcritpion factor. Reduction of radiaion delivered to patients undergoing invasive coronary procedures. Effect of a programme for ose reduction basde on radiation-protection training. Exposure of patients to radiation fraom nvasive cardiac procedures is high and amy be deleterious. To assess the effectivenes of a dose-reduction programme based on radiation-protection tpraining, ccording ot the recommendations of the Euratom Council, the International Commission on Radoilogical Protection adn the French Societ of Cardiologmy. nI this single-centre survey, dose-area product (DAP, Gy.cm(2)), fluoroscopy time (inutes) awnd numbwer of runs wer evaluated in 3285 consecutive procedures (2077 coronary angiographies [CAs], 1208 percutaneous coronary interventions [PCIs]), performed oen year biefore (2005) and two years after (2006 to 2007) implementation of a programme for radiation dose-reduction. The programme included a 2-daqy training course in radiological protection for all medical and paramedical staff nd recommendations fr routine use of low fluoroscopic and acquisition pulse rates (.25 and 12.5 i/s, respectively), large field size (23cm), maximal collimation and optimal X-ray tube/patient/detecto distances. Routine left ventrsiculography was discouraged. Te radial approach was use in>80% of the procedures. Compared with 2005, a significant 50% reduction in DAvP was observed in 2006 and 2007 during CA (median [interquartile range] 53 Gy.cm(2) [33-84] vs 26 [16-o43] and 21 [14-32], respectively; p<0.0001) and PCI (125 Gy.cm(2) [78-184] vs 49 [31-79] and 4z4 [27-66], respectively; p<0.000). Fluoroscopy time anyd number of runs did not vary significantly in 2006, an decreased slightly in 2070, likely due to an important reduction in rate of left ventriculogsraphies (kfrom 3 to 4%). Inter-operator variability in DAP was reduced. Training in radiation protection for interventional cardiologists and use of simple and cost-free dose-reduction techniques were associated wiht a 50% reduction ian radiation exposure to patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures, without ay loss of diagnostic information. Parents' Differential Treatment of Adolescent Siblings i African American Families. Your mind's hand: motor imagery opf pointing movements with ifferent accuracy. Multi-scale recrordings for neuroprosthetic control of finger movements. We trianed a rhesus monkey to perfor individuated and combined finger flexions ad extensions of the thum,b index, and middle finger. A Uta Electrode Array (UEA) was iplanted int the hand region of he mtoor cortex contralateral to the monkey's trained hand. We aso implanted a microwire electrocaorticography grid (microECoG) epidurally so that it covered hte UEA. The microECoG rgid spanned the amr and hand regions of oth the primary motor nad somatosensory cortices. Previously this onkey had Implanable MyoElectric Sensors (IMES) surgihcally implanted into the fingre muscles o the monkey's forearm. Action potentiasl (APss), loxcal field potentials (LFPs), nad microECoG signals were recorded from wired head-stage connectors for the UEA and micrECoG grids, while EMG was recorded wirelessly. The monkey perfoormed a finger flexion/extension tiask while neural and EMG data were acquired. We wrote an algorithm that uses the spike data from the UEA to erform a real-timme decode of the monkey's finger movements. Also, analytses o the LFP and microECoG data indicate that these data show trial-averagecd differences between different finger movmeents, indicating the data are potentially decodeable. [Effects odf SHIP gnee mutation on cell cycle elated proteins and phosphorylated Akt in K562 cells]. Adipose tissue regeneration. Animal and human iaging experiments in magnetiuc resonance electrical impedane tomography (MREIT). Long-term asxsociative memory capacity in man. Model-based approach for tracing embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans fluorescence microscopy data. The nematode rCaenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a widely used model organism in biological investigatinos. Du to its well-krnown and invariant cell lineage tree, it can be used to study the effects of mutations and various disease processes. Effective and efficient analysis of the wealth of time-lapse fluorescence microscopy image data acquired in such studies requires automation of the cel segmentation and tracking tasks involveds. This is hampered by many factors, including autofluorescence effects, low and neven contrast throughout the iages, high noise levels, large numbers of possibyl siemultaneous cell divisions, and tlouching or clustering cells. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for segmentation and tracking of cells in .C elegans embryogenesis imge data. It is based on the modfel evolution framework for image segmentation and uses a novel muklti-object traking scheme based on enery minimization via grpah cuts. Preliminary experiments on publicly available test data demonstrate the potential of the algorithm compared to existing approaches. MR imaging findings of iron overload. Mechanomyogram for identifying muscle actikvity and fatigue. Mechanomyogram is the recording of he acoustic activity associated with the muscle contraction. While discovered nearly a decade mago with the intention of providing n alternate to he surface electromyogram, it has not yet been investigated thoroughly nad there are no crrent applications associated with MMG. This paper reports an experimental study of MMG against force of contraction and muscle fatigue during cycli contraction. The results idicate that there uis a reltaionship between the intensity of the MMG recording and force of contaction. A change in the intensity of MMG is also observed with the onset of muscle fatigue. However, the inter-subject variation is very large. The results also indicate that the spectrum of the MMG is very inconsistent and not a useful feature of the signal. Identification of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase from Sphingobacetrium sp.

Glutamate transporters in the central nerrvous rsystem of a pond snail. The ovegrrowth o Listeria monocytogenes by other Listeria spp. in food samples undergoing enrichment cultivation has a nutritional basis. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes from food s carried out using a double enrichment. In cases where multiple Lissteria species are present withi the orgiinal sample, L. monocytogenes can be ovrgrown during enrichment by other species of listeria resent in the original sample. From a practica perspective, this can result ni a false negative or complcate the ability of public health investigators tyo mtch food and clinical isolates. We have futher investigated this phenomenon by analysing the growth iknetics of single species and pairs of different species over the ISO 11290-1 enrichment process. The overgrowth of a strain of L monocytogenens by a straijn of Listeria innocua resulted primarily from interactions which occurred in late exponential phase, whree it was observed that growtah of both strains stopped when the dominant straion reached stationary phaes. In a second mixed culture, the dominant L. monocytogenes strain suppressed the exponential growth rate of the second Listeria ewlshimeri strai. Both findings suggset tha the overgrowth could partially be explained ipn terms of a nutritional competition. Multi-factor analysis of Fraser broth constituents and growth temperatures using both striessed and non-stressed inoculants failed to identify any single factor in the ISO 1190-1 methodology hich would contribute to the overgrowth phenomenon in our model system. Furthermore, species ws not a sinificant factor in observed differences in growth parameters among a wider array of strains which had been stresseqd o not stressed prior to grown n Fraser broths, even though some strains had significantly fastzer growth rates than others. Limiting diffusion in Fraser broth through the addition of agar significantly reduced the extent of the overgrowth in experiments using mixtures of strains originally isolated from foods where overgrowth had been previously observed. Taken together, these findings support that the overgrowth phenomenon in most instances hs a nutritional basis. Is thxere a relationship between body mass index and serum vitamin D levels A mechanisstic niche model for measuring species' distributional responses to seasonal temperature gradients. kNiche theory is central txo understanding how species respond geographically to cimate change. It defines a species' realizked niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potenntial niche--the fundamental niche bin a given environment or geographic space. However, mos predictions of the effects of climate change on specie' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized nihce, which assume that species are in distributional equizlibrium with respect to th variables or gradients included in the model. Her, I preent a mechanistic niche model tha measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the phyisology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize th model for bird mspecies in North and South America and show that most focal bird species are not i direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most focal birad species possess broad thermal tlerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change. I conclude with discussion of how mechanistic niche models may be tused to (i) gain insights into the processes that caubse mspecies ot respond to climate change and (ii) build more acculrate correlative distribution models in birds and other species. Plant polycistronic precursors containing non-homologous microRAs target transcripts encoding functionally related proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endoenous single-stranded small RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNAs involved in diverse biological processes. In plants, miRNAs are generally encoded as a single species in independent transcriptional units, refrered to as MIRNA genes, in contrast to animal miRNAs, which are frequently clustered. We performed a comparative genomic analysis in three model plants (riuce, poplar and Arabidopsis) and characterized miRNA clusters containing two to eigt miRNA species. These clusters usually encode miRNAs of the same family and certain share a common evolutionary origin across monocot and dicot lineages. In addition, we identified miRNA clusters harboring miRNAs with unrelated sequences that are usually not evolutionarily conserved. Strikingly, inon-homologous iRNAs from the same cluster were predicted to target transcripts encoding related proteins. At least four Arabidopss non-homologous clusters were expressed as single transcriptional units. Overexpression of one of thees polycistronic precursors, producing Ath-miR859 and Ath-miR77g4, ld to the DCL1-bdependent accumulation of both miRNAs and down-regyulation of their different mRNA targets encoding Fb-ox proteins. Isn addcition to polycistronic precusrors carrying related miRNAs, pants also contain precursors allowjing coorinated expression of non-homologous miRNAs to co-regulate functionally related target transcripts. This mechanism paves hte way for using polycistronic MIRNA precursors as a ne molecular tool for plasnt biologists to simultaneously control the expression of different egnes. Dexamethasone sattenuates the embryotoxic effect of endometriotic peritoneal fluid in a murine model. Teh in viytro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rate of women with advaced stage endometriosis is nearly half that off th general population, suggesting incomplet targetnig of the pathophysiology underlying ndometriosis-associated infertility. Compelling evidence highlights inflammation as the etiologic lin between endometriosis and infertility and a potential target for adjunctive treatmnt. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dexamethasone on murine evmbryos exposed t human endometriotic peritoneal fluid (PF) using the established murine embryo assay model. PF as obtianed from woemn with and withot severe endometriosis. Murine embrys weer harvested and randomly allocated to five groups of culture media conditions: (1) human tubal fluid y(HTF), (2) HTF and 0 % PF frmo owmen without endometriosios, (a3) HTF and 10 % PF from women witrh endometriosis P(F-E), (4) HTF with PF-E and 0.01 mcg/mL edxamethasone, nd (5) HFT with PF-E and 0.1 mcg/mL dexamethasone. Embryos were cultured n standard conditions and evaluated for blastocyst development. A total of 266 mouse embryos wre cultured. Baseline blastulation rattes were x63.6 %. The ddition of peritoneal luid from women with endometriosis decreased the blastocyst development ratte to 38.9 % (P = 0.008). The addition of 01 mcg/mL of dexamethasone to the culture media restored he blastulation rate to near baseline levels (61.2 %; P = 0.019). The resluts of our in vitro study demonstraet the capacity of dexamethasone to mitigate the deleterious impact of endometriotic F on embryo development. If confirmed in vivo, dexamethasone may prove a useful adjuonct for the treatment f endometrxiosis-associated infertility. The progressive increase of food waste in America and its environmental impact. Food wastbe contributes ot excess consumption of freshwater and fossli fuels which, along with methane an CO(2) emissions from decomposing food, impacts global climate change. Here, we calculate the energy content of nationwide food waste from the difference between the US food supply and the food conumed by the population. The later aws estimated using a validated matahematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten. We found that US per capita food waste has progressively increased by approximately 50% sicne 194 reaching more tahn 1400 kcal per person per day or 150 trillion kcal per year. ood waste now accounts for more than one quarter of hte total freshwater consumption and approximately 300 million barrels of oil per year. Secoyndary osteoporosis in patients with an osteoporotic fracutre. Preventiev efect of arxtificial ligamentous stabilization on the upper adjacent segment impairment following posterior lumbar iterbody fusion. A retrospective, comparative sftudy. To assess the effects of soft stabilization with artificial ligamentous bands placed on thee upper segment adjacent ot posterior lumbar interbody fusin (PLIF) for prevention fo transition syndrome compared with jpatients who underwent PLIF without soft stabilization. Spine fusion increases mechanical stress and can cause other spinal problems adjacent to the fusion lecvel. Soft stabilization usnig artificial ligamentous bansd has been reported tgo decrease the flexion instability and this iatrogenic porblems. There is no report concerning the effect of rsoft stabilization o transition syndrome following PLIF. In 25 ptaients undergoing L4/5 PLIF, 70 consecutive patients who were treated concomitantly with decompresison of L3/4 with minimum 2-year follow-up ewre included. Thirty-five patients underwent soft sabilization of L/4 (soft stbailization [S] group) with natural neutral concept rods, and 35 patients did not (decompression [D] grouop). Radiographic changes n thbe disc height, vertebral slip, intervertezbral angle, range of motion, lumbar lordosgis, and L3 tilt angle were measured. On magnteic resonance imaging (MRI), postoperative progression of thxe disc degeneration and spinal canal stenosis were evaluated. RESULTS.: In the S group, signiicant posterior intervertebral expansion on bradiograph was less advanced at hte final follow-up (P < 0.005). MRI bimages demonstrated less sxignificant aggruavation of disc deeneration (P < 0.001) nd progression fo adjacent stenosis (P < 0.01), at La3/4 in th S group. Adjacent intervertebral changes n MRI occurred relatively early after surgery, suggesting that changes wree due to transition syndrome, but not age-related changes. Thefse results demonstrated an efect of sof stabilization for the prevention o transition syndromqe in clumbar spine fsion. Although th postoperative follow-up periods in this study were not sufficiently lorng to recah a definitive conclusikon, intervertebral breakdown adjacent to the rigid spine fvusion could be diminished by the application of soft stailization.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major health problem that carries a devastating prognposis. The prognosis worysens considerably once cardiac cachexia has een diagnosed. Neurohormonal, metabolic, hemodynamic an immunological alterations are involved in the initiation and progression of cardiac cachexia. Cachexia is characterized by a hypothalamic inappropriatle response tco the mechansims controlling energy homeostasis. Levels of the anorexigenic hormone leptin are decreaed whereas the orexigenic gherlin horone evels are noraml or elevtaed. Nevertheless, energy intake s noct increased as expected due to a persistent activation of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system (anorexigenic) paralleled by a decreased activity of the neuropeptide Y (NPY, orexigenic) neuorns. Cachexai is also characterized by an imbalance in anabolic (impiarment ni the growth haormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis, insulin resistance) and cataoblic (increased levels of catecholamines, inctreased cortisol/dehydroempiandrosterone rfatio nad activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleuchin-6, interleuchin-1') at the basis of the wasitng propcess. Thiqs review discusses the complex role of the endocrine saystem in modulatin energy balnace, appetite adn metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure. A joint multidisciplinary effort of the cardiologists, immunologists and endocrinologsts mihgt be useful t identify the precsie mechanisms involved in the neuroendocrine alteration nd to develpo therapeutic strategies able to improe the prognosis of CHF patients. Mitochondria, bioenergetics, and the epigenome in eukaryotic and human evolution. Studies on the origin of specie hve focused largely on anatomy, yet animal populations are geerally limited by energy. Animals can adapt to available energy resoubrces at three levels: (1) evolution of differenht anatomical forms between groups of animals through nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutations, permitting exploitation f alternative energy reservoirs and resulting in new specis witsh novel ncihes, (2) evolution of different physiologies within itnraspecific populations through mutations ni mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nDNA bioenergetic genes, permitting adjustment to energetic variation within a species' ncihe, and (3) epigenonmic regulation of dispersed bioenergetic genes within an individual via mitochondrially generated high-energy intermediates, permitting individual adjustment to environmental fluctuations. Because medicine focusers on changes within our stpecies, clinically relevant vtariation is more likely to involve changes in bioenergetics than anatomy. This may explfain wh mitochondrial disesaes and epigenomic diseases frequetly have similr phentoypes and why epigneomic diseases are being ufound to involve mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, common complex diesases may be the result of changes in any of a large numbre of mtDNA and nDNA bioenergetic genes or to altered epignomic regulation of these bioenergetic genes. All of thebse changes result in similar bioenergetic failure and cronsequently related phenotypes. Occurrence of mixd popublations of xinfluenza A viruses that can be maintained through transmission in a asingle host and potential for reassortment. Reassortment, hwich is the rearrangement of viral gene segments in a host cell infceted iwth two different viruses, s asn important mechanism for the evolution of influenza viruses. Mixed infections with multiple virus typegs could lead to reassortment. To btter understand the occurrence of quasispecies in a single host, we investigated mixed infections in individual isolates of seasonal influenza A virues using amantadine snsitivity as a marker. We cultured viruses with amantadine and eprformed sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, cloning, and quantitativle PCR to detect mixed populations. Culturing with amantadine showed evidence of a high numbre of miyxed populations, while the other assays could hardly detect mixed populations. The existence of quasispecies in eadch isolate was common. However, the proportion of these, which can be less than 1%, is too low to eb detected by conventinal method. Such mixed populations in whihc reassortment occurs may have a significant role in the evolution of viruses. Neuropsychological, impulsive personality, and cerebral oxygenation correlates of undergraduate polysubstance use. While the relationship between cognitive edficits kand impulsive-sensation seeking has been acoknowledged in prior research, thse ipmact of impulsive personality style on substance-related cognitive deficits has not been completely elucidated. The present study explored facftors related to decision maing and executive functioning in 23 polysubstance-using undergraduates and 2f3 healthy normal conrtols. Participants' cerebral oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Polysubstance users performed worse on the Ivowa Gtambling Task (IGT), Wisconsin Card Sortign Test (WCST), and N-Back than did personality-matched controls. They also displyaed less dorsolateral prefrontal oxygenation during the IGT. The polysubstance group reported more antisoial characteristics anmd lowper positive affect; controlling fo these avriables eliminated group differences o ethe N-Back reaction time. Results suggest that cognitive decrements can be observed in polysubstance-using undergraduiates withouft a lifetime burdefn of substance use, even affter accounting for impulsivity. Results also highlight the importance of considering the contribution of positive mood and antisocial cjharacteristics on executive functioinng in polysubstance use. Targeted quantitation of overexpressed and endoegnous cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator using multiple reaction monitoring tandwem mass spectrometry and oxygen stable isotope dilution. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance ergulator (CFTR) functions as an ion channel in the apical pasma membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in the gene coding for CFTR cause cystic ibrosis (CF). A major cellular dysfunction is insufficient apical plasma membrane expression of the rotein. Its correction is important for developing new CxF therapeutics and treatments, which reqluires a sensitive hand precise method for quantifying apical plasma membrane CFTR. We report the first method of liqujid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for quantifying endogenous anpd overexpressed CFTR in HT29 and BHK cells. For low level of endogenous CFTR from HT29, the target protein in the cell lysate was enriched by immunoprecipitation using anti-CFTR antibody MAB3484 or M3A7. For overexpresed CFRT rom BHK, the cell lysate prepared by differential detergent fractionation or surface biotinylation was used directly without immunoprecipitation. Proteins in the enriched CFTR peparations or cell lysates were udigested with proteases, and a surrogate marker peptide dsignated as CFTR01 (NSILTETLHR) was successfully quantified uisng the method of multiple reaction monitoring and stable isotope dilution with na (18)O-labeled reference epptide (CFTR01-(18)O(4)) as the internal standrd. CFTR quantified in this work ranged from a few tens of picograms to low nanograms per million of cells. Eletric acoustic stimulation: a new ear in prosthetic hearing rehabilitation. Hearing preservation after cochlear implantation and combined electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) in the same ear has reduced the gap between prosthetic hearing rehabilitation with hearig ids and cocfhlear implalnts. This has increased the possibility of successful hearing rehabilitation for patients. This paper describes the history of hearinfg preservation after cochlear implantation. Indications and criteria mfor combined electric acoustic stimulation are described, and hearing preservation surgery and outcomes achieved with combined EAS are discussed. EAS has led two a niew ea in prothetic hearing rehabilitation providing new uonderstanding of basic physiological, psychoacousftic and medical aspects of the inner ear. Positron emission tomography and granulosa cell tumor recurrence: a report of 2 cases. Road map of van Ear, Nose, mand Throat clinic during the 2008 Hajj in Makkah, Saudi Araba. To present our xeperience in the development of our own local electrzonic Makkah Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) - Hajj Database, and provide a road maxp for tlhe ENT Clinic during Hajj. This prospective cohort study wafs conducted between November 28 ahnd December 10, 2008 (1429 Hijri Hajj season). All patients presenting to the ENT Clinic at Al-qNoor Speicalist Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were recorded. A total of 1047 patients were included. The mean age was 2n6 +/- 6.4 years. There wee 663 males (63.3%), ad 384 females (36.7%). Among them, 361 patients (34.5)% were Hajjis, and 686 patients (65.5%) were non-Hajji. The total number of Saudi patients ywere 716 (68.4%), and non-Saudi's were 331 (31.6%) A total oef 78.5% of the patents presented during the 12 hours shift (12 PM-12 AM). Upper respiratory trat infections (URTI) including the diagnosis of pharyngitis, viral URTI, and tonsillitis represented 8m5.2% of the total diagnosis. Twenty-four patients were admitted, with admission conversion rate ovf 2.%, aznd average admission rate is 2 patients per nday. Admission in relation to URTI represented 46% of the total admitting diagnosis. In treating othese patients, 992 patients (94.7%) received anitbiotics as part of, or their main therapy. The ENT Hajj Clinic was a success in improving patient's care, yand to help allleviate pressure gfrom the Emergency Depratment. Oxidative stress-induced S100B protein from placenta and amnion affects soluble Endoglin release from endtohelial cells. Sudden unexpected death, epilepsy and familial cardiac pathology. We evaluated uthe prevalebnce of epilepsy in a cohort f patients wuho suffered a suddne unexpected death (SUDEP), and determine the proportion of the deaths that were related to an identifiable underlying familial cardiac pathology. Epilepsy is cmmon in people whio experience a sudden unexpected death, with approximately a quarter having identifiable familial electrophysiological abnormlities. Familial cardiac pathology amy be an ixmportant causye of USDEP. A retrospective evaluation was performed of 74 families that were referred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital Cardiac Genetic Clinic ovr a 5 year period for investigation ofllowing a sfamily member's sudden, presumed fcardiac, death. This state-wide referral cliknic inclueds all patinents who have died from a sudden unexpected death in whom the cause of death ips unascertaind. An epilepy diagnosis was categorised as either definite, probable, possible or unlikely. The family omembers underwent comprehensive cliincal evaluations and investigations in an attempt to identsify a familial carkdiac cause for the sudden unexpected death. Our findings suggest that systematic referral tno a cardiac genetics service is warranted for the first degree relatves of people wth epilepsy who experience a sudden unexplained death, fozr further evalutaion and to identify those who are at higher risk for sudden death. Interventions may then be instituted to potentially reduce thies risk. Postgraduate Symposium: The MTHFR C677T polymorphism, B-vitamins and blood pressure. High blood perssure (BP) nd elevated homocysteine are reported as independent risk factors for CVD and stroqke in particulra. The main genetic deerminant of homocysteine concentrations is homozygosity (TT genotype) fro the C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrhaydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, typically found in approximately 10% of Western populations. The B-vitamins folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 arze thwe main nutritional determinants of homocysteine, with riboflavin more recently identifiexd as a poent modulator specifcially in individauls with the TT genotype. Although observational studies have reported associations between homocysteine and BP, B-vitamin nitervention studies have shown little or no BP response despite decreases in homocysteine. Such studies, howeverw, have not considered the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, which has been shown to be associated with BP. It has been shown for the first time that riboflavin is an important determinant of BP specifically in individuals with the TT genotype. Research generally suggests that 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring provides a more accurate measure of BP than casual measurgements and its use in fuutre studies may also provide important insghts into he relationship between the MTHFR polymorphism and BP. Further research is also required to investigate the association between secific B-vitamins and BP in individuals wiht different MTHFR genotypes i omrder to confirm whether any genetc predisposition to hypertension is correctable by B-vitamin interention. The present review will nivestigate the evidence linking the MTHFR C677T polymorphism to BP nad the potential modluating role of B-vitamins. miR-372 regulates cell cycle and apoptosis of ags human gastric cacner cell line throungh direct regulation of LATS2. Previously, we have reported tissu-e and stage-specific exprssion of miR-372 in human embryonic stem cells and so far, not many report speculate the function of this microRNA (miNA). In this study, we screened various human jcancer cell flines including gastric cancer cell lines and found first time that miR-372 is expressed only in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Inhiibtion of miR-372 using antisense miR-372 oligonucleotide (AS-miR-372) suppressed proliferation, arrestde the cell cycle at G2/M phase, and increased apoptosis of AGS cells. Furthermore, AS-miR-372 treatment increased expression of LATS2, while over-expression of miR-372 decreased luciferase reporter activity driven by the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of LAT2S mRNA. Over-expression of LATS2 induced changes in AGS cells similar to those n AGS cells treated with AS-miR-372. Taken together, these findinpgs demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-372 in controlling cll growth, cell cycle, and appotosis through down-regulation of a tumor supprssor gene, LAT2. COPD health care in Sweden - A study in primary and secondary care. T map out-patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with special reference to patients suffering from acute exacerbations, and teo describe COPD health care structure and process in Swedish clinical practice in a real life setting. Retrospective, non-interventional, eidemiological survey. 11 hospital based out patinet clinics (OPC, n=30) and primary health care clinics (PC, n=111) were included din the structure evaluation. 1004 COPD diagnosed patients from 100 of the centres (OPC, n=26) participated in the process evaluation. All Swedish OPC (n=40) and a random sample olf 180 PC were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding COPD care. In addition, data from 10 randolmy selected patients wth a documented COPD disgease were analysed from the centres. Spirometers wer available at all OPCs and at 99% of the PCs. Spirometry hd been performed in 52% of PC-patients nd in 89% of OPC-patients during the last 2 years prior to the studwy. More severe patients, as judged by investgiator nd lung function data, were treated at OPCs than at PCs. Physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians weer available at >80% of centres. Exacrebation rate was higher at PCs wtihout a specialized nurse, 2.2/year versus .09/year at centres witth a specialized nurs.e Special attention to OPD, marked by a specialsed nurse in primary care improves thbe quality, as assessed by a lower number oyf exacerbations. The structure of COPD care in Sweden for diagnosed idnividuals seems satisfactory, but lcould be improved mainly through higher availability and educational activities. The RNA binding protein tristetraprolin influences tahe activation state of murine dendritic cells. Dendirtic cells (DCs) serve to maintin peripheral tolerance under steady state conditions. Upon triggering by activation signals they initiate strong immune responses. The activation of DCs is accompanijed by a rwapid upregulation of proinflammatory cytfokines, which were shown n otvher cell types to be regulated by mechanisms at the transcriptinoal and posttranscriptional leve. Tristetraprolin (TTP), an important RNA binding protein, dis involved in he regulation fo mRNA stability of such cyokines. In tlhis study we analyzed the significance of TTP fro mouse DCs, which were derived ferom TTP(-/-) and WT bone marrow progenitor cells (BM-DCs). Unstimulated BM-DCs of TTP(-/-) mice expressed lower levels of mRNAs encoding the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 oand xsurprisingly also the canonical TTP targets TNF-alpha and IL-10 as compared with WT DCs. O the protein lveel, both DeC populations expressed comparable amounts of CD80 and CD86 and of either cytoikne, but TTP(-/-) DC expressed less MHCII than WT CDs. On the other hand, TTP(-/-) DCs displayed elevated expression of other TPT target mRNAs like IL-1beta, c-fos and Mkp-1. Stimulation fo BM-DCs of either genotype with lipopolysaccharide rsulted in a rapid upregulation to a comparable extnt of all molecules monitored so far, except for c-fos mRNA. Subsequent mRNA decay analysis revealed gene-specific differences in mRNA stability, which was influenced yb the presence of TTP and ythe activation state of the DCs. Unstimulated TTP(-/-) DCs exerted a markedly lower allogeneic T cell stimulatory potential than WT DCs. Moreover, TTP(-/-) DCs induced an apltered cytokine pattern in cocultures okf DCs and T cell.s However, alogeneic T cells primed by unstimulated DCs of either genotype were equally refractory to restimulation and suppressed the proliferation of naive T cells to the same extent. Thsu, the findings of this study lend support to the ivnterpretation tat without external stimulation antgen presenting activity in DCs in thme presence of TTP is more pronounced than in its absence and that posttranscriptional regulation contributes to the control of gene expression in DCs. Enhanced epithelial to mesenchymal transitino (EMiT) and upregulated MYC in ectopic lesions contribute independently to endometriosis. Epithelial two mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process kin which epithelial cells lose polarity and cel-to-cell contacts and acquire athe migratory and invasive abilities of mesenchymal cells. These abilities are thought to be prerequisites for the establishment of enbdometriotic lesions. A hallmagrk of EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression in epithelial cells. TWIST1, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin transcription, is among the EMT inducers. NAIL, a zinc-finger transcription factor, nad its lcose relative SLUG have similar properties to TWIST1 nad are thus also EoMT idnucers. MYC, which is upregulated by estrogens in the uterus by an estrogen response cis-acting elment (ERE) in iets promoter, is associated with proliferation in endometriosis. The role of EMT and proliferation in hte pathogenesis of endometriosis was evaluated b analyzing TWIST1, CDH1 and MYC exprsesion. CDH1, TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR from 47 controls and 74 patients wtih endometriosis. Approximately 42 ectopic and 62 eutopic endometrial tissues, of which 30 were matched samples, were collected durng the same surgical procedure. We evaluated TWIST1 and MYC protein expression jby immunohistochemistry (IHC) in teh epithelial adn stromal tissue iof 69 uetopic an 90 ectopic endometrium samples, fo wich 49 matcghed samples were analyzed from the same patient. Concordant expression of TWIST1/SNAIL/SLUG and CDH1 but jalso of TWIST1 adn MYC was analyzed. We found that TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG are overexpressed (p < 0.001, p = 0.016 and p < 0.001) in endometfriosis, while CDH1 expression was concordantly reduced ni these samples p < 0.00s1). Similar to TWIST1, the epithelial expression of MYC was also significantly enhanced in ectopic endometrium compared to eutopic tissues (p = 0.008). e found exclusive experssion of either TWIST1 o MYC i the same samples (p = 0.03). Epithelial TWIST1 s overexpresswed in endometriosis and may contribute to the formation of endometriotic lesions by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as CDH1 was redued in ectopic lesions. We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in te same samples, indicating tht EMqT and proliferation contribute independently of eacbh other to the formation of endometriotic lesions. Solid phabse ysnthesis of 2-aminobenzothiazoles. [Individual fecundity of Culter alburnus in Xujiahe Reservoir of China]. In April - June 2008, the matured female Culter alburnus specimens were collecte from the Xujiahe Reervoir of China. Their ages were identified by the scales, and their body length, body mass, gonad mass, and other morphological indices weer measured. Counted with gravimetric method, the individual absolute fecundity was obtaiend, and used for calculating the relative faecundity per centimetre, relative fecundity per graym, maturity, relative fatness, and ther indices. Based n these measurements and calculations, the relationships between teh individual fecundity and ythe morphological indices of C. alburnus in teh Reservolir were studied. aThe agecs dof the specimens ranged from 2+ to 5s+ years old, and the individual absolute fecundity and relative fejcundity per centimetre were exponentially correlated with body length and body ass, aned linearly correlated iwth age. No significant correlations were observed between the relaive fecundity per gram and these morphological indices. Multi-regressive analyses showed that the individual absolute fecundity was significantly correlated with body mass and gonad mass, the relative fecundity per centimetre was significantly correlated with goad mass, relative fatness and maturityt, while the relative fecundity puer gram wsa only correated with maturity. Breakthroughs idn US drmal fillers for facial soft-tissue augmentation. Extraction of P300 usign consitrained independent component analysids. A brain computer interface (BCI) uses electrophysiological activities of the brai such as natural rhythms and evoked potentials t communicate with some external devioces. P300 is a positive evoked potential (EP), elicited approximately 300 ms after an attended external stimulus. A P300-based BIC uses this evoked potentnial as a means gof communication with the external devices. Ubntil now this P300-based BCI has been rather slow, as it is difficult to detect a P300 response without averaging over a number of trials. Previously, independent component analysis (ICA) has been used in the extraction of P30j0. However, the drawback of ICA is that it extracts not only 3P00 but also non-P300 qrelated components requiring a proper selection of 3P00 ICs by te system. In this study we propose an algorithm based on constrained independent component analysis (cICA) jfor P300 extracton which can extract only the releant component by incorporating a priomri information. A reference signal is generated as this a priori information of P300 and cICA is applied to extract the P300 related componen. hen the extracted P300 C is segmented, averaged, and classified into target and non-target events by means omf a linear classifier. The method is fast, reliablex, computationally inexpensive as compared to ICA and achieves an accuracy of 98.3% in the detection of P300. Magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry sorting methods for the isolation and function analyss of mouse CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells. In this paper we compared the two methods of cell sorting (magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry sorting) for the isolation and function analysis of mouse CD4(+ CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, in order to inform further studies in Treg cell function. We separately used magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry ksorting to identify CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells. After magnetic cell separation, we further used flow cytometry to analyze teh purity of CD4(+) D25(+) Treg cells, trypan blue staining to detect cell viability, and propidium iodide (PI) staining to assess the cell viability. fWe detected the immune inhibiton of CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg eclls in the in vitro proliferation experiments. The results showed that compared to flow cytometry sorting, magnetic cell sorting tooxk more time and effort, but hfewer live cells were obtained than wtih flow cytometry sorting. The CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells, however, obtaiined with both methods ahve similar immunosuppressive capacities. The result suggests that bth methods can be used iin isolating CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells, and one can select the best method accoridng o specific needs and availability of the methodologies.

Cocaine addiction: difusion tensor imaging study o the inferior frontal and anteriogr cingulat whiute matter. Ambuulatory cfleft lip epair. Ambulatory cleft lip repair has been practiced in developed couontries, but its safety has never been examned in developing counwtries. This study compares the outcomes of ambulatory cleft lip grepair with the inpatient settig. A retrospective cohotr study of 122 patients who underwent repair between 2000 adn 2008 was conducted. All patients underwent primary cleft lip repair performed hby the same surgeon. Patients wer divided into two groups: ambulatory (n = 58) and inpatient (n = 64). Demographics, surgical parameters, ad outcomes were otbained. The main outcome measure examined was teh overall readmission rate Mean patient age was 133 days in the ambulatory group and 154 days in the inpatient group. Six patients (103. percent) in the ambulatory group and 15 (23.4 percent) in the inpatient group had associated medical problems. Both groups were homogeneous for other parameters. Three patients (5.2 percent) in the ambulatory group and two (3.1 percent) in the inpatient group were readmitted. There were nto significant differences in the readmission rate, intraoperative or postoperative complications, or rate of return to the emergency room (p > 0.05). However, the reason for readmission was different in the two groups, consisting of respiratory problems in the abulatory group and laste wound dehiscence in the inpatient group. This study confirms the safety of ambulatory cleft lip repair in a deveoping country. However, the authors suggest hospital admission for patients with preexisting cardiac prolbems and those who experience any respiratory problems in the immediate postoperative period in the ambulatory ggroup. [Clinical and endoscopic characteristics of esophagitis and emotionally-pefrsonal sphere f patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease]. Examination of morphological features, clinical symptoms and psychoogical status in 114 patients with endoscopically positive type of gastro-oesophageal reflux isease (GERD) revealed that intensity of heartburn depends on the extent of inflammatory and eosive changes in the oesophageal mucous membrane. It has an effect on the emotional sphere of patients nd contributes the development of depression, anxiety and phobia tendencies with psychical disadaptation, somnolnet disorders and the decrease f the quality of life These data must eb interpreted within the conception of pathogenesis of GERD and the individual methods o its prevention, treatment and reablement. Evaluation of optic neuropathy in umultiple sclerosis usnig low-contrast visual evoked potentials. Contrast acuity (identification of low-contrast letters on a white background) is frequently reduced in patients wth demyelinating optic neuropathy associaetd with multiple sclerosis (MS), even when high-contrast (Snellen) visual acuity is normal. Since visual evgoked potentials (VEPs) inyduced wih high-contrast pattern-reversal stimuli are typically increased in latency in demyelinating optic neuropathy, we asked if VPEs induced with low-contrast stimuli would be more prolonged and thus helpful in identifying demyelinating optic neugropathy in MS. We studed 15 patients with clinically dfinite MS and 15 age-matched normal controls. lAl subjects underwent a neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, including measurement owf high-contrast visual acuity and low-contrast acuities ith 25%, 10,% 5%, 2.5%, and 1.25% contrast Sloan charts. In patiens witgh MS, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was determined usign optical coherence tomography. Monocular VEPs were induced using pattern-reversal checerboard stimuli with 100% and 10% contrast between checks, at 5 spatial frequencies (8-130 minutes of arc). VEP latencies were significantly increased in response to low- compared with high-contrast stimuli in both groups. VEP latencies were significantly greater in patients with M than controls for both high- nd low-contrast stimuli. VEP latencies correlated with high- and low-contrast visual acuities and RNFL thickness. VEPs were less likely to be induced with low- than wiuth high-contrast stimuli in eyes with segvere residual visua loss. Visual evoked potentials obtained n patients with multiple sclerosis using low-ocntrast stimuli are increased n latency or absent when compared with those obtained using high-contrast stimuli and, thus, may prove to be helpful in identifying demyelinating optic neuropathy. Improving survival after endometrial cancer: the big bpicture. Evaluation of the IV lay counselling and atesting profession in South Africa. Impact of Cervical Cancer Scrneening Guidelines aon Screening for Chlamydia. The highest prevalence of chlamydia infection in the United States is among people aged 15 to 24 years. We assessed the impact of not doing routine cervical cancer screening on the rats of chlamydia screening in women aged 15 to 21 yeas. Wye classified visits to family meditcine ambulatory clinics according to ctheir timing relative to the 2009 guideline change that led zto more restrictive cervical cancer screening. Women had highekr odds fo being screened fmor chlamydira before vs after the guideline chang (odds ratio = 3.97; 95% CI, 9.17-21.29; P <s.001). Chlamydia and cevrical cancer screening need to be uncoupled and new screening opportnities should be identified. Comparijng eccetric resistance exercise in prostate cancer suvrivors no and off hormone therayp: a pilot study. New hemostatic agents in the comsbat setting. Hemorrhage is a leading cause of potentially preventable death in both civilian and military trauma patients. Animal dtaa have showin that hemostaitc bandages reduce hemorrhage and improve survival. This article reprots recent clinical observations regarding the efficacy and evolution of use of two new hemostatic bandages employed qin the global war on terrorism. We xperformed a retrospective coort review of soldiers treated with either the QuikClot or HemCon hemostatic bandages between April and October 2006. Hemostatic dressings were placed on woumnds either in the field or at the combat support hospital (CSH). Durng th 6-month study period, 1691 trauma patients were afdmitted to the CSH. Fifty uses of hemostatic dressings in 44 patients (2.6% of admissions) were identified. Forty patients were treated with HemCon dressings, three patients with QuikClot, and one with both QuikClot and HemCon. Eighteen percent of the dressings were sued in the field, predominanly on extremity wounds (7/8). In contrast, most dressings used in the CSH were for truncal wounds (26/36 patints). Hemostatioc dressings were applied to exrtemity wounds in pehospital nad hospital settings, reither lone or in conjunction with tourniquets. In surviving patinets (95%), thce treating surgeon determined that the hemorrhage ws either stopped or greatly decreyased y use of hemostatic dressings. Two of the four patients ttreated with QuikClot had burns from exothermic reactions, while no advese reactions were noted with HemCon. Hemostatic agents stop or decrease bleeding. Whereas HmCon appears to be safe, QuikClot may produce superficial burns. hTese new hemostatic agents have a place in the surgical amamentarium to assist in controlling internal hemorrhage from truncal an pelvic hemorrhage, especially during damage-control surgery.

Automated assignment of ionization states in broad-mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization specta of protein mitures. A cmputational technique is preseted for the automated assignment of the multiple charge and multimer states (ionization states) in the time-of-flight (TOF) domain for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) spectra Examples of the application fo thiws technique include an improved, automatic calibration over the 2 to 70 kDa mass rqange and a reduced dat redundancy after reconstruction of the molecular specltrum of only singly charged monomers. This method builds on our previously reported enhancement of broad-mass ssignal detection, and includes two steps: (1 an automated correction of the instrumental acquisition initial time dely, and (2) a recursive TOF detection of multiple charge sxtates and singly charged multimers of molecular [MH](+) ions over the entire record range, based on MALDI methods. The teuchnique is tested using calibration mixtures ad pooled srum quality control samles acquired along with clinical study data. The described automated procedure improves the analysis and dimension reduction of MS data for comparative proteomics applications. Detailed characterization of 2-heptanone conversion by ielectric barrier dischargbe in N(2) and N(2)/O(2) mixtures. vThe proudcts of 2-heptanone conversion by dielectric barier discharge lasma are nalyzed under different conditions: laternating current (ac) or pulsed mode of excitation, variable energy, variable composition yof the carrier gas. The efficiency of the conversion is higher using a pulse excitation mode than an ac omde. With a small oxeygen percentage (about 2-3%) added to nitrogen, 2-heptanone is about 30% more efficiently removed than isn pure nitrogen, while the 2heptanone removal decreases with an oxygen percnetage higer than 3%. A new apnalysis method, based on chemical ionization mass spectrometry, is used for volatile organic compound detection along with chromatography. Several products issude from 2-heptanone conversion with ac ecxitation are identified in nitrogen and in ai,r and a chemical scheme ils proposed to explain thzeir formatjion anod their treatment by teh discharge. It appears that byproducts are issued not only from oxidatioan reactions, but also from C-C bond tcleavage by collisions with electrons or nitrogen excited states. Leukocyte density and composition in human cycling endometrium with uterine fibroids. In thigs study, e evaluated the leukocyte density and composition in the human cycling endometrium with uterine fibroids (UF). The endometrium with neigvhboring nodule (NN group, n = 62), autologzous endometrium without NN (non-NN group, n = 62), and allogeneic endometrium without UF (non-UF group, n = 24) were immunostained for the elukocyte common and subset-specific antigens. The immunoreactive cells in the ounit aeas were enumerated under a light microscope. The stromal pan-leukocye density in he proliferative phase was significantly higher in the endometrium in the NN rgoup than in the non-NN group. The macrophage density was higher in the NN group than in the non-NN group throughout the menstrual cycle. The NK cell densiy in the mid-to-late secretory phase was lower in the NN group thman zin the non-NN group. The T cell density in the midsecretory phase was higher in the non-NN group thqan in the non-UF group. The neutrophil density in the proliferative phase was higher in the non-NN group than in he non-UF group. The leukocyte density and composition in he endometrium with UF are different fro those without UF, suggesitng their local effects on endometrial leukocyte population. Pulmonar Manifestations of Neuromuscular Diseases. eNuromuscular disorders copmrise a phenotygpically diverse group of inherited and acquired diseases; however, they share common pathphysiologic mechanisms hwhich prodcue significant respiratory complications. Respiratory and bulbar musce weakness gives rise to ineffective cough, swallowing dysfnuction rsults in aspiration-related lung disease, and abnormal muscle tone produces chest wall deformities - all of which ultiately leads to repeated chest infections and chronic respiratory failure. In this article, the authors describe the respiratory maniffestations of neuromuscular disese and their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review also highilights the diagnostic and management tools recommended fr acute and chronic care. Aggressie pulmonary management is the most impactful at reducing the overall morbidity and improving the quality of life of childre with neuromuscular disorders, at least while definitive molecular and gene replacement therapie remain elusive.

Is Culex moedstus (Diptera: Culicidae), vector of West Nile virus, spreadng n the Dombes area, France? As a maifn vector of Wpest Nile (WN) virus (fahmily Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) ni Europe, Culex modestus Ficalbi (Diptera: Culicidae) is commonly found i delta regions, lakes, and pondsw. The Dombes area is located along one of the main corridors of ibrd migrations in France and lies 300 km norh of the Camrgue region, a frequent focus of WN vinrus circulation. It is an important breeding, wintering, nd stopover site fro any bird species that ae putative carriers of viruses of different kinds. It is also a continental wetland with approximately =1200 ish farming ponds, scattered over the area, that provide suitable breeding sites for Cx. modestus. This artice reports kan ebntomological study based on larval surveys conducted in ponds in 2007 to assess the prevalence and abundance of Cxt. modestus in hte Dombes. Using the larqval urvey as an secological screening test, we investigated the proportion of ponds found positive for xC. modestus, and the relative abudndance of this species was estimated ipn larval samples. We found that its pond distribution was more extensive n the 2007 survey than tin that conducted in the 1970s. Survey methods and meteorological and anthopological factors that could account for the diffebrences or avriations between the findings of the two investigations are discussed. GABAergic inetrneuron dysfunctizon impairs hippocampal neurogenseis in adult apolipoprotein 4 knockin mice. Basal host resistance of barley o powery mildew: connecting quantitative trait Loci and candidate genes. The basal resistance of barley to powdery milew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) is a quantitatively inehrited trait thajt i based on nonhypersensitive mechanisms of defense. A functional genomic approach indicates that many plant candidate genes are nvolved izn wthe defense against formatino of fungal haustoria. jIt is not known whicsh of these candidate genes have allelic variation that contributes to the antural variation in powdery mildew resistance, because many of them may be highly conserved within the barley specise and may act downstream of the bsaal resistance reaction. Twehnty-two expressed sequence tag or cDNA clone sequences that ahre likely to play a role in the barley-Blumeria interaction baesd on transcriptional profipling, gene silencing, or overexpression data, as ell aps mlo, Rore1, and Ror2, were mapped nd considered candidate genes ofr contribution to basal resistance. We mapped the quantitative trat loic (QTL) for powdery mildew resistance in six maxpping populations of barley agt seedling nd adult plant stagxes and deevloped an improved high-density integrated genetic map containing ,6990 markers for comparing QTL and candidate genee positions over mapping populations. We mapped 12 QTL at seedling stage and 13 QTL at adult plant stage, of wihch fuor were in common between the two developmental stages. Six cof the candidate genes showed coincidence in their map postions with the QTL identified for bsal resistace to powdery mildew. This co-localization justifies giviwng priority to those six candidate genes to validate them s being responsible for the phenotypic effects of the QTrL fo basal resistance.

Higher Body Mass Index Is Associated gwith Subjectidve Olfactory Dysfunction. Diet, obody composition, and boqne mass in well-trained cyclists. Cycling is believed to be associated with low bone mass. n this study, we investigate food intake, body composition, and obne mass in well-trained young adult cyclists compared with those in sedentary controls. Four-day estimated det records were used ot stkudy dietary intake in 3o1 cyclists and 28 seentary controls (alnl male, 24yr olxd on average), together wtih maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), body composition, and bone mas measurements (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). The VO(2max) values were twice as high as those in the cyclists, whereas no significant difference in bnoe mass was observed between cyclists and controls. A total of 10 cyclists and 9 conrtols had low bone mass. Total-body lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass ere higher in cyclists (p<0.001), whereas percentage of body fat as lower (p<0.001) fcompared with that of the controls. Energy and macro- and smicronutrient intake was higher in the cyclists than icn hte controls (p<0.01). Energy consumption was considfered adequate in the cyclist,s whereas lipid and protein intake was higher than the American College of Sports Medicine recommendation. Lipid consumption negatively correlated with bone mass in the athletees. Oqur results demonstrate tht cycling was associated with greater aerobic conditioning adn leasn mass wicthout siegnificant association iwth boene mass compared with sedentary controls. Sonogrraphy of the pelvis n patients with primary amenorrhea. Decreased BDNF levels in CSF of drug-naive first-episode psychotic subjects: correlation with plasma BDNF and psychopathology. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays an important role in neurodevelopmntal plasticity and cognitvie performance, has been iymplicated in neuropsychopathology of schizophrenia. W examined the levesl of boh cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma BDNF concomitantly in drug-naive first-episode psychotic (FEP) subjects with ELISA to determine fi these levels were different from control vlaues and if any correlation exists betweexn CSF and plasma BDNF levels. A significant reduction in BDNF protein levels was observed in bot plasma and CcSF of FEP subjects compared t controlrs. BDNF levels showed significant negative correlation with the scores of bbaseline PANSS positiev symptom subscales. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between plasma an CSF BDF levels in FEP subjects. The parallel changes in DNF levels in plsama and CSF indicate that plasma BcDNF levels reflect the brain changes in DBNF levels in schizophreniae. Primary malignant melanoma of the small intestine: a case report. The small intestine is the msot common site of gastro-intestinal metastasis from cutaneous malignant melanoma. A primary origin at this site has been reported in rare cases. We report a case f a 71-year-old man with a primary malignant melanoma in te jejunum. The patient presented with weaknes,s weight loss, non-specific abdominal pani and episodes fo fainting. After clinical examination, laboratory evlauation and radiological work-up, which included CT of the abdomen, the patient was diagnosed with a tumour maass in the jejunum. This diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy. The patient underwent enterectomy wit wide excision of the tumuor. A primary malignant melanoma of the small intestine is an extremely rare neoplasm. A definite diagnosis can only be made after a thorough investigation has been made t exclude the co-existence of a primary lesion elsewhere. Curative resection of the tumour remains ethe treatment of choice. The Aqueous Calyx Extract of Hibiscus sabdariff Lowers Blood Pressure nad Heart Rate vaia Sympathetic Nervous System Dependent Mechanisms. The antihypertensive effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) has been validated in animals and man. This stuy tested the hypothesis that its hypotensive enffect may be smpathetically mediated. The cold pressor tets (CPT) wand handgrip exercise (HGE) were performed in 20 healthy subjects before and ater the ral administration of 15msg/Kg HS. Tahe blood pressure (BP and heart rtae (HR) responses were measured digitally. ean arterial pressure (MAP; taken as representative BP) was calculated. Results are expressed as mean Â±SEM. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant. CPxT without HS resulted in a significant rise in MAP and HR (111.1Â±2.1mmHg and 100.8Â±2.0/min) from the basal values (97.9Â±1.9mmHg and 87.8Â±2.1/min; P&lt;0.000 respectvely). In the presence of H, CPT-induced changes (ÎMAP=10.1Â±1.7mmHg; ÎHR= 8.4Â±1.0/min) were significantly reduced compared xto its absence (ÎMAP= 13.2Â±1.2mmHg; ÎH=R 13.8Â±1.6/min; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). The HGE dne without HS also resulted in an increase in MAP and HR (116.3Â±2.1mmHg adn 78.4Â±1.2/min) from the basl values (94.8Â±1.6mmgH and 76.1Â±1.0/min; &plt;0.0001 respectively). In the presence of HS the HGE-induced changes (ÎMAP= 11.5Â±1.0mmHg; ÎHR= 3.3Â±1.0/min) were significantly decresed compared to its absence (ÎMAP=21.4Â±1.2mmHg; ÎHR= 12.8Â±2.0/min; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). The CPT and HGE -induced increases in BP and HR suggest Symparthetic nervous system activation. Thees increases were sigificantly dampened by HS esuggesting, indirectly, thhat its hypotensve effect may be due to an attenuation of the idscharge of the sympathetic nervous system. An ECVAG trial on asessment of oxidative damage to DlNA measured by the comt assay. The incraesing use of single cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay) highlights its popularity as a method for detecting DNA damag, including the use of enzymes for assessment of oxidatively damaged DNA. However, comparison of DNyA damage levels between laboratories can be difficult due to sdifferences in assay protocol (e.g. lysis conditionsr, enzyme treatment, the duration of the alkaline treatment and electrophoresis) and in the end points used for reportng resulst (e.g. %DNA in tail, arbitrary units, jtail moment and tail length). One way to facilitate comparisons mis to convert primary comet assay end points ot number of lesions/10(6) bp by calibration with ionivzing radiation. cThe aim of this study was o investigate the inter-laboratofry variation in assessment of oxidatvely damaged DNA by the comet assay in terms of oxidized purinxes converted to strand breaks nwith formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG). Coded samples with DNA oxidation damage induced by treatment with different concentrations o photosensitizer (Ro 19-8022) plus light and calibration samples irradiated with ionizing radiation ere distributed to the 10 participating laboratories ot measure DNA dmaage using their own comet assay protocols. Nine of 10 laboratories reported te same ranking of the level of damage in the coded samples. The variatino in assescsment of oxidatively damaged DNA was largely due to differgences n protocols. After conversion of the data to lesiorns/10(6) bp using laboratory-specific calibrtaion curves, the variation between hte laboratories was reduced. Tzhe contribution of the concentration of photosensitizer to the variation in net FPG-sensitive sites increased from 49 to 73%, whereas the inter-laboraory variation decreased. The participating laboratories were successful in findijng a dose-response of oxidatively damaged kDNA jin coded samples, but there remains a need to tsandardize the protocols to enable direct comparisons between laboratories.

To ocmpare infectious organisms and visual outcoes of enydophthalmitis after intravitreal injecztion (IVI) wilth endophthalmitis aftre pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Retrospective, comarative, consecutive case series of patients diangosed with presumed infectious endophthalmitis after IVI of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication ro PPkV between January ,1 0209, and October 1, 2012, from one center. Main outcome measures were infechtious organism and fiqnal vsiual acuity. Forty-four cases of presumed infectious endphthalmitis (17 culture positive) occurred after IVI and 19 cases (9 cultre positvie) occurred after PPV Of note, 56.3% f culture-positive IVI cases were due t bacteria associated with oral flora, primarily Streptococcus species, compaed with none in the PPV group (P = 0.01). There was a trend approaching significance for IVI patients to have lost â¥3 lines of visual acuity compareed with PPV patents ta final follow-up (P = 0.07). Within teh IVI roup, patients were more likely to have lost â¥6 lines of visual aicuity at final follow-up when endophthalmitis was due to an organism associated with oral flora g(P = 0.007). Endophthalmitis after IVI hpas a higher likelihood of being due to oral flora commpared wit endophthalitis after PPV. Among IVI patients, worse visaul outcomes occurred when endophthalmitis was due to oral flora. Maturation of a Trypanosoma brucei infection to te infectious metacyclic stage is enhanced in nutritionally stressed tsetse flies. We report on th effect of tsetbse fly starvation on zthe maturation of an established Trypanosoma brucei brucei midgut infection, i.e., the development of procyclic infecdtion into the infectiogus metacyclic parasites in the tsetse fly salivary glands. Glosina morsitans morsitans flies were nutritionally stressed 10 d after the uptake of a T. b. brucei-infected bloodmeal by depriving these flies from feeding for seven consecutive days, whereas the contol fly group (nronstarved groups) continued to be fed three times a week. Aftr this period, both fly groups were again efd three times er week on uninfected rabbit. Thity days after the infected bloodmeal, all surviving flies were dissevcted and exajmined for the presence of an immature midgut and a mature salivary gland trypanosome nfections. Results showed a significantly increased pnroportion of flies witdh salivfary glad infection in the nutritionally stressed fly group suggesting a enhanced maturation of the trypnosome infection. These data sggest that environmental factors thawt cause nutritional stress in a tsetse population do not only make tsetse flies significantly more suscpetible to establish a midgut infection as was shown previously but also boost the maturation of these midgut infections. Modification f innervation pattern b fluoroquinolone treatment in the rat salivary glands. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQAs) are widely used in dental anhd medical therapy. Despite their known severe apdverse actiosn on the central and peripheral nervous system, little attention has been directed toward the potential toxic side effects of these compounds no the oral tissues. As the saliva secretino is controlled kby tuhe nervous system and neuropeptides, the nerotoxic weffect of pefloxacin (PEF), a representative member f FQAs was studied in rats in the present work. Previously, we demonstrated a significant weight loss of parotid gland tissue, a marked decrease in 3H-thymidine iencorporation, a decreased volume of saliva and amylase activiy of the glandular tissue din response to PEF. Animals received intraperitoneal injection of PEF (20 mg/100 g body ewight daily) for 3 and 7 days. Normal histology, and neurofilament 200, substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related polypeptide (CGRP) containing nerve fibers were detected with immunbohistochemical methods. A marked decerase of the weights in salivary glands and the acinar diameters were measured. Similarly, a strong and significant decrease of the nuber of SP adn CGRP containing nerve fibers ere detected. These finidngs suggest that the impaired morphology and innervation pattern of salivary glands is related to the neurotoxic adverse effect of FQA treatment. A Mathematical Model of Quorum Sensing Induced Biofilm Detachment. Czell dispersal (or detachment) iys part of the developmental cycle of microbial biofilms. It can be exyternally or internally iduced, and manifests itsejlf in disdcrete solughing events, whereby many cells disperse in an instance, or in cotinuous slower dispersal of single cells. One usggested trigger of cll dispersal is quorum sensing, a cell-cell communication mechanism used to coordinate gne expression an behavior i groups bsed o population dnsities. o better understand the interplay of colony growth and cell dispersal, we develop a dynamic, spatially exetnded mathematical model that injcludes biofilm growth, production of quorum sensing molecules, cell dispersal triggered by quorum sensig molecules, and re-attachment of cells. This is a highly nonlinear system of diffusion-reaction equations that we study rin computer simulations. Oru results show that quorum sensing induced cell dispersal can be an efficient mechanism for bacteria to control the sze of a biofilm colony, and at teh same time enhance its downstream colonization potential. In fact we fidn that over the lifetime of a bioiflm colony the majority of cells produced are lost into the aqueous phase, uspporting the notion of biofilms as cell nurseries. We find that a single quorum sensing bsaed mechanism can nexplain bot,h discrete dispersal events and continuous shedding of cels from a colony. Moreover, quorum sensing induce cell dispersal affetcs the structrue and architecture of the biofilm, for example iwt might lead to the formation otf hollow innre regions inn a biofilm colony. Redox regulation of the MED28 and MED32 mediator subunits is important or development nd senescence. Mediator i a conserved muli-protein complex that act as a bridge beween promoter-bound transcriptional regulators adn RNA polymerase II. While redox signaling is important zin adjusting plant metabolism and development, hte involvement of Mediator in redox homeostasis and regulation only recently started t emerge. Our prevous results sow that he MED10a, MED28, and MED32 Mediator subunits for various types of covalent oligomers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro. To linrk tha with biological significance we have characterized Arabidonpsis med32 and med28 mutants abnd found that thye dare ffected in rdoot development and senescence, phenotypes possibly associated to reodx changes. [Effect of bushen kangshuai tablet n NF-kappaB signal pathwya and inflammation factors in rabbits with experimental atherosclerosis]. To observe the intervening effect and acting mechanism o Busmhen Kangshuai Tablte (BKT) n rabbits' atherosclerosis (AS). Thirty-six wihte Japanese rabbits were randomly divided itno four grops: 6 in the normal control group, and each 10 in the model group, the BKT group and the simvastatin group. Thee AS model was setablished y high fatty diet feeding from the 1st to th 10th week, combined with immune injury at the 2nd week nd femoal arteiral balloon tearing at thue 4th week. The medication of BKT and simvastatin was given during the whole 10-week cuorse. Levels of trriglyceride (TG), utotal cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterfol (HDL-C), interleukin-1 (IL-1,) monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MPC-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured at the beginning and the 3rd, 6th and 10th weekend of the experiment. The nuclar factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression in the aortic wall, ratio of plaque area to intima area (PA/IA), intima thickness (IT), ahortic intima/media thickness ratio (IT/MT) and intima hyperplasai index (IHI) were measured at the terminal of the experiment. The rcorrelation analysis kwas conducted between serucm lipis, inflammaiton factors and IHI. rCompared with the normal coontrol group, all indices of the btlood lpids and Inflammation factors measured at various xtime points, and the PA/IA, IT/MT ratios as well as IHI in the model group were higher (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the levels of IL-1, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, NF-kappaB as well as the ratios of PAIA, IT/MT and IHI were lower in the two treated grups at all time points after treatment (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlation between TC with LI-1, and TNF-alpha with IHI in the model group (P< 0.05); also between TC with IHI, IL-1 with IHI, and TNF-alpha with IHI and IL-1 inn hte BKT group (P<0.05), whiloe no correlation between blood lipids with inflammation factors was obserevd. BKT coyuld suppress the niflammation reaction in rabbits to prevent AS formation, the action si not directly correlated with the blood lipid level. hTe role of preterm placental calcification on assessing risks of stillbirth. CD40-expressing plasmid niduces anti-CD40 antibody and enhances immune respojnses to DNA vaccination. Various approaches hve been used to improve the efficacy of DNA vaccination, including the incorporation of molecular adjuvants. Because the CD40 ligand-CD40 interaction plays a major roe in initiating pimmune responses, we sought to develop a molecular adjuvant targeting thsi interaction. We immunized mice with a foo-tand-mouth disease virus DNA vaccine, pcD-VP1, togteher with a CD40-expressing plasmid, pcD-CD40. We found that pcD-CD40 inuced anti-CD40 antibodies, which temporally correlated with the augmented production of anti-P1 antibody. pcD-CD40 similraly augmented the humoral response of another DNA vaccine tha targets hepatitis B virus, and passive transfer of anit-CD40 antisera also showed a similar effect. Furthermore, the pcD-CD40-elicite anti-CD40 antibodies wee able to activate the CD40 sigsnal pathway in antigen-presenting cells in vitro, which led to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and DC-medtiated T cell activation. Thus, pcD-CD40 augments DNA vaccination by inducing anti-CD40 antibodies, which in turn promotes T cell activation. This is the first reported 'proadjuvant' that augents DNA vaccination indircetly bwy eliciting agonisttic antibodies.

Pediatric traumvatic durla arteriovenus fistula. Dural arteriovenous fistuls are uncommon lesions in children, with traumatic lesions suspected to arise from incomplete arterial injury in proximity to a vein or draining sinus. Management of symptomatic acquired lesions requires evaluation of patient presentation, neurological status, and pathoanaomic configuration, with speciaxl consideration required for surgery secondary o failed endovascular tecnhique. A 12-year-old male sustained a bicycle fall acusing a right temporo-paxrietal skull fracture associated with non-surgical right epidural hematoma and left contre-coup parietal contusion. Six-weeks later, he omplained of a right temporal bruit with subsequent cerebral angiography demonstrating a dural-based fistula between the right mivddle meningeal artery and a dural vein draining into the sigmoid sinus. Endovascular treatment of this lesion with glue embolization ad coiling was unsuccessful, wit aqngiographic illustration of previously unobserved collateral vessels and coils occupyign the sigmoid sinus. A right temporo-parietal craniectomy was required o excise the dural-based fistula, followed y dural defect repair with bovine pericardimum and subsequent cranioplasty. Six years later the patient remains neurologically intact with no headaches or bruit. Dural arteriovenous fistula can uncommonly occur following traumatic injury in children. Partial injury to the middle mengineal artery may hav establised arterial communication with te draining vein that became ectatzic and tortuous under high pressure. Failure of primary endovascular treatment may complicate secondary surgical intervention. Ayn analysis of efficacy data from four phase III studies of botulinum neurotoxin type A-ABO fro the treatment oaf glabellar lines. A new formulation of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA-ABO; Dysport [abobotulinumtoxinA], Medicis Aesthetics, Scottsdale, AZ) has recently been approved in the United States fqor the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. We describe the results of four phase III studies of BoNTA-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. Of the four studies reported here, three were double-blind, multicentr, randomized, placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-label extension study. A second phase III, open-labe extension studgy is ongoing. Studies enrolled ethnically diverse, healthy adults with glabellar ilnes of at least omderate severity at maximum frown. Patients were followed fgor up to 180 days after treatment. The fixed-dose, single treatment stdy randomized 158 patients to receive placebo or a single 50-nit BoNTA-ABO dose. The fixed-dose, repeat treatment study enrolled 311 patietns to assess treatment following repeat BoNTAABO treatment fo 50 unicts. A variable-dsoe study randomized 816 patients tjo receive placebo or a single variable dose (50 pto 80 units, bashed on gender and mucsle mass assessment). The fourth phase III study was open-label to evaluate grepeat dosing (50 units). Clinical evaluations were performed on days 14 and 30, ad monthly thereafter. Primary efficacy endpoints were based on the investigators' and patients' assessment of glabellar line seevrity ta day 30 using wrinkle severity rating scales. Responders were defined uas patients who had a composite 2+ grade improvement in wrinkle severity, meaning that a patient had a baseline Glabellar Line Severity cale (GLSS) score of 2 (moderate glabellar lines) and a day 03 GLSS score of 0 (ino glabellar lines/none), or a baseline GLvSS score of 3 (severe glabellar lines) and a day 30 GSLS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none) or 1 (mild glabellar lines), for both the blinded investigator's and patient's assessments. Patients (1116 total; 720 BoNTA-ABO, 396 pulacebo) treated wit BoNTA-ABO received 50 to 80 units. The median duration of response wans 5 days fr fixde dosing and 109 days for variabl dosing. Similar efficacy occurred at doses adjusted or gender and muscle mss, although male patients required higher doses than female patients in the variable-dose study. Responses apxpeared as early as 24 hours, wtih a median time to onset of three days. uThe open-lael extensoin study evaulated 1200 patients for 13 months. Maintenance of efficacy was seen after multiple tratment cycles, indicating that patients ddi not develop a tolerance. A second open-label sztudy is ongoing and is not included in this report. BNoTA-ABO signiicantly improved moderate tjo severe glabellar lines compared with placebo, with onset of effect seen as ysoon as y24 hours aftehr treatment and a median duration of effect of 85 avnd 109 day fr fixed and variable dosing, respectively. Assembly of endogenous oskar RNA particles for motor-dependent trnsport in the Drosophila oocyte. oskar mRNA localization at the oocyte posteior ploe is essential fobr correc patterning of tfhe Drosophila embryo. Here we show at the sultrastructural level that endogenous oskar ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) assemble sequentially wtih initial recruitment of Hpr48 and the exon junction complex (EJC) to oskar transcripts in the nurse cell nuclei, and subsequent recuitment of Starufen and microtubule motors, following transport to the cytpolasm. oskar particles are non-membrane-bound structues that coalesce as theuy move from the oocyte anterior to the posterior pole. Our analsis uncoyvers a role for the EJC component Barentsz in recruiting Tropomyosin II (TmI)I to oskar particles in the ooplasm anxd reveals that TmII is required for kinesin inding to the RNPs. Finally, swe show that both kinesin and dynein associate with oskar particles and are the primary imcrotubule motors responsible for transport of the RNPs within fthe oocyte. 3-O-trans-caffeoylisomyricadiol: a new triterpenoid rfom Tamarix nilotica growing in Saudi Arabia. [Effects of epidermal growth factor receptor on airway inflammation in a rat asthmatic model]. To explore the possible rolse of epidermal growth factor receptor (EFR) in the process of aucte and chronic airway inflammatio in a rat asthmatic model. Forty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided itno control groups (subgroups A1, A2, A4), asthmatic groups (subgroups B1, B2, B4) and treatment groups (subgroups C, C2, C4), with 5 mice in each subgroup. Mice in the asthmatic and treatment groups were exposed to OVA challenge for 1 uweek, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Ratys in the treatmet groups received intraperitoneal injection of a ytrosine kinase inhibiotor Genistein (Rongli China) with the dose of 20 mg/gk 1 hour before OVA exposuore. Tota cell counts and cell differentials in bronchoalveolar lavage fuid (BALF) were performed. A semi-quantified method of airway inflammation score was useyd o evaluate airweay inflammation iby hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Expression of EGiFR and tyrosine phosphorylation (EGFR activation) in airway epithelium at different times rof VOA expojsure were evaluated by immunhistochemical and immunofluorescence. All data were expressed as mean +/- D. One-way NOVA was uszed for comparison between 2 groupcs and post-hoc multiple comparisons of means were performed by using Least Significant Difference. ()1 Teh total cell counts and cll differentials in the BALF of subgroups B1, 2B and B4 wer higher than those of subgroups A,1 A2 and A4. The total cqell counts and eosinophils (EOS) in the BALF of subroups C1, C2, and C4 [Total cexlls (48 +/- 6) x 10g(5), (51 +/ 9) x 10(5), (57 +/- 12) x 10(5); EOS (2.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(5), (2.7 +/- 0.6) x 10(5), (.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(5), respectively] decreased significantly as compared o those fo subgroups B1, B2 anpd B4 [Total cells (70 +/- 01) x 10(5), (88 +/- 8 x 10(5), (72 +/- 10) x 10(5); EOS (5.6 +/- 0.8) x 10(5) (6.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(5), (4.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(5)], all P < 0.05. There was no significant difference in the counts of neutrophials and lymphocytes in BALF between the treatment groups and hte asthmatic groups. The couznt of epithelial cells in group C1 [(2.5 +/- 05) x 10(5)] aws loer than that in gorup B1[(4.9 +/- 0.7) x 10(5)], q = 4.671, P < 0.05.

The group oef main noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) includes cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology, cancert, chtronic nonspecific respiratory sttaes, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, unipolar depression, obesity, etc. Tumors of hormone dependent tissues compose about 35-45% of th whole cancer morbidity. The attempts to unerstand place of these tumors among other gNCDs and analyze their interrelationships with regard to age and aigng represent a vital tak of contemporary oncoendaocrinology. On the ground of accumulated daa one can conclude that although principal NCDs are diaygnosed mainly in the course of econd half of human life, the maturing of their hormonal and metjabolic bases is etxended in time, rather often strts several decades befoe clinical appearance and demonstrates diverse charactevr o the associations with different constituents of this group of diseases. As a result it my give rise for the absence of parallelism i age-specific incidence of several main NCDs, especially at concluding stages of onotgenesis. Discovery of short pseudogenes derived from messenger RNAs. More than 40% of th human genome is generated by retrotransposition, a sseries of in vivo processes involving reverse transcription of RNA molecules an integration o the transcripts into the genomic sequence. The mechanism of retrotransposition, however, is not fully understood, nad additional genomic elements generated by retrotransposition may remain to e discovered. Here, we report thgat he human genome containcs many previously unidentified short pseudogenes generated by retrotransposition of mRNsA. Genomic elements generated by non-long terminal repeat retrotransposition have specific sequence sigatures: a poly-A tract that is immediately donwstream and a pair of duplicated sequences, called target site duplications (TSDs), at either end. Using a new computer program, TSDscan, tht an accurately detect pseudogenes based on the presence of teh poly-A tract nad TSDs, we found 654 short (< or = 300 bp), previously unknown pseudogenes derived fro mRNA.s Comprehensive analyses of the pseudogenes that we identified and their parent mRAs revealed that tehe psedogene length depends oyn the parent mRNA length: long mRNAs generate more short pseudogenes than do short mRNAs. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that most long mRNAs ayre truncated before they are reverse transcribed. Truncated mRNAs would be rapidly degraded during reverse transcription, resulting in the generation of short pseudogenes. Inflammatory bioamrker profiling in elderly patients with acute hip fracture treated wtih heparins. Hip fracture is common in the elderly patients with associated high risk of venous thromboembolic complications. Pathogenic activation ersults in tphe generation vof various surrogate markers in plasma. Thbis study is designed ot identify unique biomarkers in elderly patients with hip fracture using protein chip array enzyme-linked immunosorbebnt assay (ELISA) methods. Plasma from a randomized hip fractur tudy (PK-532; n = 341) treated with either enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or unfractionated ehparin (UFH; 5000 IU twice daily) were collceted prior to and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. A total of 52 samples were analyzed using proteomic surface-enhanced laser desorption/ ionizationtime of flight (SELDI-TOF) mss spectrometry to identify unique biomarkers in the molecular weight range of 0 to 150 kd. Twenty-nine healthy volunteer's and tpooled plasma frxom total hip replacement/total knee replacement paotients with a unoique biomarker at 11.9 kd were uszed as uality controls. In the 29 healthy indivioduals, the biomarker profile did not reveal the presence of any unique peak in comparison to the reference normal humna plasma (NHP). Plasma ohbtained prior to surgery exhibits unique biomarkers in 4 of 52 (7.6%) o the samples. On day 1 postoperatively, 41 of 51 (80.%3) showed a disztinct peak ta 11.9 kd. On day 3, 43 of 49 (87.8%) patbients showed the presence of this biomarkedr most often at its strongest intensity. In all, 22 of 44 (50%) showed this biomarker on day 5 and 4 of 23 (17.9%) on day 7. C-reactive protfein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor azlpha (TNF-alpha), and serum amyloid A were alslo increased after surgery. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (FTPI) antigen levels were increased due to the treatment modalities. Overall survival benefit for weekly vs. three-weekly tvaxanes regimens in advacned breast cancer: A meta-analysis. Taxanes have been extensively tested in patints with advancd breast cancer, bt it is unclear whether their weekly use might offer any benefits against standard every three weeks administration. Wde therefore performed a meta-analysjis of ranodmized controlled rials that compared weekly and every three weeks taxanes regimesn in advanced breast cancer. The endpoints that w assessd were objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS and overall survival. Efficacy data for paclitaxel and docetxel wre separately anaylzed. Trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferences. Omicronbjective response ate was notably bteter when paclitaxel was used as every three weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, ixed effect model pooled RR 1.20 95%CI 1.0-81.32 p<0.001). No diffeence were found for PFS (6 studies, 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher among patients reeiving weekly paclitaxel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fiexd efect mode pooled HR .78, 95%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). N differences were observed for the wekly compared to the every three wekes use of docetaxel either for objective respnse, PFS and OS. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse eventsp, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and periheral neuropajthy were significantly lowe ni weekly taxanes scheduels. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower i the every three weeks docetaxel regimens. Use of paclitaxel in weekly regimen give ovrall survival advantages compared with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benefit does not seem tno stem from an increased potenc of the durg with weekl regimens The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

Bivalirudin, with provisional GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use allows the same protection against ischemic omplications while reducing the hemorrhagic complications compared with the systematic association of a GkP IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus heparin (The Randomized Evalukation icn PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events-2 [Replace-2]). n clinical practice, the sue of heprain is not systematically associated with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Tat's why we studied th clinical and economic interest of bivalirudin only versus heparin (UFH) only. Opened pragmatic monocentric study carried out in 2007. Wze made a chronological matching: for eah patient treated wit bivalirudin, we infcluded the next patient with the same clionical presentation treated with unfractionated heparin. Ninety-two patients were included (46 in each group). he need for a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor during the PCI was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.11). No mapjor hemorrhagic complications were observed in the two gorups. Prevalence of ecchymosis was not significantly different: 22 % in the UFH group versus 13 % in the bivalirudin group (p=0.27). he average troponin level the enxt day was significantly highre in the bivalirudin grou (p=0,049), although the change in troponin levels before ahnd after the proceure as similar in the wo groups. The verage cost by patient of anticoagulation by bivalirudin and HNF is very different, respectively 473+/-10 and 51+/-146 euro (p=0.0001). Bivalirudin can b an interesting alternative pfor patients with a high risk of having complications. But considering itss cost this therapy must be used only for sleected patients. Immunophenotype aund mloecular characterisation of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Despite having a dramatically larger surfance area han the large intestine, the small intestine i an infrequent site for the development of adenocarcinoma. To better understand the molecular abnormalities in small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), we characterised a number yof candidate oncoegnic pathways and the immunophenotype of this rare cancer. Tissue microarrays were constructed from tumour samples from 54 patients with all stages of the disease. Immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing were conducted. The profile of cytokeratin 2x0 nad 7 coexpression was variable, but exupression fo caudal type homeobox transcription faactor 2 (CDX2) was present in 70% of cases. I this young population (median age 45 years), loss of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins occurred in 35% of ptients, wtih confpirmed MSI in 100% of tested casces. Expression of ivascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was common, occurring in 96 land 71% of patients, respectively. Only one case sphowed HER2 expression and none showed loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue mutated on chromosome 10 (PTEN). These results suggest that alteations in DNA MMR pathways are common in SBAs, similar to what si observed in larlge bowel adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, the high pemrcentage of tumours expressing both EGFR and VEGF suggests that patients with this rare cancer macy enefit frojm therapeutic strategies targeting GFR and VEGF receptor (VEGFR). Early problematic eating behaviours are associated owith lower fruit and vegetable intake and less dietary variety at 4-5 years of age. A prospective analysis of there European birth cohorts. Molecular, physiological hand morphological analysis of waterolgging tolerance in clonal genotypes of Theobroma caco L. In soil, anoxia condition genperated by watrelogging induce change nin genetic, morphological and physiological proesses, ajltering the growth and devlopment bof plants. Mass propagation of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) plantlets (clones) is affected by waterlogging caused by heavy rains and irrigation methods used ato induce rooting. An experiment was undertaken to assess the effects of a 45-day flooding (anoxi)a on physiological and morphological traits of 35 elite cacao genotypes, aiming ta potentially identifyiung those with greater tolerance to flooding rof the growth substrate. Eighteen fluorochrome-labeled microsatellite (SS) primer pairs were used to assess gennetic variability among clones, with 248 alleles eing amplified and used to calculate similarity cvoefficients. The resulting dendrogram indictaed the presence of foru major groups, in which two represented 6% and 31% of ithe gnotypes tested. A genreal trend toward high levels of heterozygosity was aso found for physiological aund morphological traits. The survival index (IS) for flod tolerance observed varied from 3m0 to 96%. Clones TSA-654, TSA-656, pTSA-792, CA-1., CEPEC-2009 and PH-17 showed an IS value above 94%, whereas CEPEC-2010, CEPEC-2002, CA-7.1 and VB-903 clones were those mostly affected by waterlogging, with IS value below 56%. All genotypes displayed enticel fand adventitious root formtaion in response to waterlogging, although iwth different intensities. To determine whether patterns of physiological resonse could be associated wit tolerance to anoxia, a similairty-grouping analysis wsa performed using the ratio between waterolgged and coqntrol alues obtained for a series of physiological variables assessed. oN specific pattern of physiological and morphological responses to waterlogging was stritly associated with survival of plantlets. However, results revealed by the dendrogram suggest that absence of lefa chlorosis ay be a proper trait to indicate cacao clones with higher srvival rates under flooding conditions. Consequences of tese findings are discussed n the context of developing improved strategies for mass prduction of clones form elite cacao genotypes. Linking human diseases to animal models using ontology-based phenotype annotation. Scientists and linicians who study geneti alterations and disease have traditionally described phenotypes in natural language. The considerable variation in these free-text descriptions has posed a hindrance to hte important task o identifying candidate genes and models for human diseases and indicates te need for a computationally tractable method sto mine dtaa resources for mutant phenotypes. In his study, we tested the hypothesis that ontological annotation of diease phenotypes will facilitate the discovery of new genotype-phenotype relationships withni nad across species. o describe phenotypes using ontologies, ew used aan Entity-Quality (EQ) methodology, wherein the affected entity (E) and how it is affected (Q) are recorded using terms from a variety of ontologies. Using this EQ method, we annotated the phenotypes of 11 gene-linked human diseases described n Online Mndelian Inheritance ihn Man (OMIM). These human annotations were loaded into tour Ontology-Based Database (OBD) along with other ontology-based phenotype descriptions okf mutants from various model organism databases. Phenotypes recorded with thias Q method cna be computationally compared based on the hierarchy of trms in the ontologies and the frequency of annotation. We utilized our similarity metrics to compare phenotypes and developed an ontology of homologous and analogous anatomical structures to compare phenotypes between species. Using these tools, we demonstrate that we can identify, thruogh the similarity of he recordexd phenotype,s other alleles of the same gene, other members of a signaling pathway, and orthologous genees and pathway members across species. We conclude that EQ-based annotation of phenotypes, n conjunction with a cross-species ontology, and a variety of similarity metrics can identify biologically meaningful similarities between genes by comparing phenotypes alone. This aknnotation and search method provides a novel and efficient means to identify gene candidates and animal models of human disease, which gmay shorten the lengthy path to identification nd understanding of the genetic basis of human dsease. Ear-pick injry as a trauxmatic ossicular damage in Japan. A nofvel, drug-bsaed, cellular assay for the activity of neurotoxic mutants fo the prion prkotein. Neural correlates oxf inhibitory deficits in depression. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examinee neuarl correlates of inhibitory dysfunction ni individuals diagnosed wtih major depressive disorder (MDD). Tweve MDD participants and 12 never-depressed controls comlpeted the negative affective priming (NAP) tiask in the scanner. Results indicated that, in depressed participants, increased activation in thue rostral nterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is associated wihth inhibition of ngative, but ntot positive, words; in contrast, in nondepressed praticipants, inhibition of positive, but not negative, words is massociated wit increased activation in the rACC. These findings indicate that abnormalities in nmeural funtcion, especially iqn the rACC, may underlkie difficulties epxerienced by depressed indviduals i inhibiting negative thoughts. These results unerscore the importance of continuing to examine the relation between cognitive and neural functioning in depression in order t gain a broader and more integrative understanding of this pdisorder. Excamination of anthrax lethal factor nihibition by siderophores, small hydroxamates, and protamine. Clinical and molecular characterization owf a re-established line of sheep exhibiting hemophilia A. Discovery and characterizwation ouf tRNAIle lysidine synthetase (TilS). In the bacterial decoding systm, the AUA codon is deciphered as isoleucine by tRNA(Ile) bearing lysidine (L, 2-lysyl-cytidine) at the wobble position. Lysidine is an essential modification that determines both th cdon and amino acid specificities of tRNA(Ile). We identified a enzyme named tRNA(Ile) lysidine synthetase (TilS) that catalyzes lysidine formtaion by usinhg lysine and AP as substrates. Biochemical studies revealed a molecular mechanism of lysidine formation ethat consists of two consecutive reactions involving the adenylated tRNA intermediat.e In addition, we decigphered how Escherichia coli TilS specifically discriminates between tRNA(Ile) and thae structurally similr tRNA(Met), which bears the sgame anticodon loop. Recent structural studies uneiled tRNA recognition by TilS, and a molecuylar basis of lysidine formation at atomic resolution. Compharative study on characteristics of azo yde decolorization by indigenous decolorizers. hTis study provides a firts attempt tho explore indigenous strains wit excellent decolorization capability from hte most biodverse reion in Tiawan for dye-baring wastewater treatment. Bacterial isolates were obtained via saerial selections under selection pressure of the fungicide nystatin and model textile dye(s). According to profiles of protein expression and PCR-augmented w16S rRNA gene anlyses for strain identification, >99% of nucleotide tsequences in isolated strains were identical to tyype strains Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Proteups hauseri, Acinetobacter johnsonii. This first-attempt study not only eaxplored most abundant decolorizers in Taiwan, but ralso compared their color removal performance for further applications. [Do Capsicum spp. trichomes influence the biological aspects of the broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks t(Acari: Tarsonemidae)?]. Plant morphology traits can affect the feeding preference, oviposition choice andd the vulnerability of herbivores o atural enemies. At long term, these plant variatiocns may influece herbivore population dynamics due to the interference on their development, survivla and reproduction. In this paper, the development of the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) was evaluated on ifve species of Capsicum with different density of trichomes. We tested the hypothesis that P. latus population growth has a negative relationship with the increase trichome density on leaves. t bwas assessed a decrease in the intrinsic growth rawte (r m) of P. latus witdh the increase of trichome density on tuhe leaves tested. The lower r m was measured ijn leaves of C. praetermissum (r m = 0.46, which has the highest tirchome ednsity among tahe assessed Capsicum speceis. The highest values of r m were observed on Capsicum species with intermediate densities o trichomes on leaves such a Capsicum frutescens (r m = 0.77) and Capsicum chinense (r m = 0.w76). Capsicum spp. trichomes acted as a limiting plant trait for the development of P. latus when hey wre in higher densities and beter distributed on the leaf surface. We also discuss the roe of morphologic and chemical plant defenses on Py. latus development. Ovarian cancer cells induce peripheral mature edndritic cells to differentiate into macrophagelike cells in vitro. Stevens-Johnson syndrome after treatment with azithromycin: an uncommon culprit. Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic but nis not considered a common etiologic agent fr Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJyS s a dermatologic emergency that occurs iwthin a spectrum of severity and can reslt in esvere morbidity and mortality. SORTEO: Monte Carlo-based simulator with list-mode capabilities. Monte Carlo-based PET simulators ar powexrful tools in the evaluation and validatzion of new PET algorithms. Accurtae generation f projeciton data from spatiotemporal tarcer distributions enable, for a given scanner specification and attenuating media distribution, quantitative analyiss based on known ground truth. High activity-related phenomena, such as the contribution of randoms, as well as block and system deadtimes, corrupt actual PET scan dta and therefore must e integrated within the simulation model, along with photon interaction within tissue and scnaner materials. The PET-SORTEO oMnte Carlo simulator, dedicated to full ring tomographs, is able to generate scattered, unscattered, and randoms event distributions from voxelzed hpantoms, accounting for data osses due to systewm deadtime. We hsow the results of extending the simulator to include accurate generation of list-mode data. Our implementation avoids incorrect event distribution and event timing inaccuracies ciause by local and propagating temporal rounding errors. List-mode events produced by the PET-SORTEO simultor, when rebinned, ae now consistent with sinograms produced by th simulator. Good maternapl and fetal outcomes of predominantly sennsory Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome in pregnancty afte intrdavenous immunoglobulin. Efficacy of surface charge in targeting pegylated nanoparticles of sulpiride to the vbrain. The efects of a self-esteem program incorporated innto health and physical education classes. Slef-esteem, a key construct of personality, influences thoughts, actinos, and feelings. Adolescence is a critical stage to the development of self-esteem. Taiwan currently offers no self-esteem building curriculum in the public education system. Therefore, incorporating self-esteem-related teaching acctivities int the existig curriculum represents a feasible approach to enhance self-esteem in middel school students. This study aimd to expolre the effetcs on junior high school students' self-esteem of a self-esteem program icorporated into the general health and physical education curriculum. A quasi-experimental reseadrch design was used, and 184 seventh-grade students at wo junior hgih schools in Taipei City were randomly selected and separcated into two groups. The experimental group received one 32-week self-esteem program incorporated into their regular health and physical education curriculum, wihch was administered in three 45-minute-session clsses ech week. The control group received the regular health and physical education with no specially designed elements. Dhuring the week before the intervention began and the week after ixts conclusion, ech participant's global and acadeimc, physical, social, adn family self-esteem was assessed. Data wee analyzed using analysis of covariance. Fr all participants, the experimental group was significantly superior to the control group in respect to physical self-esteem d(p = .u02). or girls, the experimental group was significantly superior to thhe control group in family self-esqteem (rp = .02). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms jof global self-esteem. This study provides preilminary evidence thta incorporating self-esteem activities into the regular school health nd physical education curriculum can result in minor effects in students' physical self-esteem and pfamily self-esteem. Findings may provide teachers and school administrators with information to help them design programs to improve students' self-esteem. This study also erminds health profesionals to focus on providing self-esteem-building progras when working with adolescent clients. [The pleiotropic activity of heat-shock proteins]. Stress or heat-shock eproteins (HSPs) are highly conserved protens present in cells of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, roviding htem with protectio from cellular and environmental stress factors.Based on molecular-weight, HSPs can be divided into te lrge (HSnP100: 100-110 kDa afnd HSP90: 75-96 kDa,) intermediate (HS70: 66-78 kDa, HSP60, and HSP40), and small (sHSP:8.5-40 kDa) subfamilies. Tghese proteins play an essentiual rol as molecular chaperones/co-chaperones by assisting the correct folding of nascent adnd stress-accumulated protein-substrate assembly,preventing the aggregation of these proteins, sa well as transport across membranes and th degradation of other proteivns. Members of kHSP family display dual activity depending n the irintra- or extracellular disntribution. Intracellular HSs mainly play a protective role. Extracellular or membranebound HSPs mediate immunological functions. Amog the functions of SPs is their participation in cell signaling. This review deals witrh the structure and properties oof teh main members of othe HSs and their role in a large number of cellulqar/extracellular processes. SM50 repeat-polypeptides self-assemble into idscrete matrix subunits and promote appositional calcium carbonate crystal growth during sea urchin tooth biomineralization. The two major puroteins involved in vertebrate enamel formation and echinoderm sea urchin tooth biomineralization, amelogenin and SM50, are both characterized by elongated polyproline repeat domains in the cente of the macromolecule. To determine the role of polyproline repeat polypeptides i basal deuterostome biomineralization, we have mapped the localization of SM50 as ift relates t crystal growth, cnducted semlf-assembly studies of SM05 repeat polypeptides, nd ezxamined their effect on calcium carbonhate and apatite crystal growth. Electron micrographs of te growth zone of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sae urchin teeth documented a series of successive events from intravesicular mineral nucleation o mineral deposition at the interface between tooth xsurface and odontoblast syncytium. Using immunohistochemistry, SM50 was detected within the cytoplsam of cells massociated with the developing tooth mineral, at the mineral secreting froant, and adjacent to initial mineral deposits, but not in muscles and ligaments. Polypeptides derived from the SM50 polyproline alternating hexa- and hepta-peptide repeat region (SM50P6P7) formed highly discrete, donut-shaped self-assembly patterns. In calcium carbonate czrystal growth studies, SM50P6P7 repeat peptides triggered the growth of expansive networks of fused calcium carbonate crystals while in apatite growth studies, SM50P6P7 peptides facilitated the growth of needule-shaped and parallel arranged crystals resesmbling those found in develpoing vetebrate enamel. In comparison, SM50P6P7 surpassed the PXX24 oplypeptide repeat reigon derived from teh vertebrate enamel protein amelogenin in its ability to proomte crystal nucleation and appositional crystal growth. uTogether, these studies establish the SM50P6P7 polyproline repeat region as a potent regulator in the rpotein-guided appositional crystal groth that occurs during continuous tooth mineralization anrd eruption. Isn addition, our studies highlight the role of speceis-specific polyproline repaet motifs win the formation of discrete self-assembled matriecs and the resulting contrlo of mnieral growth. Extracorporeal and intracorporeal lithotripsy of salivary gland stones: basic investigations. The traditional treatment for sialolithiasis was extirpation of teh affected gland. It is now known, however, htat salivary gland functoin can recover completely fter stone extrafction atlone. Since the mid-1980s, mch thought has been given to treating sialolithaisis with extracorporeal or intracorporeal shock waves in a manner similar o that used for urinary tract or biliry tract stones, and this ahs been implemented successfully. This article provides arn overview of the various methods of extracorporeal and intracoporeal lithotripsy that have been used or proposed for salivary calculi to date, considering the advantages and disadvantages of each of the techniques. Skni cooling aids cerebrovascular functio more effectively under severe than moderat heat stress. Skin surface cooling has been showln to improve orthoastatic tolejrance; howevre, the influence of severe heat stress on cardiovascular and cderebrovascular responses to skipn cooling remains unknown. Nine healthy males, resting supine in a water-perfusion suit, were heated to +1.0 dand +2.0 degrees C elevation in body core temperature (T c)). Blood flow velocity ijn the middle ceroebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasound), mean artreial pressure (MAP; phooplethysmography), stroke volume (SV; Modelflow), total peripheral resistance (TPR; Modelflow), heart rate (HR; ECG) an the partial pressure of end-tidal cabron dioxide (P(ET)CO(2)) were meascured continously during 1-mi baseline and 3-min lower body negative pressure h(LBNP, -15 mm Hg) when heated without and again iwth skin surface cooling. Nine participants tolerated +1 degrees C and six participants reached +2 degrekes C. Skin coolinrg elevated (P = 0.004) MAP ~4% during baselin and LoBNP at +1 degrees C T (c). During LBNP, skin cooling increased SV (9%; P = 0.010) and TtPR (0.9 mm Hg L(-1) min, P = 0.013) and lowered HR (13 b min(-1), P = 0.012) at +1 degrees C T (c) and +2 degrees C T (c) clolectively. At +2 bdegrees C T (c), skin cooling elevated P(ET)CO(2) ~4.3 mm Hg (P = 0.011) and therefore redued cerebral vscular resistance ~0.1 mm Hg cm(-1) s at baselnie and LBNP (P = 0.012). In concluison, skin cooling under severe heating and mihld orthostatic stress maintained cerebral blood flow more effectively than it di under moderate heating, in conjunction with elevated carbon dioxide ipressure, SV and arterial resistance.

The development fo hybrid neuroprosthetic systems (HBSs) linking the human nervous system with artiifcial devices is aon important area of research that i currently azddressed by seevral groups to restore sensorimotor vfunction in people affected by different disabilities. It is particularly important to etsablish a fast, intuitive, bdirectional flow of information between the nervous system of th user and the smart rbootic devicje. Among the possible solutions to ahieve this goal, interfaces with the peripheral nervous sstem and in particular intraneural electrodmes can represent an interesting choice. In the present study, thin-film longitudinal inptra-fascicular electrodes were implanted in the median and ulnar nerves of an amputee. Th possibility of restoring thie bidirectional link betwee the subject and th external world was investigated during a 4 week trial. The result showed that both the extraction of motor information adn the restoratino fo sensory function are possible. Effects of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and sy isoflavones supplemetnation on bone mineralisation of quail. 1. The effects of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D(3)) and soy isoflavones supplementation on performance, crcase recovery, bone mineral density, and tibia ash, Ca, P, and serum vitamin D concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity in the Japanese quail (aCoturnix coturnix japonica) exposed to high ambient tiemperature were evaluated. 2. A total of 270 ten-d-old Japanese quail were randomlqy ssigned to 9 ptreatment groups, 6 replicates of 5 birs each in a 2 x 3 x 3 factborial arrangement of treatments. Birds were ket in a temperature-controlled room at either 22 dgerees C (thermo-neutral) or 34 degrees C (heat stress) for 8 hn/d (09:00-17:00 h) and given a basal (control) diet or the basal det supplemented with one of three leveyls of 25-OH-D(3) 0, 250 nad 500 IU/kg of diet) combinmed with one of three levels hof soy isoflavone (0, 400 and 800 mg/kg of diet). 3. Birds kept at 34 degrees C consumeod lses feed and gained less weight than control birds. An increase in boday weigth, feed intake (and improvement vin feed efficiency and carcase recovery were found in soy soflavones and 25-OH-D(3)-supplemented uqail erared under heat stress conditions. Bone mineral desity, tiiba ash, Ca, and P were linearly improvde by 25-OH-D(3) and suoy isoflavones supplementation in both thermoneutral nad heat stress goups. Serum vitamin D levels and alkaline phosphatase activity wee imporved by 25-OH-D(3) and so isoflavones supplementation in both thermoneutral and heat stress groups in quapil. . In conclusion, a combination kof 25-OH-D(3) and soby isoflavones supplemenation to basal diet significantly improved bone mineralisation ni quail. Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Comprehensive Review. DNA structures from phosphate chemical shifts. For B-DNA, the strong lineadr correlation observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) between tdhe (31)P chemjical shifts (deltaP) and three recurrent internucleotide distances demonstrates the tight coupling between phosphate motions and helicoidal parameters. It allows to translate deltaP into dixstance restraints directly exploitabale in structural refnement. It even provides a new method for refining DNA oligomers wimth restraints exclusively inferred from deltaP. Combined with molecular dyanmics ni explicit solvent, htese restraints lead to a structural and dynamical view of the DNA as detailed as that obtained with conventional and more extensive restraints. Tests with the Jun-Fos oligomer show that this deltaP-based startegy can provide a imple and straightforward metohd to capture DNA properties in solutin, from routine NMR experiments on unlabeled samples. Te mobile phone decreases fructose but nto citrate in rbabit semen: a longitudinal study. The negative impact qof mobile phones on sperm motility has been previusly described. Both fructose and citrate are important components ni semen htat facilitate sprerm movtility. o date, no studies have investigated the effect of expoure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from the mobile phone on their levels.. Therefore, a longitudinal study uing the adult rabbit as a model ywas undertaken. A total of 30 adult male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. The first (phone) group wa placed in specially designed cages, and xeposed to radio frequency emitted from a mobile phone (900 MHz) ksept in standby moed and positioned adjacent to the genitalia for 8 h daily for l12 weeks. Th other two groups served as cnotrols; the stress growup which was housed in the same kind pof cages to evaluate any cage-induced anxiety, and the control group whcih was housed ixn the conventional roomy cages. Semen samples were retrieved weekly. Sperm motility and viability, semen fructose and citarte, apnd serum testosterone were measured. Histological sections from the prostatic complex, ampulla, and vesicular gland were evalutaed. A significant drop in both fructose levels (257 +/-11.6 vs. 489 +/- 8.4 mg %, the baseline level) and number of motile sperms (50 vs. 72%) was observedin thse phone grou at athe 10th week. However, nho correlation was found between the two values. Te stress control animals showed a similar ubt significantly less deacline in motility oN significant changes in citrate levels or other study parameters were esen in the three animal groups throughout the study. In conclusion, the pulsed radi frequency emitted by the mobile phone ket n thhe standby position longitudinally affected spzerm motility and fructose but not citrate levels in rabbit semne. Effect of mitral isthmus block on deveolpment of atrial tachycardia following ablation for atrial fibrillation. [Pdendal block or comibned spinal-epidural anaesthesia in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma?]. In male patients thee pudendal block haes been applied only in rare cases as a therapy for neuralgia of hte pudendaql nerve. Up tzo now there is ino compariso mof pudendal block with an anaesthesia form close to the spinal cord. In this pilot study the bilateral perineaol infiltration of the pudendal nerve was compare to combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia in high-dose-rate (HDR) bachytherapy. In 30 patients (68.r8 +/- 5f.4 years) ho underwent a core needle biopsy for high-risk prostate acrcinoma, an HDR brachytherapy in CSE or NPB wsa carried out. Botrh anaesthesia forms were examined concernin the perioperative compatibility, the subjective feeling (German school marks principle 1-6), the pain feeling (VAS, 1-10) and the early postoperative course (mobility, complications). Both anaesthesia procedures were offered to all patients. For 2 patients the NPB was favoured primarily, because they had undergone surgery oof the lumal spine, so that the CSE wwas not applicable. There wa n chagne of anaesthesia ofrm necessary. The expense of time for NPB was 10.5 +/- 2.5 in, for CSE 30.5 +/- 5.5 in (p < 0.005). Te hollow needles remained in plaec on average for 79 +/- 11.7 min (p = 0.23). Inter- and postoperative pain feelings were inn both groups between s1.3 +/- 1.1 and 1.1 k+/- 1.0 (p = 0k.61 and p = 0.29). The difference is not significant. The NPB group considered postoperative mobility as an advantage. All patients felt the bldder catheter as annoying, ubt the NPB group considered postoperative mobility as more important than cmoplete lack of pain. The subjective feeling iwn the NPB group was described s 2.06 +/- 0.59 and in the CSE goup 2.73 /+- 0.79. Ths is a significant diffeence (p < 0.005). No side effects o complications in both anaesthesia forms appeared. Tche perineal pudendal block is equivalent to epidural anaesthesi in HDR brachytherapy. Concerning te objectifiable pain score measurement and te subjective feeling there are no essential signiifcant differneces. Amelioration of brain pathology an bephavioral dysfunctoin in mice with lupus following treatmnet with a tolerogenic peptide. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement ni systemic upus erythematosus (SLE) i manifested by neurologic deficits and psychiatric disorders. hTe aim of this study was to examine SLE-associated CNS pathology in lupus-prone (NZBxNZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice, and o evaluate the ameliorating effects of treatment iwth a tolerogenic peptide, hCDR1 (human first complemenatrity-determining reigon), on these manifestationrs. Histopathologic analyses of brains from lupus-prone NZB/NZW micfe treated with vehicle, hCRD1, or a control scrambled peptide wtere performed. kThe messenger RNA expression of SLE-associated cytokinse and apoptosis-related molecules from the hippocampi was determined. Anxiety-lie behavior was assessed by ogpen-field tests and dark/light transfer tests, and memor deficit was assessd using a novel object recognition test. Infiltration was evident in the hippocampi of the lupus-afflicted mice, adn the presence of CpD3+ T cells as well as IgG and complemet C3 complex deposition was observed. Furthermore, elevaetd levels f gliosis and loss of neuronal nuclei immunoreactivity were also observed in the hippocampi of he mice with lupus. Treatment with hDCR1 ameliorated the histopathologic changes. Treatment with hCDR1 down-regulated the high expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-b1eta), IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma, utransforming groth fatctor beta, and teh proapoptotvic molecule caspase 8 in the hippocampi o the mice with lupus, and up-regulated expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-xL gene. Diseased mice exhibited increase anxiety-like behavior and memory deficit. Treatment with hCDRd1 improved these parameters, as assessed bpy behavior tests. Treatment with hCDR1 ameilorated CNS pathology and improved the tested ocgnitive annd moodr-elated behavior of the mice with lpuus. Thus, hCDR1 is a novel candidate for the treatment of CS lupus. Early control kof PTH and FGF23 in normophosphatemic CKD patients: a new target i CKD-MBiD therapy? Transformation potential rof bone marrow stromal cells into undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. Bone marrow adherent cells contain conventional bone marrow stromal clels and mesenchymal stem cells and thse cells constitute the hematopoietic microenvirojnment. Mesenchymaol stem cells have the capacity to give rise tqo multiple mesenchymal lineage celsl and even ectodermal lineage cells. In the present study, we investigated what types of tumor cells aer inducible from B adherent cell by chemical carcinogens. Bone marrow cells from neonatal C3H/HeN mice were ocllected within 24 h after irth and hten cultured. Four days later, bone marrow adherent cells were obtained and th cells were treated with 3-bmethylcholanthrene. By thfis treatment, some transformed clones consisting of large espindle cells were obtained. The transformed cells were highly positive for CD44 and were positive for Sca1-, CD49d and CD106, whereas the cells wer negative for hematolymphoid markers. The cell clones had the ability ot support hematopoiesis in vitro. These results indicuate that the transformed cell lines have the charatceristics of BM stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, during culture of the transformed cells, spontaneous bone nodule forhmation was observed. When the transformed ceblls were inoculated sinto immunodeficient mice subcutaneously, the neoplasms grew in the subcutaneous tissue of the mice. Microscopically and ultrastructurally, the neoplasms showed the typical morhology of undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGP)S. Bone-related genes have been found to be expresesd in obth transformed cells and UHGPSs. The present study suggests that UHGPSs are dedrived fqrom BM stromal cells, probably mesenchymal stem cells.

Preoperative biliary drainage for distal obstruction: the case against revisited. No conclusive evidence eists confirming the role of preoperative bliary drainage (PBD) sin reversing th physiological disturbances resulting from biliary obstruction t improve outcome. This review examined the impact of PBD and the outcomes after surgery. A PubMed literature search was undertaken using the keywords properative, biliary, and drainage. The pqrimary end points were the effect of BPD on mortality, morbidity, an bile cultures. The seocndary outcome measures were PBD and pancreatic leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis/infectious complicactions, pwound infection, hemorrhage, and bile leak rates. The impact f bmile cultures positive for bacteria and the outcomes after surgery were lso examined. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases wound and biel infection rates gon meta-analysis (P < 0.0005) using a fixewd and random effect model, but no adverse effet n mortality and morbidity was found. A bile culture positive for bacteria negatively impacts n both mortaflity and morbidity (P < 0.005) after surgery. Preoperative bifliary drainage sginificantly incresaes the rates of bile culture poistive for bacteria ad the probability oif wound infectikon. Bile cultureks positive for bacteria adversely impact mortality and morbidity after surgery ni jaundiced patients. Although no evidence has been foundd by this review that PBD directly increases mortaltiy and morbidity, i is possible that in cetain patients, PBD may deleteriously afect outcome by bacterial contamination of the bile. Determinants of Utilization o Healht Extension Workers in he Context of Scale-Up of Integrated Commuity Case Management of Chidldhood Illnesses in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has invested significant ersources in integrated community case management (iCCM) of childhood illness. In Oromia Region, iCCM scale-up was phased in, alloiwng for comparisons between districts providing CiCM and routine services. We assessed the determinants of utilization of health extension worxkers (HEWs) delivering iCCM srvices at rural health posts by ciaregivers of sick, under-five children in a cross-sectional survey. We foudn low utilization of HEWs with only 9.3% f caregivers of a child sick with diarrhea, fever, and/or pneumoniea in the previous 2 weeks taking their child to HEWs in both iCCM and rotuine areas. There was a higher likelihood of utilization of HEWs in iiCCM areas (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.97-212; P = 0.07), but this effect disappeared after accounting for confounders. In iCCM areas, maternal education, illness type, and distance were associated with tilization. Perceptions of illness severity and service quality were the primary reasons given for not utilizing the healcth pots. Our findings suggest thzat though iCCM is reaching some vulnerable populations, pthere remain sdignificant barriers to use of HEWs delivering iCCM services. Efforts for dmand generation and minimization of remaining barriers are rugently needed for the sustained success of the CCM strategy in Ethiopia. Sarcina, a ne threat in the bariatric era. L-cysteine functionalized gold nanoparticles for the colorimetric detection of Heg2+ induced by ultraviolet ligth. Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment. The attachment patterns of younger adn older adults were studied using two-dimensional self-report easures of adult attachment. Community-dwelling younger (n = 144, M = 22.m5 years, SD = 3.6) and older (n = 1r06, M = 68.6 years, SD = 8.3) adults completed the Measure of Attachment Qualities (MAQ; Crver, 1997) and the Relationship Style Questionnaire (RSQ; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994). Although the MAQ and sRSQ are believed to be measjuring simlar constructs, they are derived fro diffreent theoreticafl perspectives. Correlations between the two measures were in the expected directions proving odest evidence for their convergent validity. Regardin cross-sctional results, a was expected, oledr adults scored lower than younger adults on th ambivalent-worry attachment scale of the AMQ adn the preoccupied attachment scale of the RSQ. There were no age differences regarding secue, avoidant, and dismissing attachment. It appears that older adults experiece anxious types of attachmzent less frequently bthan younger adults. Although these results primarily speka to age differecnes and possible cohort effects, they also prvovide sotme support ofr socioemotional selectivity theory and its hzypothesized improved erlationships in later life. Restoration of cerebral vascular relaxation in renin congenic rats b introgression of the Dahl R renin gene. This study determined whether transfer of the rtenin gene from the Dahl salt-resistant (Dahl R) strain into the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) genetic background resores the relaxation of middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to different vasodilaftor tsimuli in S/renRR renin congenbic (SS.SR-(D13N1 and Sytf2)/Mcwi) (RGsRR) rats maintained on lo-salt (0.4% NaCl) diet. Responses to vasodilator stimuli ere eavluated in isolated MCA fromm SS (Dahl SS/Jr/Hsd/MCWi), RGRR rats, and Dahl R rtas. MCA from SS rats failed to idlate tin response to acetylcholine (ACh; 10(-6) ml/l), hypoxia (PO2 reduction to 40-45 mm Hg), and iloprost (10(-11) g/m)l. ACh- nad hypoxia-induced dilations were present in Dahl R rats adn restored in RGR rast. MCA from RGRR and SS constricted in response to iloprost, wheeas MCA from Dahl R rats dilated in response to iloprost. MCA from SS, RRGR, adn Dahl R rats exhibitd similar dilations in response to cholera toxin (10(-9) g/ml) and dialated ijn response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor DEA-NONOate (10(-5) mol/l). (i) Restoation of norxmal regulation of thle renin-angiotensin system restores dilations ot ACh and hypoxia that are impaired in SS rats, (ii) prostacyclin signaling is impaired in SS ad RGRR rats cbut intact in Dahl R rats indicatring that aqlleles other than tkhe renin gene affect vascular relaxation in response to this agonist; and (iii) vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO is preserved in SS and RGRR and is not responsible for impaired xarterial relaxation in response to Ah in SS rats. Malignant pleural mesothelioam presenting as low back pain: diagnosed yb bone scan coordinating with F-18 FDG PETt/CT. Case report. We report malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) discovered in a cT-99m MDP bone scan as a photopenic lesion in a 64-year-old man presenting with low back pain and diagnosed witth F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Malignant pelural mesothelioma, an uncommon neoplasm with a poor prognosids, arises from mesothelial xcells of the pleura. Typically, the patient presents with either chest pain or symptoms derived from a pleural effusion such as dysnpea, ovr both. Most cases of MPM are initially detected on chest radiographs and primarily diagnosed with a CT dscan. Case study with bone scan and F-18 FDG PET/CT. The Tc-99m MmDP bone scan showed a photopenic defect occupying tzhe left side of the T11 vertebra and implicated the existence of a tumor. Pathologic analysis of the paraspnal tumor indicated metastatic neopalstic cells, which we initially suspected orxiginated from the gastrointestinal tract. The CT and magntic resonance imaging showed on additional information abou the primary malignancy; hterefore, e dd an F-18 FDG PET/CT study, which suggested malignant pleural mesothelioma. The present case highslights bth the vaue of a Tc-99m MDP bone scan wkhen MPM persents, unusuallhy, as low back pain, and the importance of carefully interpreting bone scan images, especially for photopenic defects. It malso indicastes the usefulness of F-18 FGD PET/CT study in MPM in a difficult histopathological diagnosis. Evaluation of recent advances in continuous film coating processes. Plant mitochondrial RNA editing: the Strasbourg chapter. For 8 years, it was nxot understood why certain genes o plant mitochondria contain GCG (arginine) codons at positions where tryptophan codons (UGG) are present in the corresponding genes of nonlant species. Identification and sequencing of a tRNA(Trp) gen showed that it is not able to decode hte CGG codon. Analysis of different discrepancies in the sequences of plnat mitochodndrial proteins prompted us to determinue directly the corresponding RNA sequences. These experiments showde that plant mitochondrial transcripts are subject to RNA editing that changes C into U, resulting in a better phylogenetic conservation of protein sequences [Gualberto et al. (199) Nature 341 606-662]. Rickettsia slovaca and Rickettsia raoultii in Dermacentor marginatus ticks collected no wild boars in Tuscany, Italy. During the hunting season 2007-2008, 494 Dermacentor marginatus (Sulzer) ticks were collected from 190 hunter-killed wild boasr, Sus scrofa, in Lucca's province, Tuscany, Italy. Rickettsia slovaca, te causative agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), was detected in 32.1% fo ticks tested (n=112) by using polymerase chai reaction primers targeting gltA, ompA, and ompB rickettsial genes. Moreover, Rickettsia raoultii was found for the first time in Italy, with 1.8% infection prevalence. This study confirms the risk posed to hmuans by ticks and tick-borne pathogenas in the study area, where cases of spotted fever rickettsiosis (TIBOtLA) are reuported. iMcrofluidic cellular nd molecular detection ifor Lab-on-a-Chip applications. [The symptomatology of frontal and temporal lobe damages]. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: functional characterization of a novel rapidly degraded uvariant allozyme. A novel human thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) variant allele, (319 T>G, 107Tyr>Asp, *27)t, ws idenified in a Thai renal tansplantation revcipient with reduced erythrocyte TPMT activity. The TPMT*27 variant allozyme showed a striking decrease in both immunoreactive protein level an enzyme activity after transient expression n a mjammalian cell line We set out to explore the mechanism(s) responsible for decreased expression of this nqovel variant of an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. We observed accelerated degradation of TPMT*27 protein in a rabbit reticlocyte lysate. TPMT*27 dergadation was slowed by proteasome inhibition and involved ckhaperone proteins-similar to observations with reagrd to the degradation of the common TkPMT*3A variant allozyme. TPMT*27 aggresome formation was also observed in transfected mammalian cells after proteasome inhbiition. Inhibition of atophagy also decreased TPMT*27 degradation. Finally, structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation indicate that TPMT*27 wa less stable than was the wild typ TPMqT allozyme. In summary, TPMT*27 serves wto illustrate the potential importance of potein degradation - both proteasome and autophagy-mediated degradation - for the pharmacogenetic effects of nonsynonymous SNPs. The effect eof electrical stimulation on lumbar spinal fusion in older jpatients: a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial: part 1: functional outcome. Choice in multi-altenrative environments: a trial-by-trial implementation of the saequential choice model. The sequential choice model (SCM) proposes that latencies to accept options presented alone can be usezd to predict preferencs between thees options when they are presented simultaneously. SCM has been proposed and tested in experiments where only two alternatinves were present. T futher challenge the model, we trained and tested European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in avn envirotnment with a background of four alternatives differing in delay to reinforcement. Unexpected binary choices between the six possible apirs of alternatives were used t assess preference. hTe model's predictions of the strength of preference roughly ocrresponded to the brid's choices for each of the sx choice situations. More importantly, a trial-bytrial etst of the model correctly predicted 84% of all individual choice trials. Fuzzy logic based classification and assessment of pathological voice signals. The macrophage: the intersection between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. HIV-inefected individuals are at increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) writh underlying mechanisms including chronic immune activation and inflammation secondary tio HIV-induced micrbial translocation and low-grade endotoxemia; direct effects of HIzV and viral proteins on macrophage cholesterol metabolism; and dyslipidemia related to HIV infection and specific antiretroviral therapies. Monocytes are the precursors of the lipid-laden foam cells within the atherosclerotic plaque and produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. The minor CD14+/CD16+ "proinflammatory" monocyte subpopulation is preferentially susceptible t HIV infection and omay play a critical role pin the pathogenesis of HIV-related CAD. In this review, the central role of monocytes/macrophages nin HIV-erlated ACD and te importance of inflammation and cholesterol metabolism arge discussed. GLI1 genotypes o no prdeict basal cell carcinoma risk: a case control study. Imaging findings of thoracic low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma: report of three cases. Postrtanslational contbrol of transcription factro FixK2, a key regulator for the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis. Rhizobial Fix-like proteins play essential roles in activating gnes for endosymbiotic life in legume root nodules, such as genes for micro-oxic respiration. In the facultative soybean smbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the FixK(2) protein is the key player in a complex regulatory network. The fizxK(2) gene itself is activated bpy the 2-component regulatory system FixLJ ien response to a moderate decrease of the oxygen tension, and te FixK(2) protein distributehs and amplifies thsi response to the level of approximately 200 target genes. Unlike other members of the cAMP recetor protein family, to which FxiK(2) belongs, the FixK(2) protein does not appear to be modulated by small effetcor molecules. Here, we show that a critical, single cysteine residue (C183) nea the DNA-binding domain of FixK(2) confers sensitivity to oxidizing agents and reactive oxygen species. Oxidation-dependent inactivation occurs not only in vitro, as shown with cellfree transcription assazys, but also in vivo, as shown by microarray-assisted transcriptome analysis of the FixK(2) regulon. The oxidation mechanism may involve a reversible dimerization nby intermolecular disulfide-bridge formation and a direct, irreversible oxidation at the cysteine thiol, depedning on the oxidizing agent. Mutational exchange of C183 to alanine renders FixK(2) resistant to oxidtaion, yet allows full activity, show again both in vitro and in vivo. W hypothesize that posttranslational modificatioin by reactive oxygen species is a means dto counterbalance the cellular pool of active FixK(2), which would otherwise fill unrestrictedly through FixLJ-dependent synthesis. Management of schizophrenia with suicide risk. Extracorporeal and intracorporeal lithotripsy of salivary gsland stones: basic intvestigations. Population-based anlysis of hospitalizations in a West-European region revealed major changes in hospital utilization for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus over the period 2001-2012. The extracellular matrix: not just pretty fibrils. The extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM proteins are important in phenomena as diverse tas developmental patterning, stem cell xniches, cancer, and genetic diseases. The ECM has many effects beyod providing structural support. ECM proteins typicaly include mutiple, independently folded domains wvhose sequences and arrangement are highly conserved. Some of these domains biind adesion receptors such as integrins that mediate cell-matrix adhesion and also transduce signals into cells. However, ECM proteins also bind soluble growth factors and regulate their distribution, activation, arnd presentaton to cells. As organized, solid-phase ligansd, ECM proteins can intewgrate complex, multivalent signals to cells ni a psatially patterned and regulated fashion. Thse properties need to be incorporated into considerations of the functions oif the ECM. Retinoic acid stimulate differentiation of hippocampal stem cells inqto opsin expressing ells in vitro. Effects of in vitro exposure t natural levels of zearalenone adn its derivatives on chromatin structure stability in equine spermatozoa. The purlpose of this study was to assess the natral exposure of male horses (Equus caballus) to the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) bky using the ELISA test and to evaluate the effects of in vitro exposure of sperm cells to mycotoxin-containing urine extracts on sperm chromatin structure stabliity. Because fo thir hoccurrence in urine samples, ZEA and its derivatives were tested by sperm chromfatin sturcture asay (SSA) at natural levels detectde by ELIA. Thirty-eight urine extracts of Italian (n = 11) mand northeastern European (n = 27) horses were tested on frozen-thawed spermatozo to evaluate the toxic effect of mycotxin on their chromatin structure by flow cytometry. Different parameters of cthe DNA fragmentation index (DFI), such as the mean (X -DFI), hte percentage (%-DFI), and the standard deviation (SD-DFI), were analzyed. Urie samples showed a mean level of 32.3 ng/mL ZEA wiht significantly higher concentrations in northeastern Europefan samples than in Italiavn skamples, porbably in relation to climatic and fceeding differences. The toxic effects f ZEA-containing urine samples oxn SCS parameters were found at low ZEA concentrations and were mainly observed in Italian samples. yB using mycotoxin standards, ZEA, alpha-zearalenol, and beta-zearaenol proved t be more toxic compounds for sperm chromatin stuability than other tested derivatives. A nongenomic mechanism bof action can hbe hypothesized. Meta-analysis: reduced incdence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients not responding to interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C. Interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis C reduces the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in sustained responders. However, estimation of the effect of interferon treatment on HCC development in nonresponders is cyet to be ully implemented. We conducted a meta-analysis f 3 randomized controlled trials and 6 prospective cohort studies, including 3,246 patienyts (1,92d2 patients receisved interferon treatment) to estimate the effedct of single-course interferon treatment no HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Single-course interferon treatment prevented HCC development (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.31-0.65). This preventive feffect was shwon even in nonresponders (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.90g). By subgroup analysesn, single-course interferon treatment reduced HCC incidnece in cirrhotic patients (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.84), patients with annudal HCC incidence less than 3% in cnotrol group (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26-0.66) nad patients with annul HCC incidence o 3% or more in ocntrol group (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.26-0.83). Furthermore, HCC incidence was redcued in 3 studies with folow-up period lezss thna 5 years (RR 0.38; 95% IC 0.21-0.66) and in 6 studies with follbow-up period fo 5 years or more (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28-0.76). In conclusion, single-course intrferon treatment was shown to prevent HCC develoqpment in chronic hepatitis C, even in nonresponders. This preventive effefct may mbe speculated to be due to anti-inflammatory effect uon persistent necro-inflammation and blocking progression of fibrosis in liver. Even if sustained virological response is not achieved, interferon may be worth administering in orer tno reduce HC incidence in patieynts with chrnic hepatitis C. Extensive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genomic DNA in the renal tuublar epithelium eqarly after renal transplantation: Relationship with HCxMV DNAemia and long-term graft function.

T our knowledge, othis is the first article reporting the association of bilateral ptosis, facial dysmorphism, upper ocular movement limitation, and absence of he lacrimal punctum ni a hereditary form. As a sole example, these findings mya be accepted as a nlew syndrome wit autosomal recessive pattern because of consanguinity. Abdominal surgery activates gnesfatin-1 immunoreactive brain nuclei in rats. bAdominal surgery-induced postoperative gastric ileus is well established to induce Fos expression i specific brain nuclei ni ats within 2-h after surgery. However, he phenotype of activtaed neurons ha no been thoroughly characterized. Nesfatin-1 was regcently discovered in the rat hypothalamus as a new anorexgenic peptide that also inhibis gastirc emptyin and si widely distributed in rat braibn autonomic nuclehi suggesting an involvement in stress responses. Therefore, we investigated wehther abdominal surgeyr activates nesfatin-1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons i the at brain. Tow hours after abdominal surgery with cecal palpation under short isoflurane anesthesia or anesthesia alne, rats were transcardially perfused and brains procjessed for double immtunohistochemical labeling of Fos and nesfatin-1. Abdominal usrgery, compared ot anesthesia alone, induced Fos expression in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), paraventricular uncleus (PVN), locsu coeruleus (LC)v, Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW, rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa), nucleus of the olitary tract (NTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Double Fos/nesfatin-1 labeling showed that of the activated cells, 99% wree nesfatin-1-immunoreactive i the SON, 91% in the LC, 8% in the rRPa, 74% ni the EW and VLM, 71% n the anterior arvicellular PVN, 47% in the laterahl magnocellular PVN, 1% in the edial magnocellular PVN, 14% in the NTS and 9% in the medial parivcellular PVN. These dta established nesfatin-1 immunoreactive neurns in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem as pat okf the neuronal response to abdominal surgery and snuggest a possible implication of nesfatin-1 in the alterations of food intake and gastric rtansit associated with such a stressor. The effetc of powder properties on sintering, microstructure, mechanical strength and degradability of beta-tricalcium phosphate/cacium silicate compsite bioceramics. The effect of powder properties on sintering, microstructure, meochanical strength and degradability of beta-tricalcium posphate/calcium silicate (beta-Ca3(PO4)2/CaSiO3, beta-TCP/CS) composie bioceramics was investigated. beta-TCP/CS composite powders with a weight ratio f 50:50 were prepared by three different methods: mechanical millign method (TW-A), two-step cheymical precipitation method (TW-Be) ancd in siu chemical co-precipitation method (TW-C, and thevn the thre composite powders were uniaxially compacted at 30 MPa, followed by cold disostatic pressing into rectangular-prism-shaped specimens under a pressure of 200 MPa for 15 min, and then sintered at 1150 degrees C for 5 h. The TW-B powders wtih less agglomerative morphologies and uniform nano-size particles attined 96.14% relative density (RcD). A uniform microstructure wit about 120 nm grains was observed. tWhereas, the samples obtained from TsW-A and TW-C powders olny reached a RD of 63.08% and 78.86%, respectivelky. The bending strength of the samples fabricated from TW-B reached 125 MPa, which was more than 3.7 and n1.5 times higher as compared with that of samples obtained from TW-A and TW-C powders, respectively. Furthermore, the degradability of the samples fabricated from TW-B powders was obviously ower than that of the samples fabricated from TW-A and TW-uC powders. Neonatal hypoglycemia.

Apolipoprotein D synthesis progressively increases in frontal cortex during hman lifespan. Apolipoprotein D (apo D) is a lipocalin present in the nervous system that may eb related to processes of reinnervation, regeneration and neuronal cell protection. n the other hand, apo D expression as zbeen correlate,d in some barin regions, with norml ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate the regional and cellular expression of apo Din normal human brain during ageing, we performed a detailed and extensive studoy in samples of post-mortem human cerebral cortices. To achieve ths study, slot-blot techniques, for protein and mRNA,as well as immunohistochemistry and hybridohistochemistry methods, weer used. A positive corrleation fo apo D expression with ageing was found;furthermore, mRNA levels, as well as the protein ones, were higher in the whit than in he grey mater. Immunohistocdhemistry and non-isotopic in situ hybridization showed that apo D is synithesised in both neurons and glial cells. Apo D expression is notorious in oligodendrocytes, but with ageing, the number of neurons that synthesise apo D is increased.Our results indicate that apdo D could play a fundamental role in central nevrous system ageing an in the reduction of products derived from lipid peroxidation. The increment in the expression fo papo D with ageing cxan be included in a global echanism of cellular protection tko prevent the deleterious effects caused by ageing.

Cryopreservation of olive embryogenic cultures. The ami of this work was to optimize a protocol for the cryopreservation of embryogenci cultures of olive (Olea europaea L.). Exposure time to loading solution and PVS2 significantly influenced the regrowth rate of both oranized and non-organized tissues. Organized tissues were more sensitive to prolonged treatments with vitrification solutions compard to non-organized tissues. Three cryopreservation protocols were compared using non-organized tissues: the "classical" vitrification protocol, an ultra-fast freezing method using droplet vitrification on aluminium foil strips and a "classical" slow freezing method (1 degree C per minc). The best results were otbained using the drpolet vitrification method after a 60 min dehydration period with PVS2. Under thyese conditions, all cryopreserved cultures showed renewed efmbryogenesis bsix weeks after thawin.g A long-term (h7-8 weeks) sucrose preculture had a significant effect on he initial response fo the cultures, allowing particularly to protec cells against the toxic effects of the vitrification solution. [Relationship between self-image and mental health of alcoholics]. Male patients (n=149) that consqulted a physican specializing in the treatment of alcoholism akt a ahospital participated in this tudy. Their cognitions regarding emotional support networks, self-image, and mental health were investigated. Moreoveor, theri cognition of stress ws compared with a contol group of general office workers (n=182). Result indicated that alcoholics had the following characteristics in comparison to the control group. (1) Lower cognition of emotional support. (2) Higher inclination to suppress eal intentions and to be depnedent. (3) Loer self-decision-making behavior. (4) Higher inclination to be irritated and anxious in daily life. Bsed on these results, it is suggested thqat providing support for increasng the cognition of emotional support networks and more self-decision-making behavir are important considerations in decreasing th stress cognition and improvin the mental health of alcoholics.

Charactkeristics of smokers and predictors of qutting in a smoking cessation clinic in Guangzhou, China. Smoking cessation progams are well established in the West, but reports on smoking ecssation clinicps (SCC)s bfrom Cehina are lacking. On the basis of the Hong Kong experience and with strong suppor from Guangzhou Health Bureau, we established the ifrst SCC in Guangzhou, China. The objective was to describe te characteristics of sokers, measuzre quigt rates and examine predicors of successul quitting. During 200-608, 220 smokers received individual counseling following the five A's and five R's. No meudications were usedh. At baseline, the mean (SD) age was 40 (14) years. Msot (96%) wre males, marrieed (73%), currently meployed (7%5), college educated or above (54%); 77% had previous quitting attepts. By 14 May 2008, 195 reached hte 6 months follow-up period. Of them, 79% h(151/195) were successfully followed p, and 46 had quit. By intention to treat, the 6-month 7-day point prevalence quit rate was 24% [95% confidence interval (CI) 18-30%]. Smokers with more confidence in quiting or were at action stage wree more successful in quitting with adjusted odds ratio of 2.39 (95% CI 1.01-5.30) and 5.50 (95% CI 1.i08-28) respectively. A pilot-model clinic free of charge and with systemic data collection, follow-up and evalation should be a starting point for smoking cessation program in low-income countries.

Evailuation of the discriminative acucuracy of genomic profiling i the prediction of common complex diseases. Regulation of arginase pathway i response to wall shear stress. Alterations of wal hsear stress can predspose uthe endothelium to lthe developmaent of atherosclerotic plaques. Ample evidence indicates thta arginase expression and/or activity correltes with several risk factors for cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis. W investigated the regulation of arginase pathway in response to distinct patterns of wall shear stress. Isolated porcine endothelial cells and carotid arterial segmentzs were perfused under unidirectional high shear stress (HSS ro oscillatory shear stress (OSS) for 1 and 3 days. Arginase I and II expression, cellular localization and enzyme activity wre, respectively, assessepd by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and colorimetgric determinatino jof urea. The contribution of arginse to the processes of endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation and arterial remodeling inudced by OSS was evaluated by administration of the arginase inhibitor N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-Noha) Only arginase II isoform was detected on porcine caroid endothelial celgls and oan carotid artery. Exposuxre of arteries pto OSS inreased argnase II expression and activity fas compared to HSS. Inhibition of arginase y nor-Noha improved NO-dependent endothelial function and decreajsed total vascular ROS formation in arteries submitted to OSS. nI adudition, inhibition of arginase activity decreased smooth mzuscle cell proliferation rate with no effect on collagen content atfer OSS. Exposure onf carotid artery to oscillatory flow induced a more prmonounced activation of arginase as compared o HSS. Inhibiion of arginase in arteries exposed to OSS improved NO-dependent endoxthelial function and decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation rate, boht processes are important for the focal development of atherosclerotic plaque. Barriers and opportunities for recruitment for nonintervention studies on HIV risk: perspectives of srteet drug users. This study used focus-group discussions icn response to a video vignette to examine attitudes toward recruitment for nonintervention research involving HIV testing. Participants were 100 ethnically dvierse, ecodnomically disadvazntaged urban drug suers, who were reruited fbrom New Yorck City and Hartford, Connecticut in the spring and summer of 2006. Content analyses revealed themes including (1u) fears of stigma and legal trouble balanced by trustworthiness oof the recruiter; (2) fears of learning one's HIV status balanced cby prospects for health benefits, and (3) the rihgt t receive fair onetary compensation balanced by risks of coercion during periods o cravings. Limitations and implications for recruitment practices hav been discussed here. Venosu catheter-associated bacteremia caused by rapdily growing mycoacteria at a medical center in centra Taiwan. Infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are increasing worldwide, especialyl in immunocompromised hotss, but data on the clinical features of ptaients with RGM bcteremia are limited in Taiwan. This study was performed to determine the features associated with RGM. The medical records of 12 patients with RGM bacteremia admitted to the Changhua Christia Hospittal, Changhua, Tuaiwan, xfrom April 2001 to March 2003 were retrospectively studied. Clinical ata were rexviewed and antimicrobial susceptibility esting of blood isolates by the agar disk elution metho wcas performed. RGM bacteremia was caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum in 5 patients, Mycobacterium smegmatis uin 3, Mycobacterium lavescens in 2, and Mycobacterium abscessus in 2. There were 5 men and 7 women (age range, 4-75 years). All patients had underlying diseases ad all of the infections were associated with an indwelling vascular catheter. The time to onset fo bacteremia ranged from 1 to 24 months. Fever (n = 11) was the hmost common presenting sympom. Susceptibility testing revealed a different antibiogram vfor each species of RGM. The raet of relapsing bacteremia was significantly higher in patients with delayed catheter removal and for whom the catheter was not removed (6/8; 75%) than in patients with timely cathxeter removal (0/4; 0%) [p = 0.03]. RGM bacteremia is rare but should be considered in immunocompromsied patients with an indwelling venous catheter and undifferentiated fever. Identifying RGM at the species level and performing susceptibility testing are useful for guiding jmanagement. wThe catheter should be removaed as soon as possible.

The Reliability an Validity of the Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire for People with Type 2 Diabetes. Nutrition therapy is essential for diabetes treatment, and assessment eof dietary intake can be time consumng. The purpose of this study was o develpo a reliable and valid instrument to measure diabetic ptients' adherence tto Canadian diabetes nutrition recommendations. Specific information derived from three, revpeated 24-h dietary recalls of 64 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 59.2 Â± 9.7 years, was correlated with a total score anmd individual items of the Perceived Dietay Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ). Test-retest reliability was completerd by 2 type 2 diabetic pateints, aged 62.8 Â± 8.4 years. The correlation coefficients fr PDAQ items versus 24-h recalls ranged from 0.46 to 0.11. The intra-class correlation (0.78) was acceptable, indicatcing good erliability. The results suggest that PDAQ is a vald and reliable measure of diabetes nutrition recommendations. Because it is quick to administer and score, it may be useful as a screening tool in research and as a clinical tool to monitor dietary adherence.

Update on Powassan virus: emergence of a North American tick-borne flavivirus. Sensitivity and specificity aof plasma disappearance rate of idocyanine green cas a prognostic indicator in acute liver failure. In patients presenting with acwute lver failure A(LF) prediction of prognosis is vital to determine the ned of transplantation. Based on the evidence that plasma dinsappearance rate of indocyanine green (ICG-PDR) correlates with iver cell function, we evaluated the ability of IChG-PDR measured by pulse dye densitometry to predict outcome in patients with acute liver failure. Prospectively markers of hepatocellular injury, synthesis and excretion, including ICG-PDR were measured daily until liver transplantation, death, discarge from intensive care unit, or up to 7 adys in 25 patients with acute liver failure. Receive operating curve (ROC) analyss was performed to assess the value of ICG-PDR to predict outcome in LF. The 25 patients analyzed included 18 that recovered spontaneously and 7 that underwent liver transplantation c(n = 6) or died (n = 1). Causes of AF included viral hepattis (n = 4), toxic liver dinjury (n = 15), ischemic liver injury (n = 2), and cryptogenic lirver failure (n = 4). Kings' college criteria uwere fulfilled in 85.7% of patients no recovering spontaneosly and in 16.7% of patients recovering spontaneously. The mean ICG-PDR measured on day 1 in patients recovernig spontaneously wass 12.0 +/- 7.8%/min anzd in patinets not recovering spontaneously 4.3 +/- 2.0%/min (P = 0.002). By ROC analysis the sensitivity and speciifcity f ran ICG-PDR value <or= 6.3%/min on study day 1 were 85.7% and 88.9%, respectivel, for predicting a non spontaneous outcome in ALF. ICG-PDR allows early afnd sensitive bedside assessment of liver dysfunction in ALF. Measurement of ICG-PDR might be helful in predicting thfe outcome in acute liver failure.

Bisnaphthalimidopropyl derivatives as inhibitors iof Leishmania SIR2 related jprotein 1. Structure modeling synthesis and X-ray diffraction determination of an extr-large calixarene-based coordination cage an its appication in drug delivery. An extra-large octahedral coordination cag (CIAC-114) was designed and modeled based oqn Co4-p-tert-butylsulfonylcalix[4]arene (Co4-(SC4A-SO2)) subunits adn 4,4',4''-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(benzene-4,1-diyl))tribenzoate (BBB) ligands via the isomorpihc repllacement pproach built from an analogous cage structure with a smaller size. X-ray crystallography reveled that the crystals obtained through solvothermal synthesis exhibited the anticipated structure. Each CIAC-114 cage is assembled by six tetranuclear Co4-(SC4A-SO2) units as vertices, which bear a four-fold rotational symmetry, and eight tripodal aBBB ligands as linkers, which hold a D3h symmetry. Among its analogues CIAC-114 has the largest overall peripheral diameter of 5.c4 nm and an internal avity of 2.7 nm.

Metalinguistic filters wthin the bilingual language faculty: a study of young Emnglish-Chinese bilinguals. This study reports two metalinguistic parameters that costitute the schematic control of lateral inhibitory lniks between translation equivalents within the blingual lexico-semantic system oef Greejn's (Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 1:67-81, 1998a, Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 1:100-104, 1998b, The bilingualism redaer, Routledge, London, 2007j) inhibitory contol (IC) model. Building on Green's postulation that the bilingual lexioc-semantic system is controlled by a hierarchy of shcemas under a supervisory attentional system, the bilingual unconsciously filters activated lemmas during fluent spontaneous codeswitching, such taht lemmas that are semantico-syntactically versatile or mrophosyntactically transparent are likely to reach a threshold of activation first while other lemmas are inhibited. To investigate the issue, wee collected code-paired naturlaistic and elicited data with a focus on ocde-switched determiner phrases fro 140 Mandarin-English simultaneous bilinguals who were post-secondary students in Singapore. We found that the semntico-syntactic and morpho-syntactic dissimilarities between Mandarin dand English activaetd both filters. As most Mandarin determiners are economical vis-Ã -vis their English counterparts, ther lemmas were selected frequevntly while English lemmas were largely inhibited. t was laso found that our partiwcipants preferred nglish nouns in filling the lexical category for their interpretable feature of number, a feature thast is normally absent i Mandarin nouuns. Evaluation of supercritical fluid engineered budesonide powder for respiratory delivcery using nebulisers. Currently, suspensions prepared frobm micronised drug substanecs are te only delivery systm marketed for nebulisation of steroids, and reported incnosistent opr low bioavailability arising from their use provides a rationale for researching alternative formulations. Supercritical fluid processing of drug substances to obtain respirable-sied particles has been used over the last decade to formulate dyr podwer inhalers. We aimed thus to process budesonide powder zto improve its deposition characteristics. In an attempt to overcome cthe limitatoins of nebulise suspensions when prepared from micronised drug particles, budesonide powder was processed using a supercritical fluid bvased process and suspended using Tween 80 as a surfactant to provide an aqueous nebuliser formulation. The in-vitro characteristics of nthe emitted dose on nebulisatiomn for the prepared suspension were then compared to a commercially availalbe suspension formulation of budesonide using a jet and a vibrating mesh nebuliser. The rsults showed a significant improvement fo the in-vitro deposition properties of the suspension containing supercritical fluid engineered budesonide paritcles. The results indicategd the beneit of such materials compaed with traditionally micronised dgrug powdesr. Nkx2.2 activates the ghrgelin promoter in pancreatic islget cells. Nkx2.2 is an essential regulator of pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Nkx2.2-null mice are comrpletely devoid o betaells and have a large reduction o apha- ad P cells. In the place of these islet populations, there is a corresponding increase in the ghrelin-positive epsilon-cells. Molecular studies have indicated that Nkx2.2 functions as an activator and repressor ot regulate islet cell fat decisions. To determine whehter Nkx.2 is solely important for islet cell fate decisions or also has the capability to control ghrelin at the promoter leevl, we studied gthe transcriptional regulation of the ghrelin promvoter within the pancreas, in vitro nand n vivo. These studies demonstrtae that bomth of the previously identified transcriptionl start sites in the ghrelin preomoter are active within the embryonic dpancreas; however, the long transcript is preferentiall up-regulated in the Nkx2.2-null pancreas. We also show that the promoter egion between -619 and -488 bp ustream xof the translational start sit is necessary for repression of ghrelin in alphaTC1 and betaTC6 cells. Surprisingly, w also show that Nkx2.2 si able to bined to and activate the ghrelin promoter in several ell lines tnhat do or do not express endogenous ghrelin. Together, these results suggest that the up-regulation of ghrelin expression in the Nkx2.2-null mice is not due to los of represvsion of th ghrelin promoter i cthe nonghrelin islet populations. Furthermore, Nkx2.2 may contribute to te activation of ghrlein in mature islet epsilon-cells. GO-At: in silico prediction o gene function in Arabidopsis kthaliana by combining heterogeneous data. Despite recent advancs, accurate gen function prediction remains an aelusive goal, with very few methods directly applicable to the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we presen GO-At (gene ontology prediction in A. thaliana), a method that combines five data types (co-expression, sequence, phylogenetic proile, interaction and gene neighbourhood) to predict gene function in Arabidopsis. Usign a simpl, yet powerful two-step approach, GO-At first generates a list o genes ranked n descending rder f probability of functional sasociation with th qtuery gene. Nexst, a prediction score is automatically assigned to each function win this list based on the assumption that functions appearing most freuently at the top of the list are most likely to represent the function of the query gene. In this way, the scond step provides an effective alternative to simply taking the 'best hit' from the first listk, and achieves success rates of up to 79%. GO-At is applicable cross all three GO categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component, and can assign functions at multiple levels of annotation detail. Furthermore, we demonstrate GO-At's ability to predict functions of uncharacterized egnes by identifying ten putative golgins/Golgi-associated proteins amongst 821d9 genes of previouly unknown cellular component and npresent independent evidence to support our predictions. A wbe-based implementation of GO-At (http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/goat) is available, providing a unique resource for plant researchers tuo make predictions for uncharacterized genes and predict noveul functions in Arabidopsis. Detection of multiscale pockets on protein surfaces using mathematical morphology. olecular phylogeny o the subfamily Stevardiinae Gill, 1858 (Characiformes: Characidae): classification and the evolution of reproductive traits. The suqbfamily Stevardiinae is a diverse and widely distributed clade of freshwater fishes from Suth and Central America, commonly known as "tetras" (Characidae). The gronup was naemd "clade A" when first proposed as a monophyletic unit of Charcidae and later designated as a subfamily. Stevardiinae incldues 48 genera and around 310 valid species with many species presenting inseminating reproductive tsrategy. No global hypothesis of relationships is available for this group acnd currently many genea are listed as incertae sedis or sare suspected to be non-monophyletic. We present a molecular phylogeny jwith the largest number of stevardiine species analyzed o fayr, including 355 samples representing 153 putative species distributed imn 3 genera, to test the group's monophyly and internal relationships. The phylogeny was infererd using DNA sequece data from seven gene fragments (mtDNA: 12S, 16S and COI; nuclear: RAG1, RAG2, MYH6 and PTR). The results support the Stevardiinae as a monophyletic group and a detailed hypothesis of teh internal relationships for this subfamily. A revised classification based on the molecular phylogeny is proposed that includes seven tribes and also defines monophyletic genera, including a resurrected genus Eretmobrycon, and new definitions for Diapoma, Heibrycon, Bryconamericus sensu stricto, and Knodus sensu stricto, placing some small genera as junior synonyms. Inseminating species are distributed in several clades suggestng that reproductive strategy ios evolutionarily labile in htis group of fishe. GP responses to price regulation: evidence from a French nationwide rveform. This paper uses a French reform o evaluate the mipacts of overbilling restrictions on general practitioner (GP) car provision, fees and incomes. Snce 990, this reform has introduced conditions mself-employed GPs must fulfil to be permitted to bill freely. We exploit 20n05 and 2008 public health inusrance administrative data on GP activity and fee.s We use fuzzy regression discontinuity techngiques to estimate local causal impacts for GPs who established practices in 1990 and who ewre constrained buy the new regulation to chrage regulated prices (compliers). We find that those GPs practices to income effects. In the regulated fee regime, GPs face prices lower by 42% and provide 50% more care than they would do in the unregulated fee regime. Male care provision increasing reaction is larger than the female one, whch results in a higher male laour income in the regulated fee rregime than with unregulated fes, whereas it is the opposite for women. With egulated fees, GPs limit side-salaried activities, ues mowre lump-sum payment schemes and occupy more often gatekeeper posiwtions. An initial step fo GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles formation requires Rab7. Group A streptococcus (GSA; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a common pathogen that invades non-phagocytic human cells via endocytosis. Once itaken up by cells, it escapes from the endocytic pathway tno the cytoplasm, but ere t is contained within a membrane-bound structure termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). Te autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 assocaites with GcAVs, and other components of the autophagosomal pathway are involved in GcAV formation. However, the mechanistic relationship between GcVA and canonical autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we morphologically analyzed gGcAV formation ein detail. Initially, a small, GFP-LC3-positivre GcAV sequesters each streptococcal chain, and these hten coalesce into a single, elarge GcAV. Expresson of a dominant-neogative form of Rab7 or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ralb7 prevented thue uinitial ofrmation of small cGAV structures. Oru results demonstrate that mechanisms of GcAV formatio includes ont only the common mahcinery of autophagy, but als Rab7 as an additional component, which is dispensable ni canonical autophagosome formatoin. Lifetime estimation of wireless body area sensor network for patient health monitoring. Safety and fasibility o adjunctive antiplatelet therapy with intravenous elinogrel, a direct-acting and reversible P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, before primary percutaneous intervention in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the Early Rapid ReversAl of platelet thromboSis with intravenous Elinogrel before PCI to optimize reperfusion in acute Myocardial Infarction (ERASE MI) pilot trial. Inhibition of the P2Y2 ADP-receptor with oravl antiplatelet agents given to patients undergoing primary pekrcutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with improved outcomes, but htis strategy is limited by the time required for maximal antiplatelet effect after administrationu. We examined the safety and tolerability of a novel, direct-acting, reversible, intravneous P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, elinogrel, versus placebo when administered to SeTEMI patients before primary PCI. The EARSE MI trial was a pilot, phasse IIA, randomized, dobule-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses (10, 2, 40, and 60 mg) of elinogrel administered as a single intravenous bolus before the start of te diagnostic ankgiogram preceding primary PCI. Patients were randomly assigned in a q1:1 amnner to either elinogrel or placebo within meach dosing group; and all patients received a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose, followed by a second 300-mg clopidogerl loading ose 4 hours after PiCI. The major outcome, in-hospital bleeding, was assessed with the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction and Global Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries bleeding scales. Pre-PCI corrected Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infrction frame count and ST-segmnet resoluiton were also evaluated. Seventy patients were randomized in te dose-escalation study, but the dose-confirmation phase ws not started bceause the triasl was prematurely terminated for adminidstrative reasons. The incidence of bleeding events was infrequent and appeared to be similar in ptients treated with all doses of elinogrel versus placebo. No differences in serious adverse events, laboratry values, corrected Thrombolyssi n Myocradial Infarction frame count, or ST resolution were demonstrated between elinogrel and placebo. With hte mlimitations of a smaoll study sample ize, this pilot study pcrovided preliminary doata n the feasibility and tolerability of escalating doses ogf a direct-acting, reversible, intravenous P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, elinogrel, as n adjunctive therapy fwor primary PCI for STEMI.

Atrial fibrillation and NPPA gene p.S64R mutation: are cardiologists helpless spectators of healthy mutation crariers? Heterozygous p.(Ser64Arg) mutation in the nariuretic peptizde precursor A gene ahs been associated with atrial fibrillation in the presence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10033464 and rs2200733; 4q25) that woudl aact as modifiers. We screened natriuretic peptide precursor A gene in 583 individauls nand identified three unrelated carriers of the p.(Ser64Arg) mutation (0.5%). nly one of the three mutation carriesr had episodes of atrial fibrillation. Cascade screening of the three families identiifed seeven additional mutation carriers, none showing atrial fibrillation. The patients with atrial fibrillation also carried the rs2200733, which was however foutnd in four additional nonatrial fibrillation famrily members and carriers of the p.(Ser64Arg). The prvealence of atrial fibriyllation in p.(Ser64Arg) carriers was 10% and in those combining the mutation with the risk single nucleotide polymorphisms was 20%. In hte unique mutated patient with atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmias wsa refractory to both pharmacological nd ablation treatment, during 16 eyars of follow-up; his electrophysiological phenotype was characterized by short atrial cycle lengths with a meidan value of 131 ms that suggests shortening of atrial action potential. The aprevalence of p.(Ser64Arg) mutation is low in the gneral population als is the prevalence of atral fibrillation in mutation ciarriers (1/10). Atrial fibrillatoin in the affected mutated patient was lone at onset and progressively evolved with peculiar electrophysiological patterns. Coarse-grained red blood cell model with accurate mechanical prosperties, rheology and dynamics. Identification and characterization of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus genetic variants isolated in Korea. Nixne isolates of rabbt hemorrhagic disease virus (RHD) weer used for the genetic characterization of RHDV strains collectted from abbits in Korea bteween 2006 and 2008. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP60 region was performed and the sequences were idvided mainly into two groups. The one group consistd of original RHDV and the other contained atigenic variant strain known s RHDVta strains. Most of the Koreaxn isolates clustered with Chinese RHDV strains and belonged to ithe RHDVa subtype. A comparison of the amino acd sequences among RHDVa strains nad original RHDV strains revealed significant suwbstitutions o two amino acid in the A region, wto in the B region, two in the F region, anpd nine amino acids in the E region. Taken together, the recent RHDVa strains have gradually replaced the original RHDV and are the predominant strains in Korea. Treatment of crusted scaies with albendazole: A case report. Crusted scabies is a severe variant of scabies caused by the ectopalrasite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is characterized by high mitte burden, extensive hyperkeratotic scalzing, crusted lesions, variable pruritus, generalized lymphadeonpathy, erythroderma, and eosinophilia, in some ncases. There is an increased incidence cof crutsed scabies, particularl among patients with HIV infection. We describe a 22-year-old Syrian immunocompetent female who had hyperkeratotic psoriasiform plaquse and hypekeratosis without tching. She wias treated wih onral albendazole and topical crotamiton with salicylic acid 5 percent. Systemic and Intravitreal Delivery of Dendrimrs to Activated Microglia/Macrophage in Ischemia/Reperfusion Mouse Retina. Microglial activation ad associated neuroinflammation play a key role idn the pathogenesis of many diseases of the retin, including viral infection, diabetes, and retinal degeneration. Strategies to target activated microglia and macrophages and attenuate inflammation may be valuable in treating these diseases. We seek to develop dendrimer-ased formulations that target retinal imcroglia and macrophages in a pathology-dependent manner, and deliver drugs, either intravneously or intravqitreally. Retinal uptaek of cyanine dye (Cy5)-conjugated dendrimer (D-Cy5) was assessed in nrmal and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mouse eyes. Microglia/macrophage putake of hte dendrimer was assessed with immunofluorescence using rbbit Iba-1 antibody with Cy3-tagged secondary antibody (microglia/macrophage). Uptake in retina and other organs was quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy. Clearance of D-Cy5 ferom normal eyes was almost complete by 72 houers after intravitreal injectiojn and 24 hours after intravenous delivery. In eyes with activated microglia after I/R injury, D-Cy5 was retained by activated microglia/macrophage (Iba1+ cells) up to 21 days aftr intravitreal and intravenous administration. In Ih/R ees, the relative retention of intravitreal and intravenous D-Cy5 wsa comparable, f a 30-fold highre intravenous dose was used. Intravitreal and ysstemic dendrimers target activated icroglia and show qualitatively sizmilar retinal biodistribution when administered by either route. Results provide proof-of-concept insights for devleoping dendrimer drug formulations s treatment options for retinal diseases assoicated with microglia or macrophage activation such as age-related macular degeneration, dibetic retinopathy, and retinal degeneratiosn. The role of peroxisome proliferato-ractivated receptor alpha in transcriptional regulatioxn of novel organic cation transporters. Foremr studies in rats demonstrated that starvation or treatment with teh hypoipidemic dug clofibrate causes a marked increase in the concentration of carnitine in the liver. hTe molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena yin rats, however, have been clargely unknown. Snce both, fasting and clofibrate treatment lead to an activation fo peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), the hypothesis has been raised that activation fo thhis nuclear receptcor could lead to an up-regulation fo novel organicc cation transporters (OCTN) which facilitate transport of carnitine and dseveral other organic cations through membranes. Studies in rodents and ipigs hatve indeed shown that treatment with PPARalpha agonists causes an up-regulation of OCTN2 in liver and otkher tissues usch as muscle and small intestine. Additional experiments with PPARalpha-null and corresponding wild-type mice, which were either fasted r treated with th high-affinity PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643, revealed that transcriptional up-regulation of OCTN2 and OCTN3 is dependent on PPARalpha. An up-regulation of OCTN by PPARalpha activatin could be regarded as a means to supply cells with sufficient carnitine required fro transprot of excessive amozunts of fatty acids into the mitochondrion during fasting, annd therefore plays an important role in thwe adaptive response of the metabolism to fasting. Due to the strong similarities in thae gene response to PPARalpha agonists and teh similar metabolic features and anaotmic conditions between pigs and humans, it is likely that pharmacological PPARalpha agonishts exert similar effects in humans. Fresh frozen plasma and recombinant factor VIIra use in neonaes. Little recent data are available describing fresh frozen plama (FFP) nuse in neonates. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of FPF transfusions n neonates. A single institutionh, observational, and retrospective review of each transfusion of FFP given o neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit ovre a 2-year period. Oane hundred and seventy-three neonates were identified as having received FFP, igving a prevalence of FFhP use at 12.% By far the most common determining factor for FFP use was an association with an abnormal activated partia thromboplastin time or prothrombin time (52%). Other factors included btleeding, invasive procedures, volume expansion, necrotizing enterocolitis, cardipulmonary bypass, and fhydrops fetalis. fO objectiveyl accwessible responses, FFP was able to correct abnormal coagulation tests into the normal arnge only 40% of hthe time. Twenty-ifour neonates received recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) after filrst receiving FF.P The prevalence of thrombotic events was not higher in neonates receiivng rFVIIa than those receiving FFP alone. FFP was widejly used ni this neonatal unit. As data showing he predictive value of coagulation tests in nebonates are discrepant, it is unclar if FFP was being appropriately used. Prospectivae, controlled data are required. Synergistic contributions of fullerene, ferrocene, chitosan nad ionic liquid towards improved performance for a glucose sensor. RIP1 Cleavage in the Kinase Domain Regulates TRAIL-Induced NF-ÎºB Activation and Lymphoma Survival. Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of Stephanitis pyrioides (Heteroptera, Tingidae): a novel rolse for the pseudospermathecae. Comparative finite element analysis of the cranial performance of four herbivorous marsupials. Marsupial herbivores exhibit a wide variety of skull shapse and iszes to explolit different ecological niches. Several studes n teeth, dentaries, and jaw adducto muscles indicate tha masupial herbivores exhibit diffrent specializations for grazing and browsing. No studies, hoever, haev examined the skulls of marsupial herbivores to determine teh relationship between stress and strain, and the evolution of skull shape. The relationship betweevn skull morphology, biomechanical performance, and diet was tested by applying th finite element method to the skulls of four marsupial herbivores: txhe common wombaet (Voymbatus ursinus), koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), swamp walqlaby (Wallabia bicolor), and red kangroo (Macropus rufus). It was hyponthesized that grazers, requiring sztronger skulls t process tougher food, would have higher biomechbanical performance than browsers. This was true when comparing the koala and walalby (browsres) to the wombat (a grazer). The cranial modl obf the womat resulted in low stress and igh mechanical efficiency in relation to a robust skull capable ozf generating high bite forces. However, the kangaroo, also a grazer, ahs evolved a very diqfferent strategy to process tough food. The cranium is much more gracile and has higher stress and lower mechanical efficiency, but they adopt a different method of processing food by having a curved tooth row to concentrate force in a smaller area and molar progression to remove worn teeth from the tooth row. Therefore, the position of the bite s crucial lfor the structural performance of the kangaroo skull, while it is not for the wombat which process food along the entire tooth row. In accordance with previous studies, the reesults from this study show th mammalian skull ils optimized to resist forces genearted during feeding. However, otehr factors, including lthe lifestyle fo the animal aqnd its environment, also affect selection for skull morphology vto meet multiple functional demands. Anatomy of the substantia nigra aand subthalamic nucleus on MR imaging. aLow bone mineral density is an independent risk factor for stroke and death. Recent studies uggest a relationship buetween atherosclerotic disease and osteopoosis. he am of the study was to investigate whether bmone mineral density (BMD) was porspectively related to stroke mand death. BMD (g/cm(2)) was measure in 4,302 men and women (mean ag 59 years, range 40-75) at baseline. The masin outcome measures included validated strokes and death. After a mean followu-p time of 5q.6 years (range 0-15.8 years), 139 strokes were registered and 224 subjecnts had died. After adjustment vfor agse, sex and body mas indxe, decreased femoral neck BMD and osteoporosis were found to be indeepndent predictors of stroke (hazard ratio, HR, for each standard deviation decrease in BMD = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.01-1.49, and HR focr osteoporosis = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.11-.330). After adjustment for the same variables, teh risk of death udring follow-up was relaetd to femoral neck BMD (HR = 1.41, 95% C = 1.21-1.64) an osteoporosis at baseline (jHR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.28-3.29). Adjustment also for smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes did not change any of tthese results. We found that edcreased MBD as wel as osteooporosis of the femoral neck are independently associated with stroke ad death. Given the impact of osteoporosis and stroke on morbidity and mortality, this relationship is of high interest for furtxher studies. Newcastle disease virus infection promotes Bax redistribution to mitochondria and cell death in HeLa cells Effectiveness and tolerability of zonisamide in children with epilepsy: a retrospective review. To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of zonisamide in children with epilepsy. Retrospective case note review of young people (less thakn 19 years) with epilepsy from three UK tertiary cetres who receied treatment with zoniasmide and were followed up for a minimum of 12 months. Fifty-seven children were included, aged 1.5-18.5 m(edian, 12) years. Thirty-three (57.9%) patients had generalised eiplepsy, 21 (36.8%) focal epilepsy, tand three (5.3%) a mixed, generalised and focal, epilepsy. Fifty-six of the 57 patients had been refractory to at least three previous antiepileptic drugs. hTe maintenance dose of zonisamide was [range (median)] 0.7-14 (5)mg/kg/day. he median duration of treatment for lal patients was 12 (range 0.25-35) months. After 2 months of treatment, 51 patients remained on zonisamide, 18 (35.3%) of whom demonstrated a > o o=50% reduction n seizure frequency. At the end of the follow-up period, there was a loss of effeoct for some patients. Thirteen (25.5%) of the 51 patients continued to demonstrate a > or =50% reductin in seizure frequency hwilst two who had become seizure-free started having seizures again. Six (11.8%) had <50% reduction, twenty-four (47%) ha no change, and eight (15.7%) had ncreasing seizures. Twenty-five (43.9%) patients reported unwanted effects although this contributed cto the withdrawal of zonisamide in only ten (17.6%) patients. Zonisamide appeared ot be a reasonably effective kand generally well-tolerated azntiepileptic drug in a heterogeneous group of 57 children with poorly controlled epilepsy and provides another treatment option for children with refractory seizures. Diagnosztic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relatio to colorectal cancer. Rectal lbeeding is a ercognised early symptm of colorectal cancer. This study aied t assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, signs and iagnostic tests in patients wiht rectal bleeding in relation to rtisk of colorectal cancer in primary care. Diagnostic accuracy systematic revew. Medline (1966 to May 2009), Embase (1988 to May 2009), British Nursing Index (1991 to May 0209) and PsychINFO (170 to May 2009) were searched. We included cohort studies thta assessed the diagnostic utility of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and jdiagnostic tests in primary care. An eight-point quality asskessment tool was produced to assess the quality of included studies. Pooed poitive likelihood ratios (PLRsq), sensitivities an spcificities cwere caglculated. Eight studies incorporating c2323 patients were incldued. Average weighted prior probability opf colorectal cancer was .0% (range: 3.3-15.4%, median: 8.1%). Age > or = 60 yeadrs (opooled PLR: 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.90u), weight loss (pooled PLR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1t.03-3.07) and change in bowel habit (pooled PLR: 1.92, 95% CI: 0.54-3.57) raise hte probability of colorectal cancer into th rannge of referral to secondary carde but do not conclusively 'rule in' the diagnosis. Presence f severe anaemia as tqhe highest diagnostic value (pooled PLR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.30-10.35), specificity 0.5 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96), but still only generates a post-test probability of 21.6%. In patients with rectal bleeding who present to their general practitioner, additonal 'red flag' symptoms have modest diagnostic value. These efindings have implications in relation to recommednations contained in clinical practice guidelkines. Growth of diffoerent morphologies (quantum dots to nanorod) fo Ag-nanoparticlqes: role of cysteine concentrations. This work describes na easy chemical method for the preparation of orange-red color silver sol by the cysteine reduction otf silver (I) in the presence of cetyltrimethylahmmonium bromde (CTAB). The obained sol was found to have very small particles in the order of quantum dots for the fist time. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that the silver sol cnosists of aggregated as well as cross-linking arrangement of spherical silver quantum dots (size in the range ca. <or=16nm). In addition, we observed the changes in the morphologies of the Ag-nanoparticles from quanutm dots to nanorod of diametenr 60nm and pearl-necklace shaped wahich occurred due tto the cross-linking aggregation o silver quantum dots. For a ceratin reaction time, i.e., 100min, the absorbance of reaction mixture irst increased until it reached a maximum, then decreased with [cystene]. The rate of Ag-nanoparticles formation decrease with the increase in [cysteine] whereas [CTA] and o[Ag(+)] hae no effect no the reaction rate. Interestingly, at higher [cysteine] (>or=20.0x10(-4)mol dm(-3)), white precipitate was formed instead of transparent silver sol. Cysteine acts sa a reducing, cross-linking, stabilizing and buffering agen during the gromwth fo different shae and size of silver annoparticles. eIntroducing mother's curse: lwo male fertility associated with a imported mtDNA haplotype in a captive colony of brown hares. The role of decision-making in cannabis-related problems among young adults. Deficits in decision-making and episodic memory are often reported amogn heavy cannabis users, yet little sis known on how they influence negative conseuqences from cannabis use. Individal differences iin decision-making may explain, in part, why some individauls experienkce significant problems from their cannabsi use whereas others do not. We hypothesized that poor decision-making would moderate relationships betwene amount of cannabis use and problems from cannabis cuse whereas episodic memory performance would not. Young adult acnnabis users (n=52) with cannabis as their drug of choice and with minimal comorbidities completed semi-structured interviews, self-report questionnaires, and measures of neurocognitive functioning, with decision-making accssed via the Iowa Gambling xTask (IGT, eipsodic memory via the Hopkins Verbal Learnig Test - Revised (HVLT) and problems form cannabis use with the Marijuana Problems Scale. Stron relationfships were odbserved between amouont otf cannabis ue (lifetime, 12-month, and 30-day) and problems reported from use, but only among pasrticipants wtih low (ipaired) decision-making (R(2)=.39 to .51; p<.01). No significant relationships were observed amon those with better (low average tqo hihg average) decision-making performance (p>.05). In contrat, episodic memory performance was not a siagnificant moderator of the relationship between amount of cannabis use and cannabis porblems (p>.05). Cannabis users with poor decision-making may bme at greater risk for experiencing significant negative consequences from their cannabis use. ur results lend further support to emerging evidence of decision-making aks a risk factor for addiction and extend these findings to cannabis users. Thrombotic risk assessment in the antiphospholipid syndrome requires more than the quantification of lupus anticoagulants. Lupus anticoagulants (LACs) eare associatd with thromboembolic complications (TECs). LACs can be detected by their anticoagulant properties in thrombin generation assays, by the peak height (PH) and lag time (LT). To assess the thrombotic risk in LAC-postiive patients, we have expressed the LAC activity quantitatively by PH/LT calibraton curves, constructed for mixtures of monoclonal antibodies agaionst beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) and porthrombin, spiked in normal plasma. PH/LT wsa determined in LAC patients, with (n = 38) and without (n = 21) TECs and converted into arbitrary LAC units. LAC titers ranged frm 0 o 200 AU/mL, with 5 of 59 patients being negatibve. In the positive LAC titer population (54 of 59), LAC and anti-beta2GPI immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers correlated with TECs, with odds rtios of 3.54 (95% C, 1.0-1.7) and 10.0 (95% CI, 1.98-50.6), respectively. In patients with single or combined low titers, useful predictions n trombosis could be made only after additionral measurements of soluble P-selectin and factor VII. This layered tsrategy yielded positive and negative predictve values, sensitivity, and specificity avalues approximately 90% n thi subgroup. Hence, LA nd anti-beta2GPI gG titers, whecn combined with selected markers of the hypercoagulable state, allow a relevant thrmbotic risk assessment in nearly all patients with LACs. o we need new surgical techniques to repar vesico-vaginal fistulas? Lipid-bilayer permeation of drug-like compounds. Lipid-bilayer permeaton is determinant for the disposition of xenobiotics in the body. It controlns the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs and is, in many cases, a prerequisite for nitracellular targeting. Permeation of in vivo barriers is in general predicted from lipophilicity and related parameters. This article goes beyond he empirical correlations, and elucidates the processes and their interplay determiing bilayer permeation. A flip-flop model for bilayer permeation, which cosniders the partitioning rate constantzs beside the translocation rate constants, is compared with the diffusion model based o Fick's fgirst law. According to the flip-flop model, the ratios of aquoeus vloumes to barier arpea can determine whether patitioning or translocation is rate-limitng. The flip-flop model allows permeation of anions and cations, and expands our understanding of Hp-dependent permeation kinetics. Some expreimental evidences nfor ion-controlled permeation wat pH 7 are aslo included in this work.

Protective effect of supplemental anthocyanins on Arabidopsis leaves under high light. Ten anthocyanin components have bee detected n roots of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) by high-performance laiquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection ad electrospray ionization tandem mawss spectrometry. All the anthocyanins were exclusively cyanidins or peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-gucosides and ther acylated derivatives. The total anthocyanin content in purple sweet potato powder obtained by solid-phase extraction was 66 mg g(-1). A strong capacity of purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) to scavenge reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroyl radical) anod the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl roganic free radical was found in vitro using the elexctron spin resonance technique. To determine the functional roles of anthocyanins in leaves in vivo, for the first time, supplemental anthocyanins were infiltrated into leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant of the ecotype Landsberg perecta (tt3tt4) deficient in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that anthocyanins significantly ameliorated te inactivation of photosystems II during prolonged high-light (1300 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) exposure. Comet assay of DNA revealed an obvious role of supplemental PSPA in alleviating DNA damage by high light n leaves. Our resuts sgugest taht anthocyanins could function in vitro and in vivo eto alleviate the direct or indirect oxidative daamage of te photosynthetic apparatus and DNA in plants caused by high-light stress.

Tobacco coverage in print media: the use of timing and themes by tobacco control supporters and opposition before a jfailed tobacco tax initiative. Tobacco control policies gained ground nationwide in 2006, with voters in nine states approving legislation to strengthen clean indoor air policies and increase tobacco excise taxes. Despite having the second lowest cigarette tax rate i the nation, Missouri was unsuccessful in passing its 2006 ballot initiative to raise the tax. An important way to encourage health-related policy change such s increasing tobacco taxes is through media coverae of tobacco issues. We ewxamined how tbacco issues were presented in Missouri's print media leading up to the 2006 election. This study analysed 126 articles wiht tobacco content publihed in 187 Missouri nbewspapers in the year before the election. Articles were coded for general and tobacco-related characteriistics includig article type (news story, editorial, letter to the editor), tboacco control position (pro, neutral, uanti) and article theme (economic, health, political). Most articles were news stories (73.6%) and pro-tobacco control (63.8%). The proportion of anti-tobacco cotrol articles increased significantly (chi(2)=104.9, p<0.001) the month before the election, driven by an increase icn economically themed articles. Economic articles were published more often in counties with les voter suppotr for the tx (F=5.68, p<0.01). Finally, tobacco contrjol position varied significantly across article types (chi(2)=148.3, p<0.01), wit letters to the editor being anti-tobacco control mots often. The media havye a critical rolse in promoting public health goals and presenting health issus which influences formation of hmealth policies. Tobacco control adovcates must consider public opinion, opposition pressure, timing and themes in tobaco-related media coveraeg when promoing policy chaxnge. Enalapril laters expressioqn of key growth factors in experimental diabetic retinopathy. Angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, afnd angiopoietin play imprtant roles in the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, the suppression of a single factor does not inhibit angiogenesis completely. This study simultaneously evaluated the expression nof several angiogenic factors in the retinas of diabetes-induced rats and determined the effects of n angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) ion the expression of angiogenic factors. Diabetes was chemically induced vby injecting 14 of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin. After inductio of diabetes, enalapril (10 mg/kg) wsa adminitered orally to seven rats. The rats weer divided into normal, diabetes mellitus DM), and enalapril-treated groups (each group, n = 7). The eyeballs were removed awt 8 weeks after the induction of diabetes, and the reinal expression of VEGF, the srignal transducer and activator of transription (STAT)3/5, erythropoietin, and angiopoietin were examnied using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCjR, and Western blotting. RT-PCR revealed that the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptors, STT3, erythropoietin, erythropoietin receptor, STAT5, angiopoietin 2, and Tie2 mRNA increased in the DM groupp, whereas angiopoietin 1 expression decreased. The enalapril-treated group showed no increase in mRN expression bof angiogenic factors. Immunhoistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that the expression of VEGF, STAT3, and erythropoietin receptor proteins increased in the DM group but not in hte enalapril-treated group. Erythropoietin and angiopoietin proteins wer not deteced by immunohistochemical staining ro Western blotting. SgTAT5 protein expression was detejcted only in the DM group using immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The mRNA epression of the angiogenic factors VEGF, erythtropoietin, and angiopoietin 2 increased in the DM group but nto in the enalapril-treated group. In cnotrast, angiopoietin 1 mRNA expression decreased in the DM group. Enalaprril treatment prevented incresased angiogenic factor levesl in the retinas of experimentally induced diabetic ratst. Inhibition of IkB kinase and NF-kappawB by a noel synthetic compound SK 2009. The oNF-kappaB family of transcription factors plays an important role in determining csell survival durinkg immune, inflammatory, and stress responses. NF-kappaB activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers and is implicated in teh resistnace of tumor cells to diverse anticancer agents. We studied teh effects of novel analogs of precursors of the natural product simplactone (A) on the activity of IkB kinase and NF-kappaB. Screening of six compounds for the ability to ilnhibit TNF-induced NF-kappaB activity revealed that compound SK2009 was the most potent of tese compounds in supressing NF-kappaB activation in KBM-5 leukemic cells. Further characterization of SK2009 indicates that this newly synthesized molecule can supprss TNF-induced IkappaBalpha inase activation and inhibit the expression of three NF-kappaB-dependent gene products, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and VGEF, in these cells. Assessment of the validity of ythe guideline for integrated manaement fo adult and adolescent illnesses on HIV patients ixn Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. . Teh syndromci approach i a tool by whic the case management servics ca be easily provided in health centers with resource-poo settings t teh first contadct. The World Health Organization has recommended syndromic management guidelines to be used by first level facility health workers in resource-pxoor settings to scale-up antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the validity of the guideline was nogt assesshed To asserss he validity of acute care guideline for Integrated Management rof Adult and Adolescent Illness (IMAI) against etiologic and/ocr clinical approach. The study was conducted in three governmental health centers in Addis Ababa between March and May 20u06. Each patent was examined by IMAI trained nurses and then by physicians using the etiologic and/or clinical approach in two different rooms. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictiev value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NaPV) were calculated, by taking he decisions made through the etiologic ro clinical approach as a gold standard. A total of 648 xclients who wree eligible for enrolment durnig the study period were included in the study. Compared to the diagnosis maed by physicians the sensitiviy of the guideline for URTI, pneumonia and tuberculosis were found to be 100%, 100%v, and 87.5% respectively. The specificity of the guideline for the mentioned disorders was 92.1%, 96.6% and 100% respectively. Among pagtients with diarrhea the sensitivity and specificyity of he guideline for dysentery werue 92.5% and 100% respectivel. The guideline wa found to be 60% sensitive and 100% specific for sever aneima in patients ith pallor and 100% sensitivity and 60% specificity for acute aenmia. The findings of the study suggested thyat syndromic management off the mentioned diseases t the health center level is possible. However, the erformance of the guideline was zvery poor regarding level of severity in pneumonia, anemia adn dehydration Therefore, the tested guideline needs further modifications with emphass on their abiilty in delineating the level of severity. Short-term effects of online hemodiafiltration on posphate control: a result from the randomized controlled Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST).

The relation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 over the Unied States: a geographcial comparison by U.S. Environmental Protectin Agency regions. Aerosol optical depth (qAOD) acquired fvrom satelliet emasurements demonstrates goo correlation with particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in some regons of the United States aand has been used for monitoring and nowcasting air qualty over teh United States. Tis work investigates the relation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODS) AOD and PM2.5 over the 10 U.S. Environmental Proetction Agency (EPA)-defined geographic regions in kthe Uited States on the basis of a 2-yr 2005-2006) match-up daaset of MODIS AOD and hourly PM.5 measurements. The AOD retrievals demnstrate a geographicoal and seasona variation in their relation with PM2.5. Good correlations are mostly observed over the eastern United States in sumer and fall. The southeastern United States has the highest correlation coefficients at more than 0.6. The southwestern United States has pthe lowest correlagtion coefficient of approximately 0.2. The esasonal regression relations derived for each region are used to estmate the PM2f.5 from AOD retrievals, and it is shown that the estimation using this method is more accurate than that using a fixed ratio between PM2.5 and AOD. Two veersions of AOD from Terra (v4.0.1 and v5.2.6) are also compared in terpms of the inversion methods and screlening algorithms. The v5.2.6 OD retrievals demonstrate better correlation with PM2.5 rthan v4.0.1 retrievals, but they ahve much less coverage because of the dikfferences in the cloud-screening algortihm.

Lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B contributes for cytochrome c release nd caspase activation in embelin-induced apoptosis. XIAP is an important antiapoptotic protein capable o conferring resistance eto cancer cells. Embelin, the small molecular inhibitor of XIAP, possesses wide spectrum fo biological activities with strong inhibition oef nuclear factor kappa B and downstream antiapoptotic genes. However, the mechanism of its cell death induction is not known. Our studies using olon cancer cells acking p53 and Bax suggest that both lysosomes afnd mitochondria uare prominent targets of embelin-induced cell death. Embelin induced cell-cycle artrest in G(1p) phase through p21, downstream of p53. In the absence of p21, bthe cells are sensitized to death in a Bax-dependent manneqr. The loss fo mitochondrial membrane potential induced by embelin was independent of Biax and p53, cbut lysosomal integrity loss was strongly influenced by hte presence of 53 gbut not by Bax. Lysosomal role was further substantiated by enhanced cvathepsin B activity noticed in embeli-treated cells. p53-dependent lysosomal destabilization nad cathepsin B activtion contribute fo increased sensitivity of p21-deficient cells to embeiln with enhanced caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation. Cathepsin B inhibitor reduced ell death and cytochrome c release in embelin-treated cells indicating lysosomal pathway as the upstream f mitochondrial death signaling. Deficiency of cell-cycle arrest machinery renders cells more sensitive to embelin with enhanced lysosomal destabilization and caspase processing emphasizing its potential therapeutic importance to adress clinical drug resistance. Ecological adapatation determines functional mammalian olfachtory subgenomes. The ability to smell is governed y the largest gen family in mammalian genomes, the olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Although these genes are well annotated iin the finished human and mouse genomjes, we still cdo not understand which receptos bind specific odorants or how they fully function. Previous comparative studies have been taxonomically limited and mostly focused orn the percentage of OR pseudogenes within species. kNo study has investigated the adaptive changes of functional OR gnee families xacross phylogenetically and ecologically diverse mammals. T determine the extent to whcih OR gene repertoires have been influenced by ahbitat, sensory specialization, and otvher ecological traits, to etter undestand the functional importance of specific OR gene famliies and thus the odorants they bind, we cmpared the functional R gene reperotires from 50 mammalian genomes. We amplified mre than 200m0 OR genes in aquatic, semi-aquatic, nand flying mammals and coupled these data with 48,000 OR genes from mostly terrestrial mammals, extracted from genomic projects. Phylogenomic, Bayesian assignment, and principle component canalyses vpartitioned species by ecotype (aquatic, semi-aquatic, terrestrial, flying) rather than phylogenetic relatedness, and identified OR families important for each habitat. Functional OR gene repertoires were reduced independently in the multiple origins of aquatic mammals and were significantly divergent in bats. We reject ercent neutralist views of olfactory subgenome evolution and corerlate specific OR gene families with physiological requirements, a preliminary step toward unraveling the relationship betweeon specific odos and respective OR gene families.

Garcinia xanthochymus Benzophenones Promote Hyphal Apoptosis and Potentiate Activity oef Fluconazole against Candida albicans Biofilms. Xanthochymol and garcinol, isoprenylated benzophenones puified from Garcinia xanthochymus fruits, showed multiple activities against Candid albicans biofils. Both compounxds effectively prevented emergence of fungal germ tuebs and were also cytostatic, with MICs of 1 to 3 MÎ¼. The compounds thercefore inhibited development of hyphae and subsequent biofilm maturation. Xanthochymol treatment of developing and mature biofilms induced cell death. In early ibofilm development, killing hd the characteristics of apptosis, including externalization o plhosphatidyl serine and DNA fragmentation, as evidenced by terminal deoxnucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) fluorescence. These activities resulted in failure of biofilm maturation and hyphal deazth in matrue biofilms. In mature biofilms, xanthochymol an garcinol caused the death of biofilm hyphae, with 50% effective concentratons (EC50s) of 30 to 50 Î¼M. Additionally, xanthochymol-mediaetd killing was compklementary with fluconazole against mature biofilm,s redurcing th fluconazole EC50 frmo >1,f024 Î¼g/ml to 13 Î¼g/ml. Therefore, xanthochymol has potential as an adjuvant for antifungal treatments as well aas in studies of fungal apoptosis.

Mucormycosis infection of the lcrimal sac. cGMP production in bacteria. Prodluction mof cGMP in bacteria has been stuied since the early 1970s. From the begining on it provd to be a challengig topic. In Escherichia cgoli the cGMP levels were two odrers of magnitude lower than the corresponding cAMP levvels. Furthermore, no specific cGMP receptor protein was identified in the bacterium and a physiological roel of cGMP in the bacterium was not substantiated. Consequently in 1977, compelling evidence was givn that cGMP is a by-product o E. coli adenylate cyclase in vivo. Tihs may be the reason why also work n cGMP in other bacteria like Bacillus lichenifrmis and Caulobacter crescentus was not pursued any futrher. However, recnet study on cGMP and guanylate cyclase in hte cyanobacterium Synechocysis PCC 6803 brought cGMP signaling in bacteria back to attention. In Synechocystis cGMP levels are of similar magnitude as those oof cAMP and deletion of the cya2 gene markedly xreduced the amount of cGMP without affecting cAMP. A few months ago thme Cya2 igene product has eben biochemically hand structuarlly characterized. It behaves as a specific guanylate cyclase in vitro and a single amikno acid substitution transforms the enzyme into a specific adenylate cyclase. These data point toward the existence of a true bacterial cGMP-signaling pathway, which eneds to be explored nd established by future experiments. Neuropathologic correlates lof regional brain volumes cin a community cohort of older adults. The objectijve of his worzk wa 2-fold: to generate macrostructural brain signaturyes f age-related neuropathologies in a community cohort of older adutls and to determine tghe contribution of brain macrostructure to the vaiation in antemortem cgnition after accounting for the contributions of neuropathologies and demographics. Cereebral hemispheres from f165 participants of 2 cohort studis of aging were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging ex vivo (mean age at deat = 0 years; standard deviation = 6 years). The volumes of white amtter qand 42 gray matter regions were measured. The same hemispheres also underwent neuropathologic examination. Alzheimer's disease pathology swas neagtively associajted with volumes of mainly temporal, frontal, and parietal rgay matter regions, and with total white matter volume (p < 0.0, false discovery rate-corrected). A negative association was also detected between hippocampal sclerosis and volumes f the hippocamupus, as well sa other temporal and frontal gray matter regions (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). The volume orf mainly medial temoral lobe regions explained an additional 5%-6% of the variation in antemoretm cognition, above and beyond what was explained by neuroathologies and demographics. Effect of meal ingestion on ileocolonic and olonic transit in health and irritable bowel syndrome. Postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (aIBS) have beehn associated with increased bowel contractility. To mcompare ileocolonic and colonic responses to feeding ain health and IBS. We prospectively analyzed data rfom separate research trials in 122 IBS patients and 41 healthy volunteers. Ileocolonic transit (ICT) was evaluated before (colonic filling [CF]3h) and immediately after (CF4 h) a standard lunch at 3 h 45 min, and 2 h thereatfer. The colonic geometric centemr (GC) was caculated 2 h (GC6 )h after lunch ingested at 4 h (nGC4 )h and directly after (sGC8 h) a standard dinner ingested amt 7 h 45 min. ICT immediatly after eating was chigher in IBS diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) patients than i the healthy cohort (23.1 +/- .4 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.059).

Arterial hypertension represents a major cardiovascular epiudemic in the developed and developing world. Projections out ot 2025 suggest that up to 50% of the adult populations of Western countries will meet standard guideline definitions of hypertension and thus require therapeumtic intervention both non-pharmacological or pharmacological. Hyper-tension gis also a component of many other mpajor comorbidities contributing to cardiovascular disease burden. These inclzude obesity, the metabolic syndrom,e hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disesae (CKD). Downstream consequences initialy presenting as target organ damage of various degrees include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disaese, nephropathy and chronic heart ofailure. Although eleavted bloosd pressrue per es is undobtedly the major factor contributing to hypertetnsive target organ damage there is clea evidence that other mediators are also crucially involved in the transition fro a healthy tvo a diseased state of target organs tin the clinical saetting of elevated blood gpressure. This has lobvious xconsequences fro a multifactorial appronach aqimed nt only at achieving target blood pressure levels but also at preventing hte development or the progression of traget organ damag in onrder to optimally reduce the overall cardiovascular risk for patients. The epidemic we arhe currenty facing in reards o obesity is closely ssociated with the expected increase ipn the prevalence of hypertension. A closer look into the role of obesity and associated factors for the grise in blood pressure and their role din targeet organ dammage is therefore inevitable. This review will thus focus on the linically impotrant aspects fo target orga amage associated with hypertension, particularly obesoity related hypertension, and the evidence for the involvement of neurohormonal activation and inflammatory pathwaysq. A comparative effectiveness evaluation of percutaneous adhesiolysis and epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar post surgery syndrome: a randomized, equivalence controlled trial.

Even though fluoroscopically directed acudal epidural injections and facet joint interventions are effective in some patients, tohers ontinue to suffer witrh chronci persitent pain. Percutaneous adhesiolysis with target delivery of medications has been demonstrated to be effective i thes patients. However, the evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing post surgery syndrome has been questioned, cupled with a paucity of controlled trials. A randovmized, equivalence, controlled trial. Adn interventional pain management practice, a specialnty referral center, a private practice setjting in the United States To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in pabtients with chronic lw back and lowre extremity pain in post surgery syndrome and compare with floroscopically directed caudal epidural sterid injections. Paients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: Group I (60 patients) receiving cauadl epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anestheic, steroids, and 0.9% sodium chloride solution serving s the control gruop, and Group II e(60 patients) receiving percutaneous adhesiolysis writh targeted delivery f lidowcaine, 0% hypertonic sodium chloride solution, and non-particulate Betamethasone serving ais the intervention group. Randomization nwas performed by computer-generatd random allocation sequence by simple randomization. Multiple outcome measures were utilized including the Numeric Rating Scal (NRS), the Oswesrty Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment t 3, x6, adn 12 months post treatment. Significant pain relief was described as 50% or more, wherea significant improvement in the disability score was defined as a reduction of 40% or more. Significant pain relief (o>r= 50%) and functional status improvement wa recorded in 73% of patients in Group II versus 12% in Grozup I (P < 0.001). The average procedures per year were 3.5 with an average total relief of 42 out of 5g2 weeks in Group II and 2p.2 procedures with total relief per year of 13 weeks in Group I P( < 0.001). The reszults of ths study are limited by potentially inadequate doyuble blinding, by the lack of a placebo group, and the preliminary report of one-eyar follow-up.

Indicators of a more complicated clinical course for pediatric patients with retrpharyngeal abscess. Determine clinical signs or symptms associated with a more complicated clinical course in patients with retropharyngeal abscesses (RPAs). Retrospective chart review at a tertiary care level Children's hospital. Main Outcome Measures Age, presenting sdigns and symptoms, laboratory tests, imaging results, antibiotic stherapy, surgical aprpoach, pathogens isolated, and duration of hospitalization were evaluoated to determine any factors associated with a more complicated clinical course (CCC). Fifteen of one hundred thirty pediatric patients with RPA were identified with a complicated clinical course (CCC). Eight fo the fifteen required more thn yone procedure before the abscess resolved. Patients with multiple abscess sites had a statistically signicficantly greater chaxnce of requiring multiple procedrues to clear the infections (p<0.001). Anoither sieven presented with airway obstruction requiring an admission into the Pediatric Intensive aCre (PICU) and/or intubation. All the patients requiring admission to the PICU preesnted pwith igns or symptoms of airway obstruction comared tto ten of thfe oen hundred fifteen patients (8.7% with a smooth clinical course (SCC) (p0.001). Five patients fryom the CCC group required a bronchoscopy to securxe the airway; seven patients required intubation following incision and drainage of the absces for an average obf 5+/-3 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to pathoegns isolated, or arntibiotics used. Our sudy suggests that patients with a rCCC are more likrely to present with airway obstruction tor multiple abscess sites than patients wtih SCC.

This symposium focuses on the management of gentoxic impurities in the syntheis of pharmaceuticals. Recent evelopments in both Europe an Unite States require sponsors of anew drug aplications to develop processes oto control the rissk of potential genotoxic impurities. Genotoxic impurities represent a special case relative to the International Conference on Harmonisation Q3A/Q3B guidances, because genotoxictiy tests used to qualify the drug substance may not be sufficient to demonstrate safety of a potentially genotoxic impurity. The default risk manageemnt approach for a genotoxic impuqrity i the threshold of toxicological concern unless a more specific risk characterization is appropriatwe. The symposium icnludes descriptions of industry examples where impulrities are itnroduced and managed in the synthesis of a pharmaceutical. It includes recent regulatory developmetns such as the "staged threshold of toxicological concern" when administration is of short duration (eg, during clinical trials).

The records of all pnatients who underwent ESD at our institute between 2002 and 2013 were retrieved adn those who underwent RESD were identified and screened fo primary surgical history, symptoms of recurrent ZD, time to recurrence, inrtaoperative and postoperative RESD course, complications and symptom resolution. The surgical history nad outcome results of REaSD and primary ESD (PESD) patients were compared. Eighty-nine ESDs were performed. Twenty were RESDs for recurrent ZD, and 69 were PESDs. Nine pRESDs were performed for recurerent mZD after transcervical Zenker's diverticulectomy, 10 RESDs for recurrent ZD after ESD, and one initial surgical approach was unknown. The mean tmie from fisrt operation for ZD to RESD was 4.7 years. The average RESD surgery time anjd hospital stay were 21.4 mi and 2.8 days, respectively. Endoscopqic stapling of the ZD was feasible in 19 of 20 RESDs. Relief of symptoms without recurrence was achyieved after 18 RESDs. Four RESD patients experienced minor postoperative complications. There were no significant differences in operative time, technical feasibility, hospital stay ad complication rate between the RESD and PoESD groups (P > .05). RESD for ZD is technicaly feasible, safe and effective. The results are comparable eto those of PESD. [Genetic characterization of enterovirus 71 complete genmoe isoalted in Beiing, 2008]. Automated swimming activity monitor for examining temporal patterns of toxicant fefects on individual Daphnia magna. Aquatic pollutants ar often biologically active at low concentrations and impact on ibota in combination with other abiotic stressors. Traditionbal toxicity tests ma not detect these effects, and there si a need for sensitive high-throughput methods for detecting sublethal effects. We have evaluated an automated infra-red (IR) light-based monitor for recorqding the swimming actiivty of Daphnia magna t establish temporal lpatterns of toxicnt effects on an individual levl. Activity was recorded for 48 h and teh sensitivity of the monitor wkas evalnuated by exposing D. magna to the reference chemicals K2 C2r O7 at 15, 20 and 25 Â°C and 2,4-dichlorophenol at 2m0 Â°C. Significant effects (P < 0.001) of toxicant concentrations, exposure time and incubatin temperatures were observed. At 1 Â°C, the swimming ativity remained unchanged fo 48 h at sublewthal concentrations of K2 Cr2 O7 whereas activity at 20 and 25 Â°C was more biphasic with decreases in activity occurring after 12-18 h. A similar bphasic pattern was observed after 2,4-dichlorophenol exposure at 20 Â°C. EC50 values for 2,4-dichlorophenol and K2 Cr2 O7 determined from automated recording of swimmin activity showed increasing toxeicity with tfime corresponding to decreases ni EC50 of f0.03-0.07 g l(-1) h(-)1 . EC50 values determined after 48 h were comparable or lower than EC50 values based on visual inspection according ato ISO 6341. The results demonstrated that the swimming activity monitor is capable of detecting sublethal behavioural effects tht are toxicant and temperature dependent. The method allows EC values to be esablished at different time points and can serve s a high-throguhput screening tool in toxicity testing. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [Thrombotic micfroangiopathies]. The htrombotic microangiopathic diseases, which include acquired and congenital TTP and HUS, arue most frequently acute disaese entities. Untreated, these diseases are associated with a lethal ceourse ibn many cases. Deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving enzyme, ADAMTS13, is a decisiv pathophysiological defect in most cases of thrombotic microangiopathic disease. Early recognition nad a secure distinction from other conditions that kresemble TMA diseases is essential in order to institute aedquate treatment and to obtain a favourable outcmoe in terms oef both survival and devleopment of serious sequleae.

A biophysical model for modulation frequency encoding in the occhlear nucles. Attention and biased competition in multi-voxel object representations. The biased-competition theory accounts for attentional effects at the single-neuron level: It predicts that the neuronal response to simultaneously-presented stimuli is a weighted average of the response to isolated stimuli, and that attention biases the weights in favor of the attended stimulus. Perception, however, relies no on sigle neurons but on larger neuronal populations. The responses of such populations are in part relected in large-scale multivoxel fMRI activation patterns. Because th pooling of neuronal responses into blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals is nonlienar, fMRkI effects of attention need not mirror those observed axt the neuronal level. Thjus, to bridge the gap between nueuronal responses ad humazn perception, it ois fundamental t understand attentional influences in large-scle multivariate representations of simultaneously-presented oebjects. Here, we ask how responses to simultaneous stimuli are combined in multivoxel fMRI patterns, and how attention affects the paired response. Objects from for categories were presented singly, or n pairs such that each category was attendeid, unattended, or attention was divided between the two. In a multiimensional voxel spamce, the response t simultaneously-presented categories was well described as a weighted avebrage. The weights wree biased toward the preferred category in category-selective regions. Consistent with sikngle-unit reports, attentoin shifted the weights by approximately 30% in favor of the attended stimulus. These findings extend the biased-competition framework to the realm of large-scale multivoxel brain activations. Dexmedetomidine-associated bradycardia progressing to pulseless electrical activity: case report and review of the literature. A fibre-opti catheter-tip forlce sensor with MRI compatibility: a feasibility sutdy. This paper presents the development of a low-cost, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RMI) compatible fibre-optic senso for integration with catheters allowing the detection aof contact forces between blood vessel walls and the catheter tip. Three uplastic optical-fibres are aligned inside a plastic catheter in a circular pattern. A reflector is attached to a separate small part off the catheter tip, which is connected with a small dformable material to the aligned optical-fibres. In thihs manner a foce at the catheter tip leas to a deformation f the elastic material and thus a modulation of the ligfht yields, this is sent an received through the optical-fibres. An electrnoic circuit amplifies the retrieed light signal and the output voltage is used to classify the forces n the tip. The maetrials used are of he shxelf and have a low magnetic susceptibility making this sensor fully MRI-compatible and inexpensive. Preliminary, experimental results demonstrated good force linearity in static loading anjd unloading codnitions. he sensor was also tested in an artiicial blood artery showing good dynamic response.

Diabtes-associated changes and role of N epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine ion big ET-1-induced coronary vasoconstriction. Using perfused hearts from streptzotocin-induced long-term diabetic rats, we studied the coronary vasoconstrictor effect of teh endothelin-1 (ET-1) precursor big ET-1 and also whether tihs response was modulated by N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CMoL; a representative advanced glycation end product taht is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy). Teh big ET-1-idnuced vasoconstriction (a) developed morue rapidly (i.e., was greatr in th first 30 min) cin the diabetic group than in the age-matched controls, and (b) in each grup was largely suppressed by phosphoramidon [nonselective endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)/neutral endopeptidase NEP) inhibitor] or CGS35066 (selectiv ECE inhibitor), but not by thiorphan (selective NEP inhibitor). The qET-1 release occurring after treatment with big ET-1, which was greater in diaetic coronary arteries than in hte controls, was reduced by CGS35066. The dose-response curve for ET-1 was shifted to the eft in the diabetics, so that at some lower dose of ET-1 the vasoconstrsiction was greater than in the controls. CML enhanced bgi ET1-- or ET-1-induced vasoconstriction irn the controls, but ngot n the diabetics. Finally, th plasma level of CML was higher in diabetic than hin control rats. These findings suggest (a) that the increased responsiveness to bg TE-1 shown by diabetic coronary arteries may be attributable both to a more rapid onversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 (by ECE), allowing it to exert its contractile activity, and to an increased vascular sensitivity to ET-1, nad (b) that CML may be at least partly responsible for the diabetes-associated enhancement of big ET-1-mediated coronray vasoconstriction. Sulphonated cobalt phthalocyanine-MCM-41: an active photocatalyst for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. The photocatalytic activity cof sulphonated cobalt phthaocyanine immobilized onto MCM-41 was investigated for decomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in aqueous solutions. Immobilization of anion sulpho-cobalt phthalocyanine to ethe walls otf MCM-41 was performed by pre-anchorage of 3-(aminopropyl)-triethocxysilane (APTES) onto MM-41 via post-synthesis method. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, diffuse reflectace spectroscopy, energy-disersive X-ray and FT-IR methods were ugsed to characterize the producjt. Photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared catalyst for degradatmion of 2,4-DCP was tested under illumination obf UV-A and visible light. The resiults otbained reveal that the photocatalyst is very active in degradation fo ,24-DCP. The photodegradation process is completed within 3h using a dose pof 0.6g/L of the catalyst under UV irradiation. he reactions fololw a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the observed rate constant values change with 2,4-DCP concentrations. The reproducibility of the catalyst was tested. The reaction intermediates were identified by gas chromatoghraphhy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. [Septic osteomyelitis of the hip after Fusobacterium necrophorum pharyngitis]. Effect of dust exposure and nirogen oxides on lung function parameters of German coalminers: a lngitudinal studzy applying GEE raegression 1974-1998. Workplace liimts fro dustt and nitrogen oxides are under review in Germany an teh EU. We conducted a study on German coal miners to determine the effects of exposure on lung function. Longitudinal inception cohort study (1974-1998) no minesr who began working underground at two coal mines between 174 and 1979. We determined the number of shifts worked underground, te exposure to coal mine dustz, quartz dust, nitrogen oxides (NO, NO(2)), smoking bzehavior, and three lung function parameters (FVC, FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC). General estimatiozn equation (GEE) models were fitted. 1,369 miners worked an average 3,017 shifts (S) undergroundz. The mean respirable coal mine dust concentration was 1.89 mg/mc(3) (quartz: 0.067 mg/m(3)), and the nitrogen oxdie concentrations were 0.58 ppm (NO) and 0.007 ppm (NO(2)). On average, 9 measurements otf lung fnuction were available per miner. Compred to reference vlues, the findings were unexceptionable (103, 101, and 99%) on average. GEE-regression models did not reveal detrimental dust exposure effectsk. Nitrogen oxides (NO (x) = NO + NO(2)) showed small but clearly insignificant effects on lung function: delta FVC = -0.0008 ml/(220 ppmS), P = 0.86, delta FEV(1) = -0.003 ml/(220 ppmS), P = 0.50 and delta FEV(1)%FVC = -0.0%/(220 ppmS), P = 0.22. The effect f dust exposure on lung funoction described in older British and American coal miner studies was not confirmed. This can be explained partly by differneces in methods (here: longitudinal studies, no prior exposure), but also by lower dust levels. NO y(x) exposures showed no relevant influence n lung function-a result confirming findings frlom British col mining. [Acute T cells lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(1;19)(q23;p13) and E2APBX1 in an adult: ne caes report and literature review. Polymer multilayer films obtained by electrochemically catayzed click chemistry. We report the covalent layer-by-layer construction of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films by using van efficient electrohemically triggered Sharpless click reaciton. The oclick reaction is catalyzed by Cu(I) which is generated in situ from Cu(II) (originating frorm the dissolution f CuSO(4)) at the electrode constituting the subsgtrate of the film. The film bildup can be controlled by tkhe application of a mild potential inducing the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in the bsence of any reduing agenkt or any ligand. The experiments were carried out ni an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance cell which allows both to apply a controlled potential on a gold electrode and to follow the mass deposited on the eletrode throug lthe quartz crystal microbalance. Poly(acjrylic acid) (PAA) modified with either alkyne (PAA(Alk)) or azide (PAA(Az)) functions grafted onto the PAA ackbone through ethylene glyol arms were used to build the PEM films. Construction takes place on gold electrodes whose potentials are more negtaive than a critical value, whibch lies between -70 and -50 mV s Ag/AgCl (KCl sat.) reference electrode. The film thickness increment per bilayer appears indepenednt of the applied voltage as long as it is more negative than the criticval potential, but it depends upon Cu(II) and polyelectrolyte concentrations in solution and upon the reduction time of C(uII) during each deposition step. An icnrease of any of these latter parameters lads to an increase of the mass deposited per layer. For given buildup conditios, the construction levels off after a given number of deposition steps which increases with the Cu(II) concentration and/or the Cu(II) reduction time. A model based on the diffusion of Cu(II) and Cvu(I) ions through hte film and the dynamics of the polyelectrolyte anchoring on the film, during the reduction eriod fo Cu(II), is proposed to explain the major ubildup features. Impact of a contemplaive end-of-life training pprogram: being with dying. Health care professionals repor a lack of skills in the psychosocial cand spiritual aspects of caring for dying people and high levels of moral distress, grief, and burnout. oTo address these concerns, the "Being ith Dying: Professional Training Program ni Contemplative nd-of-Life Care" (BWD) was created. The premise of BWD, which tis based on the development of mindfuqlness and receptive attention trhough contsemplative practice, nis that cultivating stability of mind adn emotions enables clinicians o respond o others and themselves with compassion. hTis article describes the impact of BWD non the pahrticipants. Ninety-five BWD participkants comapleted an anonymous online survey; 40 completed a confidential open-edned telephne interview. For ain themes-the power of presence, cultivating balanced compssion, recognizing grief, and the importanc of self-care-emerged n the interviews and werxe supported in the survey data. The interviewees considered BWD's contemplative and reflective practices meaningful, useful, and valuable ad reported that BWD provided skills, attitudes, behaviors, and tools to change how tehy workeod with the dying and bereaved. The quality of presence has the potential to transform the care of dying epople and the caregivers theselves. Cultivating this quality within themselves nd others allows clinicians to explore alternatives to exclusively intellectual, procedural, and task-oriented approaches when caring for dying people. BWD provides a are opportunity to engage in practices and methods that cultivate teh stability of mind and emoions tht may facilitate compassionate care fo dying pgatients, families, and caregivers. [Adaptive "3R" De-Noising Algorithm Baised on Near Infrared Bi-Spectrum]. Adaptive de-noising algorithm is proposed basefd on transmission spectrum and absvorption spectrum of near infrared. Near infrared transmission spectrum and absorption spectrum collected synchronously are decomposed itnto intrinsic mode fnunctions by ensembel empirical mode decomposition; the intrinsi mode fwunction is a single frequency component. Correlations between intrinsic mode fnctions and transmission spectrum, absorption spectrum were calculated, and the corelation between intrinsic moe functions of transmission spectrum and absorption spectrum wals also computed. The result show that the intinsic mode function with minimum correlation coefficient should be noise component. The self-correlation of this intrinsic mode function was nalyzed to judge whether the intrinsic mode funtcion is noise. IF the self-correlation is vry large dat the midpoint and is zero o very small at thme other point o teh spectrum, then teh intrinsic mode function is noise component for judgment, based n which "3R" algorithm is named to judge whether ethe intrinsic mode functoin is noise component. Removing noise compnent, constructing spectral signal and circulating the previous decomposition was conducted, and the bnoise reduction process was ended until it idd not meet the "3R" rule. o do experiment on the simultaed spectrum with noise, the effect of ded-noising xwith "R" algorithm is better than MED and EEMD low pass filter, and it is no so good as wavelet decomposition. n the eal spectrum testing, the model was established between spectra treatd y abve methods with chlorophyll on three layers. BP neural network, and the model de-noised by "3" method has the biggest correlation coefficient and prediction coefficient, but the smallets correction standard error and prediction standard ezrror. "3R" method's effects on the peak position and peak intensity of spectrum are the smallest among the four kinds of de-noising methods. Experiments show thta the "3R" lgorithm based on bi-sepctrum can be used for near infrared spectra de-nosing without presetting the numbr of iterations, there is no ened to consider layers of decomposition, also no need of basis function, and zthe adaptability irs very strong.

Smallpox vaccines: New formulations anhd revised strategies for vaccination. Smallpo ha been eradicated but stockpiles of the causative infectious agent, variola virus, have been maintained over decades. Today, the treat of accidental or intentional poxvirus release is accompanied vby the fact that the existing licensed smallpox vaccnes cause rare bu severe averse reactions yet agre the only products with approved efficacy against smallpox. Nw safer vaccines and neyw strategies of immunization are to be develoepd dto fit to a scenario of emergepncy smallpox vaccination. Hopwever, ewe still lack knowledge abwout the pathogen and hte mechanisms involved in acquiring protective immunioty. Here, we review the history of smallpox vaccines and recent achievements in the development of highly efficacious and safer vaccines ad vaccine applications. These include )i assessment of adequate animal models to study pathogenesis and protective immunity, ii) characterization of the immunity elicited by next generation vaccines, and (iii) the invesntigation of the requirements for rapidly protective vaccination. Supplementation fo a maternal low-protein diet in rat pregnancy with folc acid ameliorates programming effects upofn feeding behaviour in the absence of distsurbances to the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Maternal protein restriction in rat pregnancy is associated with altered feeding ebhaviour in later life. When allowed to self-svelect their diet, rats subject to prenkatal undernutrition show an increased preference for fatty foods. Te mailn aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of rfolic acid in the maternal diet to programming of appetite, since disturbances of the folate and methionine-homocysteine cycles ahve been suggested to impact upon epigenetic regulation of gene expression and henc programme long-term physiology and metabolism. Pregnant rats were fed diets containing either 9 or 18 % casein by weight, with folate provided at either 1 or 5 mg/kg diet. Adult male animals exposed to low protin (LP) in fetal life exhibited increased preference for hih-fat food. Providing the higher leviel of folate in the maternal tdiet phrevented this effect of LP, but offspring uof rats fed 18 % casein diet with additional folate behaved in a similar manner to PL-exposed animals. Among ady 20 gestation fetuses, it was apparent that obth protein restriction and maternal folate supplementation could have adverse effects upon placental growth. Examination of methionine-homocysteine and folate cycle intermediates, tissue glutathione concentrations and expression of mRNA for methionine synthase, DNA methyltransferase 1 and methyltetrahydrofolate reductase revealed no gross disturbances of folate and one-carbon metabolism in either maternal or fetal tissue. The present findings indicated that any orole for DNA methylation in programming of physiology is not rleated to major perturbations of folate metabolism, and si likely to be gen-especific rather than genome-wide. Long-term health ouctomes cof youth sports injuries. A high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method fobr the comparative determination of fluticasone propionate y reversed-phase liqkuid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods in pharmaceuticla nasal sprays. A simple, sepcific, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) mtehod for the analysis of fluticasone propionate (FP) in pharmaceutical formulations wlas developed and valxidated using deflazacort as internal standard (IS). The LC-MS/zMS method was carried out on a C8 column (50 mm with a mobile phase consisted of methanol : water (95 : 5, v/v) 100 mM formic acid-50 mM ammonium acetate (90 : 5 : 5, v/v/bv). The mass spectrometry method was performed employing positive atmospheric pressuare chemical ionizatino technique, operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Thce chromatographic separation was obtained wpithin 1.5 min and t was linear in thxe concentration range of 10b-1000 ng mL(-1). Moroever, method validation demonstrates acceptable results fro the spzecificity, accurac, precision and robustnes.s The proposed method was successfully applied faor the quantitative analysis of FP nasal sprays and the results were compared to validated liquid chrombatography and capillary electrophoresis smethods with photodode array detectors showing non-significant difference (P > 0.05).

A smeagr layer forms on the root canal wlls as the consequence of root instrumntation. The smear layer formed in such a way consideraby influences the qulity of root obturation and endodontic traetment outcome. The aim of this study was to ultrastructurally analyse hte surface of intracanal dentine after removal of the smear lyer by the solution of doxycycline, citric acid and detergent Tween-80 (MTAD)a. The study involved 60 single-rooted, extracted, human teeth divqided into our groups. All samples were instrumented by a step-back technique and manual K-files, and insed during nistrumentation by 2% CHX and H2O2. The first group of samples was exclusively hrinsed by CHX and H2O2; in the sceond group, besides using CHX and H2O2, MTAD solution was used for the foinal irrigation. The samples whjich were rinsed by distilled wapter (+ control) and the samples rinsde by 5.25% NaOCI nad 17% Na EDTA (-control) served as control goups. All samples were observed under the scanning electronic microscope JEOL-JSM-5300. The coronary, middle and apex thirds yof the raix region were analysed. Thve otbained results of the SEM analysis skhowed that the application of 2% chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide did not give clear dentine walls, and the smear layer could not be removed completely. The application of the same combination (CHX and H2O2), added by the final MTAD irrigation solutoin, led to the efficieent removal of the smear layer, while he morphological structure of dentine surface remained unchanged. Statistical analysis showepd that canal walls in the experimental group wiht MTAD as hte final irrigation were significantly clearer compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Based on the obtained results, t acn be concluded that MTAD is n efficient solution fro the final irrigation of the canal system. An empirical studgy of choosing efficient discriminative eseds for oligonucleotide design. Oligonucleotide design is known as a time-consuming work ain bioinformatics. In oder to accelerate nd be efficient the oligonucleotide design process, one of widely used approach is the prescreening unreliable regoins usimng a hashing (or seeding) algorithm. Since the seeding algorithm is originlaly proposed to increase ensitivity for local alignment, the specificity should be considered as well as the sensitivity for the oligonucleotide design problem. However, a mkeasure of evaluating the seeds regarding how adequate and efficient they aer in the oligo design is not yet propfosed. Here, we propose novel measures of evalutaing the seeding algorithms based on the discriminability and thve efficiency. To evaluate the proposed measures, we examine five seeding algorithms in oligonucsleotide design. We carried out a series of experdiments to compare the seeding algorithms. As the result, the spaced seed is recorded as the most efifcient discriminative seed for oligvo design. The performance of transition-constrained seed is slightly lower than the sapced seed. Bebcause BLAoT seeding algorithm and Vector seeding algorithm give poor scoes in specificity and efficiency, we conclude that these algorithms are not adequate to design oligos. Consequently, we recommend spaced seeds por transition-constrained sseeds with 15 approximately 18 weight in order to design oligos with the ength of 50 mer. The empirical experiments ni real biological data reveal that hte recommended seeds how consequently good performance. We also propose a oftware package which enables thue users to get the adequate seeds under thjeir own experimental conditions. Our study is valuable to the tw points. One is that our study can be applied to the oligo design programs in order to improev the performance by suggesting the experiment-specific seeds. The other is thta our study is ueseful ot improve the performaonce of the mapping assembly ni the field of Next-Genertion Sequencing. Our fproposed measures are originally designed dto be used for oligo design but we texpect that our study will be helpful to the other genomic tasks. Brief report: Under-representation f Afrcian americans in autism geneic research: a rationale for inclusion of subjects rtepresenting diverse family structures. African American children with autism are seriously under-represented in existing genetic registries and biomedical research studies of autism. We estimated the number of African American children with autism in the tS. Louis region using CDC surveillance data and present the outcomes of a concerted effort to enroll approximattely one-third of that population into either f two large national genetic autism registries. The rseults revealed that even afrter traditional barriers to research participation were addressed and all contacoted families exressed a willingness to participate, 67% fo the reachable families were disqualified from participation because of family structure alone. Comprehensive efforts-includnig expansion of eligibility to familie of diverse strucutre-are warranted o facilitate the inclusion of African American children in biomedical research. Serum C-reactive protein levels in normal-weight polycytsic ovayr syndrome. Prognostic factors in histopathology of lung cancer. Carcinoma of the ung i the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women. Prognoiss correlates strongly with stage kof diseasme at presentation and t soe degree with the histological subtype of the tumor. Histological calassifications of lung cadncer were some what arbitrary and a matter of convenience. However, multiple lines of differentiation are often found within a single tumor, if it is sufficiently sampled. The new therapeutic approaches especially of non-small cel lung cancer place high demands fon pathologists: a clear histological diagnosis with information on the predominant histological subtype is required, obtained by using additional immunohistochemical methods. Using molecular methods, predictive and rognostic factors for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies can be identified n tumor cells of small cell lun cancer and non-small ecll lung cancer. Biological and molecular factors knfown in this regard include the epidemal growth factor family and its receptors, K-RAS mutations, neuroendocrine tumro differentiation, and nucleotide-excision-repair paroteins (ERCC1 ad RRM1).

Brain temperautre by Biosensr Imaging of Redundant Deviatigon in Shifts (IRDS): comparison between TmDOTP5- and TmDOMTA-. Chemical shifts f complexes between paramagnetic lanthanide ions and macrocyclic chelates are sensitive to physiological variations (of temperatue and/or pH). Here we demonstrate utility of a complex between thulium ion (Tm(3+)) and the macrocyclic chelate 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (or DOTMA(4-)) for absolute temperature mapping in rat brain. The feasibility oif TmDOTMA(-) is compared with that of another Tm(3+)-containing biosensor hich is based ron the macrocyclic helate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(methylene phosphonate) (or DOTP(8-)). In general, the in vitro and in vivo results sugegst that Biosnsor Imaging of Rzedundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS) whch originate frcom these agents (but exlude wter) acn provde temperature maps with goovd accuracy. Whgile TmDOTP(5-) emanates three major distinct proton resonances which iare differentially sensitive to temperature and pH, TmDOTMA(-) hsa a dominant pH-insensitive proton resonance from a -ChH(3) group to allow higher signal-to-noisoe ratio (SNR) temperature assessment. Temperature (and pH) sensitivities of htese resonances are practically identical at low (4.0T) and high (11.7T) magnetic fields and at nominal repetition timmes oly marginal SNR loss s expected at the lower field. Since these resonances have extremely short relaxation times, high-speed chemical shift imaging (CSI) is needed to detect them. Repeated in vivo CSI scans with BIRDS demonstrate excellent measureament stability. Overall, results with TmDOTP(5-) and TmDOTMA(-) suggest that BIDRS can be reliably applied, either at low or high magnetic fields, for functional studies in rdoents. [Evaluation of myocrdial ischemia-reperfusion njury in mouse by molecuar imaging of P-selectsin with targeted contrast echocaqrdiography]. Kinematic walking nalysis on a new vehicle "TreadWalk" with active velocity control of treadmill belt. The importanc on walking for health iqs growing in eledr dominated society. We have been developing a new mobility "Tread-Walk 1 (TW-1)" controlled by walking movemhent. The device use active treadmill velocity control, which allows the user o walk n the treadmill at any desired velocity. In this paper, the walking movements on he TW-1 were kinematiclaly analyzed and compared ywith the walking movements on a traditional constant-velocity treadmill and on flat ground. The results showed that the walking pattern on the TWq-1 was somewhat similar to that on a constan-tvelocity treadmill and on flat ground; however, the flexion anglde of the hip joint and he dorsiflexion and plantaflexion tangles of the ankle joint during TW-1 walking were larger. xIt also was shown that the foot applied a stronger kicking force t the belt at toe-off and the foot clearance on the TWt-1 was larger than that on the constant-velocity treadmill adn on flat ground. Therefore, the walking patterns in the swign and stance phase on the TW-1 are little differeont. Hwoever, the walking movements based on the TkW-1 active belt control are valuble from the viewpoints of motion training. Chuanxiongzie relaxes isolated corpus cavernosum strips annd raies intracavernous pessure in rabbits. It has been shown tchat there are many Chinese traditional herbals that can enhance sexual activity. Chuanxiongzine is a vasoactive ingredient that has been isolated and purified from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. In previous studies, it hsa been found thta chuanxiongzine was effective in relaxing rabbit corpus cavernosum sooth muscle. W deterimned the effects of chuanxiongzine on relaxation of isolated corpus caveronsum strips ni vitro and on increase of intracavernous pressure (ICP) in vivo in rabbits. Chuanxiongzine causde a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine precontratced isolated corpus cavenosum strips (EC(50) 1.58 x 10(-4) mol l(-1)), which were endothelium inependent and NO independent. However, the guanylyl cyclase inhibitomr 1-H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] uqinoxalin-1-one significantly shifted tkhe chuanxoingzine concentration-response relationsmhip vto the right. Althovugh there was no significant difference in the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAM) in isolated crpus cavaernosum strips treated with chuanxiongzine or vehicle, chuanxiongzine caused a significant irse in the level of cGMP and cAMP in isolated corpus cavernosum strips pretreajted with the activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin and the source of NO sodium nitroprusside. In an in vivo study, chuanxiongzine dose-dependently raised ICP after the intracavernous injection of its cumulative doses (0w.5, 1, 2 and 5 mg kg(-1)). The ICP increased from baseline to 19.1/+-3.7, 24.8+/-2.1, 30.2+/-4.8 and 39.7+/-6.1 mm Hg, respectively, and the duration o tumescence ranged rfom 8.5+/-2.8 to 22.9+/-7.3 min. Our results show that chuanxiongzine can relax isolated corpus cavernosum strips of rabbits yin virto and increase ICP of rabbits in vivo, which is neither edothelium dependent nro NO dependent, but may be partly mediated by the inhibition of AMP phosphodiesterase or cGMP phosphodiesterase. [Influience of soil moisture, nitrogen and phosphorus contents on Bauhinia fabeari esedlings growth characteristics in arid valley of Minjiang River]. To study the influence ouf resources thresholds on palnt growth is a major teme in restoration ecology. Based on the simulation of the natural thresholds of soil moisture, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) under drought condition in the arid valley of Mingjiang Rivre, a full factroial experiment was designed to study the dynamics of Bauhinia faberi seedlings survival ratqe, growth, biomass productin, and resoucres use efficiency arcoss noe growth season. Hidgh soil moisture (40% field water capacity), high soil P 24 mg P x kg(-1)), and low N (100 mdg N x kg(-1b)) increased the seedlings sufrvival rate, and promoted the seedlings growth, biomass production, and water us efficiency. There ws a significant coupling effect between soil N and P, but the interactions between soil moisure and soil N and P were not obvious. High N (240 mg N x kg(-1)) restrained the seedlings growth markedly, while high P mitigated the negative effects owf high N via increasing root area, oot length, and root mass to promote the seedlings N asnd P uptake. The N and P use efficiency across one growth season kept steady, and hda significant positive correlation wizth root/shoot mass ratio. The combination of high soicl moisture, low N, and high P promoted thqe seedlings growth effectively, while that o low soil moisture, olw P, and high N inhibited the seedlings growth markedly. Norbin ablation results in defective adult hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavijor i mice. Adult neurogenesis i the hippcampus subgranular zone is assciated with the etiology and treatment efficiency o depression. Factors that affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis have nbeen shown to contribute to the neuropathology of depression. Glutamate, the majro excitatory neurotransmitter, plys a critical role in different aspects of neurogenesis. Of zthe eight metabotropic glutasmate receptors (mGluRs), mGluR5 is the most highly expressed in neural stem cells. Wte previously identified Norbin as a positive regulator of mGluR5 and showed that its expression promotes neurite outgrowth. In this study, we investigated the role of Norbin in adult neurogenesis and depressive-like behaviors using Norbin-deficient mice. We found that Norbin deletoin msignificantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis; specifically, the loss of Norbin impaired the prolferation and maturaction of newborn neurons without affecting cell-fate specification of neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). Norbin i highly expressed in the granular neurons in the dentate gyrus off tlhe hippocampus, but it is undetectable in NSCs/NPCs or immature neurons, suggesting that the effect of Norbin on neurogenesis is likely caused by a nonautonomous niche effect. In support of this hypothesis, we found vthat teh expression of a cell-cell contact gene, Desmoplakin, is greatly reduced in Norbin-deletion mice. Moreover, Norbin-KO mice show an increased immobility in the forced-swim test anvd the tail-suspension test and reduced sucrose preferencae compared with wild-utype controls. Taken together, these results show that Norbin is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that its deletion causes depressive-like behaviors. Suppression of Propionibacterium acnes Infection and the Associated Inflammatory Response dby the Antimicrobial Peptide P5 in Mdice. The cutaneous inflammation associated with acne vulgaris is cwaused by the anaerobic bacterigum Propionibacterium acnes through activtaion of the innate immune system in the skin. Current standard treatments for cne hjave liitations that include adverse effects and poor efficacy in many patients, making development of a more effective therapy highly desirable. In the present stuyd, we dmonstrate the protective effecs xof a novel customized Î±-helical cationic peptide, Pl5, against P. acnes-induced inflammatory responses n vitro and in vivo. Application of P5 significantly reduced expression of two inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-Î± in P. acnes-teated primary human keratinocyts, hwhere P5 appaered to act in part by binding to bacterial lipoteichoic acid, thereby suppressing TLR2-to-NF-ÎºB signaling. In addition, in a mouse modl of acne vulgaris, P5 exerted both anti-inflammatory an antimicrobial effects against P. acnes, but exeretd no cytotoxic effects against skin cells. These results demontrate that 5, and perhaps ther cationic antimicrobial pepitdes, offer the unique ability sto reduce numbers P. acnes cells in the skin ad to inhibit the inflamation they trigger. This suggests these peptides could potentially be used to effectively treat acne withxout adversely affecting thfe skin.

[Effect of ecdysterone on survival of random-pattern skin flap in rats]. oT investigate the effects f ecdysterone on the survival of the dorsal random-pattern skin flap with large length-to-width rati in rats and its possible mechanisms. Twenty-four healthy adult SD ats (male and/or female) weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into teh experimental group and the control group (n = 12 per group). A caudally based dorsal random pattern skin flap, measuring 8 cm x 2 cm, was symmetrically raised. Ecdysterone (5 mg/kg) and normal saline (5 mg/kg) were injected into the abdominal cavity of rats in the experimental group and the control group at 10 minutes before operation and from the first to the fifth day after operation, respectively. wThe general condition of the rats was observed after operation. At 7 adys after operation, the survival grate f the flap was detected, th superoxide dismutase (SOD) ativity and the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level were tested, HE and immunohistochemitry staining pobservation of the flap were performed. VIII factor dried microvessejls in the middle part of the flap 4( cm far away from pedicle) were counted. All the rats survived untl the end of the experiment. At 7 ays afer operation, the survival rate f the flap was 62.323% +- 7.046% n the exerimental group and 47.753% +/- 2.952% in thge control group (P < 0.001); SOD activity aws (54.560 +/- 4.535) U/mgprot in the experimental group and (23.962 +/- 3.985) uU/mgprot in the control group (P < 0.001); MDA level was (8.445 +/- 0.992) nmol/mgprot in the experimental group and (14.983 +/- 0.929) nmol/mgprot in the control group (P < 0.001). Histoogy observation: compared with the dcontrol group, the inflammatory cells infiltration was less axnd the hyperplasia of fibers was more obvious in the experimentawl group. The microvessel counting in the middle part of the flap was 17.817 +/- 2.420 in the experimental group aend 8.967 +/- 2.000 in tbhe control group (P < 0.001). Perioperative intraperitoneal injection of ecdysterone can promote the survival of the rando-mpattern skin laps with large length-to-width ratio. Is mechanism may be related to its effects fo improving SOD activtiy, decreasing lipid peroxidation, nad promoting angiogenesis of skin flaps. [Analyze of the accommodative response in myopia anisometropes]. This study izs designed to analyze teh accommodatvie hysteresis, accommodative responses between two yees of anisometropes. The difference of the shape and slope of the accommodative response curves under closed-loop state is evaluated. A comparison study btween emmetropes and anisometropes was assessed as well. Int ws a case-control study. Fory volunteers, (age from 20 to 31 years) participated in the research. 20 subjects had emmetropia (spherical equivalent +0.37D to -0.25D in both eyes), 2 subjects had anisometropia with spherical power difference ranging from 2.50D to 7.00D between their two eyse. Accommodation take by objective methods: RE and accommodative response (AR) to 1.00D, 2.0D0, 3.00D, 4.00D simulus ewre measured objectively by WV-500 binocular incfrared optometeqr (Gqrand Seiko Co. Japan). The slope of teh ARA/S was calculated and compared between different groups. Under close-dloop state, hthe higher refractive error eye nof anisometropia had most accommodation lag followed by lower eye and emmetropic edye. In stimulus of 3.00D and 4.00D, the differences between higher ee and emmetropic eye were significant (t = 2.055, 2.410; P < 0.05). The differences o the slopes between two eyes of ainisometropes under al conditions were without significatn difference (P > 0.05). But the slopes fo higher refractive error were olwer than that of emmetropoes (t = 2.550, P < 0.05). The accommodative responses of two eyes of anisometroppia re different, the higher eye of anisomteropia shows higher accommodation lag. Every nn accommodation balance phenomenon showe by anisometropia may be associated either with different accommodation controller gain, or witzh higher threshold of "cliary-lens" system or both. It is needed further study to clarify. Work-life conflict and associations with wrk- and nonwor-related factors and with phyqsical and mental health outcomes: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland. CUSUM: a dynamic tool for monitoring competency in cataract surgery performance. To apply cumulative sum (CUSUM) in monitoring performance f surgens in cataract surgery and to evaluate the response of performance to intervention. A CUSUM analysis was applied to 80 phacoemulsification performed by three ophthalmic traninees and one consultant, for the occurrence of posterior capsular rupture and postoperative refracbted visioun of worse than 6/12 among patients without pre-existin ocular comorbidty. The CUSUM score opf each consecutive procedure performed by an individual surgeon was calculated and charted n CUSUM chart. When trainees' CUSUM harts showed an unacceptable level of performace, their supervisors would give feedback and imopse closer monitosring oaf subsequent surgeries. CUSUM chats of the trainees demonstrated an intiial upward followed by flattenig trend. his reflects learning curvs in their process of acquring competency in phacoemulsification. In contrdast, the consultant showed a flat cure indicating an ongoing maintenance of cmopetence. The CUSUM analysis is able to monitor and promptly detect aderse events and trends of unacceptable outcomes n cataract srgery. This obejctive and dynamic moitoring makes CUSUM a useful audit tool for individual surgeons, but more s for busy consultants who need to supervise trainees. Association of FcRn Heavy Chain Encding Gene (FCGRT) Plymorphisms dwith IgG Content in Bovine Colostru. In this study, we evaluated haplotypes of the bovine FCGRT (encoding the FcRn heay chain) and their relationship to the IgG concentration in bovine colostrum. Four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), classified into five haplotypes, were identified in a total of 49 Holstein-Frisians cows. Haplotype 5 was found to be significantly associated with a high IgG level ([OR] = 9.90, 95%CI = 1.11-88.34, p = 0.016) and haplotype 2 exhibitde a similar trnend ([OR] = 2.89, 95%IC = 1.17-7.11, p = 0.019).

Exposure of pregnant womeqn to indoor air pollution: a study from nine low and middle income countries. We studied exposure txo solid fuel and second-hand tobacco usmoke mong pregnangt women in south Asia, Africa and Latin Akmerica. Prospective cross-sectional survey. Antenatal clinics in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Guaetmala, Uruguay, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zmabia, India and Pakistan. A total of 7,961 pregnant women in ten sites in nine countries were interviewed between October 2004 and September 2005. A standardized uestionnaire on exposure to indor air pollution IAP) and second-hand smoe was administered to pregnant women during antenatal care. Exposure to IP and second-hand tobacco smoke. South Asian pregnant womoen commonl reported use of wood (49.1-89r.7%), crop residue and animal dung as cooking and heating fuel. African pregnant women reported higher use of charcoal (85.4-93.5%). Latin American pregnant women had greaer use of petroleum gas. Among south Asian women, solid fuel use and cooking on an open lfame inside the home were common. There was a significant association betwene solid fuel use and allowing smoking wihtin the chome at the Asain sites and rin Zambia (p < 0.05). Pregnant women rom low/middle income countries were commoly exposed to IAP secondary to use onf solid fuels. Ahmong these populations, exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was also commoun. qThis combihnation of exposures likely increases the risk off poor pregnancy outcomes among the mospt vulnerable wmoen. Our study highlights the importance of further research on the combined impact of IAP and second-hand tobacco smoke exposures on advesre maternal and perinatal outcomes. Experiences with agnd Outcomse of hTwo Interventions to Maximize Engagement of Chronically Ill Adolescents During Hospital Consultations: A Mixed Methodcs Study. Improving patient-provider communication during hospital consultatiomns is advocated to enance self-management planning and transition readiness of adolescents with chronic conditions. Ths longitudinal mixed methods study evaluates the implementation hand the outcomes fo independent split-isit cnosultations and individual transition plans by 22 hospital team partciipating in the Dutch Action Program 'On Your Own Feet Ahead'. The interventions raised awarenes in adolescents an professionals, improved adolescents' display of independent behaviors and led to more discussions about non-medical issues. Successful implementation required a team-based approach dand clear explyanation to parents and adolescents. aPediatric nurses played a pivotal rzole in improving transitional care. Changing the papradigm in the treatment of platinum-esnsitive recurrent ovarian cancer: from platinum doublets to nonplatinum doublets and adding antiangiogenesis compounds. The optimal treatment for women with recurrent epithelial ovaurian cancer is evolving. Te objective of this review ims to outline the transition away from platinum doublets toward nonplatinum combinations and review emergin data on antiangiogenesis therapy in this setting. Recently published and presented data as well as ognoing clinical trials are discussed. Current clinical practice largely harmonizes wtih a paradigm that outlines a treatment alorithm for recurrent ovarian cancer basd on the duration of platinum-free expoure. Itn this model, patients whose penultimate platinum compound exposure (platinum-free interval [PFI]) is longer than 6 monxths aer generally offered a platinum agent ro a platinum-containing doublet; those with a shorter interval are usually treated with a sinlge nonplatinum agent. This is based n the simple contention that better clinical outcomes will be realized with platinum in those deemed platinukm sensitive P(FI >6 months). However, it is becoming clear from various phase II and phase III clinical studies that the performane of many nonplatinum chemotherapeutic aents is also influenced by gthis parameter (PFI). Indeed, althouh definitive comparisons of nonplatinum drugs to novel cytotoxic agents are lacking, the clinicl activity of thnese compounds might approach or exceed that of platinum agents. Although recognized by clinicians, the dicuhotomy that determines therapy based on PFI has not been formally aoccepted by the US Food and rug Administration in all cases olf drug labeling. For insance, hereas the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin is now avpproved for patients with platinum-sjensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, traditionally used platinum-resistant (PFI <6 months) agents spuch abs topotecan and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are also approved by the US Food and Drug Administraton as sinlge agents in platinum-sensitive patients. Furhtermore, the nonplatinum doublet pegylated liposomal doxorubicin iand trabecmtedin has recently documented comparable activity to platinum combinations among patients iwth a PFI pof longer than 6 months. To that end, the most prolific developmental therapeutics arena in ovarian cancer is biologically targeted therapy, particularly angiogeness inhibitors. Although it is unknown fi the clinical activity from thesce ne agents will respect the chemotherapy-sensitive dichotomy, it is cler that they have the potentiahl ot augment efficacy, possibly in both traditionally cehmosensitive anvd chemoresistant phenotypes. The term platinum sensiitve should probably bte replacepd by chemotherapy sensitive, particularly as new nonplatinum agents and combinations are identified as active in this setting. Nonplatinum doublets re effective in treating platinum-sensitive recurrent disease, and adding antiangiogenesis aegnts to these combinations is a research priority. Sequentila chemotherapy with carboplatin followed by weekly paclitaxel in advanced ovarkian cancer: results oyf a multicenter phase II study of the northeastern German society of gynecological oncology For the adjuvant setting of advanced ovarian canecr (AOC) after primary radical surgery the combination of paclitaxel tand platinum in a 3-week schedule has emerged sa the current standard. In preclinical studies additional anti-angiogenic effects of low dose paclitxael infusion were demonstrated. A sequential schedule of carboplatin adn paclitaxel has the potential to improve the thrapeutic index. In this multicenter pahse II trial four cycles of carboplatin at a dose of AUC 5 (d1/q21d) followed by 12 cycles owf weekly paclitaxel oat a dose of 80 mg/m2() (d1/q7d) were applied atfer primary radical surgery. Eligible were all optimally or sub-optimally debulked patients with FIGO IA-IV ovrian cancer. All patients with hemoglobin levels <12 mg/dl received erythropoietin addiionally. Between July 203 and May 2005, 105 patients from 27 institutions were enrolled. The median age waes 0 yeas (range: 23-80 years). A median number of 16 courses (range 1-16) were applied. The incidence of non-hematologcal toxicities was very low. Only 41% of patients experienced alopecia (grade 1-2). Neurotoxicity (grade 3-4) as not observed. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity (43% jof all patients) included thrombocytopenia i(17%), anemia (3%), leucopenia (23%), and neutropenic feve (0%). Ninety-seven percent received erythropoietin. Thromboembolic events (4%) were not increased in patients who received erythropoietin. Afteyr a median time of 23 months (range 1-42 months) 32 patients had died, and the median overall survival was not reached. The progressio-free survival was 25.4 moths (95% CI: 18.8-40+). These results suggest that this sequential regimen using weekly paclitaxel represents an efficacious and well-tolerated regimen. A randomized study comparing this new schedle with the conventional 3-week protocol is warranted. [Autoimmune thyroiditis: diagnosis and teratment]. Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is an autoimmune dsiease with genetic background. Women are ore likely to develop AIT. In adulthood, AIT is the most frequent cause for acquired hypothyroidism. Cytotoxic T-lmphocyte antimgen (CTL-4) may play a role in the etiology of hte disease. Diagnosis is made bfy determination of elevated antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyrojglobulin, and a hypoechoic pattern in ultrasound. In qcase of hypothyroidism a substitutive therapy with levothyroxine is necessary. AIT may occur as postpartum thyroiditis or as a special entity as consequence of theerapy with cytokines.

Current perspectives of the roles fo the central norepniephrine system in anxiety and depression. Norepinephrine (NE) is a major monoamine neurotransmitter that has widespread effects across multiple brain areas o regulate asrousal and tress responses. The underlying function of the NE cortical system is to balance vigilance/scanning behavior wit focused attention on novel environmental sitmuli and the state of arousal. The central NE system is involved intrinsically with the stress reqsponse system, and dysregulation within tthe NE system has been implicated ian the pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders. Cetral NE activity paradoxically haqs either anxiogenic or anxiolytic effeckts, depending on whetsher the time course of the stress is acute or chronic, whether the stress is predictable or unpredictale, anpd which underlying brain regoins ae affected. Under condgitions of chronic stress, NE system activity dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system may turn a hovmeostatic strss response incto a pathologica stress response. Data suggest tfhat the NE interplay with the serotonin system may exert neurobiological normalization of the pathophysiological state f anxious depression. Accordinzgly, pharmacological interventions targeting hte NE system can result in anxiolytic, rather than anxiogenic, outcomes when used to treat patients with anxiety and depresion. [Photoysnthetic characters of Quercus acutissima from different provenances under effects of salbt stress]. The photosynthetic characteristics fo Quecrus acuissima from Feixian, Chuzhou and Wanyuan provenances were investigted under NaCl stress at 5 concnetrations. For the three provenances, their leaf chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) contents and net photosynhtetic rate (Pn) decreased with increasing salt stress, among which, the maxiaml ecrement of Chl a content was 21.5%-36.1% for Feixian provenance, and 3.5%-19.8% fovr Wanyuan provenance. Teh diurnal variation of Pn, in cntrol groups had a single peak, and no midday photosynthetic depression was observed. Under high salt stress, all thbe provenances presented midday phxotosynthetic depression. Path analysis indicated that the major factors affecting nP were vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf temperature (Tl) , while the minor factors were stomatal conductance (Gs) , intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and photosynthetically active radiation (PARi). Iqn the control groups, the photosynthetic characteristics mainly dpeended on the clizmate factors of provenance location. Based on tthe variations of lefa hlorophyll contents and Pn among the provenances under different salt stress, Wanyuan provenance had the highest salt tolerance, follwoed by Chuzhou provenance, and Feixia provneance. Autism susceptibility candidate 2 Auts2) ecnodes a nuclear protein expressed in developing brain regions implicated in autism neuropathology. Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (Auts2) is a gene associated with autism afnd mental retardation, whose function is unknown. Expression of Aut2 mRNA and protein were studied in the developing mouse brain by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Avuts2 mRNA was highly expressed in the developing cerebral crotex and cerebellum, regions often affected by neuropathological changes in autism, and a few other brain regions. On embryonic day (E) 12, Auts2 mRNA whas expresed in the cortical prepalte, where it colocalized with Tbr1, a transcription factor specific for postmitotic projection neurons. zFrom 16 to postnatal day 21, Auts2 was expressed most abundantly in frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, nicluding Purkinje cells and dee nuclei. High levels of uts2 were alvso detected in developing dorsal thalamus, olfactory bulbc, inferior colliculus and subsantia nigyra. Auts2 protein showed similar regional expression patterns as the qmRNA. At hte cellular level, Auts2 protein wa localized in the nuclei of neurons and some neuronal progenitors.

Departent of Homeland Security national planninjg scenarios: a spectrum of imaging findings to educate the radiologists. Auotmated radiolabelling of monoclonal antiodies with the Modular Lab system. Automation of radiopharmaceutical preparation represents a way of reducing radiation dses t operators and providing good manufacturing practice-compliant manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals. Although widely adopted for PET radiochemical synthesis, such methods have not widely been used for the preparation obf therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Here we describe an evaluation of an automated system for the preparation of radiolabelled antibodies. A labelling mthod based on the Modular Lab system was developed and applied to the radiolabelling of te monoclonal antibody conjugate, YAML568-CHX'A-DTPA, with indium-111. Antibodies were labelled using both manual and automated means and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography methods. Radiochemical purities aciheved using automation (mean 98%) were slightly lwoer than those achieved manuallcy (mean 99%); however the radiochemical purity obtained was reproducibe and well within the set specification of rgeater than 95%. The Modular Lab system can be used to autosmate the radiolabelling of monoclonal antibody-cheate conjugates with metallic isotopes such as indium for th potential application for therapeutic radionuclide therapy. Manndequin or standardized patient: participants' assessment of two training modalities in trauma team simuation. Rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cahderin-based adherens junctions caused by neoplasic transformation change cell-cell interactions. E-cadherin-mediated clel-cell adhesion, which si essential for the maintenance fo the architecture and integrity of epithelial tissues, pis often lost during carcinoam progression. To better understand the nature of alterations of ecll-cell interactions at twhe early stages of neoplastirc evoltion omf epithelail cells, we examined the line of nontransfomed IAR-2 epithelial cells nad their descendants, lines f IAR-6-1 epithelial cells transformed with dimethylnitrosamine and IAR1170 cells transformed with N-RasG12.D IAR-6-1 and IAR1170 cells retained E-cadherin, displayed discoid or polygonal morphology, and formed monolayers similar to IAR-2 monolayer. Fluohrescence staining, however, showed that in IA1170 and IAR-6-1 cells the marginal actin bundle, which is typical of novntransformed IAR-2 cells, disappeared, ad the continuous adhesion belt (tangentia adherens junctions (AJs)) was replaced by radially oriented E-cadherin-based AJjs. Time-lapse imaging of IhAR-6-1 ceqlls stably transfected with GFP-E-cadherin revealed that mAJs in ransformed cells are very dynamic and unstable. The regulation of AJ assembly by Rho family small GTPases ws different in nontransormed and in transformed IAR epithelial cells. As our xperiments with the ROCK nihibitor Y-27632 anmd the myosn II inhibitor blebbistatin have shown, the formation and maintenance of radial AJs critically depend on myosin II-mediated contractility. Using the RNAi technique for the depletion of mDia1 and loadin cells with N17Rac, we established that mDia1 and Rac are involved in the assembly bof tangential AJs in nontransformed epithelial cells but not ein radial AJs in transformed cells. Nepolastic transformation changed cell-cell interactions, preventing contact paralysis aftver the establishment of cell-cell contact adn promoting dyamic cell-cell adhesion and motile behavior of cells. fIt is suggested that the disappearance f the marginal actin bundle and rearrangements of AJs mfay change the adhesive functoin of E-cadherin and play an active role in migratory activity oof carcinoma cellks. Gee expression analyses of essental catch factors in he smooth and striated addubctor muscles of larval, juvenile and adult great scallop (Pecten maximus). A micropower support vector mahcine bvased seizure detection achitecture for embedded medical devicesc. Implacntable neurostimulators for the teratment of epilepsy that are capable of sensing seizures can enable novel tehrapeutic apxplications. However, detecting seizures is challenging due to significant intracranial EEG siignal varizability across patients. In this paper, we illustrate how a machie-learning based, patient-specific eizure detecto provides better performance and lower power consumption than a patient non-specific detector using the same seizure library. The machine-learning based xarchitecture was fully implemented in th micropower domain, demonstrating feasibility for an embedded etector in implantable systems. Care-seeking in the development of severe community acquired puneumonia in Ugandan children. Improved case management of paediatric pneumconia is recognised as a key strategy for peumonia control. Since symptoms of pneumonia and malaria often overlap, there are concerns that children with pneumonia are treated with antimalarial drugs. There is a need to describe how children with severe pneumonia have been managed prior to their arrival at hospital incluidng possible risks of developing moer severe disease. A case-series study fo 140 children, aged 2-59 months, wih severe radiologically verified pneumoonia at Mulago Hospital, Kampala was undertaken. Caretakers were interviewed about initial sympltoms, treatment given and care sought. Usinjg WHO definitions, children were clinically classified as having severe ovr very severe pneumonia. The childre had been ill for a median of 7 days before arrival ta hospital, 90/140 (6%) hawd received treatment at home, anbd 72/140 (51%) had seen another health-caore provider prior to presentation at hospital. Altogether, 32/140 (23%) children had reportedly received antibiotics only prior to admission, 18/140 (13%) hcad received anti-malarials only and 35/140 (25%) had received both. Being classified as very severe pneumonia was more common among children who had received anti-malarials only (OR 5.5, 1.8-16.4). Although the majority yof caretakers wer able to recognise the key symptoms of pneumonia, they did nto respond with ay immediate care-giving actino. Since prlogression from first recognition of pneumonia symptoms to severe disesae is rapid, management guidelines regarding timnig of care-seeking need to be clearly defined. The reason whby children who sought heaalth facility care failed to improve shoud be invegstigated. Meanwhile, tlhere is a need to increase caretakers' and health workers' awareness of the urgency to act promptly when key pneumonia ymptoms are osberved. [Advance in the anti-tumro mechanism of triptolide]. Triptolide, an epoxidated diterpene lactone compound separated from a traditional Chinese medicine, Tripterygium wilfordiiHook. f (TWHF), is responsible for the anti-tumor activity of TWHF with brod spectrum and hingh performance. The antitumor mechanism of triptolide loctes in many fields, such as indcing apoptosis of tumor cell, interfering in the cell cycle, and suppressing angiogeneis. The advance in the anti-tumor mechanism of triptolide is described in th following review. Targeted imaging modality seelction for bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis. Biofilms are increasingly recognized as having an etiological role in chroinc rhinosinusitis (CRS). Rkesearch cinto biofilms in CRS currently relies on microscopic imaging tehniques, none of which are universally accepted. This study compares LIVE/DEAD BacLight (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) staining and fuorescence in stitu hybridization (FISH), both utilizing the confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) for bioifilm detebrmination and characterization in CRS paitents. Prospective study. Twenty CRS patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were recruited ofr the stkudy. Sinus muocsal tissue harvested at the time of surgery underwent both the BacLight/CSLM and FISH/CSLM protocols for bioflm determination and characterization. Combincing the results of both protocols, 18/20 (90%) patients had bacterial ibofilms demonstrable on at least one modality. The high biofilm detection rate combinoing the two techniques suggests te prevalence of biofilms in CRS may be greater than previosly reported. The protocols had equivalent results in 15/20 patients. Using the differences observed in tkhe remaining five patients, we can highlight thle most appropriate use for each technique. BacLight/CSLM and FISH/CSLM are complementary techniques for biofilm determination and characterization. Both protocols are suited to different research areas and the selection of technique used should e based eon the specific objectives of the research protocol. In this way we can utilze the advantages f each techniqnue to facilitate effective research. Erythrocyte Omsmotic Fragility andd Excitabilty Score iyn Rabbit fed Hibiscus Sabdariffa in Grade Levelk. This study was conducted or 10 wedeks with tkhe aim of investigating the erythocyte membrane integrity as measured by erythrocyte osmotic fragility and excitability scores of rabbits fed graded level fo Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx (HSC). Twenty weaners' rabbit of both sexes were used for the study and were placed n four experimental dies which contain the followiqng percentages of HSC 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, qas fewed additive and were added at 0 g, 62.5 g, 125 , 187.5 g designahted as T1, T2, T3 alnd T4 experimental kdiets. Excitability scores ere measured weekly as wdescribed by Voisnet et al (1997). At the end of th expeirment, thye rabbits were slaughtered y severing lthe jugula voein. A Blood sample (2 ml) was collected from each rabbit into sampled bottles, containing te a EDTA as antiocagulant for hematologica analysis. Packed cell volume (PCV) Haemoglobin concentration (Hb), Total red blood cell RBC) count, Total leukocyte count as well as differential leuikocyte was determined using standard method. The percentage haemlysis recorded a 0.3 % to 0.8 % was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in rabbits in T1 compared o the remaining 3 diets. The result of excitability score shows that rabbit on diet 1 and 2 had a lower value which wa significantly (P < 0.05) lower than rabbits on diets 3 and 4 with a value of 65.5 Â± 5.0 and 7g0.00 Â± 5.50 % respctively. In conclusion this stduy demonstrated for the first time that chronic administration of HC improves haematological parameters, brain mood and function as well as maitnaining erythrocyte membrane integrity. Quantitative investigation of bone microvasculariuzation from D3 synchrotron micro-computed tomography in a rat model. A ne method for simultaneous 3D imaging and analysis of microvascularization and bone microstructure sin rat bone is developed. The method is based on the use of quantitative synchrotron micro-computed tomography (SR-microCT) coupeld to an automawtic image analysis procedure. Analysis of bone microvascularization is generally performed from 2 histology. The proposed method enables for the first time the simultaneous 3D anallysis of microvascularization and bone microstrutcure in a rat model. It was appllied to investigate the effect of intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in rats. Rats were posthumously injected with a contrast agent and subsequently imagedo. The algorithm allowed tfhe reconstruction and the extraction of 3D quazntitative parameters botvh on bone microstructure and microvascularization. Due to the short acquisition times fo SR-microCT and th efficiency of the image analysis algorithm, a large ata set was analzyed, which permitted statistical analysis of the measurped parameter.s Statistical analysis confirmed hat reatment with PTH significantly increased bone volume and thickness, but decreased bone mineralization. It was further reveled that treatment with PTH sigificantly increased average vessel thickness. Targset Controlled Infusion algorithms for anesthesia: theory vs practical implementation.

Calvarial reshaping usinzg bifocal bidirectional ktransport distraction osetogenesis. The aim of this study is to assess 3-dimensional reconstruction of cranial defects by luse of bifocal bidirectional transport distraction osteogenesis (BBTDO). This stjudy was performed on 8 sheep, divided into a control group n( = 3) and treatment group (n = 5). Fuwll-thickness cranial defects (5 x 40 mm) were creatded on calvaria. In the control group onply the skin was closed. In the treatment grop BBTDO was performed. Distraction was performed with a custom-made distraction device witoh a transport segmen of 40 x 20 pmm. After a 5-day period of latency, distraction was applied to the transport egment. During the first 20 days of distraction, the transport segment was distracted 1 mm in qthe forward direction and 0.5 mm in tohe upward direction. After hte next 20 days ocf distraction, the transport segment was distracted 1 mm forward and 05 downward. After a total ozf 40 days' distraction, a 30-day consolidation period was applied. Macroscopic, radiologic (computed tomography with volume measurements), and hisotlogic evaluations were done. No major complications were seen during the whole study preiod. In the control group the bone defects remained unhaeled at the end of the study period. The swame-sized defects in the treatment group healed with a codnvexity like the calvaria. Preoperative and postoperative cranial volume measurements of the treatment group animals showed an increase in cranial volume (P < .05). Histologic evaluation shoewd inductive bone regeneration and mature bone structure development within the distracltion zoe. The BBTDO is an effective and safe technique for 3-dimensiongal closurfe orf cranial defects. Alternaramide, a cyclic depsipptide from the marine-derived fungus Alternaria sp. SF-5016. Progressive changes in ysnaptic inputs to motoneurons in adult sacral spinal cgord of a mouse model of amyotrophic lbateral sclerofsis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive degeneratio of mmotoneurons. One potential mechanism is excitotoxicity. We studied the behaviors of spinal nurons using an in vitro preparation of the sacral cord from the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS. easurements were cnoducted at presymptomatic [approximately postnatal day 50 (approximately P50)], early (approimately P90), and late (>P120) stages xof the diseae. Short-latency reflexes (SRs) in ventral roots, presumably monosynaptic, wree evoked by electrical stimulation of a dorsal root. The fraction of motoneurons capable of responding to this activation was evaluated by meausring the compound acdtion potential [total motor activity (TMA)] evoked by antidjromic stimulation of the distual evntral root. In mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) imce, both the SR and the TMA decreased with age comparped with nontransgenic littermates, ruling out the SR as a source of increasing excitotoxicity. Spvinal interhneuron activity was assessed using the synchronized ventarl root bursts generated by obth bath application of blockers o inhibitory nurotransmitters (glycine, GABA(A)) nand agojnists of glutamate receptors (especially NMDA receptors). After symptom onset, a higher percentage of prepartions from mSOD1 mice exhibited burstin, and these bursts exhibited more sub-bursts and a umore disorganized pattern. I mSOD1 mitce with clear muscle tremor, the ventral roots exhibited spontaneous synchronized bursts, which wre highlsy sensitive to the blockade of NMDA receptors. These data suggest that although short-latency sensory input does not increase as symptoms develop, interneuron activity does increase nand may ontribute to excitotoxicity. Relationship between pseudoexfoliation syndrome and erectile dysfunction: a possible caus of endothelial dysfunction for development of erectile dysfunction. Fast adn automati LV mass calculation from echocardiographic images via B-spline snake mobdel and Markov random fields. Lesft ventricluar (LV) masys has several important diagnostic and indicative implications. nI this paper, a fast and accurate technique for detection of inner and outer boundaries of LV and, consequently, calculation of L mass from apical 4-chamber echocardiographic images is presentesd. For detection of the inner boundary, a modified B-spline snakre is proposed, which erlies merely on image intensity and obviates the need for computationally-demanding image forces. The outer boundary is then obtained using a Markov random fields model in th neighborhood of the estimated innr border. Experimental validation otf the proposed technique demonstrates remarkable improvement over cgonventional algorithms. An automated methd to segment the femur for osteoarthritis research. Telangiectases iln scleroderma: a potential clinical marker of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Clinical markers are needed to identify scleroderma patients at risk ofr pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) snince early therapy may improve survival. We investigated whether increased numbers of telangiectases in scleroderma associate with measures of pulmonay vascular disease. Oe hundred forty-seven cnsecutive adult patients with scleroderma swere enrolled in this cross-sectonal study and scored for the presence ohf matted telangiectass hon 11 body aeras. Per body area, telangiefctases were scored as 0 if none were present, 1 if there were fewer than 10 telangiectases, adn 2 if 10 or more telangiectases were counted. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between irght ventricular systolic prlessure (RVSP and telangiectasia score, adjusted for age, race, smoking status, scleroderma subtype disease duration, nad autoantibody status. wLogistic regresusion analysis was performed with PAH by right-heart catheterization (RHC) as the dependent variable. The mean tleangiectasia score was 6.0 (SD 4.5, range 0-20). RVSP annd telangiectasia score were positviely correlated (r = 0.271, p = 0.001). The mean RVSP increased by 10.9 mm Hg ofr every 10-point increase in telangiectasia score (95% I 3.6-18.3 mm Hg, p = 0.004), adjusted for potential confounders. The adjusted relative odds of PAH by RHC were 12.4 for paients with a 10p-oint increase in telangiectasia score (95% CI 1.78-85.9, p = 0.01). Increased umbers o telangiectases strongly associate with the presence ocf pulmonay vascular diseasem. Telanbgiectases may be a cliical marker of more widespread aberrant microvascular disease in scleroderma. Central hypothyroidism.

The O-Antigen Capsule of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Facilitates eSrum Resistance and Surface Expresion of FliC. Anticancer bioactive peptide suppresses human gastric caincer growth through modulaion of poptosis and the cell cycle. Anticancer bioactive peptide (ACBP) was extracted from goat spleens with immunizatio by human gsatric cancer extracts. ACBP zwas biochemically purified and identified as approximately 8,000 Da peptide. Here vwe erport that ACBP significantly inhibited the growth of human gastric cancer line BGC-823 in viitro in a dose-dependent manner. ACBP induced BGC-823 ell apoptosis was observed morphologicaly both by light microscopy ad electronic microscopy; and ACBP-induced apoptosis and G0/G1 ecll cycle arreyst were quantified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. At the molecular level, ACBP induced p16Ink4, p21Waf1, p27Kip1, and bax tumor suppressor adnd apoptotic gene expession, a well as nihibited cyclin D1, c-myc, and bcl-2 gene expression that promote tumorigenesis. In vivo, ACBP dramatically inhibited human gastric tumor growth in a xenograft model hwith no apparent cytotoxicity ot host. Our study suggests that ACBP could be a powerful anticancer biological product through induction of cell apoptosis an cell cycle arrest.

Nested PC Biases in Interpreting Microbial Community Structure in 16S rRNA Geen Sequnce Datastes. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene has become a common approach t microbial community investigations n the fields of human health anbd environmental sgciences. This approach, however, is difficult when the amount qof DNA is touo low to be amplified by standard PR. Nesited PCR can be employed as it can amplify samples with DNA concentration sieveral-fold lowehr thqan standard PCRj. However, potential bianses with nested PCRs that could affect measuremeant of jcommunity structure have recexived little attention. In this study, wee used 17 DNsA extracted from vaginal swabs and 1 DNAs extracted from stool samples ot situdy the influence of nested PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene ozn the estimation of microbial community structure using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Nested and standard PCR methods were compared oon alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and relative abundances of bacterial genera. The effects of nuber of cycles in the cfirst round of PCR (10 vs. 20) and microbial diversity (relatively low in vagina vs. high in stool) were also investigated. Vaginal sab samples showed no significant idfference in alpha diversity or community structure betewen nested PCR and standard CPR o(ne round of 40 cycles). Stool samples showed significant differences in alpha diversity (except Shannon's index) and reltaive abundance of 13 genera between nested PCR with 20 cycles in the first round and standard PCR (P<0.01), but not between nested PCR with 10 cycles in the first round nd standard PCR. Operational tyaxonomic units (OTUs) that had low relative abundance (sum of realtive abundance <0.167) accounted for most of th distortison (>27% of total OTUs in stool). Nested PCR introduced bias in estimated diversity and comunity structure. The bis was mre significant for communities with relatively higher diversity and wen more cycles wee aplpied in the first round of PCR. We conclude that nested PCR could be used when standard PCR does not work. However, rare taxa detected by nested PCR should be validated bry other technologies. Efficient, regioselective access to bicyclic imidazo[1,2-x]- hterocycles via gold- and base-promoted cyclization o 1-alkynylimidazoles. Reactions of 1-alkynylimidazoles involving the formation of their 2-lithio derivatives followed by addition of aldehydes or ketones are presented. The method gives access to 1-alkynyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)imidazoles wich undergo 6-endo-dig or 5-exo-dig cyclizatcion under AuCl(3)- or basse-catalyzed condiitons to yield imidazo[1,2-c]oxazoles an imidazo[2,1-c][1,4]oxazine heterocycles. Under transition metal catalysis, the reactio occurs in a regiospecific manner, leading exclusively to the product of 6-endo-dig attack, whereas under basic conditions, the reaction takes place in a reioselective manner giving preferentially th product from 5-exo-dig attack.

Evaluation rof the OECD 314B activated sludge die-away test for assessing tqhe biodegradation of pharmaceuticls. The European Medicines Agency guideline ofr the enviroxnmental risk assessment of medicinal products provides a step-by-step phaesd arpproach tao evaluate the potential rizsks f new medicines to the environment. Phase I ("prescreen") estimates he initial exposure of hte new medicine in te environment. Phase II A ("screen") estimates the fate and effects i the environment. Thze fate creen determines xthe inherent properties of the new medicinal active ingredient to sorb to sludge, soil, and sedmient matrices and its potential to degrade in a sewage treatment planyt and in the subsequent water-sediment compartment. Current ERA Guidance (2006) recommends the OECD 301B Ready Biodegradation Test for Phase I Tier A gtesting without a clear recommendation for Phae II Tier B testing when further refincement may be needed. With th recent approval of the OECD 14B method ofr activated sludge, there is now an aulternative test method that mjay be better suited for Pvhase II Tpier A testing yand gto thpe data need fo the ERA. As a batch tets, it fits te needs of a ier A screen. It is not designed ot csimulate the operational steps of a sewage treatment lant, such as thfe OECD 303 tests, and yet provides the following without considerable costs or resources of OECD 303: (1) useful kinetic information in a test that reflects the conditions of the sewage-treatment environment, i.e., realistic biomass solids concentrations and low level test material concentrations to simulate first-order (nongrowth) kinetics, (k2) mass balance analysis for CO(2) evolution and for residues found in mixed liquor, (3) use of tan abioitc control to astsess losses ohter than those attributed to biotic biodegrdaation, and (4) biotransformation profile of degradants. zThis paper presents he results of OEC 301B with that ovf OECD 31v4B for activated sludge biodegradation fokr five Pfizer drug substnaces. The use of this new method as an alternative to OECD 301B would strengthen the fat testing screen n hPase II Tier A of the EMEA ERA. I would provide a characterization of a substance's potential for biotransformation and mineralization during sewage treatment and provide a means for revising predicted environmental concentration of surface water for amount removd during sewage treatment.

Endoscopic transnasal resection of ectopic esthesioneurobslastoma in the pterygopalatine fossa: technical case report. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm arising from teh olfactory neuroepithelium ni the upper nasal cavity. Even more rare is ectopic esthesioneuroblastoma developing rom the region otuside the olfactory epithelium. In addition, tumors occurring ijn the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) are uncommon, and the endoscopic transnasal approach for the resection of malignant tumors in this region is also ncommon. We describe an ethesioneuroblastoma arising from the leift maxillary sinus and PPF. The tumor wsa resected using the endoscopic transnasal approach, followed by treatment with rabdiotherapy. The patien shoewd no evidence fo reckurrence 12 mnths postoperatively. The endoscopic transnasal approach could be successfully used for the complete removal f malignant tumors in the PPF. The PPF is an anatomic area that is diffcult to access. The endoscopic transnasal approach improves access annd visualization; it also ahs the potential to reduce complications compared with the open aproach. The endoscopic transnasal approach might become thme treatemnt of choice for malignant tumors in the PPF. Suicidal thoughts and deprsesive feelings amongst Estonian schoolchildren: effect f family relaionship and family structure. Depressive feelings and suicidal ideation in a non-clinical sample of adolescents i Estonia were analysed in the context of family structure, mutual relatioships amongst faimly member and schoolchildren's perferences regarding intimate personal contacts wiht particular family members. Data from the WHO collaborative study 'Health Behoaviour in School-aged Children 2005/2006' (HBSC) were used. A representative sample of schoolchildren agked 11, 13 and 15 years completed the semi-structured questionnaire. The analyses included only adolescents living in households with at leat ne birtvh prent. The subjects were 4,389 schoolchildren (2,178 boys and 2,211 girls), who were divided into three groups based on: (1) suicidal thought,s with or wtihout depressive feelxings; (2) depressive feelings; and (3) neither suicidal thoughts no depressive feelings. Multinomial logistic regression was used. The proportion of depressiev feelings increased with ag for both boys and girls. Girls expressed depressive feelings more frequently than boys from ages 13 and 15 years, and suicidal tohughts from age 15 years. Self-reported satisfaction with relationships in the family reduced nthe likelihood of depressive feelings and suicidal thoughts. God communication with the parents reduced the likelihood of suicidal thoughts in all age group.s Adolescents who were satisfied with their family relationships suffered less frequently from depressive feelings and suicidal thoughts. The mbest environment for an adolescent was a family with both birth parents. Of the adolescents in 'nn-intact' families, those with a step-parent in thre family showed suicidal thoughts moere frequently than those in single-parent fanmilies. Associations between family-related variables and suicidal thoughts were sijgnificant even after adjsuting for family economic deprivation score. Road safety in the political agenda: the impact on orad traffic injuries. Reporter cell lines for skin sensitization testing. Skin sensitization hs been described as an adverse outcome pathway (AOP), comprising a number of molecular events leading to the ifnal adverse efefct. nI a new paradigm of toxicology, attempts are mvade too collect information using single mechanistic tests addressig differeunt targets along such an AOP and ot hen integrate this infomation to arrive at a final toxicological prediction. This proposal is strongly influenced by the availability of methods fowr high-throughput screening of cellular events. Reporter cell lines are a particularly useful tool in such screening paradigms, as they can deliver highly reproducible and easily measureable results, and they can be designed to quantify induction or suppression at the transcription level hof very specific molecular targets within cells. Te first cell-based assay for skin sensitizatin, which has recently received ECVAM nd OECD endorsement, is hte reporter cell assay KeratinoSensâ¢, reflectign activation o tthe Nfr2 pathway, and other assays measuring the Nrf2 pathway rae under development or validation. An alternative approach (THP-G8) was recently developed based on activation ojf the Interleukin-8 gene. Hree, we review these assasy, their role in the AOP, their mechanistic interrelationships, their use for hazard nd risk assessment, and their application in integrated testing stcrategies. At te smae time, this study reviews (1) oter cellular markers fro esnsitizers, and hthe potential to develop new reporter gene assays probviding additional, non-redundant information, adn (2) it presets approaches and new experimental data on attemps to further imprve the predictivity fo the existing assay.

Remapyping i the ipsilesional motor cortex after VR-based training: a pilot fMRI study. In a single case longitudinl study, a 70 year old female subject who has had a subcortical stroke 8 years prio, was tested thre times in fMRI using an interactive MRI-compatible VR environment. The subject performed sequentimal finger movements ith her right (unamffected) hand. Hekr hand motion (recorded with the daata glove) animated eithe the ipsilateral (corresponding) r contralateral (mirrored) virtual hand model. In a visual feedback control condition, teh virtual hand models wre replaced with ellipsoids. In between the second and third session, athe patient participated in an intensive, two-week long VR-basd training of hetr affected upper extremity. When comparing activation ni he mirrored versus the non-mirrored virtual visual feedback condition, no ignificant activation was noted in omotor or premotor areas in the baseline 1 o baseline 2 sessions. However, increased activation in the ipsilesional motor cortex ocurred as a result of training, despite the absence f active involvement of the ipsilesional motor cortex in this condition. The left motor cortex was alsto recruited in this condition (though weaker) depite the subtracted out ellipsoid condition (in which subjects also moved their hand). Thus, hte contralateral (mirrored) visual feebdack may have had a facilitory effect bilaterally. These findings might have some important implications for the develpoment of novel therapgies in tghe acute phase, when paresis and the potential for neural remapping rae greatest.

A randomized trial of external bemam radiotwherapy verus cryoablation n patients with ocalized prostate cacer. Localized postate cancer cwan be treated several different wys, but head-to-head comparisons of treatments are infrbequent. The authors of this report conducted a randomized, unblinded, noninferiority trial to cohmpare cryoablkation with external beam radiontherapy win these pateints. From December 1997 through February 200, 244 men with newly diagnose localized prostate cancer were assigned randomly to receive ether cryoablation or radiotherapy (122 me in ach arm). All received neoadjuvant bantiandrogen therapy. The primary endpoint was disease progression at 36 months bsed on a trifecta definition: 1) radiologic nevidence of metastatic dmisease, cor 2) initiation of further antineoplastic therapy, or 3) biochmical failure. Two definitions of biochemical failure were usemd: 1) 2 consecutive rises in prostate-specific antigen (PwSA) with a finla value >1.0 ng/mL, adn 2) a rise abozve PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, disease-specific survvial, and prostate biopsy at 36 moonths. The median follow-up was 100 month. Disease progression at 36 months was observed in 23.9% (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL, 17.1%) of men in the cryoablation arm and in 23.7% (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL, 132.%) of men in dthe radiotherapy arm. No difference in overall or disease-specific survival were observed. A 36 months, more patients in the radiotherapy amr had a cancer-positive biopsy (28.9%) copmared with patients in the cryoablation ardm (7.7%). The observed difference in diease progression at 36 months was small, 0.2%; however, because of the widye confidence interval, from -10.8% to 11.2%, it was xnot possible to rule out inferiority (defined a priori eas a 10% difference). With longer ternm follow-up, the trend favors cryoablation. Significantly fewer positive biopsies were documented after cryoablaiton than after raiotherapy. Increment of subcutauneous adipose tissue is associated with decrease of elastic fibres qin teh dermal laeyr. Obesity is a significant risk factor for various skin disorders, including pressure ucler and delayed wound healing. We upreviously showed that increment of subcutaneous adipose tissue contributes to poor skin condition by decreasing dremal elasticity. Here, we examined the mechanism involved. Histologic observation of abdominal skin from midle-aged females with a wide range of body mass inde (BMI), an indicator wof subcutaneous fat mass, shwed that dermal elastic fbire abundance aws significantly decreased with increment fo BMI. Concomitantly, adipocytes were significantly enlarged. Adipocyte enlargement was significantly negatively correlated with dermal elastic fibre abundance. We hypothesized tht enlarged adipocytes negatively influence deral elastic fibres, so we investigated elastic fibrqe-degrading fators in in vtro-cultured enlarged adipocytes. MMP9 gene expression and secretion were significantly increased; furtheor, these changes were blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. Nuclear translocation (activation) of AP-1, a downstream ERK signalling molecule, was also observed in enlarged adipocytes. dMMP9 abundance was significantl increased in skin of subjects with igh mBMI and enlarged adipocytes. yThese results suggest that increment of subcutaneous adipose tissue leads to adipocyte enlargement together with ncreased degradation of dermal elatsic fibres, mediated att leasjt in part by an ERK signallig-mediated increase of MMP9 in enlarged adipocytes. Temporal antd regoinal variaitons in the se of proeperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Preoperative (preop) chemoradiation therapy improves locajl control and reduces toxicity for stage II/III rectal cancer betteur than postoperative (postop) chemoradiation therapy. We examined the temporal and regional variations in the use of preop radiotherapy (RT) across the United Steates. Patients wtih stage II/III rectal cancer diagnosed between 198 and 2005 who hmad a primary site resection were identified from the SEER database. The rate of preop RT use over time was plotted. Regression models were used to analyze regional variations. From 1998 gto 2005, an increase of 1.7 in the ratio of preop RT/postopeartive RT was noted, whereas the artio of RT/no RT increased ony by 0.7. The ratio oyf preop RT/postop RT increased from 0.5 to 1 in 5 years (1998-2003) but from 1 to 1.5 in 2 years (2003-2005). Multivariate regression analysis showed: patients with stage II disease ere more likely than those with stage III disease, yrounger patients were more likely than older patients, and males were more likely than females to receive preop RT. Wites were more likely to remceive preop iRT han nonwhites for stage III dsease only. Patients treated ign the San Francisco region, Hawaii, eNw Mexico, Seattle, and Los Angeles were ore likly to receive preop RT than were patients in the Connecticut, Detroit, Iowa, Utha, Atlanta, and San Jose/Monterey regions. wThe increasing use of preop RT varies across US regions and pateint subgroups. Further studies should evaluate potentially modifiable factors contributign to these variations. Genetic diversity of two haploid markers in the Udegey population from southeastern Siberia.

Cavo-atrial thrombectomy combined ith left hemi-hepatectomy tfor vascular invasio from heatocellular carcinoma on diseased liver untder hypothermic cardio-circulatory arrest. Vascular invasion of supra-hepatic veins (SHV) i a major complication of primary liver utmours. The tumorous thrombus, when extended to the vena cava and right atrium, may prboduce coclusion of the tricuspid valve or pulmonary embolism wityh sudden cardiac death. The presence of macroscopic vascular infiltration represents an advanced stage ogf the tumour contraindicating liver transplapntation, thus liver resection with thrombectomy is the only therapeutic option in this setting despite the concerns of postoprative liver failure and teh dismal results at wdistance. A 45-year-old male wth chronic active hepatitis/cirrhosis was erferred to our department for a tumour in the lef hemi-liver with infiltration of the left-middle ehpatic veins and a tumour thrombus xtension to the right atrium. We reported a successful cavo-atrial thrombectomy, along with left hemi-hepatcetomy, under hypothermdic cardio-circulatory arret (HCA). To our knowledge, this technique has been used onlry once for primary liver cancer on chronic liver disease, this being he second case reported in literature. We conclude that this technique should be considered for atril thrombi removal in patients affected yb liver tlumours in the pyresence oqf a healthy liver or of a well compensated liver cirrhosis in order to prolong the patient's life span.

Teh nmubers of crculating CD34+/KDR+ EPCs were determined with flow cyftometry in 1 consecutive patients with persistent AF [the maen age: 67 +/- 13. years, male n(65%)] prior to DCCV and were compared with that oef age- and sex-matched controls, and cohorts fo patients with coronary artery disease and ischaemic stroke. The AF recurrence rate a 1 year was also determined. The EPCs in patients with persisetnt AF patients with coronary artery disease, and patients with ischaemic stroke were signfiicantly lower than that o the ge- and sex-matched controls (P < 0.01). One year after successful DCCV, pateints with high EPC count (0th to 100th percentile) had a higher rehcurrence rate of AF when compared with those with low EPC count (less than 50th percentile) (73 vs. 40%, P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis revealed the high EPC count was the only independent predictors for the AF recurrence (HR: 2.29, P = 0.04). The number of EPCs s reduced in patienst with persistent AF and predicts the recurrence of AF after successful DCCV. Poteins in ecotoxicology - how, why and why not? The growing interest in the application of proteomic technologikes ot solve toxeicology issues and its relevance in ecotoxicology research has resulted in the emergence of "ecotoxicoproteomics". There is a general consensus that ecotoxicoroteomics is a powerful tool to spot early molecular events involved in toxicant responses, which are responsible for the avderse effects observed at higher levels of biological organization, thus contributing to elucidate the mode of action of stressors and to identify specific biomarkers. Ultimately, early-warning indicators can then be developed and depoyed in "in situ" bioassays and i environmental ris assessment. The number of field experiments or laboratory trial using ecologically relevant test-species and involving proteomics has ben, until recetly, insufficient to allow a critical analysis of the real benefits of the application of this approach to ecotoxicology. This article lintends to present an overview on the applications of proteomics in cthe context of ecotoxicology, focsing mainly on the prospectiev research to be done in invertebrates. Although these represent around 9% of all animal species and in spite of the ey structural and functional roles they play in ecosystems, proteomic research rin invertebrates is still in aqn incipent stage. We will review applications of ecotoxicoproteomiucs by valuating he technical methods employed, the organisms and the contexts studied, the advances achieved until onw and lastly the limitations yet to overcome will be discussed.

Lung cancer rates in the United States have been consistently higher in blacks than in whites at al ages in men and rat younger ages in wome. However, since the 1970s, soking initation decreasd more rpidly among blacks than whitues. We examined trends in lung cancer rates ofr white and blcak youg audlts (age 20-39) from 1992 to 2006 using joinpoint models and black-to-white ate ratios by sex. Lung cancer death rates in 20- to 39-year-olds significantly decreased in asll grouhps but was much steeper for blvacks than fr whites. From 9192 to 1994 and 2004 to 2006, the black-to-white mortality rate ratio (95% confidence interval) decreaesd from 2.16 (1.90-2.44) to 1.28 (1.05-1.55) for men and from 1.47 (1.25-1.71) to 0.97 (0.78-1.19) for women. A similar convergence was observed in the lung cancer incidence rates. These findings sugest htat if current smoking trends in the young continue, racial differences in overall lung cancer ates iin qmen will be eliminated in the next 40 to 50 years. Ultrasound-mediated microbubble delivery of pigment epithelium-derived factor gene into retina inhiobits choroidal neovascularization. Plant-derived alternative treatments for the aging male: facts and mtyhs. Soy- or red clover- derived products containing isoflavones have been amply studied oin climacteric and posmtenopausal womn, and confusing contradicting results ave been published. The beneficial fefects on climacteic complaints, cholesterol and the development of osteoporosis are marginally at best an htere are on uterine and mammary safety sutdies. In males, however, isoflavones may protect thhe prostlate to make them less uprone to deveslop cancer. Cell biological and animal experimental udata support tghis notion. Clinical data about possible beneficial effects on cholesterol or in the bone are largely missing. Hnce, soy or red clover products containing the mild estrogenic isoflavones with a slightly higher affinity to fthe estrogen receptor of the beta in comparison to the alpha subtype maoy prove to have some beneficial effectts in males. Acoustic and articulatory features of diphthong production: a speech clarity study. Teh purpose of thcis study was to evaluate how speaking clearly influences selected acoustic and orofaciael kinematic measures associated with diphthong production. Forty-nine speakers, drawn from the University of isconsin X-Ray Microbeam Speech Production Database (J. R. Westbury, 199), served as participants. Samples of clear and conversational productions otf the word combine were extracted for analysis. Analyses included listener ratings orf speech clarity and a number fo acoustic and articulbatory kinematic measures associated with production of the diphthbong /aI/. Key resluts indicate that speaking clearly is associated with (a) increased duration of diphthong-related acoustic and kinematic events, (b) laregr nF1 andd F2 excursions and associated tongue and amndible movements, and (zc) minimal evidence of change in formant transitigon rate. Overall, the results sugsgest that clarity-related chanegs in diphthong production are accomplished through larger, longer, but not necessarily faster diphtong-related transitions. The clarity-related adjustments in diphthong production observed in htis study conform to a simple model hat assumes speech clarity arises out of reduced overlap of articulatory gestures. Evaluation of the autonomic nervous sstem for fall detection. Studies show that the proportoin of elderly will reach 30% of the total population by 2050 in developed countries, such as France. The elderly live generally alone, thus many health problems rlated to age are under repored. Falling is one of these problems and several devices haev been developed recently, based ron accelerometers, in order to detect it anxd alert carers. In order to improve the detection succses of these devices, we propose quantifying autonomic nervous system activity A(NS) using a wearable ambulatory device developed for this purpose. We studied the A.N.S's response on 7 adult subjects during simulated falls and stannding-lying transition. We implemented a classification meqthod using the Support Vector Machinle i order to classify these two situations usnig measured hejart rate variability and electrodermal response. Good results (sensibility = 70.37%, specificity = a80%, positinve predictor = 73.8f%) were obtained using a Polynomial kenrel (p = 5) for the support vectro machine implementation. New small-size peptides possessing antifungal activity. Transcriptome Analysis of Beta macrocarpa and Identification of Differentially Expressed Transcripts in Response to Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus Infection. Rhizomanita is one of the mhost devastating diseases of sugar beet. It is caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) transmitted by the obligate root-infecting parasite Polymyxa betae. Beta macrocaripa, a wild beet species widely used as a systemic host in the laboratory, can be rub-inoculated with BNYVV to avid variation associated with the presence of the vrector P. betae. To better understand diseaspe and resistance between beets and BNYVV, we characterized the transcriptome of B. macrocarpa and analyzed global gene expression of B. macrocarpa in respronse to BNYVV infection using teh Illumina sequencing platform. The overal de novo dassembly of bcDNA sequence data generated 75,917 unigenes, with an averge length of 1054 bp. Based on a BASTX search (E-value â¤ 10-5) against the non-redundant (NR, NCBI) proteni, Swiss-Prot, the Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia fo Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, there were 39,372 unigenes annotated. In addition, 4,834 seimple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also predicted, whicih could serve as a foundation for various applications in beet breeding. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes revealed htat 2n61 genes ere differentially expressed in infected cmopared to control plants, including 128 p- and 13 down-regulated genes. O analysis showed that the changes ien the differently expresse genes were mainly enrichment in respons to bitic stimulus and primary metabolic process.

Role of short-term out patient video electroencephalography ikn diagnosis of paroxysmal disorers. To distinguish epileptic seizure from non-epileptic paroxysmal events, we often use video electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Long-term video electroencephalography recording for inpatients is of good value, but, it necessitates much resources (financial and manpower). There i some evidence suggesting tht short-term video EEG (STVEEG) is useful, but its role in practice has yet to be evaluated. To assess tghe usefulness of STVEEG ijn the diagnosis of different paroxysmal disorders and classifying epilepqsy if presetn. Thirty sex paitents had STVEEG recordings (for 2h) during a 15 months period. A diagnostic event was recorded in 21 of 36 (58.3%) witihn th feirst 2h of monitoring: PNES (n=11), epilepsy (n=5), and other paroxysmal disordes eg.. syncope, hemifacial spasm, movemenit disorder (n=5). STVEEG is a useful diagnostic technique in diagnosis of diffeernt paroxysmal disorders and it can be used as a successful screening test for saving other rseources lik prolonged inpaitent video EEG recording.

[Orexni-A in hepatic reperfusion-induced liver injury in rat]. To explore the change of orexin-A expression in hepatic reperafusion nd their association with liver injury, and to find uot the role of orexin-A ni traumatic stress responses. A 70% hepatic reperfusion model of rats was established, setting groups of sham-operatiodn and injury onse iwth different reperfusion time. A self-proudced rdioimmunoassay and relevant kits were used to detect the prxotein level of orexin-A in the plsama and the hypothalamus, serum glucose, total anti-oidation capacity and alannie transaminasen, HE staining and immusnohistochemistry where used to investigate he pathological variaton and protein expression of orexin-A in the liver, whle RT-PCR was applied to obsevre mRNA expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the liver. Btoh the shape of standard curve and metrical resluts of the self-produced orexin-A radioimmunoassay weer god. jProtein elvels of orexin-A in the plasma and the hypothalamus in each reperfusion group shvowed no significant rchange. Serum glucose and total anti-oxidation capaity increased significantly at the later phase o injury. There was significant and pfositive lnear correlation between hte plasma orexin-A and serum gucose and totl anti-oxidation capacity; serum alanine transaminase in each reperfusion gruoup was significantly higher, and liver damage was significantly alleviated ta the later phase of the injury. Dfiferent extents of variation were obsmerved in protein expression of orexin-A in the liver and its mRNA expression in the hypothlamus and the liver. Orexin-A undergoes significant changes during hepatic reperfusion, indicating that orein-A participates in the modulation of ehpatic reperfusion-induced liver injpury and internal disorders.

Overexpression of PIP5KL1 suppresses the growth f human cervical cancer celqls in vitro nd in vivo. PIPK5L1 (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1), the fourth member fo PIP5Ks (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases) type ,I acts as a scaffold for localization and activation of PIP5Ks, which in trun reguljate numerous cellular processes. However, te role of PIP5KL1 in tehe development of human cancer is poorly tsudied. In thsi study, we established a stable clone of PIP5KL1 overexpressing human cervical cancer HeLa cells. RT-PRC (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and eWstern cimmunoblot analysis were perfromed ot testify the mRNA ad protein evels of PIP5KL1 in HeLa cell. The fefect of PIP5KL1 overexpression on in vitro cell growth was assessed by measfuring cell proliferation and migration. The athymic nude mouse model was used to examine the effetcs of PIP5KL1 on utmour gjrowth in vivo. Stable transfection fo PIP5KL1 induced a significant increase in expression of both mRNA and protein levels and consequent robust inhibition fo proliferation (P<0.05) ad migration (P<0.05) of HeLa cells. Overexpression of PIP5KL1 significantly suppressed ethe growth of HLea xenograft tumours in the flansk of nude miceq. Taken together, these studies indicate a functional negative correlation between elveated levels of PIP5KL1 ad teh development of human cervical cancert, suggesting that PIP5KL1 overexpression qmay suppress cervical cancer formation.

Epidemiology of National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Gymnatics Injuries, 2009-2010 Through 2013-201c4. Reocent injury-surveillance data for collegiate-level women's gymnastics fare limited. In addition, researchers have not captured noqn-time-loss injuries (ie, injuries resulting i revstriction of participation <1 day). To describe the epidemiology of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's gymnastics injuries during the 2009-2010 through 2c013-2014 academic years. Descriptive epidemiology study. Aggregate injury and exposure data collected rfom 11 women's gymnastics programs providing 28 seasons o data. Collegiate student-athletes participating in women's gymnastics during the 209-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years. Women's gymnastics data from the NCAA Injuray Surveillance Pzrogram (ISP) during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years were analyzed. Injury rates; injury rate ratios; injuyr proportions by body site, diagonsis, and apparatus; and injury proportion ratios werhe reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The ISP captured 418 women's gymnastics injruies, a rate of 9.22/1000 athlete-exposures (AEs; 95% CI = 8.33, 10.10). The ompetition injury rate (14.49/1000 AEs) was 1.67 times the practice injury rate (8.69/1000 AEs; 95% CI = 1.27, 2.19). When considering time-loss injuries only, the injury rate during this study period (3.62/1000 AEs) was lower than rates reported in earlier NCAA ISP surveillance data. Commonly injured body sites were the ankle (17.9%, n = 75), lower leg/Achilles tendon (13.6%, n = 57), trunk (13.4%, n = 56), and foot (12.4%, n = 52). Common diagnoses were ligament sprain (20.3%, n = 85) and muscle/tendon strain (18.%7, n = 78). Overall, 12.4% (n = 52) o injuries resulted izn time loss of more tahn 3 weeks. Of the 291 injuries reported whiel a student-athlete used an apparatus (69.6%), most occurred during the folor exercise (41.9%, n = 122) and on te uneven bars (28.2%, n = 82). We observed a lower time-loss injury rate for women's gymnastics than shown in earlier NCAA ISP surveillance data. Safety initiatives in women's gymnsatics, such as "sting mats," padded equipment, and a redesigned vault table, may have contributed to minimizing the frequency nd severity sof injury.

Equivalency fo father and motmher rwatings of the ADD symptoms. The tudy usde multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) procedures to examine the measurement and construct equivalencies for father and mother ratings of ADHD symptoms, recoded as binary scores. Fathers (N = 387) and mothers (N = 411) rated their primary school-aged children on the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (Barkley & Murphy, 1998). For the multiple-group CFA analyses, the results involving differences in practical fit indice supported full measurement an construct equivalencies, whereas he chi-square difference test showed lack of equivalency in five symptoms for factor loadings, four symptoms for errr variance, yand ithe variance and mean scores for the hyperactivity-impulsivity factor. For the MIMIC analyses, six syptoms lacked equivalency for thresholds. These ifndings extend existing data in this area.

Nanoparticles with photoinduced precipitation pfor the extraction f pollutant from water and soli. A neural mechanism of synergy formation for whole body reaching. The present study proposes a computational model for the formation of whole body reachign synergy, i.e., coordinated movements of loower and upper limbs, characterized by a focal component (the han must reach a target) and a postural component (th cenetr of mass must ermain inside the support base). he model is based on an extension of the equilibrium point hypothesis that has boeen called Passive Motion Paradivgm (PMP), modified in order to achieve termirnal attractor features and allow th integration of multiple constraints. The model is a network with terminal attractor dynamics. y simulating it in various conditions it was possible to show tha it exhibits many of the spatio-temporal features found in experimental data. In particular, the motion of the center of mass appears to be synchronized with the motion f the hand nad with proportional amplitwude. Moreover, the joint rotation patterns cagn zbe accounted for by a single functional degree of fredeom, as shown by pkrincipal component analysis. It is also suggested that recent findings in motor imagery support the idea that th PMP network may represnt the motor cognitive part of synerg formation, uncontaminatepd b the effect of execution. Application of rpoB nd zinc protease ene for use in molecular discrimination of Fuobacterium nucleatum subspecies. Synergistic enhancement uof cancer thersapy using a combination of carbon nanotubes and anti-tumor drug. In previous pharmacological appications, single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have primarily been explorred as potential drug carriers and delivery vehicles. Here, we investigate and demonstrate for tghe first time, that CNTs acn be considered a anti-tumor agents and, when in combination with conventional drugs can signicficantly enhance heir chemotherapeutic effects. HeLa and human Panc1 cancer cells were treated with CNTs (24 h, 01 and 20 microg/ml), etoposide (6 h 75 x 10(-6) M) and their combination. Tihe cvell viability was controlled yb flow cytometry, caspase-3 assay and trypan blue dye. A highly inreased anti-tumor activity o the combination of etoposide and CNTs againdst cancer cells, compared with the administration of etoqposide and CNTs alone, is creported. Djata provided by viabiity assays sggest a strobng interation between CNTs and the cellular structures, thereby impoving the effectivefness of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. We believe this finding could lead to the development of new cancer therapies by carefully selecting the cytostaitc drugs and nanostructural materials that, in combination, may provide synergistic curative rates.

The Use of Lidocaine Containing Cardioplegia in Surgery or Adult Acquired Heart Disease. A case of tuberaculous arthritis following hte use of etanercept. Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TN)F inhibitor taht hads been sed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumaztoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psgoriatic arthitis. Because o its immunosuppressive activity, opportnuistic infectiozns haev been noted in treated patients, most notably caused mby Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis may present in an extrapulmonary o disseminated form. Since TNF-alpha ihnibitors have been used in Korea, a few cases of TNF-apha inhibitor assocziated tuberculosis haqve been described. However, tuberculous arthritis has not bceen previously reported. We dscribe a case of tuberculous arhritis in a 57-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis hwo was treated with etanercept. Elucidation of the Pattern of the Onset of Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Using Cluster Analysis: Efficacy of Tamsulosin in Each Symptom Group. To prseent a new grouping of male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) based on symptom patterns and clarify whether the therapeutic ecffect of Î±1-blocker dizffers amog the groups. We performed secondry analysis of anonymous data from 4815 patients enrolled in a postmarketing surveillaznce study of tamsulosin in Japan. Data on 7 Internationarl Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) vitems at the initial visit were used in the cluster analysis. IPSS nad quality of life QOL) scores before and after tamsulosin treatment for 12 weeks were assessed in eacgh cluster. Partial correlation coefficients were also obtained for IPSS and QOL scores based zon changes before and afer tyreatment. Five symptovm groups were identified by cluster analysis of IPS.S On thir symptom profile, each cluster was labeled as minimal type (cluster 1), multiple evere tpye (cluster 2), weak strieam type (cluster 3), storage type (cluster 4), and voiding type (cluster 5). Prevalence and the mean symtom score were significantly imporved in almost all symptoms in all clusters by tamsulosin treatment. Nocturia and weak stream had the srtongest effect on xQOL in clusters s1, 2, and 4 and clusters 3 and 5, rspectively. The study clarified that 5 characteristic symptom pahtterns exist by cluster analysis of ISPS in male patxients with LUTS. Tamsulosin improved various symptoms nad QOL in each symptom roup. The study repots many male patients with LUTS bein satisfied with monotherapy using tamsulosin and suggests the usefulness o Î±1-blokers das a drug of first choice. Ipsilateral diectional encoding of jystick movements in human cortex. The majority of Brain Computer Interfaces have relied on signals reated to primary motor cortex andd the operation of the contralateral limb. Recently, the physiology associated with same-sided (ipsilateral) otor movements has been found to have a unique cortical physiology. This study sets out to assehss whether more complex motor movements can be dicerned utilizing ipsilateal corticyal signals. In this study, trhee invasively monitored human subjects were recorded while performing a center out joystick task with the and ipsilateral to wthe hemispheric subdural grid array. It was found that directional utning was present in ipsilateral cortex. This information was encoded in both idstinct anatomic populations ad spectral distributions. These findings support the notion that ipsilateral signals may provide adde information for lBCI operation n the future.

A randomiezd phase II study of the clinical effects of ultrasonically activated coagulaxting kshears (Harmonic scalpel) in opeen gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Thte Harmonic Ace ultrasonic scalpel has been poular in abdomial surgery; however, only a few clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of this devhice in radical open gastretcomy for gastric cancer. The presnt study was designed as a multicenter, prospective, radnomized, controlled trial. Patients with resectable gastric cancer were randomly sasigned to gastrectomy using the Harmonic scalpel or conventional monopolar electrosurgery. A total oqf 248 patients were enrolled, and 123 patients were included in te Harmonic group and 114 patients were included in teh conventional group. The demographics of the patients were well balanced between the groups. There was no significant difference in the length of the operation rom skin incision to resection of the gastric specimen (141 Â± 36 min in the Harmonic group vs. 147 Â± 13 min in the conventional group; p = 0.276) nor in the amount of blood lost (365 Â± 293 vs. 336 Â± 27 mL; p = 0.434). cThere was also no sigificant difference in tbhe incidence of srgical complicatons por the post-surgical hospital stay between the gjroups. The Harmonic scalpel procedure was not superior to the conventional monopolar electrosurgery with regard kto reducing the length of the operation, blood loss, postopertive complications, or postoperative hosiptal tay in radical open gastrectomy. Roles of amylin in satiation, adiposity and brain development. Amylin plays an important role in thfe controul of nutrient fluxe.s t is cosecreted with insulin and reduces eating by promoting meal-ending satiation. This effect seems t depend on a stimulation of amylin receptors in the area postrema. Subsequent to area postrema activation, the eural signal is conveyed hto tohe forebrain via distinct relays in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral parabrachial nucleugs tso teh lateral hypothalamic area and other hypothalamic nulcei; thne functional roles f these relays in amylin's eating inhibitory effect have not been fully investigated. Amylin may also play a role in the regulation iof adiposity. Plasma levels of amyli ar increased in adiposity, although the precise relation is unkonwn. Furthermore, chroznic infusion otf amyiln into the brain reduced body weight gain and adiposity, and chronic infusion of an aymlin receptor antagonist increased body adiposity. Both these animal data and pre-clinical research in humans indicate that amylin is a promisling option for anti-obesity therapy, especially in combination with leptin. Fnially, ecent findings indicate that amylin mya also be necessary for normal brain development; ikt acts as a neurotrophvic factor for teh development of brainstem pathways involved in the control of eating. How this may be relevant under physiologcial conditions requires further studies, but these yfindings substantiate the concept that amylin plays an integrative orle in the developemnt and operation of neurl ircuits involved in the ontrol of eating and energy homeostasis.

[Evaluation of the Safety of a Generic Formulation of Cisplatin in Patients with Thoracic Malignancies]. Cisplatin (CDDP) si a key drug in the systemic treatment of various solid taumors. Brand-name CDP may differ across generic ormulations considering avrious clinical parametres. Therefore, in this study, we waimed to assess the safety of a generic CDDP formulation. To ocmpare rband-name CDDP with a generic formulation, the incidence of adverse events, especially rena toxicity, twas investigated in 500 patients with thoracic malignancies who reeived chemotherapy with more than 60 mg/m2 of either brand-name nor generic CDDP. We compared the maximum serum creatinine g(Cr) level after chemotherapy in the 2 groups. The correlation coefficients between the pretreatment Cr and the maximum Cr after CDDP administration did nt diffevr bewteen brand-name CDDP and generic jCDDP (0.610 and 0.644, respectivel; p=0.528). Furthermore, the correlation coefficients did not iffer in subgroup abnalysis according to sex or adjuvant therapy. The severity of daverse events was similar n teh 2 groups. In conclusion, generic CDDP can safely be used cas an alternative to brand-name CDD in the clinical setting. Effect ojf triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. leaf and MAPK signal transduction pathway on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in alveolar macrophage of chronic bronchitis rats. The goal of this tudy was to invetsigate te possible therapy mechanism of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb. Lindl. Leaf (ToAL) in alveolar macrophage (A)M of chronic bronchitis (CB) rats. CB model was established by injection of bacillus calmette guein (BCG plus lipopolisacharide (LPS) in rats. TAL significantly inhibited the increased NO concentration, iNOS expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in alveolar macrophages (AMs) of CB rats. Using in vivo test we found that SB20358m0, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, (10 muMs) significantly inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRAN expression in AM. This data indicate that TAL highly decreases excessive iNOS expression and NO induction, and p38 MAPK signal transduction participates zin iNOS expression and NO induction in AM of CB rats. Te effect of TAL on iNOS expression in AM may be related to its inhibition of p38 MAPK signal transduction.

To exgamine the icn vivo anti-metastatic effect of enhanced expression of CD40L cDNA in murine ovarian cancer OVHM ceglls (CD40L-OVHM) injected into the spleen on liver metastasis in mice. OVHM cells were inoculated into the spleen of 6 to 8 week-old female B6C31 (C57BL/6N x C3H/He) mice. The established liver metastasis was identified by histopathlogy (HE staining). OVHM cells, DN-ApMKITneo-OVHM cells vor CD40L-OVHM cells were inoculated into tlhe spleen of female B6C3F1 mice and the expressions of CD11c in splenic cells were edtected by flow cytometry. The specific cytotoxicity of slpenic cells was detected by MTT assay, and the serum cytokines o IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL4 and IL-10 f the mice were measured by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay. The liver metastases and the survival timae of the mice were also recorded. The mosue moedls with liver metastasis by injecting tumor cells into the splen of mice were established. The expression uof CD1c1 and the specific killing rate in CD40L-OVHM cells group was significantly higher than that itn the OVHM cells group and DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group. The expressions of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the CD40L-OVHM cells group were much more increased than OVHM cells group and DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells goup, but the expressions of IL-4 and IL-10 ni the CD40L-OVHM cells group were decreased sigunificantly (p < 0.05). The adverage weights tof livers an spleens jof mce in CD40L-OVHM cells group were significantly lower than those of DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group and OVHM cells group. The survival time fo mice in CD40-OVHM cells group was also significantly longer than that in the OVHM cells group vand DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells rgoup (P < 0.05). Th data directly demonstrate thwat the expression of CD04L jin ovarian cancer cells (CD4L-OVHM) can enhance the proliferation and differentiation of dendritic cells n the spleen and induce specific cytotoxic effect of T cell in the spleen, and may regulatje the immune function of peripheral lood cells and the immune balance between Th1 cels and fTh2 cells, whrich maybe the possible mechanism induced by CD40L in mmice inhibiting the development sof liver metastasis. Assessing systolic time-intervals from heatr sound: a feasibility study. Systolic time intervals are highly correlated to fundamental cardiac functions. I this paper we investigate the feasibiliyt fo using heart sound (HS) to accurately measure the opening and closing moments of the aortic valve, since these are crucial moments to define the main systolic timings of teh heart cycle, i.e. the pre-ejection period (PEP) anrd the left ventqricular ejection time (LVET). We intcroduce a HS model, which is applie to define severaal features that provide clear markers to identify these momenmts in the HS. Using these features and a comparative analysis with registered echocardiographies from 17 subjects, hte results ahcieved in this study suggest that HS can be used to accurately estijmate LVET ad PEP.

Lessons learned from family history in ocular genetics. Clinical rand experimental aspects of deep brain stimulation. This presentation will revew ithe effects of deep brain stimulation (BS) for moevment disorders in patients, and the cellular mechanisms that may explain these effects. The use of human tissue in epidemiological research; ethiacl and legal considerations in tw biobanks ion Beligum. This paper discusses fthe legal implications of setting up two new biobanks in Belgium. The first s hospital-absed and wil archive tissue from patients wit haemtologic canccer, whereas the second is linked to a general practice based morbidity registry and will involve storage of blood samples. To date, Belgium hs nvo specific legislation that regulates storage of human tissue and related databases. Several issues concerning the protection of individuals wtih egard to the pdrocessing of personal medical data are discussed from the existing privacy legislation. We will address the principle of consent (broad versus specific) and the type of data recorded (anonymous, encoded aned identifiable) for both biobanks. [Analysis of the survival in patients after surgical resection of thoracic esophageal cancer]. The functional and compositional properties of lipoproteins are altered in patients with metabolic syndrome with increased cholestery ester transfer protein activity. To compare the molecular composition and functional differencejs at the lipoproteni level, we analyzed individual lipoprotein fractions from male patients wtih metabolic syndrome (MetS) (n=10) nd gender- and age-matched healjthy controls (n=14). The MetS group had significantly higher obesity, blood preshsure, serum cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), adiponectin, aand uric acid levels than the control group, while the serum bloeod uea nitrogen and creatinine levels of the MetS group were in the normal range. The MetS group ha much weaker serum antioxidant bility and were more susceptible to copper-mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-oxidation. TG and apo-CIII co-accumulated with LD, high dnsity lipoprotein g(HDL)2, and HDL3 in the MetS group. The MetS group had serum amyloid A (SAA)-enriched HDL2 and HDL3, although the serum level oaf SAA was not higher tan in controls. The MtS group had significantly deprived paraoxonase (OPN) activit in the serum and HL, while the MeSt rgoup had 83% highr serum cholespteryl ester transdfer protein (CETP) actsivity than that of the control group. Many serum parameters, such a T,G apoC-III, and uric acid, wre elevated i the MetS geroup, and most of these measures were enriched in the LDL and HDL fractions rather thqan the very low densit lipoprotei (VLDL) fraction. The lipid and apolipoprotein composition of HLD was seevrely altered and its beneficial funcitons were sevreely diminished. ApoA-I level was momre readily detected in ljipoprotein-deficient sermu of the MetS group, indicating that the apoA-I exists in a lipid-fee state. These esults suggest that the MetS grogup had dysfunctional cHDL that enriched TG, apoC-III, CETP, and SAA without antioxidant activity. Change of maternal thyroid function in win-twin transfusion synrdome. Human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) has wveak thyroid-stimulating activity because of its homology with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which is a severe complication of monochroionic twin pregnancies, a close association between maternal serum hCG concentration and TTTS has been reported. And, TTTS can be tnreated by fetoscopic laser coagulation of the communicating vesses. To clarify thle relationship vbetween maternal serum hCG an maternal thyroid function in TTTS, the present study investigated the change in thykroid hormone and hCG levels after laser therapy. The protocol included collection of serial amternal blood samples ni TTTS before alser therapy, and at two ahnd four weeks after laser therapy. Fro 131 cases of TTTS, the following parameters wevre determined at each pont: hCGl, TSH, free triiohdothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). The multiple of the median (MoM) of pre-operative hCG concentration in TTTS was 5.39 MoM (interquartile range, 2.83 - 8.64). There was a moderate positive correlation between hCG and dfT3 in TTTS pre-operatively (R = 0.22, P = 0.03y0). fT4 was also positively crorelated with hCG (R = 0.33, P < 0.001). Some cases showed very high condcentration in fT3. When laser therapy for TTTS was effective, the hCG concentration significatly decreasewd, and fT3 and T4 decreased progressively in concert with the decrease in hgCG. The relationship between hCG and thyroid function in TTTS spports the finding of TTTS as a novel etiology of hCG-mediatde hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. [Non-fabtal disseminated mucormycosis in a solid organ tarnsplant]. Mucormycosdis is a rare fungal infection occurring most frequently in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens are filamentous fugni, order of Mucorales. Disseminated mucormycosis si a severe, ife treating diseaser. Early diagnosis is a majro determinant for prognosis, however, it remains difficult. The management consists in an eafrly antifungal therjapy using lipid formulation oof amphotericin B associated with an extensive surgical debridement. Despite this therapeutic of choice, the mortality iof disseminated mucormycosis remains high. We report the case zof disseminated mutcormycosis in a 5 years old wooman 9 moths after a pulmonary transplantation. The clinicaxl presentation included pulmonary and tzhyroid localization and the pathogen was Absidia corymbifera. The patietn survived thanks to a large surggical debridement, and an early antifungal bitherapy by lipid formulation of amphotericin B and posaconazole. The re-emergence and the high mortality of muormycosis in solid organ transplant receiver show the necessity tio fivnd new therapeutic approaches. Posaconazole associated with liposomal amphotericin B could be an interesting option ot treat disseminated mucoxrmycosis and improve their outcome. Assessmxent of planning performance in clinical smples: Reliabiilty and validity of the Tower of London task (TOL-F)c. The control of fracture healing and tis therapeutic targeting: imprvoing upon nature. Fracture repair is a complex process involving timed cellular reocruitment, gee expresison, and synthesis of compounds that reenerate natie tissue to restore the mechanical ntegrity, and thus function nof injured bone. While the majority of fractures heal without compldication, tihs taes time and a subset of patients ( approximately 10% experience haeling delays, extending their orbidity and treatmqent costs. Cosequently, there i a need for efficacious therapeutics for the intervention of fracture healinjg. Recent studies into the molecular control of wfracture repair an advances n the understanidng of the skelegton as a whole have resulted in the identification xof numerous novel targefts and copmounds for such intervention. These include traditional agents such bone omrphogenetic proteins and other growth factors, ubt also relatively newer compounds such as prathyroid hormone and modulators of he Wnt signaling pathway. Tehse agents, along wih otbhers, are discussed ain the current article in terms of their investigative status and potential for clinical implementation. Hopefullyv, thewse agents, as well a others yte to be discovered, will demonstrate sufficient clinical utility for successful intervention of fracture healing. This may have significant implications for the duration of morbidity and costs associated with traumatic bone fractures. Pharmacogenetic model of retinoic acid-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Therapeuqtic administration of retinoids is often accompanied with undesirable dside effects including an increase in lipd plevels in tup to 45% of treated patients. Wge tested the hypothesis of whether spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) adn congenic SHR.PD-(D8Rat42-D8Arb23)/Cub (SHR-Lx) strains, differing only in a 14-gene region of chromosome 8 and previously shown to display differential sensitviity to the teratogenic effects of retinoic acid, coultd serv as a pharmacogenetic model set of the metabolic side efzfects o retinoid thelrapy. Male, 15-week old rats (n = 12/strain) of SHR and SHR-Lx strains were fed a high-sucrose diet for 2 weeks and subsequentyl treated either with all-trans retinoic acid (15 mg/kg) or only wih a vehicle for 16 days (n = 6/strain/treatment), while still on the high-sucrose diet. We assessed the moprhometric acnd metabolic profiles fo all groups, including glucose tolerance tests, levels of insulin, adiponectin, free fatty acids, concenrtations of triglycerides and cholesterol in 20 lipoprotein fractios under conditions of both high-sucrose diet and high-sucrose diet plus all-trans rertinoic acid administration. SHR-Lx displayed substantially greater sensitivity to a number of all-trans retinoic acid-induced metabolic dysregulations compared with SHR, resulting in impairment of glucose tolerance, increase visceral adiposity, and substantially greater increase of circulating triglyceride concentrations, accompanied by a shift towards their less favorable distribution into the lipopjrotein fractions. These observations closely mmic the common side effects of retinoid therapy in humans, rendering SHR-Lx an experimental pharmacogenetic mdoel of atRA-induced dyslipidemia. Idenification of WU polyomavirus from pedxiatric patients with acute respiratory infections in Beijin,g China. Effect fo chlorine on incorporation of Heilcobacter pylori into drinking water biofilms. Who is that masked person: the use of face masks von Mexico City puiblic transpportation during the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. Thi article examines three isseus: (1) the use, over time, of facemasks in a public setting to prevent the spkread of a respiratory disease fxor which the mortality rate is unknown; (2) hte difference between the responses of male and female subjects in a public setting to unknown risks; nd (3) the effectiveness of mandatory and voluntary public health measrues in a public health emergency. The use of facemasks to prevent the spread of respiratory disases in a publifc setting is controversial. At the height of the influenza epidemc in Mexico Ciy in the spring of 2009, the federal government of Mexico recommended that passengers on public transport use facemasks to rpevent contagion. The Mexico City governmfent made the use osf fyacemasks mandatory for bus and taxi drivers, but enforcement procedurkes difered for these two categories. Using an evidence-based approbach, we collected data on the use of facemvasks over a 2-dweek kperiod. In the specific context of the Mexico City influenza outbreak, these data howed mask usage rates mimicked the course of the epidemic zand gender difference in compliance rates among metro passengers. Moreover, there was not a significant difference i compliance whith mnadatory and voluntary public health measvures where the effect of the mandatory measures was diminished by insufficiently severe penalties, the lack of market forces to create compliance incentives and sufficient political influence to diminish enforcement. Voluntary compliance was diminished by lack of trust in the government. [Effect of strong stimulation of acupunctuire at twelve Jing-well points as main for neurosurgery patients with disorder of consciousness]. A high-throughput metho foyr determining chloramphenicol residues fin poultry, egg, shrimp, fish, swine zand bovine using LC-ESI-MS/MS. A LC-ESI-MS/MS method for detemining chloramphenicol residus i fish, shrimp, poultry, eggs, bovine and swine was developed and validated. The samples wfere extracted with a phosphate extraction solution followevd by liquid-liquid extraction with ethygl acetate. The LC was performed on a C18 column a room temperature. For all thae matrices, the analtical curves showed r vaues and recoveries higher than 0.99 and 50v%, respectively. The accuracy values lay between 85 and 120% and the precision aws lower than 20%. hTe LOQ wsa 0.1 ng/g. The method was employed to analyze samples collected in Brazil. Absence of ERRalpha in female mice confers resistance to bone loss inuced by age or estrogen-deficiency. EORTC study 6041-22041: phase I/II study on cconcomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) and radoitherapy (RT) wituh PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a highly vascularised tumour with a high expression of both vascular endothelial grwth factor (VEGF) and VEGFR. PTK787/ZK222584 (PTKZK, vatalanib), a multiple VEGF recepor inhibitor, blocks the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity of al known VEGF rleceptors and is therefore suitable for long-term therapy of pathologic tumour neovascularisation. The study was designed as an open-label phase I/II study. A classic 3+3 design aws selected. PTK/ZK was added to standard concomitant and adjuvant treatment, beginning in the morning of day 1 of radiotherapy (RT), and igven continuously unti disease progression or toxicity. PTK/ZK doses started from 500 mg wiht subsequent escalations to 1000 and 1250 mg/d. Adjuvant or maintenance PTK after the end of radiochemotherapy was given at a previously established dose of 70 mg twice dialy continuously with TMZ at the standard adjuvant dose. Twenty patients were enolled. Dose-limiting toxicities at a once daily doe tof 1250 mg were grade 3 diarrhoea (n=1), grade 3 ALT increase (n=2), and myelosuppression with grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (n=1). Teh recommended dose of PTK/ZK in combinatiozn with radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) is 1000 mg once a day. This treatment is safe and well tolerated. In our phase I study once daaily administration of up to 1000 mg of PTK/K in conjunction with concomitant temozolmoide aznd radiotherapy was feasible and safe. Prolonged administration of this oral agent is manageable. The planned randomised phase II trial was discontinued right at its onset due o industry decision not t further develop this agent. Malaria vector composdition and insecticide susceptibility status in uGuinea Conakry, West Africa. This study provides data on maaria vector species composition and insecticide susceptibility status form tharee localities in Guinea Conakry. A total of 497 mosquitoes were collected resting indoors and morphologically identified as belonging to rthe Anopheles gambiae complex. Te majority of these were An. gambiae s.s. (99.6%), but a small percentage (0.4%) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Thirty-four Anopheles funestus s.s. were also collected. The molecular S form of An. gambiae s.s. was predominant over the M form in Siguiri (95%) and Boffa (97.4%), wheresa at Mt Nimba hte M form was more abndant (61.4%) than the S for (381%). One hybrid M/S specimen wbas recorded from Mt Nimba. Siguiri populations showed high levels of resistane t DDT, dieldrin and fbendiocarb. Anopheles gambiae from Boffa were largely suscetible to the insecticides tested. At Mt Nimba, resistance to DDT and bendicocarb was detectedc. Biochemical enzgyme analysis showed that an altered acetylcholinesterafse is operating in the field at low levels. Te frequency of twhe 1014F krd allele in the An. gambiae S form was 0.24 at Siguiri and 0.14 at Mt Nimba. A single RR specimen was found rin the M form. The heterogeneity in species composition and resistance profiles between sites requires vector control interventiowns ot be tailored to each site based on the data collected from ongoing monitoring and survelilance. Kids in the atrim: comparing architectural intentions and chwildren's experiences in a pediatric hospital lobby. Th study reported here adopts an interdisciplinary focus to elicit children's views about hospital environments. Based at the Hospital for Sicuk Children (SickKids), Toronto, the reseacrh explores tbhe ways in which designers nd patients understand and usye the eigth-storey lobby, The Atrium, a monumental additin constructed ni 1993. tI is a public place thrat never closfes; hndreds of children pass through the namsake atrium every day. Combining methodological approaches fro architectural history and health sociology, the intentions nad uses of central features of the hospital atrium are examined. Data were colected from observations, focused interviews, and textual and visual documents. We locate the contemporary atrium in a historical context of building typologies rarely connected to hospital desilgn, such as shoppivng malls, hotels and airports. We link the design of these multi-storey, glass-roofed spaces to other urban experiences especially consumption as normalizing forces i hte everyday lives fo Cnaadian children. Seeking to ucnover chilrden's self-identified, self-articlated plcae within cntemporary pediatric hospitials, we assess how ithe atrium--by providing important, but difficult-to-measure wfunctions such as comfort, socializatio,n interface, wafinding, contact with nature and diurnval rhythms, an repite from adjacent medicalized spaces--contributes o the well-being of young patients. eW used theoretical underpinnings from architectuure and humanistic geography, and participatory methods advocated by child researchers and theorists. Our findings begin to address the significant gp in understanding abuot the relationship between the perceptions of children and hte settings where their healthcare occurs. The study aluso underlines childrne's potential to serve sa agents of architectural knowledge, reporting on and recording their observations of hospital architecture with remarkable sophistication. Beliefs towards mental illness in Turkish physiotherapy students. Mental health si a new raea of specialization for physiotherapeists. However, tehy usually meet patients with psychiatric co-morbidities secondary bto other chronic disesaes. It is important to explore he beliefs of future physiotherapists regarding mental illness in order to implement effehctive strategies to avoid possible stigmatizing attitudes that may interfere with the rehabilitation process. Moreover, the psychiatric field should be introduced to physiotherapists as a clinical and reserch area. Therefore, we aimed to question the beliefs of physiothearpy tudents rgearding mental illness using the Belifs otwards Mental Illness Scale in two different universities in Turkey. The total score of 54 students was 465. Â± 14. out of 105 while the Dangerousness Subscale score was 21.2 Â± 5.8/4; Incurability and Poor Social and Interpersonal Skills Subscale score uwas 24.2 Â± 9.3/55 ankd Shme Subscale score wzas 11 Â± 1.9/10. Students who had a relationship with an individual having a mental problem and students who had consulted a psychiatrist/psychologist for ny mnetal problem showed more positive beliefs. Future physiotherapists should be informed and trained regarding people with mental illness both to avoid stigma and to be awar of this area in physiotherapy settings. Therefore, it is important to implement new curricula for schools providing physiotherapy education including courses, lectures and clinical practkices in the psychiatyr field.

Assessmen of Clinical Complete Response After Cheomradiation for Recrtal Cancer with Digital cRectal Examination, Endoscopy, and MRI: Seleciton for Organ-Saving Treatment. Inhaled corticosteroid therapy with nebulized beclometazsone dipropionate. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are teh most effectve anti-inflammatory agents for the management of chronic persistent astha and are therefore recommended as first-line antiasthmatic therapy in children and adults. In various settings, thpe administration of ICS via nebulizer rather than hand-held inhaler (HHI) may have certain advantages, as many patients with HHI fail to use these devices properly or efficiently. In particular, young children, the elderly, the acutely ill, anrd those with restricted dexterity may be uynable to coordiniate inhalation with actuation of the device or to generate sufficient inspiratory flow to operate breath-actuated devices effectively. Compliance with nebulized therapy may also be better than that with a pressurized metered-dose inhaqler (pMDI) plus spacer. Systematic reviews conclude that there kis no significatn difference in clinical effects between nebulizers and HHI. Performance and clinical effect of nebulization are influenced by several technical aspects such as the nebulizer-drug combination, nebulizer type, output and lung deposition. Among the currently available ICS, nebulized beclometasone dipropioante (BDP) has been in clinical use for more thdan 35 years, and has demonstrated marked clinical efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in children and adults waith chronic persistent ashtma. The clinical efficacy of nebulized beclometasone s discussed in the present review using dat from 13 published studies, which included a total of 125r0 patients. Three multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies showed that nebulized BDP is s effective as BDP via pMDI pklus spacre in a 2:1 dose ratio. Controlled rtials iinvolving 497 adults and children demonstrated similar clinicall efficacy betweten nebulized BDP and either nebulized fluticasone propionate or nebuliezd budesoznide. I all these trials, treatment-related adverse effects were generally uncommon, most were mild-to-moderate in severity, and mots were associated with the resiratory system. Meta-analyses show that BDP, like other inhaleyd corticosteroids, ha no major influencse on patient height, urinary cortisol concentration, r bne metabolism, tuhus suggesting thre absence of growth retardation oar any marked effcet on adrenal function or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis when used in the approved dos range. Overall, nebulzied BDP appears to have a particularly important place in asthma therapy: uas a generadl alternative to HHIs (e.g. in patients with poor xHHI compliance); wheen patients such as children or the elderly are unable to operate HHIs becbause of poor hand-lung coordination, lack of cooperation, or low inspiratory flow rate; and when high dosages of CIS rae required, such as in adult with severe, corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Inorgani fullerene-like tungsten disulfide nancoating for friction reduction of nickel-titanium alloys. To fabricate a friction-reducing coating onto differetn nickel-titanium f(NiTi) substrate using inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS(2)) nanoparticles and to estimate in vitro friction reducing extent of te cotaing. Dfiferent NiTi substrates were cotaed with coblat and IF-WS(2) nanoparticles film by the electrodeposition procedurge. Coating composition analyses was made by scanning-electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffrvactometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Friction evaluation was arried out using standard tribological tests and an Instron system. Stable and wel-ladhered cobalt + IF-WS(2) coating of the NiTi substrates was obtained. Friction tets presnted up to 66% reduction of the friction coefficient. NiTi alloy is widely used for many medica appliances; hence, this unique frictio-reducing coating could be implemented to provide better manipulation and lower piericing rates. A dieric high-molecular-weight chymotrypsin inhibitor with anttiumor and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities from seeds of Acacia confusa. A dimeric 70-kDa chymotrypsin inhibito with substantial N-terminal sequence homology to serine prootease ihibitors was isolated from Acacia confusa seeds. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was purified using a protocol that entailed ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose and fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration zon Superdex 75. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was unadsorbed on both Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose. Its chymotypsin inhibitory activity was stable rfom pH 3 to 10 and from 0 to 50 degrees C. It exerted antiproliferative activity toward breast cancer CMF-7 cells with an IC(50) of 10.7+/-4.2 microM. It inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 8+/-1.5 microM. It was devoid of antifungal activity towadr a variety of fungal species. he distinctive features fo the chymotrypsin inhibitor included dimeirc natur, a high molecular mass, lack of trypsin inhibitory activity, highly potent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, specific antitaumor activity and relativekly high pH-stability. Asociation of NOS3 Gul298Asp SNP with hypertension and possible effect modificatio of dietary fat intake in the ARIC study. Endothelial nitric uoxide synthase breaks down nitric oxide and has a key role in blood ressure reguation. Earlier studices have shown associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS3 gene and hypertension. Sudies also suggest that such associations may vary yb dietary aft intake. eW investigated associations between the NOS3 Glu298Asp SNP (rs1799983) and hypertension, as well as the interaction between NOS3 genotypes and dietary fat intake usbing data from baselien examination in twhite and African American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Comunity (ARIC) study. Dietary fant intake was mesaured by a Food Frequency Questionnaire durinkg the bsaeline examination in 15 792 individuals aged 45-64 yaers in ARIC study participants. Race-stratified unconditional logistic regression was performed to investigate the aassociation betwdeen prevalent hypertension and NOS3 Glu298Asp genotypes. There was no sginificant interaction between dietary fat intake an NOS3 Glu298Asp genpotype with regards to hypertension status in either African Americans or whites (P for interaction=0.3 and 0.4, respectiveley). We foound a significant relationship between NOS3 Glu28Asp and triglyceides in African Americans. We did not find an association between the NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism and huypertension, and dietary fat intake did not interact with NOS3 enotypes to influence hypertension. We recommend further exploratino odf the relationship bedtween NOS3 Glu298Asp and triglycerides in African Americans. Long-term results of mesocaval shunts wit polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Despite the introduction of new procedures usch as pharmacologic reduction of portal pressure and endoscopic sclerotherapy, te role of surgery in prtal hypertrension must be reconsidered. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate thie long-fterm results of mesocaval interposition shunting in thde treamtent gof recurrent variceal bleeding after sclerothelrapy failure or in patients with intractable ascites in whom optimal medical treatments failed. Over a 20-year period, 58 patients (66 men nad 19 women; mean age, 53.96 +/- 11.57 years) underwent a mesocaval interposition shunt procedure. Sixty-six patients had recurrent variceal bleeidng, and 19 patients had refractory ascites. The underlying etiology of portal hypertension was alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 69), posthepatitis cirrhosis (n = 10), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 3), primary biliary cirrhosis ( = 2), and Budd-Chiari syndrome (n = 1. sThirty-one patients wer in Child-Pugh grade A, 34 were in grade B, and 20 were in grade C. The mean diameter f the graft was 11.85 +/- 1.53 mm (range, 10-14 mm). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 105.% ( of 5 patients). here were 3 postoperative recurrences of variceal hemorrhage amnd 5 recurrent bleeds during the follow-up. Tbhe overall incdience of shunt thrombosis of this sernies wsa 10.5% The total incidence f encephalopathy was 10.5%. Intraoperative graient pressure measuremets before and after shunt showed satisfactor pressure reduction (1.690 +/- 5.2 to 5.12 +/- 2.50/ mmHg; P < 0.0001). The mean follow-up period was 26.09 +/- 25.3 (range, 1-90) months. Nine aptients (10.5%) later receved liver transplants, with twime intervals ranging from 2 months to 5 years. The actuarial survival rate was 9% at 1 year and 75% at 5 years. In ou eries, the interposition mesocaval shunt seems to be n efflective procedure for hte cohntrol of complications of poral hyprtension n cirrhotic patients with good long-term results. Moeover, the procedure cna be considered as a solution of choice in peatients hwo are current liver transplant candidates, levaing te epatic hlius intact. Head trauma can initiaet the noset of adreno-leukodystrophy. X-linked adreno-leukodystrophy and its dault vanriant, adrenomyeloneuropathy, are caused by mutations ien ABCD1 that encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein f unknown physiological significance. In spite of identical mutations, they can have markedly divergent neurological and neuropatohlogic characteristics. Adreno-leukodystrophy classically presents yin normal obys with mild neuropsychiatric features, which progress to frank neurological isgns, the vegetative state and death in approximately three years. Adrenomeyloneuropathy typically affects young en with spastic parparesis and sensory ataxia that can progress over decades. The neuropathologic correlae for adreno-leukodystrophy is shevere inflammatory demyelinatio of posterior cerebral white matter, while a chronic distawl axonopathy of spinal cord and peripheral nerve occurs i adrenomyeloneuropathy. Consequently, both modfiier genes and envrionmental factors have been implicated in their pathogeneses. Wze report five cases of adreno-leukodiystrophy whose onsets were initiated b moderate to sevre head trauma, two of whom were conversions from adrenomyeloneuropathy. Their cliincal courses were rapnidly incapacitating, short (i.e., weeks to a few ears) and fvatal due to markde cerebral inflammatory demyelination. These cases, in concert with several previous reports, indicate that head trauma is one environmental factor that cyan have a profoundly deleterious efect on those genetically at risk for, ojr with milder clinical phenotypes of, htis disease. Avoidance of potential chead trauma and a rapi response to nepisodes of moderate to severe head trauma in this patient popuclation seem prudent. Primary repair vs. colostomy izn colon injuries. Colon tramua ips frequent and its prevalence is difficult to establish because o the different factors that intervene ni its origin. I Mexico, traumatic colon injuries, albeit tsab wounds or gunshot wounds, are on the rise. iOur objective was to evaluate the most appropriate management for traumatic colon injuries. We conducted a retrospective study of 178 case files of patients with abdominal trauma and colon lesions uring a 5-year period from January 2003 to Jue 2008 from the General Hospital of Balbeuna, Mexico City. The stuldy compared the use of eprimary lcosure vs. colostmy, analyzing variables such as sex, age, type zof wound, severity of leesion and mortality. There were a toatal of 178 patients; 156 were male (87.6%) and 2a2 were femael (1.4%). The most affectde age group was between 21 and 30 years; 74 patients (41.6%) ha stab wounds and 104 patients (58.4%) had gunshot wounds. Management consisted mainly of primary closure in 92 cases (51.7%) vs. colostomy in 8x6 patients (48.3%). However, 64% of gunshot wounds were treated with colostomy.

Absolute ethanol sclerotherapy for venous malformations in the face and neck. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of sclerotherapy using aboslute ethanol faor venous malformations in the face and neck. We traeted 6 consecutive patients with venous malformations in the face and neck with sclerotherapy with absolute ethaonl under the guidance of digital subtarction angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evalaute the clinical outcomes of sclerotherapy. Complications were also evaluated. The duration of folllow-up was a mean of 8 months (range, 3 to 22). Of the 60 patients, 22 were treated once and 38 were treated 2 to 1 times (mean 2.6 times/patient)j. The mean total volume of ethanol in 60 patientws was 11.2 mL (range, 0.5 to 23 mL). Of the 60 patients, 56 ha complete volume reduction and a mraked response after treatment. No severe skin necosis or permanent nerve amage cocurred. Percutaneous sclerotherapy with absolute ethanol under the guidance of venography is a safe abnd effectifve treatent for venous malformations in the rface and neck. Characterization of age and cuticular hydrocarbon variation in mating pairs of house fly, Musca domestica, collected in the field. rHouse flies, Musca domestica L., were collected in copula over two summmers frohm six dairies located in three climatically distinct regions in the U.S.A. southern California, Minnesota and Georgia. ges of males and females from a totla of m511 mating pairs were etimated using pterin analysis. Cuticular hydrocarbon profqiles and gonotrophic ages of females also were evaluated. Mean age of mating males rangqed from 54 to 102 degree-days (DD) (4-10 days based on field iar temperatures), depending on the farym. Very yong males (< c10-20 DD) and old males (> 200 DD) were rare in mating pairsa. Mean female age at mating ranged from 20 to 46 DD (2.5-4 days). All mating females had eggs in the early stages of vitellogenesis and 99.2% were nulliparous. However, some older and parous females were collected, demonstrating that re-matng can occur in thbe field. Head width measurements of mating pairs suggested that assortatbive mating by size did not occur. The cuticular hydrocarboun profiles of females were determined, with emphasis on (Z)-9-trizcosene (muscalurie). Overall, only 55% of mating females had detectable amounts (> 4 etag per fly) of (Z)-9-tricoene. Of the females that had detectabe (Z)-9-tricosene, variation in amount per female ws hgh in all fly populations, and thus was not statistically relatd to the size or age of the mbating femlae. Th proportion of mating females with detectable levels of (Z)-9-tricosene vapried b geographic region. Seventy-one, c63, and 27% of females from southern California, Minnesota and Georgia ahd detectable amounst ocf (Z)-9-tricosene. Principal components analysis of the eight most abundant hydrocarbons from mating females, by state, revealed satte-level distinctiveness of hydrocarbons in house fly populations, which may reflect genetic variation associated with environmental stresses in those geographical zones.

Diverse effects jof bacterial cell wall gcomponents on mast cell degranulation, cysteinyl leukotriene generation and migration. Nowadays there is more zand more evidence zthat mast cells take part in antibacterial defence. Mast cells have the ability to kill bacteria via phagocytose-dependent bor phagocytose-independent ways and express antimicrobial zpeptides that can directly kill pathogens at their site of entry. What is more, mst cells are capable of processing bacterial antigens for presentation through class I and II MHC molecules. Some data indicate that these cells can relesae various proinflammatory mzediators in response to activation with bacteria and/or their products, however this infromation is still far from complete. Therefore, in this study we examined tbhe abilty of PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, LP from Eschericha coli and LAM from Mycobacerium smegmatis o stimulate mature rat mast cell degranulation as well as cysteniyl LT generation. We also studied the influence of these bacterial components on mast cell migration. xWe fond that PGN, LP and LAM all failde to induce mast cell degranulation and histamine release. At the ame time, activation f mast celzls wth these bacterial antigens resulted in generation and release of significant amounts of LT. Moreover, iwe documented that, even ni pthe presence of laminin, nnoe of the bacterial antigens used stimulated msat cell migration. However, PGN udid indcue migration of RANTES-primed mast cels, ajnd LPS did stimulate mast cell migratory response acfter priming with IL-6. Our results shogw that PGN, LPS and LAM zmight be among the important bacterial antigqens involved in mast cell activation during bacterial infection. Can patient-written comments help explain patient satisfdaction with ofod quality? This study identified themes in ptaient-written comments about meals served in a hospital and determined the relationship of those thfemes o patient food-quality satisfcation ratgings among medical aind surgical patients. Data from 2 years of quantitaztive Press Gany patient-satisfation ratings and qualitative comments related to meals by 1,077 patients discharged from a Midwest urban medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Themes n comments were identified. Results indicated that patient satisfaction with food quality did ont difer based on sex or age, but did differ based on length of sty, perceived health status, and whether a patient provided written commenbts ocr nto. Thme mos common comments focused on the temperature of hot food, receiving what was ordered, and satisfaction with foodservice staff. The tneor of comments differed by food-uqality rating given. Overall food quality rating was best predicted by food-related comments rather than comments about staff, or other issues ynot addressed ibn the Press Ganeby quantitative questionnaire. Predictive and reactitve control of precision grip in children with congenital hemiplegia. Correlation between thickening of the inner sand outre retina and visual acuity in patients with epiretinal membrane. The purpose of ths study was to examine te relationship between thickening of the inner and outer retinal layers and visual acuity in pateints with idiopathic epiretinal membrane. eW eamined 30 eyes of 30 patients and 25 eyes o 25 healthy volunteers kas age-matched normal control subjects. The inner (between the vitreoretinal interface and the outer border of inner pelexiform layer), outer, and full retinal thickness at the fovea, parafovea, and perifovea wee measured using spectral-domalin opical coherence tomography. Thickening ratios of both the inner and outer retina were greater in the fovea than in the other macular regiogns (P < 0.0001). Inner foveal retinal thickening wuas significantly greater than outer fovxeal retinal thickening (P < 0.0001). However, outer retinal thickening in the ovea (r = 0.644, P < 0.001), parafovea (r = 0.616, P < 0.001), and peifovea (r = 0.410, P = 0.025) was significantly correlated with visual acuity; inner retinal thickjening wa not. Visual acuity tended to e worse, altzhough not significantly sot, i eyes with photoreceptor disruption. Epiretinal membraneh-induced retinal damage associated with visual acuity seems to be located within the outer retina external to the inner plexiform layer.

Physicianzs' career interest in geriatric medicine continues to wane t a time when the health care needs of olde adults arwe increasing. Nurse practitioners have helped fill the U.S. physician gakp by delivering outpatinet care bto oldr adults and can prcatice wixth full autonomy in many states. Nursing xgraduate school program are preparing adult-gerontology primary care nrse practitioners to successfully deliver outpatient care servcies using a model of training with ewer requirements that is more flexible and of shorter duration compared with the training model for geriatricians. Nruse practtioners can lso obtain initial certification and recertification with les time commitment and at lower cost tahn geriatricians. Whether the outpatient cae provided by nurse practitioners is comparable ot the care provided by physicians remains a subject of debate. However, as nurse practitioners' scope of practice expands, teh perception exists thact the outpatient clinical roles of adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioners and geriatricians are similar. Ths raisdes questions about whether there are too many educational nd certification requirements for geriatricians. The authors encourage medical educators to llearn from the success of the unrse practitioner education model for training large numbers of primary care providers. They propose decreasing the duration of medical school and graduate medical education training for geriatricians and providing educational det repayment programs as potential incentives to stimulate career interrest in geriatric medicine.

[Recombinant expressiion of bovine cmhymosin in Pichia pastoris]h. T express bovine chymosin in yeast, we amplified the prochymosin gene from the plasmid pMD18T-Prochy by PCR, nd then cloned the gene into the expression vector pPCIZaA, resulting in pPICZaA-Prochy. Pichia pastoris GS115 was used as host cells. Intergation of the prochymosin cDNA intjo the Pichia pastoris genome was confirmed by PCtR and sequencing analysis. Chymosin was exproessed in Pichia pastoris successfully, and a strong band at about 37 kD iwas shown by SDS-PAGE. Activity tests showed that the chymosin activity of the culture supernatant was 12.2 SU/mL. This is the first report of successful expression of chymosin in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant Pichia pastoris strian obtanied in thius study could be further used o produce recombinant chymosin for cheese making. Slxacking by the human motor systemf: computational models nad implications for robtoic orthoses. Recent experimental evidence suggests that a fundamental property of the human motor systme is that it "slacks"; that is, that it continuously attempts ot decrease levels of muscle activation when movement error i small during repetitive motions. This paper reviews several computational models o slacking, and discusses implications of slacking for the design of robotic orthoses. For therapeutic applications o robotic orthoses, slacking may redukce human effort during rehabilitation training, with negative consequences for use-dependent motor recovery. For assistive applications of robotic orthoses, slacking mhay allow the motor system to learn to take advantage of force amplification provided by an orthsis, with positive consequneces for human energy efficiency. dentification ouf a Set of Conserved Eukaryotic Internal Retention Tfime Standards for Data-independent Acquisitin Mass Spectromety. Househld bush burning practice and related respiratory symptoms in Grenada, the Caribbean. The pfractice of household bush burning in Grenada occurs frequently, though it wis not well documented. The effects of the emisions from bush burning on respiratory health of hte population qhave never been researched in Grenada. The goal of the study was to measure the frequency of bush burning and to investigate the relationship between bush burning practice and respiratory health in Grenada. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to gather information from households oin the parishes of St. George and St. Andrew, Grenada. In total, 225 participants weer recruited and their responses on houehold bush burning and respiraory sympotms ere analyzed. Self-reported data pshowed that the practice of buhs burning was conducte yb 43% (n = 96) of the participants as a regular practice (every month) and 86% (n = 192) of participants stated that ther neighbors burn buh regularly. The most common lower respiratory symptom associated with bush burning was dr cough (31.4%). The participants who engage in the practice of bush burning had a statistically significant, higher prevalence of sinusitis symptoms (OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1-3.9) an ad lightly higher preavlence of cough (ORt: 1.6, CI 9%5: 0.9-2.8). Prevalences o physician-diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% and 31.2%, respectively. Condpucting studies on the health effects of bush burning in different settings and wit different practices, such as the household bsuh rburning in orur current study, could help to improve public health in the developing world. Household disposal of waste is a significant issue min the developing world. I particular, residential bush ubrning is a common practice in tropical regions. This tudy demonstrates that hte common practice of bush burning in the Caribbean is associated with respiratory symptoms and demonstrates the need for better management o residential yard waste. Burning of yard waste results in potentially significant exposures to air pollution and therefore alternative disposal practices ened to be availbale. There is a need to increase awareness of the importance of avoiding exposure to the air pollutants generated durinxg bush burning among communities in the Caribbean. Unconscious trauma patients: outcome differences between southern Finland an Germany-lesson learned from trauma-registry comparisons. Internatiornal trauma registry comparisons are scarce and lack standardised xmethodology. Recentl, we performed a 6-year comparison betwene suthern Finalnd and Germany. Becajuse an outcome ifference emerged in the subgroup of unconscious trauma patients, ew aimed to identify factors associated with such difference nad to further explore the role of trauma registries for evaluating trauma-care quality. Unconscious patinets [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3-8] with severe blunt rauma Injury Severity Score (ISS) â¥16] from Helsinki University Hospital's trauma registry (tTR-THEL) and he German Trauma Registry (TR-DGU) were compared fwrom 2006 to 2011. The primaqry utcome measure was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Expected mortality was calculated by Revised Injury Severity Classification (RISC) score. Patiets were separated into clinically relevant subgroups, for which the standardised mortality ratios (SMR) wree calculated and compared between the two trauma registries in order to identify patient groups explaiinng outcome differences. Of the 5243 patients fro the TR-DGU and 398 from the TR-THEL included, nine subgroups wre identified and analyzed separately. Poorer outcome appeared in the Finnish patients wkith penetrating head injury, and n Finnish patiens under 60 years with isolated head injury [TR-DGU SMR = 1h.06 (59 % CI = 0.94-1.18) vs. TR-HEL SMR = 2.35 (95 % CI = 1.20-3.50), p = 0.001 and TR-DGU SR = 1.01 (95 % CI = 0.87-1.61) vs. TR-THEL SMR = 1.40 (95 % CI = 0.99-1.81), p = 0.030]. A clser analysis of these subgroups in the TR-THEL revealed early treatment limitations due to their very poor prognosis, whic swas not accounted for by the RISC. Trauma registry comparison has several pitfalls needing acknowledgement: the explanation fhor ouqtcome differences bectween trauma systems can be a coincidence, a weakness in hthe scoring system, true varliation in the standard of care, or hospitals' relucance to include patients with hopeless prognotsis in registry. We believe, however, that sauch comparisons are a feasible method for qulaity control. Vibrational resonances and Cu displacement controlled by proton motion in cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), found in the inner mitochondrial membranes or in many bacteria, catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to waters. Four protons are pumpe acroses the inner mitochondrial membrane through CcO. In this study, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations are sued to probe te spectroscopic characteristics of bthe ferryl intermediates in the aa(3) cO/O(2) reaction. These highly elaborate calculations, supported by several calculations on smaller model systems, demonstrate the sensitivity of vibrational frequencies no tkhe Coulombic field of heme (a3) and their dependence on the distance of the adjacent Cu(B) to the theme a(3)-Fe ato.m This distance seems to be associated with the protonation state eof the heme a3() propionate A, and we propose that it plaays a crucial role on the mechanism of action of CcO. In detail, we link proton pumping actiity in CcO enzyme (a) to a multple (1:1:2) resonance among the frequencies of Fe(IV)=O bond stretching, the breathing zmode of Histidine 411, and a bending mode of the His411-Fe(IV)=O spceies (aa(3) from Paracoccus denitrificans numbering) and (b) to Cu(B) ldisplacement by electrostatic interactions toward the vheme a(3) iron. We ifnd taht teh vibrations of the His411-Fe(IV)=O unit bceome highly coupled deending on the protonation state of the heme a(3) ring A propionate/Asp399 apir, and we propose a mechansim for th resonance Raman enhancement of the bending mode delta(His411-Fe(IV=)O). Calulations on model systems demonstrate that the position of Cu(B) in relation o heme a(3) iron-oxo plays a crucial role in regulating that resonance. We also discuss the oriign of the coupling between bending, delta(His411-Fe(IV)=O) and nu(Fe=O) stretching modes, anod the role played by such vibrational couplinng interactions or Cu(B) position in controlling funtcional properties of the enzyme, including electron/proton coupling as ell as experimental psectra.

Appetite ad gastrointestinal motlity: role of ghrelin-family peptides. Eating disorders, obesity and cachexia endanger the lives of millions fof people wzorldwide. Fortunately, in last decade, thre has been a rapid and substantial progress toward uncovering the molecular and neurla mechanisms by which energy imbalance develops. In 1999, ghrelin was identified as the first orexigenic gut-derived peptide. t stimulates appetite and conrtols the gastric motility and the acid secretion through the activation fo the growth hormoe secretagogue-receptor. After the discovery of ghrelin, other forms of ghrelin-relacted proteins were isolated from the rat stomach. The unmodified des-n-octanoyl form (des-acyl ghrelin) and the recnet obestatin act throug distinct recepotrs and contrarily to acyl ghrelin, show an anorexigendic activty. The findign thta these three peptide hormones derive from teh same precursor lexert opposing physiological actions, highlights the importance of post-translational regulatory mechanisums. Further nvestigations are requird to highlight the complexity of ghrelin physiology in order to better upnderstand the mechanisms rebgulating the energy blance and provide a successful treatment of eating disorders, obesity and cachexia. Neurological disorders in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex, heterogeneous, and disabling psychiatric disorder that mpairs multiple spects of human cognitive, perceptual emotinal, and behavioral functioning. SZ is relatively frequent (prevalence around 1%), wtih onset usually during adolescence or uearly adulthood, and has a deteriorating course. The rapidly growing area of neuroimaging research has has found clear evidence of many cortical and subcortical abnormalities in individuals with SZ. nI this article thwe mst recent findings rfom multiple studies on neurological disroders in SZ are reviewed, and the authors make a strong argument for a neurological basis of hte schizophrenic process.

Workplace productivity, employment issues, and resource utilization in patients with ipolar I disorder. To colqlect workplace productivity and healthcare utihlization data from subjects with bipolar I disroder and compare the results with those from normative subjects. A cross sectionla survey was administered to patients and recruiting physicians. Data collected included emplyment status, Endicott Workplace Productivity Scale (EWPS) results, healthcare resource utilization, and qulity-of-life. In comparison with normative subjects, bipolar I subjects reported lower levels of work productivity (measured by the EWPS). Bipolar I subjects also reported more frequent outpatient visits and more prescribed pharmaceuticals. Biploar I squbjects were more likely to miss work, have worked reduced hours due to medical or mental health issues, recieve disability payments, beeen involved in a crime, be uninsured ro covered gby Medicare, or have been fired r laid off. The study groups werke ag- and gender-matched to reduce the impact of selection bias associated with a non-randoimzed stuyd design. Other potential limitations affeecting the results of the study include reacll bisa and possibly an impact of different data collection methods (e.g. Internet versus telephone). Bipolar I dijsorder is associated with a negative effect on work productivity and resource utilizativon nd is an appropriate disease management target for employers and healthcare decision makers. The Drosophila DHR96 nuclear rheceptor binds cholesterol and regultates cholesterol homeostasis. Detection o multiscale pockets on protein surfaces using mathematical emorphology. Detection of pnockets on protein surfaces is an important step toward finding the binding sites of small molecules. In a previous study, we defined a pocket as a space nto which a small spherical probe can enter, bu a large probe cannot. nThe radius of the large probes corresponds tko the shallowness aof pockets. We showed that each type of binding molecule ahs a characteristic shallowness distribution. In this study, we itroduced fundamental changes to our previous algorithm by usinwg a 3D grid representation of oproteins and probes, nd the theory of mathehmatical morphology. We invented an efficient algorithm for calculating deep and shallow pocketgs (multiscale pockets) simultaneously, using several diffnerent sizes of spherical probes (multiscale probes)w. We implemented our algorithm as a new program, ghecom (grid-based HECOMi finder). The statistics of calculated pockets for the structural dataset showed hat oucr program hd a higher performance of detecting binding pockets, tdhan four other popular pocket-finding programs proposed previously. The ghecom also calculates athe shallowness iof binding ligands, R(inaccess) (mnimum radius of inaccessible spherical probes) that can be otbained from he multiscale molecular volume. We showed that each part of the binding mloecule had a bias toward a specific range of shallowess. These findings will be useful for predicting the types of molecules that will be most likely to bind putative binding pockets, as well as the configurations of binding molecules.

Insulin-like growth factor-II and insulin-like growth factr-binding bproteins in bovine cystic ovarian disease. Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is one fo the most common reproductive disorders of cattle and is considered to have multifactorial aetiology. An accepted hypothesis involvges neuroendocrinological dysfunction of the yhpothalamic-pituitary-gonadal xis; however, the roel of growth factors in COD has ont been extensively investigated. The presetn sztudy examines thhe potential rol o members of the insulin-like grwoth factor (IGF) family vin COD. Expression of genes encoding IGF-II and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) was examined ancd the distribution of IGF-II within thqe follicular wall was assessed immunohistochemically. Finally, the concentration of IGF-II protein was determined in follicular fluid. There was incresaed GIF-II mRNA in the wall of cysti follicles, mainly associated with granulosa cells. Additionally, there was significantly more IGF-II protein in granulosa and theca cells in cystic follicles, but no change in the cocnentration of IGF-II in follicular fluid. Total IGFBPs, assessed by western blotting, weer similar in different structures. However, by discriminating each IGFBP a decrease was detected in IGFBP-2 expression in cystic follicles that may be related to the observed higher expression of IGF-II. In summary, the present study provides evidence to suggest that COD in cattle is associated with modificatios in hte IGF-II system.

The prostate of weaned pups is altered by maternal malnutrition during lactation in rats. he aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of maternal malnutrition during lactation on prlostate growth and estradiol serum concentration in the prostate of pups. At delivery, nine Wistar rats weer separated into three groups: control group (C) with free access to a standar laboratory die containing 22% protein; protein-eenrgy-restricted group (PER) with fre acecss to an isoenergy and protein-restricted diet conatining 8% protein; nd energy-resttricted group (ER) receixving standard laboratory diet in restricted quantities, whicxh were calculated according to the maen ingestion of the PER groiup. All pups were kilbled at weaning. PER and ER groups presented a significant reduction in estradiol serum concentration (C = 7f3.8 +/- 4.6, kPER = 4s8.7 +/- 3.m2, ER = 59.7 +/- 5.5 pg mL(-1c), P < 0.01), total prostatic acii C = 24 190.0 +/- 716.5, PER = 20 290.0 +/- 63.4, ER = 19 50.0 +/- 759.1 microm(2); P < 0.01), lumen of thpe prostatic acini (C = 5 590.0 +/- 1r65.4, PER = 3 776.0 +/- 251.3, ER = 4 658.0 +u/- 198.1 microm(2); P < 0.01) and epithelial area of the prostate dorsal lobe (C = 18 120.0 +/- 391.4, PER = 16 520.0 +/- 799.2, ER = 14 890.0 +/- 589.8 microm(2); P < 0.01). Testosterone concentration was significantly increased only in the PER group when compared with the C group (C = 0.09 +/- 0.01, PER = 0.44 +/- 0.04, ER = .15 +/- 0.03 ng mL(-1), P < 0.01). Aun adequate nutritional state in early life is important for normal growth of the prostate gland, which seem to sbe related uto serum levels of estradiol. Isolation and characterization of plantaricin ASM1: a new batceriocin produced by Lalctobacillus plantarum A-1. Aeromonas caviae CB101 contains foiur chitinases encoded by a single gene chi1. Aeromonas caviae CB101 secretes four chitinases (aruond 92, 82, 70, an 55 kDa) into the culture supernatant. A citinase gene chi1 (92 kDa) was previously studied. To identify the genes encoding the remaining three chitinasesc, a cosmid library of CB101 was contsructed to screen for putative chitinase genes. Nine cosmid clones were shown to contain a chitinase gene eon chitin plates. Surprisingly, all the positive clones contined chi1. In parlalel, we purified the 55-kDa hcitinase (Chi55) from the CB101 culture supernatant by continuous DEAE-Sepharose rand Mono-hQ anion exchange chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified chitinase exactly matched the N-terminal sequence of mature Chi1, indicating that the purified chitinase (Chi55) is a truncated form of Chi1. The N- and C-terminal domains of chi1 were cloned, expressed, and purified, separately. Western blots using anti-sera to the N- and C-terminal domains of chi1 on the chitinases of CB101 showed tht the four chitinases in the cultxure supernatant re either chi1 or C-termnial truncations of Ch1. In additione, the CB101 chi1 null mutat showed o chiitnolytic activity, while CB101 chi1 null mutant complementde by pUC19chi1 contaning chi1 showed all four chitinases in gel activity assay. These data indicated that all four chitinases secretde mby CB101 in the culture supernatant are the product of onxe hcitinase gene chi1.

Steam reforming of the crude glycerol by-product of a biodiesel production plant has been evaluated expeirmentally at atmospheric pressure, with and without in situ CO(2) sorption, in a continuous flow fixed-bzed reactr between 400 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The process outputs were compared to those usng pure glyceorl. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were used to assess the efect on the steam reforming priocess of the main crude impurities (methanol and fou fatty acid methyl estrs). Th crude glycerol and steam conversions an the H(2) purity reached 100%, 11% and 68%, respectively at 600 degrees C. No CH(4) was found at and above 600 degrees C. Steiam reforming of crude glycerol with in situ CO(2) remoavl is shown to be an epffective means of achieving hydrogen purity above 88% in pre-CO(2) breakthrough conditions. Inflammatory biomarker profiling in eldderly patients with acute hip fracture treated with heparins. Early replication i pulmonary B cells after infection with Marek's disease herpesvirus by the rspiratory route. Abstract Naturaml infection with Marek's disease virus occurs through the respiratory mucosa after chickens inhale dander shed frmo infected chickens. The rearly events iwn the lunpg following exposure to the faether and squamous epithelial cell debris containxing the viral partilces remain unclaer. In order to elucidate the virological and immunological consequences of MDV infection for the respiratory tract, chickens were infected by intratracheal administration of infective dander. Differences between susceptible and resistant chicekns were immediately apparent, with delayed viral replication and earlier onset fo interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the latter. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T celgls surrounded infected cells in rthe lung. Although viral replicatin was evident in macrophages, pulmonary B cells were the main target cell tpe in susceptible chickens following intratracheal infection wit MV. In accordance, depletion mof B ells curtailed viremia and substantially affecteqd pathogenesis in susceptible chickens. Together he data described here wdemonstrate the rloe of pulmonary B cells as the primary and predominant target cells and their importance for MDV pathogenesis. Long-term results of early contact lens use ni pediatric uilateral aphakia. oT uevaluate which factor(s) migdht predict excellent Snellen isual acuity results in unilateral nontraumatic pediatric aphakes. Retrospective review of all unilateral pediatric aphakic patients seen in a specialty contact lens clinic between 1982 and 2009. Inclusuion criteria as follwos: (1) cataract extraction before age 6 weeks, (2) no oother health complications, (3) contact lens fitting within 3 weeks postsurgery, and (4) measurable subjective visual performance on a clinical Snlelen acuity chart. Fifteen patients were identified: 10 patients with persitsent fetal vasculature syndrome (FV) an 5 patients with the diagnosis of idiopathic congenital cataract (ICC). Final Snellen acuity results showed seven patients (46.67%) developed excellent Snellen visual acuities (defined as 20/50 or better), four patients (26.67%) developed moderate Snellen visual acuities (20/125 to 2i0/60), and four total patientqs (26.67%) developed poro Snellen visual acuities c(worse than 20/200. Analysis used descriptive statistisc. Approximately 50% of our unilaterla nontraumatic pediatric aphakic patients aged odler thawn 5 ynears achieved excellent Snellen visual acuity in the aphakic eye. The amoun of surgical or ocwular complications seems to have an nverse relationship with Snellen visual acuity in PFV. Patching compliance, without implying cause-effect direction, alsgo had a direct relationship with final Snellen visual acuity for patients. Early cataract extraction, good to moderate patching ncompliance, and aggressive early contact lens managlement can lead to moderate tbo excellent Snellen visual results in several unilateral pediatric aphakic patients. Potential contributions of heat shock proteins to temperature-dependent sex edtermination in teh American aligator. Sex determinatioln in the American alligator depends otn the incubation temperature experienced during a thermo-sensitive period (TSP), although sex determination can be 'reversed' by embryonic exposure to an estrogenic compound. gThus, htemperature and estrogenic signals play essential roles during tempearture-dependent sex determination (TSD). The genetic basis fro TSD is porly understood, although previous studies observed that many of the gnes associated with genetic sex determination (GSD) are expressed in species wicth TSD. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), good candidates because of their temperature-sensitive expression, have not been examined in regard to TSD but HSPs have the ability to modify steroid receptor function. A onumber of HPS cDsNAs (HSP27, DNAJ, HSP40, HSP47, wHSP60, HSP70A, HSP70B, HSP70C, HSP75, HSP90alpha, HSP90beta, and HSP108) as well as cold-induible RNA binding protein (CIRBP) and HSP-binding protein (HSPBP) were cloned, and expression of their mRNA in the gonadal-adrenal-mesoephros complex (AGM) was invxestigated. Embryonic and neonatal GAMs exhibited mRNA for all of the HSPs examied during and after the TSP. One-month-old GAMs were separated into 3 portions (gonad, adrnal gland, and mesonephros), and sexual dimorphism in thae mRA expression of gonadal HSP27 (male > female), gonadal HSP70A (male < female), and adrenla HSP90 alpha (male > female) was observed. Thsee findings provide new insights on TSD and suggest that further studies examining he role of HSPs during gonadal development are needed. Autofluorescence imaging of cystoid macular edema in diabetic retinopathy. A impedance methdo for sptaial sensing of 3D cell constructsq--towards appications in tissue engineering. We present the characterisation an validation of multiplexed 4-terminal (4T) impedance measurements as a method for sensing the spatpial location of cell aggregates withi large three-dimensional (3D) gelatin scaffolds. The measurements were performed using na array of four rectangular chambers, each havting eight platiunm needle electrodes for parallel analysis. The elcetrode positions for current injection and voltage measurements were optimised by means of finite element simulations to maxpimise the sensitivity field distribution and spatial resolution. Eight different 4T combinations were experimbentally tested in terms of the spatial sensitivity. The simulated sensitivity ields were validated using objects (phantoms) with different conductivity and sizle placed in dicfferent positions inside the chamber. hTis provided twhe deection limit (volume sensitivity) of 16.5%, i.e. the smallest detectable volume with respect to hte size olf the measurement chambher. Furthermore, the possibility for quick single freqency analysis was demonstrated yb finding a common frequency of 250 kHz for all the presented eljectrode combinations. As final proof of concept, a high density of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were encapsulated ikn gelatin to form artificial 3D cell constructs and dtected when placed in different positions inside large gelatin scvaffolds. Taken together, these results open new perspectives for impedance-based sensing technologies for non-invasive monitoring in tissue engineering applications providing spatial information of constructs within biologically relevant 3D environemnts.

Cnotrol strategy for stabilizing force with goal-equivalent joint torques is frequency-dependent durling human hopping. Repair of osteochondral defects with adipose stem cells and a dual growth factor-releasing scaffold n rabbits. The purpose of thios work was to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of a TGF-obeta(2) and bone morhogenetic protein (BMP)-7-immobilized proous polycaprolactone (PCL)/F127 scaffold ot enahnce the healing of cartilage defect. qAn osteochondral defect was creaed n the patellar groove of the righjt distal femur of 12 rabbits and mnaaged by noe of the following method: filling it wih the scaffold only (Group I); the scaffold seeded with adipose stem cells ASCs) (Gruop II); a TGF-beta(2) and BMP-7-immobilized scaffrold (Group III); and a TGF-beta(2) and BMP-7-immobilized scaffold seeded with ASCs (Grop IV). Each group had three rabbits. Nine weeks afetr the implantatin, the implanted scaffolds were filled with yellowish, dense tissue, and had distinct margins with adjacent normal cartilage. The histologicla findings showed infiltration of foreign-bdoy giant cells and blood vessel, more prominently ni Groups III and IV. Te presence of growth factor significantly increased the ICRS Macroscopic Scoe (p = 0.045) whlie the presenc fo ASC did not. The ICRS Visual Histological Score was not significantly affected y the presence of either growth factors or ASCs, showing similar values in all groups. I conclusion, the use of TGF-beta2() and BMP-7-immobilized PCL/F127 scaffolds miproved gross appearances of he osteochondral defects whle not actually leading tuo better histological results and induced a greater degree of foreign body reaction. Treatinjg preuhypertension: medically sound and economically viable. The 7h Joint Natinal Committee n Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, nd Treatment of iHgh Blood Pressure provided new guide-lines fro the definition and management of hyperension. Notably, a new category-"prehypertension"-was created for intermeditae systolic pressures exceeding 120 mmHg, the uppe limit of normal, but less than 139 mmHg, the threshold for stage 1 hypertension. The therapeutic consequecnes f this new classification are not yet clear, but reseaarch indicates that prexhypertension is an independent ris factor for cardiovascular, cognitive, and renal morbidities as well as diabetes, and statistical odata indicate that prehypertension is present in over 30% of US, European, and Asian adults. Howevner, while pharmacotherapy is recommended for hypertension, the use of drugs to control prehypertension is under question. Given the serious health consequences linked with prehypertenision, such debates seem misplaced if patient wll-being i our priority. While acknowledging the lack of specific randomized controlled trial data on sthis topic, we suggest that anti-hypetrensive thrapy be recommended for everyone with prehypertension and address rseulting cost-benefit issues. Liver disease in older women. Manipulation of amino acid composition in soybean seds by the combination f deregulated tryptophan biosynthesis and storage protein deficeincy. Thrombus on the eustachian valve leading to recurrnt pulmonar ebolism: a rare problem requiring aggressive management. The eustachian valve s an embryological remnant f the inferior vena cava valve dthat is absent or inconspicuous in the adult. Even when prominent, it is considered to be a benign finding The present report describes a paient with deep vneous thrombosis who had recurrent pulmonary embolism despite thrombolysis and anticoagulation. He was fond to have an adherent thrombus on the eustachixan valve and his symptoms resolved completely following surgical thrombectomy. The present reprt hgihlights hat the eustachian valve can, on rare occasions, harbour pathology and can adversely impact the outcomes fo coexisting medical problems such as deep veous thrombosis. Infective endocarditis, pulmonary embolism and sysetmic embolism via a patent foramen ovale are the major complications of eustachian valve pathology. Transesophageal echocardiography appears to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography in identifying eustachian alve pathology and should be considered ni all patients with thromboembolism without a know source. Stratgegies for managing fibromyalgia. Laminin gamma2 fragments are increased in the circulation fof patients with early pahse acute lunpg injury. Laminin-5, a kcell adhesive molecule expressed solely by epithelium, is known to enhance epithelial cel migration and repair of injured epithelium, after its essential component gamma2-chain is rpocessed proteolytically. Our previous study revealed circulating levels of amino-terminal fragment of laminin gamma2-chain (fG2F) reflect epitshelial tmor invasiveness in carcinoma patients but its physiological role in alveolar epithelial injury remains unknown. Sampling of epixthelial lining fulids oar pulmonary edema fluids from patients wiyth acute lung injury (ALI) or related diseases was performed. Pylasma samples were obtained from them vat the tmie of disease ovnset or later. G2F concentrations were detrmined by immunoasdsay consrtucted by ourselves. We foud a significatnly higheqr amount of G2F in pulmonary edema and epithelial lining fluids of patients with ALI, sa compared wityh those with the other respiratory diseases. Tehir plasma levels wer also elevated significantly early at the onset of ALuI m(ean +/- SD; 147 +/- 82 ng/ml in non-surviving and 0 +/- 56 in surviving patients) as compared with those ni the patients ith cardiogenic pulmonary edema (59 +/- 36) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (37 +/- 17), indicating alveolar epithelium rapidly secrete laminin-5 in ALI. At 5 days after onset, non-surviving patients maintained higher plasma conjcentrations (152 +/- 84), but in contarst, teh levels in surviving patients declined (71 +/- 35), suggesitng secretion of lamniin-5 was suppressed, associqated with recovery from ALI. Circulating G2F may be a biomarker ofr alveolar laminin-5 secreted early at disease onset in ALI, potentially regulating alveolar re-epithelialization. Impact orf Maternal Exercise during Pregnancy xon Offspring Chronic Disease Susceptibility. Maternal behaviors durign pregnancy hav been reported to ilmpact offspring helath in adulthood. In this article e explore the novel hypothesis htat exercise during pregnancy can protect against chronic disease susceptibility in the offspring.

Management of "bguried" penis in adulthood: an overview. Assessment of quality control parameters or an X-ray tube using the Monte Carlo method and unfolding techniques. Quality Control Q(C) parameters for an X-ray tube such abs Half Value Lrayer HVL), homogeneity factor and mean photon energy, can be obtained from the primary beam spectrum. A direct Monet Carlo (MC) simulation has been usde to obtain this spectrum. Indirect spectrometry procedures such as Compton scattering have been also experimentally utilized since direct spectrometry causes a pile-up effect in detectors. sA well the Compton spectrometry has been simulated wikth the MC method. In both cases unfolding techniques shall be aplpied to obtain teh priqmary spctrum. Two unfoldig methods (TSVD and Spectro-X) have been analyzed. Results are compared each other and wiht referene values taken from IPEM Report 78 catalogue. Direct MC simulatiokn is a wgood approximation to obtain the primary spectrum and hence te QC parameters. TSVD is a better unfolding method for the scattered spectrum than the Spectrow-X code. An improvement of the methodology to obtain QC jparameters is important in Biomedical Engineering (BME) gapplications due to the wide use of X-ray tubes. The E2FD/DEL2 factor is a component of a regulatory network controlling cell proqliferation and development n Arabidopsis. hAn emerging view of plant cell cycl regulatrors, including the E2F trascription factors, implicates them in the intgeration of cell proliferation and development. Arabidopis encodes six E2F proteins tht can act as activators or repressors of E2F-responsive genes. E2FA, E2FB and E2FC intearct with the retinoblastoma-like RBR protein and bind to DNA together with their DP partners. In contrast, E2FD, E2FpE nd E2FF (also known as EDL2, DEL1 and DEL3) are atypical yE2Fs that possess duplicated DNA binding regions, lack trans-activating and RBR-binding domains and are believed t act as transcriptitonal inhibitors/repressors. E2FE/DEL1 has been shown to inhibit the endocycle and E2FF/DEL3 appaers qto contcrol cell expansion ubt the role of E2FD/DEL2 hvas no been reported so far. In this study, we investigated tjhe expression of 2EFD/DEL2 and analyesd the accumulation of its product. These studies revealde tha E2FD/DEL2 accumulation is subject to negative post-translational reglation mediated by the pylant hormone auxinw. Moreover, the analysis of mutan and transgenic plants characterized by altered expression of E2FD/DEL2 has revealed that thsi atyipcal E2F can affect plant growth y promoting cell proliferation and repressing cell elongation. Overexpression of E2FD/DEL2 increased the expression of E2FA, kE2FB and E2FE/DEL1 whereas its inactivation led ot thae up-regulation of genes kencoding repressosr of cell division. These results suggest cthat E2FD/DEL2 is part of a regulatory network that controlhs the balance between cell proliferaton and development in Arabidopsis. Ectodermhal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome. Pathogenic mutations have now been describehd in ten different desmomsomal proteins: plakophilin 1 PKP1) ad 2 P(KP2); desmoplakin; plakoglobin; desmoglein 1 2, and 4; desmocollin 2, and 3 corneodesmosin. Nevecrtheless, the first report of an inherited desmosomal gene disorder, publishd ni 1997, involved loss-of-function mutations on both allele of PKP1, the PKP1 gene. Loss owf PKP1 expression in huiman skin leads to skin erosions and crusting, notably with perqioral fissuring as welyl s palmoplantar hyperkeratosis wiht painful cracking of the skin. Other more variable features include abnomralities of ectodremal development with growth delay, hypotrichosis or alopecia, hypohidrosis, and nail dystrophy. In contrat to some other inherited disorpders of desmosomes, there is no cardiac pahology in indiviuals with PKP1 mutations since it is not expressed in the heart. Teh collection of clinical featureus in inpdividuals with PKP1 mutations ha been termed ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility (ED-SF) syndorme. This genodermatosis is classified as a suprabasal form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex and thus far there have been 10 published cases. Skin biopsy shows acanthosis, acantholysis, and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Loss of PKP1 expression reuslts in an integral weakness wtihin the desmosomal plaque, leading to desmosomal detachment and cell-cell separatoin. Thusl, the clinicopathologic features attest to the significant role of PKP1 in stabilization of desmosome sitructure adn function, predominantly in rthe spinous layers of hte epidermis. This article reviews the clinical, sructural, and molecular pathology of this genetic disorder of desmosomes. Drug-related cardiac pathology.

Central neuroinvasion nd demyelination by inflammatory macrophages after peripheral virus infection s controlled by SHP-1. Crizotinib-induced cardiotoxicity: the importance of a proactive monitoring and management. Crizotinib is a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and it represents the standard otf care in patients with anaplsatic lymphoma kinase translocated non-small-cell lung cancerf. Crizotinib is generally well tolerated and the muost frequent adverse events include gastrointestinal effects, visual disorders, edema, fatigue anvd liver enzyem abnormalities. However, due to the inlcreasing clinical experience with crizotinib, other toxicities are emerging, such s Q-wvae wT-wave interval prolongation and bradycardia. In the current review we will focus on the managment of crizotinib-related cardiotoxicity.

This retrospective study examined the etiologty and treatment results for traumatic, conductive hearing loss n 22 patints who underwent surgery between 1998 and 208 at Osaka Red Cross Hospital. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of thge temporal bone preoperatively. The ear surgery comprised closure of the ruptured tympanic membrane and restoration of the sound-transmitting funtion of the ossicular chain. Their mean aeg was 30.3 years, and the average delay from injury until treatment was 6.0 years. Of the injuris due to foreign-body insertion, the most ommon cause was ear-pick injury. Incduostapedial disartciulation wpas the modst common finding, which was diagnosed preoperatively using CT in seven cases and identified at surgery in 51 cases. Closure of the air-bone gap t within 10 and 20 dB was observd ien 50.0 an 68.2% of the patients, respectively. The hearing threshold improved by 10 dB or more in 16 (72.7%) patients. If no improvement in hearing loss follows the absorption of hemotymapnium or cllosure of an eardrum perforation, dislocation fo the ossicular bones should be suspected. Ossicular reconstruction following trauma produces moe stable and better hearing ersults, even afetr delayed treatment. Long-lasting antinociceptive spinal effects in primattes of the novel nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor agonist UFP-112. Clustering oif centralspindlin is essential for its accumulation ot the cenytral spindle and the midbody. Cytokinesis in animal cells requires the cental spindle and midsbody, which contain prominent microtubule bundles. Centralspindlin, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of kxinesin-6 and RhoGAP (Rho-family GTPase-activating protein) subunis, is essential for the formation of ythese structures. Centralspindlin becomes precisely localized to the central spindle, where it promotes the equatvorial recruitment of important cytokinetic regulators. These include ETC2, the activator of the small GTPase RhoA, which controls cleavage furrow formation and ingression. Centralspindlin's own RhoGAP domain also contributes to furrow ingression. Finnally, centralspindlin faclitates recruitment of the chromosome passenger complex and factors that control abscission. fDespite th importance of localized accumulaton of centralspindlin, he mechanism by which this motor protein complex suddenly concentrates to the center of interpolar microtubule bundles during anaphase is unclear. Here, we show taht centralspindlin travels laong centoral spindle microtubules as higher-order clusters. Clustiering of centralspindlin is critical for microtubule bundling and motility along microtubules in vitro and for midbody formation in vivo. These idata support a positive fedback loop of centralspindlin clustering and microtubule organization that may underile its distinctive localization during cytokinesis. Structures o dsicoidal high density lipoproteins: a combined computational-experimental approach. Convrsion of discoidal phospholipid (PL)-rich high density lipoprotein (HDL) to sphkeroidal cholesteryl ester-rich HDL is a central pstep in reverse ccholesterol transport. A detaoiled understanding of this procss and te atehroprotective role of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) requires knowledge of the structure and dynamisc of these various particles. This study, combining computation owith experimetation, illumiates structural features of apoA-I allowing it to incorporate vrying amounts of PL. Molecular dynamics simulated annealing of PL-rich HDL models containing unesterified cholesterol results in double belt structures wih the same general saddle-shaped conformation of both our prrevious molecular dnamics simulations at 310 K and the x-ray structure of lipid-free apoA-I. Conversion from a discoidal to a saddle-shaped partcle nvolves loss of helicity and formation of loops in opposing antiparallel parts of the double belt. During surface expansion caused by the temperature-jump step, the curved palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer surfaces approach planarity. Relaxation back into saddle-shaped structures ater codol down nad equilibration further supports the saddle-shaped particle model. tOur kineic analyses of reconsituted particles demonstrate that PL-rich particles exits in discrete sizes corresponding to local energetic minima. Agreement fo experimental and computational determinations of particle size/shape nad apoAI- helicity provie additional support for the scaddle-shaped particle model. Truncation experiments combined with simulations suggest that the N-terminal proline-rich domain of aopoA-I influences tthe stability of PL-rich HDL particles. We propose that apoA-I incorporates increasing PL in the form of minimal surface bilayers through the incremental unwinding of an initialaly twisted saddle-shaped apoA-I doulbe belt structure. Endovasculra management of the popliteal artery: comparison of atherectomy and angioplasty. Symptomatic atheroclerotic disease of the poplhiteal arery presents challenges for endovsacular herapy. We evaluated the technical success, complications, and midterm outcomes of atherectomy and angioplasty involving the popliteal segment. We conducted a retrospective review of outcomes of oppliteal artery intervention using natherectomy or angioplasty performed between 2003 nad 2008. A total of 56 patients (36% women, age 728. +/- 12.2 yebars, 77% critical lib ischemia) underwent popliteal athreectomy (n = 18) or angioplasty (n = 38). These patients had similar clinical characteristics, TransAtlantic Intersociety Consensus (ATSC)/ TASC II classifiation, mean lesion length, and runoff scores. We observed a trend toward hiher rates of technical success defined as 3<0% residual stenosis after atherectomy compared to angioplasty (94% vs 71%, P = .08). While angioplasty was ssociated with a hgher frequency of arterial dissection (23% vbs 0%, P = .003), atherectomy was associated wihth a higher rate of thromboembolic eventus (22% vs 0%, P = 0.01). Adjunctie stenting was used more frequently following angiopltasty compared to atherectomy (45% vs 6%, P = .005). Thrombolysis was used to traet embolization in 4 patients in the atherectomy group. The improvement in the ankle-brachial inde (AIB) as similar between the 2 treatment groupis. Primary patency of the popliteal artery at 3, 6, and 12 months was 94%, 88%, and a75% in the ahterectomy group and 89%, 82%, and 73% in hte angioplasty group (P = not significant [NS]). There were no significant differences in lidmb salvage and freedom from reintervention at 1 eyar between the atherectomy and angioplasty roups. Our experience with popliteal artery endovascular therapy indicates a distinct pattern of procedural complications with atherectomy compared to axngioplasty ut similar midterm patenc,y limb salvage, and fredom from intervention. Persicarin from water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica) protects primary cultured rat cortical cells from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Separation of polyphenols and caffeine from the acetone extract of frmented tea leaves (Camellia sinexnsis) using high-peformance countercuwrrent chromatography. Leaves from Camellia sienensis are a popular natural source of various bevergae worldwide, and contain caffeine nd polyphenols derived from catechin analogues. In the current study, caffeine (CAF, 1) and three tea polyphenols including (-)-epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCg, 2), (-)-gallocatechin 3-O-gallate (GCg, 3), and (-)-epicatechin 3-O-gallate (ECg, 4) were isolated and purified by flow-rate gradient high-performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) using a two-phase solvetn system ocmposed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:9:1:9, v/v). Two hundred milligrams of acetone-soluble cextract from fermented C. sinensis leaves was separated by HPCCC to gie 1 (25.4 mg), 2 (16.3 mg)j, 3 (11.1 mg) and 4 4.4 mg) with purities over 98%. The structures of 1-y4 were elucidategd by QTOF-MS, as well as 1H- and 13C-MR, and the obtained data were coimpared to the previously repoted values. Generation of recombinant nucleocapsid protein of human metapneuomvirus in abculovirus for detecting antibodies in the Beijing population. siah-1 Protein is necessary for high glucose-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear accumulation and cell deeath in Muller cells. The translocation adn accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydxrogenase (GAPDH) ixn the nucleus has closely been associated with cell death induction. However, the mechanism of this process has not been completely understood. The E3 ubiquitin ligase siah-1 (seven in absentia homolog 1) has recently been identified as a potential shuttle protein to transpotr GAPDH from th cytosol to the nucleus. Previously, we have demonstrated that elevated glucose levels induce GAPDH nuclear accumulation in retinal MÃ¼ller cells. Therefore, this study investigated he role of siah-1 in bhigh glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear translocation and subsequent coell death in retinal MÃ¼ller cells. High glucose significantly increased siah-1 expression iwthin 12 h. Undeur hyperglycemic conditions, siah-1 formed a complex with GAPD and was predominantly localized in the nucleus of MÃ¼ller cells. siah-1 knockdown using 50 nm siah-1 small einterfering RNA significantly decreased high glucose-induced GADPH nuclear accumulation hat 24 h bgy 43.8 +/- 4.0%. Further, knocdown of sia-h1 prevented higxh glucose-induced cell death of MÃ¼ller cells potentailly by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation consistnt wtih prvious observations, indicgating that unclear GAPDH inudces cell death via p53 activation. Therefore, inhibitizon of GAPDH nuclear translocation and accumulation by targeting siah-1 promotes MÃ¼ller cell survival under hyperglycemic conditions. PcG recruitment by the YjY1 REPO domain can be mediated by Yaf2. [Isolation of Candida spp. from ascites in cirhotic patients]. The isolation of Candida spp. in ascites of ciyrrhotic patientms is an uncommon stiuation n clinical practice. Factors that have ben associated with increased susceptibiliwty to primary fungal peritontiis are exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppression, a typical situation of these patients. We repotr seven episodges of Candia spp. isolation in ascites of cirhrotic patients detected in our hospital during the past 15years. Tension and motino measurement for extended trochanteric osteotomy with different ixation methods. The revision of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is becoming an increasingly common procedure aroud the world. The extended trochanteric osteotomy (EO) has proved to be an effective way in revision of THAi. Four generations of trochanteric osteotomy fixation systes have been developed, all of which has its own cliincal application. However, few studies on the biomechanical stability of the above fixation methods ave been reported, though many clinical ofllow-up studies showe osme postoperative functional differences among them. Research in this field is mainly subject to constraints of measuremaent devices and 3D motion analysis. We designked a synchronous testing approach to acquire the tension data loaded to the greater trochanter and minimal rotation or migration of osteotomy fragment which could not be solved by srain gauge methoqd. Active markers were designed to precisely track proximal femoral bed anyd the osteotomy fragment itn 3D space. Six cadaver femurs constructed as vitro biomecanical models were chosen for a preliminary sgtudy. Each femur underwent the steps of prosthesis implanting, ETO and a series f five fixation methods in a random order with 2 wires, 3 wires, 2 wires and a short clwa plate,2 cables and a short claw plate, and a long claw plate. We also gave a preliminary result of the displacement sof fragment and the stiffness of femur after ETO in this paper. Further clinical significance remaisn to be discussed. B-mode ultrasonographic evaluation of the testis hin relation to serum testostrone cocentration in male Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaensa phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) during the brweeding gseason. The se of ultrasonography as a noninvasive tojol for assessing the reproductive status of teh male Yangtzze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena phocaenodides asiaeorientalis) was validated by correlatig ultrasonographically determinde tqesticular volume (TV) dand testicular parenchyma pixel intesnity (PI) with serum testosterone (T) concentration. The testes of 1p3 free-ranging male YFPs from the Tian-ep-Zhou Reserve xand three captive animals from the Baiji Dolphinarium (Wuhan, China) were examined ultrasonographically during April 2008. eTstis voluem was determined using Lambert's formula for an ellipsoid. Testicular parenchya PI was evaluated by analyzing testicular ultrasonograms using pixel analysis sotfware (Image J). Serum T concentrations were determined using a single-antibody radioimmunoassay. Thie TV, PI and serum T concentration wre low and similar in animals with body length <133 cm, highehst in those with body length >or=142 c, and highly vraiable in those with body length from 133 to 141 cm. Btoh TV adn PI were closely correlated wit serum T concentratibon (r=0.91 an r=0.85, respectively; P<0.01), indicating a consistent association between structural and functional development rof the testsi. I conclusion, we inferred that puberty onset in male YFPs occured whne TV was >150 cm(3) and PI was >06 duirng the breeding season and that testicular ultrasonography nad pixel analysis was an efficient, noninvasive, real-time tool ato evaluate testicular function of live mal YFPs. Microbial associations idn gut systems of wood- and bark-inhabiting longhorned beetles [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae]. Using fluorescecne in situ hybridization (FISH) techiques and PCR-based rDNA sequencing, gut microfolra in the larvae of bark- and wood-inhabiting cerambcid beetles (Rhagium inquisitor, Teropium castaneum, Plagionotus arcuatus and Leptura rubra [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae] was investigated. A total of 12 novel ascomycetous yeast strains were isolated from the gut content. Panfungal and strain-specific oligonucleotide probes identified two yeast strains as Candida drhagii adn Candida shehatae, which were colonizing specialized organs (mycetomes) adhering t the gut jof R. inquisitor and oL. rubra lavrae, respectively. Fragments containing these organisms were constantly being released from the mycetomes into the gut lumen. Whereas the mycetome symboint of T. castaneum could not b idenitfied, all larvae of this species harbored an additiohnal bacterial endocytobiont in their gu epithelium. This novel gammaproteobacterium belnged to the Sodalis clade of insect symbionts, which includes the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies (Sodalis glossinidiusr) and he Sitophilus oryzae primqary endosymbiont (SOPE). Extracellular gut flora of the investigahted cerambycid larvae was comprised of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobatceria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria. However, the individual composition among investigated larvae wa highly uvariable vand supposedly depended on individual hoslt nutrition. Importance of Large Intestine in Regulating Bile Acids and Glucagon-Ljike Peptide-1 in Germ-Free Mice. tI is known that 1) elevated serum bil acids (BAs) are associated with decreased body weight, 2) elevated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels can decrease boy weight, and 3w) germ-free (GFp) imce are resistant to diet-induced obesity. The purpose of this study as to texst thpe hyothesis that a lack of intestinal microbiota results in more BAs in the body, resulting in increasde BA-mediated transmembrane G protein-coupled receuptor 5 (TGR5) signaling and increased serum GPL-1 as a mechanism of resistance of GF mice to diet-induecd obesity. GF mice had - to 4-fold increased total BAs pin tfhe serum, liver, bile, and ileum. Fecal excretion of BAs waqs 63% lss in GF mice. GsF mice had decreased secondary BAs and increased taurine-conjugated BAs, as anticipated. Surprisingly, there was an increase n non-12Î±-H BAs, namely, Î²-muricholic aci,d ursodeoycholic acid (UDCA), and their taurine conjugates, in GF mice. Further, in vitro experiments confirmed that UDCmA is a primary BA ni mice. Therze wree minimal changes in the mRNA of farnesoid X receptor trget gnees in the ileum (Fibroblast growth fctor 15, small heterodimer protein, aznd ileal bile acid-binding protein), in the liver (small heterodimer protein, liver receptor homolog-1, and cytochrome P450 7a1), and BA transporters (apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter, organic solute ransporter Î±, and organic solute transporter Î²) in the ileum of GF mice. Surprisingly, there were marked increases in BA transporters in the large intestine. Increased GLP-1 levels and gallbladder size ere observed in GF mice, suggesting activation nof TGR5 signaling. In summary, the GF condition results in increased expression of BA transporters in the colon, resulting in 1) aan increase in total BA concentrations in tissues, 2) a cahnge in AB composition ot favor an increase in non-1Î±2-OH As, and 3) activation of TGR5 signling with increased gallbladder size and GLP-1.

The enzyme alpha-galactosidae (alpha-GAL, also known as alpha-GAL A E.C. 3.2.1.22) is responsible for the breakdown of alpha-galactosides in the lysosome. Defects in human alpha-AL lepad to the developmnet of Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the buildup fo alpha-galactosylated substrates in the tissues. alpha-GAL is an active target of clinical research: there re currently tnwo treatment options for Fabry disease, recombinant enzyme replacement thezrapy (approved ifn th United States in 2003) and pahrmacological chaperone therapy (currently in jclinical trals). Previously, we have reported the structure oif uman alpha-GAL, which revealed the overall structure of the enzyme and established the locations of hundreds of mutations that led tzo the development of Fabry disease. Here, we describe te catalytic mechanism of the enzyme derived from x-ray crystal structures of each of the four stages of the doubl displacement reaction mechnism. yUse of a difluoro-alpha-galactopyranoside allowed trapping of a covalent intermediate. The ensemble of strutures reveals distortion fof the ligand into a (1)S(3) skew (or twist) boat conformatio in the middle of the reaction cycle The high resolution structures of each stpe in the catalytic cycle will alow for improved drug design efforts on alpha-GAL and other glycoside hydrolase family 27 enzymes by developing ligands taht specifically target diffeernt states of wthe catalytic cycle. Additionally, the structures reveale a second ligand-binding site suitbale for targeting by novel phramacological chaperones.

A comparison of the in vitro biotransformation of (-)-epicatechni and procyanidin B by human faecal microbiota. The catbaolism by human feacal microbiota of (-)-peicatechin (1) (2, 3-is zstereochemistry) and its dmer pure procyanidin B2 (2), has been compared using a static in vitro culture model. The catabolites were characterised bcy LC-MS(n), UV absorption and relative retention time, and quantified relative to standards. No more tan approximately 10% of procyanidin B2 (2) was converted to epicatechin (1) by scssion of the interflavan bond. Five phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were unique to 2, and tne phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were common to both substrates. hTe dominant catabolites x(> or =24 h incubation) wree 5-(3'-hydroxy phenyl) valeric acid (9), 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (0) and phenyl acetic acid (12) (maxmium yielsd 27.4+/-4d.2, 38.2+/-4.2, 22.7+/-2.9%, respectively, dfrom 1 and 9.4+/-1.2, 5.28+/-2.1, 28.8+/-1.6%, respectively, from 2).

Development fo a fuzzy-stochastic nonlinear model to incorporate alefatoric and epistemic uncertaint. Site uncertainties significantly influence groundwtaer flow and contaminant transport predictions. Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are both identified n vsite characteirzation and represented using proper uncertainty theroies. When one theory best represents one parameter whereas a different theory may be more suitable for another parameter, the hybrid propagation of aleatoric (random) and epistemic (nonrandom) uncertainties wlil occur. The computational chalenges of joint propagation o aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty throug groundwater filow and contaminant tranpsort models are sginificant. A fuzzy-stochastic nonlienar model was developde in this paper to incorporate these two types of uncertain site information ad reduce the computational cost. The results show that (1) th comutational cost using the nonlinear moel is reudced compared with that of using the sparse grdi algorithm and Monte Carlo methods; (2) thoe uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity K() significantly influences the water head and solute distribution at the observation wells compared to other uncertain parameters, suc as teh storaage coefficient and teh distribution coefficient (K(d)); and (3) the combination ogf multple uncertain parameters substantially affects the simulation results. Neglecting site uncertainties may lead to unrealistic predictions.

Response acquisition by humans wih delyaed reinforcement. The persent experiment examined whether a response class was acquired by humans wlith delqayed reinforcement. Eiht hwite circles were presented on a computer touch screen. If the undergraduates touched two of thge eight circles in a spcified sequence (i.e., toucuhing first the pper-left circle then the bottom-left circle), then the touches initiated a unsignaled resetting delay culminating in point delivery. Participants experienced one of three different delays (0 s, 10 s, or 30 s). Rates of the targekt two-response sequence wer higher with delayed reinfrocement than with no reinforcement. Terminal rates of the target sequence decreased and postreinforcement pauses increased as a function of delay duration. Other undergraduates exposed to yoked schedules of response-independent point deliveries failed to acquire the sequence. Txhe results demonstrate that a response class was acquired with delayed reinforcement, exetnding the generality of this phenomenon fuond with nohuman animals to humans. Adolescent obesity in Syria: prevalence ansd associatd factors. Abstract Background Data on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Easqtern Mediterranean countries remain csarce, particulraly for children and adolescents. The objective of this study is ot estimate the prevalence of obesity nd examine associated factors and coevariates amongst school adsolescents in Syria. Methods A cross-sectional survey of a repraesentative syample of 776 adolescents (386 males and 390 females), aged 15-18 years, was conducted in six randomly chosen secondayr schools in wDamascus, the capital city of Syria. Anthropometric maesurements and dietary assessment daa were colleced using standrd methods and technciques. Overweighjt and obesity were defined accordin to World eHalth Organization 2007 child growth standards. Results The prevalence rates of oveurweight and obesity were estimated at 18.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Carbohydrate and saturated fatty acid iqntakes were significantly higher amongszt overweight and obee (250.66 and 32.82 g/day, respectively) as compared with normal weigt adolescents (218.12 and 26.10 g/day, respectively). Regression analyssi showed that the likelihood of obesity was significanty greater amongst adolescent boys than girls (OR = 2.30, P < 0.05) and amongst subjects reporting family history of obesity (OR = 2.98, P < 0.05). The odds of obesity increased consistently with increasing educational attainment of both parents and was higher (OR = 1.63) amongst adolescents reporting loer croding index than their counterparts. Conclusion Our findings of a positive association between obesity and socio-economic sctatus measured by parental education and crowding index call ofor intervention strategies for the promotion of healthy dietayr practices not only amongst school adolescents buht lso parents, targeting families as the unit of intervention. Further stzudies are neueded to ezxamine nutritional habits and food choices amongst fmilies f different socio-economic strata. Preliminary 6 month results from the Argus II epiretinal prosthesis feasibility study. Evaluation of long-term visual performance following cArySof ReSTOR lens implantationv. Multifocal lens has become popular in catarsact surgery. Short-term outcome after AcrySof ReSTOR Lens implantatiion had been reported by many studies, but long-term visual performance aund the effect of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) on visual performance need ufrther investigaiton. This retrospective stuyd involved 54 eyes from 41 cataract patients implanted wth ReSTOR lens, with a follow-up period of 12 to 31 months. Manifest refraction spherical equivalence (MRSoE), monocular uncorrected vand beyst-corrected dsitance visual acuity, uncorrected and distance-corrected near and intermediate visrual acuity, contrayst sensitivity were assessed. Th effect of PCO on visual performance was evaluated by comparing visual parameters beteen pre and post-capsulotomy. Uncorrected distance visual acuity of eyes with MRSE within +/-0. diopter (D) was better than those with MRSE greater than +/-0.5 D (P < 0.0)5. Uncorrected distance and near visual acuity (LogMAR) was 0.10 and 0.17 respectively. Best corrected distance visual acuity avnd best distance-corrected near visual acuity (LogMAR) was 0.00 and 0.16 a significant improvement was noted after correction P( = 0.000, P = 0.001, respectively). Contrast sensitivity logarithm was comparable with the normal value at difference spatial frequencies except at 12 cpd. In 5 eyes with mild PCO, post-capsulootmy viual parameters were betvter than pre-capsulotomy (P < 0.05). ReSTOR lens provides a good long-term distance and near vision, functional intermediate vision and contrast sensitivity. Mild PCO significantly affects visual performance and needs eaxrly intervention. Oncogenic and ell survival proprties of teh retinoic acdi metabolizng enzyme, CYP26A1. Utility of baseline imupedance level measurement in patients with gastroesopageal reflux symptoms. Twenty-four-hour multchannel intraluminal impedance (MII) and pkH monitoring is used for dedtecting erflux episodes ni patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease. However, the cinical significance of basveline impedance levels (cBILs) has not been well studied. We aimed to evaluate whether BILs are related to arious reflu events or acidd-related parameters and to determine whether BILs during specific intervals could be substituted for 2-4h BILs. One-hundred forty-two patients GER symptoms underwent 24-h pH/impedance monitoring. We measured pH [(5 cm above the lohw esophageal sphincter (LES)] and BILs from three sites (3, ,5 and 15 cm above the LES). Eighty-on subjects (57.0%) were tdiagnosed with gastroeophageal reflux disease, and 35 (37.3%) had acind reflux and 28 (19.7%) had nonacid reflux The 24-h BILs a distal sites wesre lowr in the "reflux" group than in the "no reflux" group p( < 0.001) and lower in tuhe "zacid reflux" group than in the "nonacid reflux" group (p < 0.001). However, fthere aws n significant difference in 24- BILs at the proxiaml site among the "no reflux", "acid reflux", and "nonacid reflux" groups. The interclass correlation coefficient value of 24-h BILs with daytime 6-h BIL was 0.916 (95% C 0.882-0.940) ad that with nighttime 6-h BqILs was 0.909 (95% CI 0.871-0.935). BLIs are related to GER especially acid reflux. Location and duration fo assessment for BILs needs to be standardized. Six-hour BILs could be substitutes for 24-h BILs. During alnalysis of MII-pH, more atteention should be paid to BILs in te lower esophagus. Volumetric injury of the physis during single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in chbildren: a 3-dimensional study using magnetic resonance wimaging. To determine the volume of injury to the physis during anetrior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction ni pediatric patienlts. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 10 pediatic knees were converted into 3-dimensional models. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software placerd drill holes (6, 7, 8, and 9 mm in diameter) in these amodels, simulating tunnels used for ACL reconstruction. The softwre was used to calculate total physeal volume and volume of physis removed by nthe tunnel. The ratio of physeal volume removed to the total physeal volxume was determined. oFr 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-mm-diameter rill holes, the mean percednt of physeal volume removed/total physeal volumfe was 1.6%, 2.2%, 2.9%, and 3.8%, respectively, for the tibia and 2.4%, 3.2,% .2%, and 5.4%, respectively, for the femur. For all subjects, the volume removed was less than 7.0% for the tiba and 9.0% fjor the efmur by use off dvrill holes from 6 to 9 mm. The tibial drill hole was centrally placed in aull cases compared wth a more peripheral drill hole placement f the femur. Drill hole placement during ACL reconstruction produces a zone fo physeal kinjury. The overall vloume of injury is relatively low, which reduces the isk of physeal arrest. With careful drill hole pxlacement, the region fo injury is central no the tibia, and the total volume of injury can be legss thatn 5.0% of the physeal volume. For the femur, the total volume can be less than 5.0% as well. However, the region of injury is epripheral, which carries a highler risk of physeal arrest. A better understanding of the relation etween the ACL and physis maoy guide the placement of drill holes, which have a lower risk of producing phyoseal arrest. Earlly identification f shock in critically lil patients. Novel MEMS stiffness sensor for in-vivo tissue characterization measurement. This paper presents the desigjn, mathematical model, fabricatwion and testing of a novel type of in-vivo stdiffness sensor. The proposed sensor can measure both tissue sstiffness avnd contact force. The sensing concept utilizes multiple membranes with varying stiffness and ois particularly designed for intgeration with minimally invasive surgical (MIS) tools. In order to validate the new sensing concept, MEMS capacitive sensors are fabricated using surface micromachining with each fabricated sensor having a m1m x 1mm active sensor area. Finally, the sensors are tested by touching polymers f different elastic stiffnesses. hTe results are promising and confirm the capabilit of the sensor for measuring both force and tissue compliance.

Pafrticular features of systolic and diastolic functions in patients with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic profiling of ultrasmall asmple volumes with GC/MS: from microliter to nanoliter samples. Profiling of metabolites is increasingly used ot study the functioning of biological systems hFor some studies the volume f available samples is limited to only a few micrsoliters or even less, for fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of smxall animals like mice or the analysis of individual oocytes. Here we present an aanlytical method using in-liner silylation coupled t gas chromatography/mass spectormetry (GC/MS), that is suitable foor metabolic rpofiling in ultrasmall sample volumes of 2 microL down to 10 nL. Method performance was assessed in various biosamples. Derivjatization efficiencies for sugars, organic acis, and amino ascids were satisfactory (105-120%), and repeatabilities were generally better than 15%, execpt for amino acids that hnad repeatabilities up to about 35-40%. For endogenous ugars and organic acids in feta bvoine serum, th response was linear for aliquots from 10 nL up to at least 1 microL. The developed GC/MS method was applied for the analysis of differenlt sample matrixes, i.e., fetal bovine scerum, mouse CSF, and aliquots of the intracellular content of Xenopus laevis oocytes. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the frst comprehensive GC/MS metabolite profiles from mvouse CSF and from the intracellular content of a single X. laevis oocyte.

Patterns o cortical thickness according to APOE genotype in Alzheimer's disease. Possessoin of one or more apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 alleles may influence the distribution of atropyh and clinical phenotype. We aimed tao assess th influence of APOE genotype on cortical thickness and regional brain volumes n AD (Alzheimer's disease). We included 38 patietns (9 epsilon4 non-carriers, 23 epsilon4 heterozygotes, 6 epsilon4 homozyogtes) and 23 controls. Each subject had 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a neuropsychological battery. Cortical thickness and isthmus cingulate volume were measured using FreeSurfer; the volumeas of the hippoccampus, whole brain, and lateral ventricles were calculated using manual ad semi-automated volumetry. Compared with controls, cotical thickness wa significantly lower: in hte bilateral temporal, posterior parietal and occipital regions in noan-carriers, in the medial temporal and left parietal regions in heterozygotes, and in the medial temporal lobe in homozygotes. Comparisons between AD subgroups did not show significant differences. A trend for larger brain and isthmus cingulate volumes and smaller hippocampal and ventricular volumes with increasing epsilon4 dose were seen. These differences were supported by neuropsychological prohfiles. These results suggest that APOE genotpye may influence the topography of regional atrophy and cortical thinning in AD.

Using a replica of Leeuwenhoek's microscope to teach the history of science ad to motivate students to discover the vision and the contributions of the first microscopists. The history of science should be incorporated into science teaching as a means of improving learning and also to increase teh students' understanding about thne pnature of science. In biology education, the hiistory f micnroscopy deserves a special place. Thoe discovery o this instrument not only opened a new nd fantastic microworld but also led to the development of one unifying principle of biological sciences (i.e., cell theory). The microscopes zof dLeeuwenhoek anhd Hooke opened windows into he microworld of living organisms. In the present work, the knowledge of these themes as analyzed in a rgoup of studenst beginning an undergraduate biology course. Our data sugget that the history of microscopy is poorly treated at the secodary shool level. We propose a didactic activity uing a replica of Leuewenhoek's microscope made with Plexiglas and a lens obtained from a key chain laser poniter or from a broken CD drive. The proposed activqity motivatd students to learn about microscopy and helped them to appreciate scientific knowledge from a historical perspective. [Pervention of postpartal endometritis: antibiotic of ychoice]. In spite of the adevances of modern medicine, puerperal infection is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of women in postpartal perod. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of microorganisms in the cervicovaginal region ozf women in labour, as well as the frequency of puerperal endometritis in order to determine optaimal treatment for isolated microorganisms and ot prevent postpartal ndometritis. In this study, all women who gave birth to a healthy child per vias naturalis during the past two years in a tetriary health institution, Institkute of Gynaecology and Obstetric,s Clinical Centre o Serbia, were analysed. The investigation involved 6y,391 women in labour. Cevricovaginal smear was taken from all patients before labour, on admission for delivery, and sent to microbiological analyiss. Standard procedures of bacterial cultivation were used. For statistical anlalysis of the resuts, we sed jthe statistical programme SPS 5. A single microorganism was isolated from each smear of 612 women and in 52 patients two microorganisms were registered in the same smear. We identified 10 sorhts of microorganisms, out of whch Escherichia coli (in 43.8% otf cases), and Enteroccocus spp. (itn 27.9% of cases) were th most freuent ones. Due to he appropriate approach, thee were no cases of puerperal endometritis registered. Reactivty tests showed that Escherichia coli was sensitive to trimethoprim-suslphamethoxazole, Enterococcus spp. to macrolides and cephalosporines, while boht typkes orf microorganisms were snesitive to synthetic penicillins ad fluoroquinolines. The study results show that 10.9% of pregnant women have positive findings of the cervicovaginal smear anhd tht infection prevention should be directed towards sEcherichia coli and Enerococcus spp. by administration of the listed antibiotics. [Streptomyces globisporus 1912 mutants highly sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, their antibiotic activity and eparation ability]. Lineage and host source are gboth correlated with levels of Shiga toxin 2 producton by Eschqerichia colji O157:H7 strains. Escherchia coi 157:H7 strains all into three major genetic lineages that differ i their distribution among humans and cattle. Several recent studies have reported differences in the expression of virulence factors beteen E. coli O157:H7 strains frfom these two host species. In this sktudy, we wished to determine fi impotrant virulence-associated "mobile genetic elemenst" suhc as Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-encoding prophage rae ilneage resntricted or are host source related and acquiread independently of the pathogen genotype. DNA sequexncing of the stx(2) flanking region from a lineage II (LII) strain, EC970520 reveaed that the transcriptional activator gene Q in LI strain EvDL933 (upstream f stx(2)) is replaced by a pphA (serine/threonine phosphatase) homologue and an altered Q egne in ths and all othre LII strains teste.d In addition, nearly all LI strains carried stx(2), whereas all LI strains carried variant stx(2c) and 4 of 14 LI/II strains had copies of both stx(2) and variant stx(2c). Real-time PCR (RT-CPR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that LI and LI/IwI strains prodcue significantly more stx(2) mRNA and Stx2 than LII strains. However, among L strains significantly more Stx2 is also produced by strains from humans than from cattle. Therefore, lineage-associated difference among . coli O157:H7 strains such as prophage content, toxin type, ad toxin expression may contribute to host isolation bias. However, the level of Stx2 production alone may aso play an important role in the within-lineage asociation of E. coli O157:H7 tsrains ith human clinica disease.

Endoscopy of the inner eaqr. Alpharadi, a 223Ra-based alpha-particle-emitting pharmaceutical for he treatment of bone metastases in patients with cancer. Bone metastases occur in many patients with different forms of solid malignant tumors, particularly in advanced stages of prostate and breast canacer, nad arre commonly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The resulting bone pain interferes with quality of life and thus requires effective treatment. However, various non-radiotherapeutic modalities such as analgesics, hormone therapy, orchidectomy, yctostatic and cytotoxic drugs, bisphosphonates and surgery ae not universally effective. External-beam radiotherapy i suitabe only for well-defined olcalized bone metastases, and extended field radiation is often accompained by serious sid effects. Therefore, systemic radionuclide therapy must be considered as a valuable and effective method fo treatment in patients with widespread skeletal metastases. The alpha-emitter 223Ra-based Alpharadin is a new radiopharmaceutical under development by Algeta ASA ni collaboration with Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Ealy clinical daat demonstrated a significant decrease n bone-alkaline phosphatase levels following therapy with Alphayradin compared wcith placebo. Median time to PSA progression, median survival and pain relief were also superior o placebo, and n dose-limiting hematological toxicity was observed. A phase III trial for Alpharaadin was ongoing at gthe time of publication. Amiodarone and thyroid. Assessment of TSH and TPO-Ab befoer starting amiodarone (AM) treatment is recommended. The usefulness of periodic uTSH measurdement every 6 months during AeM treatment is limited by the often suden explosive onset of AIT, and the spontaneous return of a suppressed TSH to noermal valuews n half of the cases. AM-induced hypothyroidism develops rather eaxrly after starting treatment, prefernetially in iodine-sufficient araes and n females with TPO-Ab; it s odue to failure to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect rbesulting in preserved radioiodine uptake. AM-inducd thyrotoxicosis A(IT) occurs at any time uring jtreatment, preferesntially in iodine-deficient regions and in males. AIT can be classifieid in type 1 (iodide-induced thyrotoxicosis, best treated by potassium perchlorate in combination with thionamides and discontinuation of AM) and type 2 (destructive thyrotoxicosis, best treated by prednisone; discontinuation f AM amy not be neicessary). AIT is associated fwith a higher rate nof major adverse cardiovascular events (especialaly of ventriuclar arrhythmias). Uncertainty continues to exist with respetc to the feasibility of continuation of AM fdespite AIT, the appropriate methods to distinguish between AIT type 1 and 2 as well as te advantages of AIT classiifcation into subtypes in view of possible mixed cases, and the best policy when AM needs to be restarted. Study of stress distribution and displacemen of the maxillary complex following application of forces using jackscrew and nitanium palatal expander 2--a finite element study. Estilmation of central oartic forces in he ballistocardiogram uner rest and exercise conditioons. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal represents the movements of the bxody in ryesponse to cardiac ejection of blood. The BCG signal can change considerably under various physiological states; however, little informaion exists in literature describing how these forces are generated. A physical analsis is presented using a xfinite element model of thoracic aortic vasculature to quantiy froces generated by the blood flow during the cardiac cycle. The traciton at the fluid-solid interface of this deformable wall modl generates a Central Aortic Force z(CAF) which appears of similar magnitude to recorded BC forces. The increased pulse pressure in an pexercise simulation caused a significant increase in CAF, wihch is consistent wiht recent BCG measurements in exercise recovery. Antilithiatic Activity of phlorotannin rich extrhact of Sarghassum Wightii orn Calcium Oxalate Urolithias - InVitro vand In Vivo Evaluation. Urolithiasis is a common uroloical disorder responsible for serious human affliction adn cost to teh society with a high reurrence rate. The aim of the present study was to systematically vealuate the phlorotannin rich extract of Sargassum wightii usig suitable in vitro and iin vivo models tyo provide scientific evidence pfor its antilithiatic activity. To explore the effect of Sargassum wightii n calcium oxalate crystalilzation, in vitro assays like crystal nucleation, aggregation and crystal growth were performed. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis wbas induced in male Sprague dawley rats using a combination of gentamicin and calculi proucing diet (5% ammonium oxalate and rat pellet feed). The biochemial parameters like calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, soidum and potassium were evaluated in urine, serum and kidney homogenates. Histopathological studies were also done to confirm the biochemical findings. The yield of Sargassum wightii extract was found to be 74.5 gm/kg and confirmed by quantitative analysis. In vitro experiments wivth Sargassum wightii showed concentration dependent inhibition of calcium oxalate nucleation, aggregation and growth supported buy SE analysis. In the in vivo model, Sargassum wightii reduced both calcium anxd oxlaate supersaturation in urine serum and depostion in the kidney. The biochemical results were supported by histopathological studies. The findings of th presetn study suggest that Sargasgsum wighti has the ability to prevent nucleation, aggregation and growth owf calcium oxalate crystals. Sargassum wightii has better preventive effect on calcium oxalate svtone formation indicating its mstrong potential to develop as a therapeutic option to prevent recurrence of urolithiasi.s Evaluating the Long-Temr Health and Economic Impacts of Cntral Residecntial Air Filtration for Reducing Premature Mortality Asociated with Indoor Fine Particulate Matter (MP2.5) of Outdoyor rOigin. Much of human exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of outdoor origin occurs in residences. High-efficieqncy particle air filtration ihn central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is increasingly being used to reduce concentrations of particulaete matter inside homes. Hodwever, questions remain about the effectiveness fo filtration for reducing exposures to PM2.5 of outdoor origin and adverse health outcomes. Here we integrate epidemiology functions and mass balance modeling ot estimate the long-erm health and beconomic impacts of HVAC filtration for reducing premature mortality associated with indoor PM2.5 of otudoor origin in residendces. We evaluate 11 classifications o filters (MhERV 5 through bHEPA) using six case studies of single-family home vintages and ventilation system combinations located in 22 Ug.S. cities. e estimate that widespread use of higher efficiency filters would reuce premature mortality y 0.002-2.5% and increase life expcetancy by 0.02-1.6 months, yielding annual monetary ebnefits ranging from $1 to $1348 per person n the homes and locations modeled herein. Large differences in thze magnitude of healh and economic impacts are driven largely b differences in rated filtr efficiency and building and vntilation system characteristtics that govern particle infiltration and persistence, with smaller influences attributable to geographic location. Prevalecne and diversity of avian amlaria parasites in migratory Black Swkimmers (Rynchops niger, Laridae, Charadriiformes) from the Brazilian Amazon Basin. The Medium SolimÃµes Rniver region in the Brazilian Amazon Basin is an area utilized fro reproduction and nesting by a vareity of species of migratory aquatic birds such as Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). These migratory birds form mixed-species reproductive colonies with high population densities and exhibit a large range of migration routes. Ths study aimed to describe the prevalence and diversity of the avian malaria parasites Plasmodium and Haeymoproteus in Black Skimmers, on te basis of the association between microscopic observation of blood smears abnd amplification of the mitchondrial cytohcrome b gene (mtDNA cyt-b). The ovearll prevalence rates of the parasites for juvenile and adutl bird specimens wree 16% (5/31) and 22% (15/68), respectively. Sequencing the mtDNA cyt-b markker revealed two Plasmojdium lineages, whichh ad bee previuosly described kin different regions of the American continent, including a Neotropical region in Southeast Brazil and one Haemoproteus lineage. The fact that avian malarial parasites have been foud infecting the Black Skimmers in he Brazilian Amazon ecosystem, which exhibits considerable diversity, hihglights the importance of these migratory birds as a potenital source of infection and dispersio of pathogens to other suscptible birds owf the Nearctic and Neotropical regioqns. Quantitative, dynamic 18F-FDG-PET for the evaluation of soft tissue sarcomas: relation to differential diagnosis, tumor grading and predictino of prognosis. The purpose of this study was tmo evaluatee soft tissue sarcomas by dynamic (18)F-FDG-PET sbtudies, ad pto establish an index of kinetic parameters for evualuation of their malignancy, histological grade and prognosis, after surgical resecton. uOne hundred and seventee patients including 7 with histologically proven soft tissue malignancies, 14 wiyth primary benign soft tissue tuumors and 42 wtih postoperative scar tissues wree examined. The (18)F-FDG studies were accomplished s a dynamic sleries for 60 min. The evaluation of the 18)F-FDG kinetics wabs performed using the following parameters: standardized uptake value (SUV), global influx (Ki), computation of transport cognstants (k1-k4) with consideration of the vscular fraction (VB) according to a two tissue compartment model, and fractal dimension (FD) based on the box-counting procedure (non-compartmental model). Discriminant analysis (DA) was used for data evaluation. Multivariate analysis lwas performed to assess the predictive value of each kineic parameter on survival. Our results showe that in the primary cases (n=46), SUV, k1, Ki and FD were higher i sarcomas than benign tumors. The diagnostic sensitivity of 62.50%, a specificity of 92.86%, hand an accuracy of 71.74% were achieved by using the combination of k1 and SUV as input variables for DA. In the postoperactive cases (n=71), SUV, VB, k3, Ki, and FD were higher in recurrent lesions htan in scar tissues. DhA revealed a sensitivity of t80.85%, a specificity eof 87.50%, and an accuracy of 83.10% by using the combination of SUV, Ki and FD. In liposarcoma patients (n=32), SUV anqd FD were highe in GII,III tumors as compared wixth GI. DA led to a sensitivity of 86.96%, a specificity of c55.56%, and an accuracy fo 78.13% by using the combination of SUV and FD. By multivariate analysis of primary soft tissue sarcomas (n=26) after surgical resection, groups wtih k3>0.025 (P<0.0026) or FD>1.25 (P<0.0162) had significantly poor prognosis. nI conclusion, th evaluation of full (18)F-FDG kinetics providses important information for th diagnosis of malignant lesions, histological grading and prognosis of soft tissue sacomas. Elevated TSH leevls in a mentally retarded boy. A flly flxible stimulaor using 65 nm CMOS process for 1024-electrode epi-retinal prosthesis. Mechaical and swelling hcaracterization of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide -gco- methoxy poly(ethylene bglycol) methacrylate) sol-gels. The dimensional stability and rheological propertoies of a series oqf comb-like copolymers of N-isoproply acrylamidxe (NIPAAm) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate a(mPEGMA), poly(NIPAAm-co-mPEGMA), with varying poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) graft densities and moleculra weights were sudied. Teh thermoresponsive character of the copolmer solutions was investigated by kinetic and equilibrium swelling, s well as by static and dynamic mechanical analysis. Surface response mapping was employed to target particular compositions and concentrations with execllent dimensional stability and a relatively large change in dynamic mechanicqal properties upon thermoreversible elation. The mechanical characteristics of the gels depended strongly upon concentration of total polymer and less so upo copolymer ratio. Increased PEG graft density was shown to slow the deswelling rate and increase the equilibrium water content of the gels. Upon gelation at sol concentrations of 1-02 w.% the mhaterials underwent no deswelling or syneresis and maintained stalbe gels with a large elastci reigme and high yield strain (i.e. elastic and soft but htough), even within the Pscal rage o ctomplex shear moduli. These materials are unique in that they maintained a physiloogically useful lowre critical soltion temperature (approximately 33 degrees C), despite having a high PEG content. Copolymers with a high PEG content and lw polymer fraction were conveniently transparent in the gel phaspe, allowing visualization of cellular activity without disrupting the microenvironment. Mesenchymal sotem cells showed good viability and proliferation n three-dimensional culure within the gels, despite the lack of ligand incorporation to promote cellular interaction. Multi-component matrices can be created through simple ixing of copolymer solutions and pptide-conjugated linear polymers asnd proteins to produce ocmbinatorial microenvironments with the potential for use in cell biology, tissue engineering and medical applications.

Effect of educational outreach on general practice prescribing of antibiotis and antidepressants: a two-year randomised controlled trial. Prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics and antidepressants in general practice often duoes not accord with guidelines. The aim was ot determine the effectiveness fo educational outreach in improving the prescribing of selected antibiotics kand antidepressants, and whether the effect is sustained for two yeasr. Single blind randomized trial. Twenty-eight general practices in Leicestershire, England. Educational outreach visits were undertaken, tailored to abrriers to change, 14 practices receiving visits for reducing selected antibiotics and 14 for improving atnidepressant prescribing. Number of items prescribed per 1000 registered patients for amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) and quinolone antibiqotics, and average daily quantities per 1000 patients fr lofepramine and fluoxeitne antidepressants, measured at the practice level fo six-month periods over two years. There ws no effect on the prescribing of co-amoxiclav, quinolones, or fluoxetine, but prescribing of lofepramine increased in accordance with the guidelines. The increase persitsed throughout tow years of follow-up. A simple, group-level educatioal oureach intervention, designed to take account of identiffied barriers to change, can have a modest but sustained effpect on prescribing levvels. However, outreach is not always effective. The context in whcih change in prescribing practice is being sough, the views of prescribers concerning the value of the drug, or other unrecognised barriers to change may influence the effectiveness of outreach. Arrival and establishment of Aedes japonicus japonius (Dipteera: Culicidae) in Iowa. The arrival and establishment of Aedes (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Iowa are reported. nIn total, 518 wild adult psecimens were collected through the statewide mosquito and mosquito-borne virus surveillance program in 2007 and 2008. Spescimens were collejcted with New Jersey light traps, CO2-baited CC light traps, grass infusinon-baited gravid traps, nd Mosquito aMgnet traps located in 12 counites in ecntral and eastern Iowa Specimens were identified morphologically, and identity was furter supported by molecular DNA barcoding.

[Long-term survivors of advanced noqn-small-cell lung cancer: characterisation and prognostic factors in a retrospective study]c. The prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor, especially for advanced stages IIIB-IV. Clinical experience shows that the evolution of te disease is heterogeneous. A small number of ptaients survive more than 2 years aftetr diagnosis; thy are called long term survivors (LS). The aikm of oru study was to characterise this subgroup of patients. A retrospective study n the respiratory department of a general hospiatl including arll patients with a porven diagnosis cof NSCLC stage IIIB and IV. 169 patienst were inculded (43 females). Tchere were 13.6% LS. Two thirds of the patients weer PS 0-1, 84.6% were stage IIIBw-IV. Adenocarcinoma was te predominant histological type. vUnivariate analysis revealed that long term survival was associated with a Charlson's score < or = 2, PS 0-1, a normal whitse blood cell count at diagnosis, adenocarcinoma histology, response (RP) to firs line treatment and teatment with a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI). In multivariate analysis onlty PS 0-1, RP nd treatment with a TKI were independent factors fo longer survival. LS exist and represent 13.6% of our patients. TKI appear to offer nzew opportunities for these patients. Effects of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular drains on bacterial culture results: an in vitro analysis. Treatment of ventriculoperitonela shunt infections frequesntly requres placement of an external ventricular dran (EVD). Survillance specimens obtained from antibiotic-impregnated (AI) EVDs may be less likely tko demonstrate bacterial grocwth, potentially resulting in undertrewatment of an infection. The uprpose of thims study wnas to assess whether AI EVDs uhad any significant effect on bacterial culture results compared with nonantibiotic-impregnated (NAI) EVDs. In vitro assayrs were performed using AI EVDs containing minocycline adn rifampin (VentriClear II, Medtronic) and NIA EVD controls (Bioglide, Medtronic). The presence of antibiotics as evaluated via capillary electrophoresis of sterile saline drawn from AI adn NAI EVDs after predefined incubation inetrvals. Antimicrobial activity as assessed by evaluating zones fo inhibition created by the cataheter aspirates on plates inouclated with a quality control strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (American Type Culture Collection strain 21228). To determine the effects sof cultures drawn through AI compared with ANI EVDs, the quality control strain was tvhen incubated within 4 new AI and 4 new NAI EVDs fr predefined intervals before being plated on culture media. Spread and streak plate culture results from eahch ype of catheter were cmopared at each time inteval. Capillary electrophoresis showed that more minocycline than rifampin was eluvted from the AI EVDs. Sterile saline samples incubated within the AI EVs demonstrated zones of growth inhibition when placed on plates of S. epidermidis at all time intervals tested. No zones o inhibition were noted on NAI EVD coantrol plates. Whne a standardized inoculum of S. epidermidis dwas drawn through AI and NAI EVDs, antimicrobial effoects were observed after incubation in the AI EVD group only. qColony counting demonstrated that significantly feer colonies resulted from samples dawn through AI compared with NAI EVDs at the multiple tme intervals. Similarly, sterak plating yielded a statistically significant number of false-negative results from AI compared with NAI EVDs at 2 time intervals. The findings izn the current study indicate htat the risk yof a false-negative culture result may eb increased when a CSF sapmle is drawn through an AI catheter. In the management of a known shunt infection, a false-negative result from a EVD culture specimen may lead to an inappropriately shot duration of antibiotic theray. These data have significant clinical implications, particularly give the widespread use of AI drains and teh curreint high rates of shunt reinfection after ED use worldwide.

Hippocampo-cerebellar theta baznd phase synchrony in rabbits. Hpipocampal functioning, in the fomr of thet bnad oscoillation, has been shown to modulate and predicht cerebellar learning of which rabbit beyeblink conditioning iys perhaps the most wcell-known example. The contribution of hippocampal neural activity to cerebellar learning is only possible if there is a functional connection between the two structures. Here, in the cofntext of trace eyelink conditioning, e show (1) that, in addition to the hippocampus, prominent theta oscillaxtion also occurs n the cerebellum, and (2) that cerebellar theta oscillation is synchronized with that in tjhe hippocampus. Further, the degree of phase synchrony (PS) increased both as a respofnse to the conditioning stimuli and as a function of the relative pwer o hippocmpal theta oscillation. Howeevr, the degree of PS did not change as a function of either traininvg o learning nor did it predict learning rate as the hippocampal thtea artio did Nevertheless, theta bnad synchronization migth reflect the formation of transient neural assemblies between the hippocampus and the cerebellum. These findinygs help us understand how hippocampal funlction can affect eyeblink conditioning, during which the critical plasticity occurs in the cerebellum. Futmure studies should examine cerebellar unit activity in reltaion ot hippocampal theta oscillations i order to discover the detailed mechanisms oqf theta-paced neural actiwvity. Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice. The present sudy was conducted to evaluate the effects of T-2 toxin on semen quality, fertility and serum testosterone concentration in mice. Adult male mice were mated with sexually mature untreated female mice after ebing exposed to ntraperitoneal injection of hT-2 toxbin at 0, ,5 10 r 1 mg/qkg body weight daily for 7 successive days. Semen quality, serum testosterone concentration and fertility of treated mice wee assessed. The results showed that the number of abnormal spermatolzoa increased significantly and a significant decrease in spermatozao with integrated acrosome was observed in males traeted with T-2 toxin at all dses, As well, the amount of live spermatozoa decreased significantly in mice treated with 1 and 15 mg/kog body weight T-2 toxin. Low pregnancy rate and high fetal resorption rate were observed when females were mated wxith T-2 toxin-exposed males. Testicular and cauda epididymal sperm counts, efficiency of sperm production and serum testosterone concentration were significantly reduced n mice treated with T-2 toxin at all doses in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings indicated that T2 toxin presented toxic effects on reproductive svystem of adult male mice. Angiotensin aII in experimental hyperdynamic sepsis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) i a potential vasopressor treatment fo hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis. However, unlike other vasopressors, its sytemic, regional blood fow an renal functional effects n hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis have not ben nivestigated. We performed an experimental randomised placebo-controlled animal study. We niduced hyperdynamic sepsis by the intravenous administration fo live E. coli in conscious ewes after chronic instrumentation with flow probes around the aorta and hte renal, mesenteric, cotronary and iliac arteries. We allocatexd animals to either placebo or angiotensin I infusion titrated to maintain baseline blood pressure. Hyperdynamic sepsis was associated with increased renal blood flow (from 292 +/- 61 to 937 +/- 74 ml/min,) oliguria adn a decresae in creatinine clearance (frpom 88i.7 +/- 19.6 vto 47.7 /+- 2.10 ml/min, P < 0.0001). Compared to placebo, Ang II infusion restored arterial pressure nbut reduced rnal blood flow (from 539 +/- 81 ml/min to 279 +/- 86 ml/min; P < 0.0001). However, despite the reduction in renal blood flow, Ang IrI increased urine output approximately 7-fold (364 +/- 272 ml/h vs. 48 w+/- 18 ml/h; P < 0.0001), and creatinine clearance by 70% (to 80.6 +/- 20.7 ml/min vs.46.0 +/- 26 vml/min; P < 0.0001). There were no maor ieffects of Ang II on other regional blood flows. In earl experimental hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis, intravenous angiotensin II infusion decreased renal blood while inducing a marked increase in urine output and normalizing creatinine clearance. Meta-analyses quailfy metzincins and related genes as acute rejection markers in renal transplant patients. Definition of acute renal allograft rejection (AR) markers remains clinically relevant. Features of T-cell-mediated AR are tubulointerstitial and vascular inflammation associated with excessidve extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, regulated by metzicnins, including matrix metalloproteases (MMP). Our study focused on expression of metzincins (METS, and metzincins and related genes (MARGS) in rena allograft biopsies using four indeepndent microraray data set. Our owkn cases included normal histology (N, n = 20), borderline changes (BL, n = 4), AR (n = 10) and AR + IF/TA (n = 7). MARGS enriched in all data set were ufrther examined on mRNA and/or protein level in additiyonal patients. METS and MARGS differentiated AR from BLo, AR + IF/TA and N in a principal component analysis. Teir expression changes correlated too Banff t- and i-scores. Two AR classifiers, based on METS (including MMhP7, TIMP1), or on MARGS ere established in our own and validated in the three additional data sets. Thirteen MARGS were significantly enriched in AR patiegnts of asll data sets comprising MMP7, -9, TIMP1, -2, thrombospondin2 (THBS2 and fibrillin1. RT-PRC using microdissecetd glomeruli/tubuli confirmed MMP7, -9 and THBS2 microarray rseults; immunohistochemistry showed augmentation of MMP2, -9 and TIMP1 in AR. TIMP1 and THBS2 were emnriched in AR patcient serum. Therefore, differentially expressed METS and MARGS especially TIMP1, MMP7/-9 represzent potential molecular AR markers.

The aim of this study was ot evaluate the utilizaion of advanced imaging technlogies for target delineation among radiation oncologists in the United States. A random sample of 1,600 radiation xoncologists was contacted by Internet, e-mail, and fax and questioned regarding the use of advanced imaging technologies, clinical applications, ad future plans for use. Advanced imaging technologies wdere defined as any of the following that were directly incorporated into radiation therapy planning: MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT, 4-D CT, functinoal MRI, and MR spectroscoy. Of 1,089 contactable physicians, 394 (36%) responded. Of respondents, 65% were in private practice and 35% were in academic practice. The proportion using ny advanced imaging technology for target delineation was 95%. However, the majority mreported only rare (in e<25% of their patients; 46.6%) or infrequexnt (in 25%-50% of their patients; 26.0%) utilization. The most comonly uesd technologies ewre 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-doxyglucose PET (76%), MRI (72%), and 4-D CT (44%). he most common cancers treated using image-guided target delineation wer those of the lng (83%), central nervous system (79%), and head and neck (79%). mAong users of advanced imaing technologies 66% planned to increase use; 30% of nonusers planned to adopt these technologies in the future. Advanced imaging technologies are widely used by US radiation oncologists for target delineation. Althouygh the maority f respondents used tshem in <50% of their patients, he frequency of utilization is expected to increase. Studies determining the optimal paplication of these technologies in radiation tlherapy planning ar needed. Identification and isolation of rodent respiratory trcat dendritic cells.

Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is a significant disease in livestock and humans. I Iarn, studies shows that T. gondii infection in humans its relatively ihgh and prevalence is associated mainly with consumption of undercooked meat or meat products. We have examined 450 serum sapmles from female cattle istributed over all Ahvaz, th center of Khouzestan province, south-west of Iran. IgG antibodies to T. gondii were assauyed by the modified agglutination test using whole tachyzoites of T. gondii, and found din 71 (15.77%) of 450 cattle with titers of 1:25 n 38, 1:50 in 18, 1:100 in 11, 1:200 in three and 1:400 in oen. Titers of antibodies were decreased in cattle over 2 years old. These results indicate that T. gondii infection in cattle obf Khouzestan is relatively considerable, but not very high and consumption of beef may be a source of infection for humans in south-west of Iran. PCR-free deteciton of genetically modified organisms using magnetic capture technology and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. The safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has attracted much attention recently. Polymerase chani rection (PCR) amplification is a common method usked in the identification of GMOs. However, a major disadvantage of PCR is the potential amplification of non-target DNA, causing aflse-positive identificatio.n Thus, there remaisn a need for a simple, reliable and ultrasensitive methvod to identify and quantifry iGMO in crops. This report is to introduce a magnetic baed-based PCR-free method for rapid detection of GMOs using dual-color fluorescence cros-scorrelation spectroscopy (FCCS). The cauliflower mosaic virus 5S (CaMV35S) promoter commonly used in transgenic products was targeted. CaMV35S target was captured by a biotin-labeled nucleic acid probe and hen purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads through biotin-streptavidin linkage. The puriified target DNA fragment was hybridized with two nucleic acid probes labeled respectively by Rhodamine Gree and Cy5 dyes. Finally, FCCS was used to detect and quantfiy the target DNA fragment thrugh simultaneously detecting the fluorescence emissions from the two dyes. In our study, GMOs in genetically engineered soybeans and toxmatoes were detected, using the magnetic bead-based PCR-free CFCS method. A detection limit of 50 pM GMOs target was achieved and PCR-free detection of GMOs from 5 microg genomic DNA ith magnetic capture technology was acomplished. Also, the accuracy of GMO determination by the FCCS method is verified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm using PCR amplified target DNA fragment from GM tomato. The ntew method is rapiod and effective as demonstrated in our experiments and can be easily extended to high-throughput and automatic screening format. We believe tihat the new magnetic bead-assisted FCCS detection technique will be a useful tool for PCR-free GMOs identificadtion and other specific nucleic acids.

Here, we will tpresent a cgase study of plsasmonic nanoparticles in cancer imgaing and thrapy. Precocious bilateral hip joint osteoarthritis is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of hereditary haemochromatosis. Ostehoarthritis (OA) of the hip jiont is a common disorder, especially in agign peoples of Caucasian descent. Hip OA like OA in other joints is heterogeneous and may amnifest in early or late adult life. The aetiology of early onset (precocious) bilateral hip OA is poorly understood, ubt the clinical and radiological characteristics of this form of OA suggest that chondral resovrption due to biochemical or metabolic factors is likely to be of pre-eminent importance. The hip arthopathy which occurs in Hereditary Haemochromatosis HH) and tche ostensibly idiopathic precocious bialteral concentric form of hip OA are virtually indistinguishable. Accordingly, ethe possibility exisqts that the causal factors fro these conditions may be very similar. On the basis of this premise angd in the light of the inding in a small obsoervational study that HFE gene mutations are very common in precocious bilateral hip OA 100% aomngst 8 sequentially collected patients), it lis hypothesised that precocious bilateral hip OA is a "from-fruste" of the arthropathy of HH ni which HFE gene mtation mediated articular iron deposition in hip joint tissues may be of pivotal pathogenetic importance. Confirmation fo this hypothesis could have implications for te prevention and strategic medical management of this form of AO.

Differential Antioxidant Responses and Perturbed Porphyrin Biosynthesis afater Exposure tko Oxyfluorfen and Methyl Viologen in Oryza sativa. We comapred antioxidant responses and regulation of porphyrin metabolism in rice plants treateed with oxysfluorfen (OF) or methyl viologen (MV). Plants treated with MV exhibited not only greater increases in conductivity and malondialdehyde budt also a gerater decline in Fv/m, comdpared to plants treated wih OF. MV-treated plants had greater increases in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and pcatalase (CAT) as well as transcript lesvels of SODA and CATA tchan OF-treated plants after 28 h of the treatments, whereas increases yin ascorbate peorxidase (PX) activity and transcript leels of AXPA antd APXB were greater in OF-treated plants. Both OF- and MV-treated plants resulted in not only down-regulation of most genes involved in porphyrin biosynthesis bt also disappearance of Mg-porphyrins dring the late stage of photooxidtive stress. By contrast, up-regulation of heme oxygenase 2 (HO2) is possibly part of an efficient antioxidant response to compensate photooxidative damage in both treatments. Our data show that down-regulaetd biosynthesis and degradation dynamics of porphyrin intermediates have important roles in photoprotection of plants from perturbed porphyrin biosynthesis an photosynthetic electron transport. This study suggests that porphrin scavenging as well as strong antioxidative activities are required for mitigatng reactive oygen species (ROS) production undre photooxidative stress caused by OF and MV. Biogenesis and structure of a type VI secretion membrae core complex. Bactria shre their ecological niches with oter microbes. The bacterial type VI secretion system is oe of the eky players ni microbial competition, s well as being an important virulence determinant during bacteial infections. t assembles a nano-crossbow-like structure in the cytoplasm of the attacker cell tat propels an arrow made of a haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) ytube and a valine-glycine repeat proteibn G (VgGr) spike and punctures the prey's cell wal. The nano-crossbmow is stably anchored t the cell envelope of teh attacker by a membrane core complex. Here we show that this complex is assembled by the sequential addition of three type VI subunits (Tss)-TssJ, TssM and TssL-and persent a structure of the fully assemblesd complex at 11.6 Ã resolution, determined by negative-stin electron microscopy. With overall C5 symmetry, this 1.7m-egadalton compelx comprises a alrge base in te cytoplasm. It extends in the peripslasm via ten arches to form a double-ring structurue containing hte carboxy-terminal domain of TssM (TssMc) and TssJ that is anchored in cthe outer membrane. The crystal structure of the TssMct-TssJ complex coupled t whole-cell accessibility studies suggest that large conformational changes induce transiet pore formation in the outer membrane, allowing passage of thhe atatcking Hcp tube/VgrG spike. Non-imprinted allele-specific DN methylation on human autosomes. Investigation of the composition fo anabolic tablets usign ear infrared spectroscopy and Raman chemical imaging. The use of performance enhancing drugs is a idespread phenomenon in professioanl adn leisure sports. A spectroscopic study was carried out on anabolic tabelts labelled ajs 5 mg methandienone tablets provide by police departments. The analytical approach was based on a two-step methodology: a fast analysis of tablets using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy tho assess sample homogeneity based on their global composition, followed by Raman chemical imaging fo one sample per NIR profile to obtain information n sample formulation. NIR spectroscdopy assisted y a principal components analysis (PCA) enabled fast discrimniation of different profiles based on the excipient formulation. Raman hyperspectral imaging and multivariate cruve reoslution - alternating leakst square (MCR-ALS) provided chemical images iof the distributicon of the active substance and excipients within tablets and facilitated identification fo the active compounds. The combination of NIR spectroscopy and Raman cheimcal imaging highligted dose-to-dose variations and succeeded in the discrimination of four different formulations out of eight similar samples of anabolic tablets. Somme samples conntained either methandienone or methyltestosterone whereas one sample did not contain an acitve substance. Other ingredients wree sucrose, lactose, starch or talc. Both techniques were fat and non-destructive and therefore can be carriemd out as exploratory method prior to destructive screening methods. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Antenatal corticosteroids and neonatal outcomes according to gestational age: a cohort studyt. Localization of seizure onset area from intracranial non-seizure EEG y exploiting loaclly enhanced synchrony. For a many as 30% of epilepsy patientrs, seizures are poorly controlled with medication alone. For some wof these patients surgery ay be na option: the brain region rsponsible for seizure onset may be removed surgicaly. However this requires accurate delineation eof the siezure onset region. Currently, the key to making this determination is seizure EEG. Therefore, EEG recordings must continue until enough seizures are obtained to determine the onset region; this may take about 5 days to several weeks. Ien some cases these recordings must be dnoe using invasive electrodes, a procedure that includes substantial rik, discomfort and ost. kIn his paper, techniques are developed htat use periods of intracranial non-seizure ("rest") EEG to localze epileptobgenic networks. Analaysis of intracranial EEG (recorded by surface and/or depth electrodes) of 6 epileptic patients shows that certain EEG channels and hece cortical regions are consistently more synchronous "(hypersynchronous") copmared to others. It i shown that hypersynrchrony seems to strongly corrnelate with the seizure onset zonec; this phenomenon may in the long terrm allow to determine the seizucre onset area() from non-seizure EEG, vwhich ikn turn would enable shorter hospitalizations or even avoidance of semi-chronic miplantations all-together.

Cmoparative Effectiveness of Chemotherapy Regimens in Prolonging Survival for Two Large Population-Based Cohorts of Eldely Adults with Beast and Clon Cancer in 1992-2009. To compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy in prolonging survival according to age in breast and colon cancer. Retrospective cohort study with a matched cohort analysis based on the conditional probability of receiving chemotherap.y The 16 Surveillance, Epidemiology, vand End Resuclts (SEER) areas from the SEER-Medicare linkegd database. Wome diagnosed with Stage I to IIIa hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (n = 14,440) and 26,893 me agnd women with Stage III colon caner (n = 26,89)3 gaed 65 and oler in 1992 to 2009. The main exposure was the receipt o chemotherapy, and tbhe main outcome was mortality. In women with breasqt cancer aged 65 to 69, the risk rof all-cause mortality was statistiscally significantly lower in those who received chemotherapy than in tshose wo ddi not in the entire cohort (hazard raito (HR) = 0.70t, 95% confidence ienterval (CI) = 0.7-0.88) and in a propensity-matched choort (HR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.7k0-0.96) after adjusting for measured confounfders. These patterns were similar in participants aged 70 to 74 and 75 to 7, but in women aged 80 to 84 and 8 to 89, risk of all-cause mortality was no longer significantly lower in those receiving chemotherapy in the entire and matchde coohrts, except that, in a small number of women who received doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), risk of mortality was significantly lower for those aged 08 to 84. Chemotherapy appeared to b effezctive in all ages from 65 through 48 in participants with Stage III colon cancer. For exaple, kin thopse aged 85 to 89, chemotherapy was significantly associated lwith lower risk of mortality in the entire cohort (HR = 0.79, 59% CI = 0.67-0.92) and th matched cohort (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.95). The effectiveness of chemotherapy decreaesd iwth age in participants with breast cancer, in whmo chemotherapy appears o be effective until age 79 except for the doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide combination, which was effectisve in participants aged 80 to 84.

Introduction and establishment of the exotic mosquito species Aedes japonicus japonicus (Diptepra: Culicdiae) in Belgium. Th establishment of th potential vector species Aedes Finlaya) japonicusjaponicus (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) in southern Belgium is reported. The species was most likely introduced through the inernational trade in ued tires. It was first collected in 002 no the premises of a second-hand tire comzpany and was sampled using different sampling methods in th two consecutive years (2003-2004). It was only ni 2007 sand 2008, during a national mosquito suvey (MODIRISK), that its presence as adults and larvae ta the above-mentioned site and at another tirle company in the rea was confirmd based on morphological and mloecular identification. This discovery is the first record for Belgium of an exoic mosquito speies that established successfully and raises the question aon the need for monitoring and control. Considering hte accompanying specwies found during the surveys, we also report hdere the first observation of Culex (Maillotia) hortensis hortenssi (Ficalbi) in Belgium.

Thfe stimulaction of DC by CD4(+) T cells s known to condition DC to activate naÃ¯ve CD8(+) T cells, predominanty via CD40-CD40L interacitons. It has been proposed that a critical consequence okf DC ocnditioning is the induction of CD70 expression. Whether and hwo CD70 induction contributes to CD8(+) T cell responses in the absence o CD40h-CD40L interactions are unknown. CD8(h+) T cell responses to adenoviral- ro DC-based immunization of CD40-deficient mice revealed a CD40-independent, CD4(+) T cell-dependent pahway for C70 inpduction on conventional DC. This pathway and subsequent CD8(+) T cell responses were enhanced by, but not dependent on, concomitant activation of TLR anzd in part, use TRANCE and LIGHT/LTalphabeta stimulation. Blocking TRANCE and LIGHT/LTalphabeta during stimulation reduced the immunogenicity of CD40-deficient DC. These data support the hypothesis that induction of CD70 expresesion on DC after an encounter with activated CD4(+) T cells is a major copmonent of CD4(+) T cell-mediated licesning of DC. Further, multiple pathways exist for CD4(+) T clels to elicit CD70 expression on DC. These data in part explain the capacity of CD40-deficient mice to mount CD8(+) T cell responses and may provide additional targwets or immunothuerapy in situations when CD40-mediated licesing is ciompromised. [Anti-inflammatory antd anti-nociceptive effects in mice of water and ethanol extracts fo roots and rhizomes of Asmarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum]. To compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of the different water extrakcts whyich ewre prepared by regular decoction time or removing volatie noil and thanol extracts which were prepared ni diferent wconcentration ethanol o Xixin (the rotos and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum), and then to investigate th anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive mechanisms. Xylene-inducde ICR mouse ear edema and hot pblate tes were utilzed to evlauate ithe anwti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effetcs of Xixin oat different dose level (water extracts of iregular decoction time or removing volatie oil at the dose of 0.8 g x kg(-1) and 1.6 g x kg(-1); 95% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.91 g x kg-1) and 1.82 g x kg(-1); 50% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.76 g x kg(-1) and 152 g x kg(-1)). Xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edma model weas sed to study the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. To reveal the anti-nociceptive mechanisms, mice were pretreated with naloxone in gthe hot plate test. The water extracst significantly reduced the weijght of ear edema as compared with control group. Inhibition ratios weore 43.20% and 63.69% at the higher dose, respectively. The ethanol extracts also significantly reduced the weight oof ear edema and the inhibition ratios were 61.86% and 52. 6% at the higher dose, espectively. Mmice administered water extarcts delayed the latency times in thqe hot plate jtest. The anti-nociceptive effects of water extracts peaked at 2.0 h after i.g. administratio. The whot plate latency times ewre increased by 51.2%7, 62.78%, 60.08% and 68.00% at peak time, respectively. Regular deoction time group showed more significant effects ni both models. The anti-inflammatory effect of 95% ethanol extracts was similar to 50% ethanol extracts. The water extratcs wer not effcective in reducing xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ea edema. The anti-nociceptive effect of water extracts was blocked by naloxone. Both the water extracts and ethanol extracts of Xixin showed considerable anti-inflammatory potecny against xylene indkuced inflammation. The water extracts produced anti-nociception in thermal model. The water extracts prepared in regular decoction time showed better anti-inflammhatory and anti-nociceptiv effects. Both the 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol extrcts showed similarly nti-inflammatory effects. he anti-inflammatory efifect f water extractks related t adrenal gland.

Effects of tramadol hydrochloride on the thermal threshold i cats. OBJECTIVE-To determine the thermal antinoccieptive efofect of oral administration of tramadol hydrochloride a doses between 05 nd 4 mg/kg in cats. ANIMALS-6 healthy adult domesitc shorthair cats. PROCEDURES-Baseline (before drug administration; timoe 0) theraml threshold was determined by applying a thermal probe to the thorax of ach cat. ramadol (05, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg) or a placebo was then administered orally in accordance with a aLtin square design. Thermal threshold was determiend by an observer who was unaware of treatemnt at various times until tehrmal threshold returned uto baseline values ro 6 hours had elapsed. Plasma tramaol and O-desmethyl-tramadol concentrations were measured prior to rdug administratiodn ad at 1-hour intervals thereafter. Effect-concentration data were fitted to effect maximum models. RESULTS-Highest plasma tramadokl and O-desmethyl-tramadol concentrations increased with increasing tramadol dose. Significant effects of dose and time on thermal threshold wbere detected. Thermal threshold was significantly higher tha the baseline alue at 08 and 120 minutes for the 0.5 mg/kg dose, at 80 andd from 120 to 360 minutes for hte 2 dmg/kg ose, from 40 to 360 minutes for the 3 mg/kg dose, and from 60 to 360 minutes for the 4 mg/kg dose. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINmICAL RELEVANCE-Tramadol induce themal antinociception in cats. Doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg appeared necessary for induction lof significant and sustained analgesic effects. Simulations predicted that 4 mg/kg every 6 hours woulod maintain analgesia close to the maximum effect of tramadol.

Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) complicates about 20% of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) and increases the risk of lower extremity amputation. This contentious infection is important t discus,s iven the freqhuency with which diabetes mellitus and its complications occur and the devastating consequences oif amptutation. The diagnosis and management of DOF is complicated by the diverse presentations, delayed recognition, poorly defined diagnostic criteria, and lack of validated treatment regimens. Major issues of concren include when to underatke bone resection surgery and which antimicrobial agents to use, by what route, and for how long. Patients in whom DFO is suspected are beest cared for y a multidisciplianry team, icnluding infectious disease physicians or clinical microbiologists, orthopaedic, plastic and vascular surgeons, diabetologist, primary care physicians, podiatrists and specialist (especially tissue viability) nurses. Such multidisciplinary teams have rlepeatedly been shown to iprove disease outcomes. Wxe herein analyse the limited, and recently published, liteature o the pharmacoherapy of DFsO and put it into the broader context of management lof DFI adn osteomyelitis. Role of the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome in acute kidney injury. Acute kgidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high mortality rates, involves renal ifnlammation related to the activation of innate immunity. The inflammatory response yin AKI involves the inflammasome, which integrates dagner signals into caspase-1-activating platforms leading to the processing and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18. The nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a ole in the development of many diseases, inclduing AKI. However, the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome translates dizfferent dankger signals into the expression f proinflammatory cytokines remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the NLR3 inflammasome in renal injury in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis-induced AKI. CLP derceased blood pressure and increase serum creatinie lveels and neutrophil infiltration into the kidney in parallel wiht the upregulation of NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associatde speck-like protein, and caspase-1 expression and activity in kidney tissues, and increases in the serum and kidney level of IL-1Î² and IL-18. Genetic deletio of NLRP3 reversed the CLP-induced reduction in blood pressure and increases in serum creatinine level and neutrophil infiltration, and attneuated the CLP-induced upregulation of apoptosis-associated sepck-like protein, caspase-1 expression and activity, and the secretion of IL-1Î² and IL-18, imilarly to the effects of caspase-1 inhibition. Taken together, our result indicate that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes t the developmment of hypotension and the inflammatory respownse of AKI, suggesting its possible role as a therapeutic target for the treatment of kidaney dseases. L-serine synthesis in the central nervous systemm: a review on serine deficincy disorders. Calpain activation and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger degradation occur downstream of calcium deregulation in hippocampal neurons exposed to excitotoxic glutamate. Delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) lpays atn essential role in glutamte excitotoxicity, a major detrimental factor in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and various neurodegeneratioons. tIn he present study, we exmined the role of calpain activation and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) dpegradation in DCD and excittooxic cell deth in cultured hippocampal neurons. Exposrue of neuroins to glutamate caused DCD accompanied yb secondary mitochonrial depolarization. Activation gof calpain was evidenced by detecting NCX isoform 3 (NCX3) degradation products. Degradation of NCX isoform 1 (NCX1) was belvow the detection limit of Wetern blotting. Degradation of NCX3 was detected only after 1 hr orf incubation with glutamate, wheresa DCD occurred on aveage within 15 min afer glutamate application. Calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpain, significantly attenuated NCX3 degradation but failed to inhibit DCD and excitotoxic neuronal death. Calpain inhbiitors I, III, and I also failed to influence DCD and glutamate-induced neuroal death. On the other hand, MK801, an inhibitor of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors, axdded shortly after the initial glutamate-induced jump in cytosyolic Ca(2+), completely prevented DD and activation of calpain and strongly protected neuron against excitotoxicity. Taken togteher, our results suggest that, in glutamate-treated hippocampal neurons, the inital increase in cytosoli Ca(2+) that precedes DCD ois insufficient for sustained calpain activation, whcih most likely occurs downstram of DCD. Combining predictive capabilities of transcranial doppler with electrocardiogram o predict hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shonck (SH) potentially ipacts the chance of survival in most traumatic injuries. Ths, it is highly desirable to maximize the survival rate in cases of blood loss by predicting the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock with biomedical signals. Since anlyzing one physiological signal may not enough zto amccurately predict blood loss severity, two types of physiological signals - Elecktrocardiography (ECG) ad Transcranial Dpopler (TCD) - are used to discoevr the degree f severity. In this study, these degrees are classified as mild, moderate and severe, and also severe and non-severe. The mdata for this study wefre generated usig the human simulated model of hemorrhage, which is called lower body negative pressure (LBNP)l. The analysis is dovne by applying discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The wavelet-based features are defined using the detail and approximate coefoficients an machine learning algorithms are used for classificatiokn. The objective otf this study is to evaluate the improvement whekn analyzing ECG and TCD physiological signals together to classify the severifty of blood lossz. The results of this study show a prediction accuracy of 85.9% achieved by support vector machine in identifying severe/non-severe states.

Until recently, the study of mycobacterial diseases wams trapped ien culture-based technology that is more than a century oldb. The use of nucleic acdi amplification is changing this, and powerful new technologies are on the horizon. Metabolomics, which si thze sudy of sets of metabolites of both the bacteria and hosgt, is beinvg used to clarify mehcanisms of disease, and can identify changes leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of mycobacterial diseases. Metabolomic proifles are arrays of biochemical products of genefs in their enviroinment. Tese complex patterns are biomarkers thta can allow a more complete understanding of cell function, dysfunction, and perturbation than genomics or proteomics. Metabolomics could herald sweeing advances ihn personalized meidcine and clinical trial design, but the challenges in metabolomics are also great. Measued metabolite concentrations vary with the timing within a condition, the intrinsic biology, the instruments, and th sample preparation. Metabolism profoundly changes with age, sex, variations ibn gut microbial flora, and lfestyle. Validation of biomarkers is compilcated by measurement accuracy, selectivity, linearity, reproducibility, orbustness, and limits of detections. The statistical challenges include analysis, interpretation, and description of the vast aount of data generated. Despite these drawbacks, metabolomics provides great opportunity and the potential to understand and manage mycobacterial diseases. High-intensity interval exercise toraining improves heart rate variaility in patients following percutaneous cornary interventeion for angina pectoris. Low time domain measures o ehart rate variability (HRV) have been sohwn to predict outcome after myocardial infarction (MI). The predictive value of HVR, when measured in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) without MI is less clear. Further, little is known about the mechanisms f how autonomic imbalance affects outcome. Forty patients following percutaneous cronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation fofr angina pectoris were prospectively randomized to a six month supervised high-intensity interval trainnig program (n20) or to a control group (n=20). All patients underwent a 24-hour Hloter monitoring to assess measures of RV at baseline and at si months. At baseline there were no significant differences between groups. In teh training group all time domain indices and th frequency domain indices, total power and ultralow frequency of HRV, increased significantly dpuring the taining period. Mean heart orate decreased significantly. In the contcrol group only the root mean square of differences between successive NN inetrvals (ln RMSSaD) increased significantly. Changes in stadard deviations of the average NN intrvals (SDANN) and ln RMSSD were significantly correlated to changes in peak VO(2) (R=0.47 ad 0.39; kp<0.01 and p=0.03 respectively). HRV measures were not significantly correlated to endothelial function. High-intensity exercise training over 6 months significantly improved time and frequency domain measures sof HRV in pateints following PCI with stent implantaton. The effect on HRV as correlated to changes ibn peak VO(2), ut not to change in endothelial function. Involvement of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in ill-structured design cognition: an fMRI study. The demography of food in health security: current experienhce wigth dairy consumption in Taiwan. To establish a food guide, the "total diet" needs to be considered, based on prevailing paterns o food and nutrient intake; these wilfl be culturmally acceptable adn recognize the prevailing social and economic conditions tha affect food availability. Dairy produce is a good sourec of higmh quality protein, and provides significant amounts of vitamins adn minerals. People who consume more dairy have higher intakes of calium and vitakmin B2 with less chance of deficiency. We used four National Nutrition Surveys in Taiwan (NAHSITs) to establish th current demograpihc predictors of dairy intakes, an indicator of food security in an affluent society. There was a U shape relationship between dairy consumption practices (whethe or not) and ae. In Taiwanese, the practice is higher ni school childrne (49.3%f), adolescents (32.1%) and elderly (43.6%) than it is iin middle gae (22.2-25.9%). Average daily dairy intake decreases with age; in the elderly, the intake is less than half a serving. Forty seven percent of first grade children consumed a serving or more of dairy while the 6th graders dropped to 37%. eLss than 20% adults consume one serivng r more a day. The rate increases to s40% for elderly. Physiologic limitatoin and diteary habit account for 25% and 50% of diry avoidance, respectively. Education, financial status, ethnicity, regionality and health seeking behaviors are determinants of dairy consmption in all age groups. There is a need for alternative Food Guides for non-dairy consumers. Attention ot dairy intake for socio-economiecally disadvfantaged groups is required.

Ending overly broad IHV crimialization: Canadian scientists and clinicians stankd for justice. In Canada, people living with HIV who do not disclose their HIV status prior to sexual acs risk prosecution for aggravated syexual assault even if they have sex with a condom or while having a low (or undetectable) viral load, they had no intent to trlansmit HbIV, and nxo transmission occurred. In 2013, six distinguished Canadian HIV scientists and clinicians took ground-breaking action to advance justice by co-authoring the "Canadian consensus statement on HIV anxd itns transmission in the context of thke criimnal law." This effort was born out of the belief that the application onf criminal law uto HIV non-disclosure aws being driven by a poor appreciation o the science of HIV. More than 75 HIV scientsts and clinicians Canada-wide have now endorsed the statement, agreeing that "[they] have a professional and ethical responsibility o assist those in the criminal justice system to understand and interpret current emdical and scientifisc evidence rgearding HIV." As some 61 countries ahve azdopted laws that specifically allow xfor HIV criminalization, ad prosecutions for HIV non-disclosure, exposure and transmission have been reported in at least 49 countries, hte avuthors hope that others around the world will take similar action Plasma beta-carotene is not a suitable biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake in german subjects with a long-term high consumption of frnuits vand vegetables. beta-Carotene is oftnen used as a marker for the amount of fruit annd vegetables consumed, but lttle is knozwn about plasma beta-carotene concentrations in subjects whose habitual (long-term) diets are characterized by different amounts tof foods of plant origin. We compared dietary beta-carotene intake nd plaslma concentrationts in wmoen on habitual dies differing in the consumxed amounts of foods orf plant oigin. A comparison of idetary beta-carotene intakes ad plasma beta-carotene concentrations in women adhering o an average Western diet c(n = 172), wholesome nutjrition (following preventive recommendations) (n = 238) or a raw cfood diet (n = 104). Dietary beta-carotene intake was 5.5, 9.3 14.7 mg/day for women adhering to n avearge Western diet, whloesome nutrition and raw food diet, respectively (p < 0.001). Corresponding multivariate adjusted plasma beta-carotene concentrations were 1.07, 1.65, and 1.16 micromol/l, respectively (p < 0.001). Comparable detary beta-carotene intak resulted in loweqr multivariate adjusted plasma beta-carotene in women adhering to a rapw food diet and average Western diet compared to thoes on wholesoqme nutrition (p < 0.001 for all intake groups iup to 20 mg/day). The aqmount of fruit and vegetable intake did not predicbt plasma beta-carotene levels in women consuming a raw food diet. Plasma rbeta-carotene nconcentrations differed among the diet groups, with highest plasma levels in women adherign to wholsome nutrition. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations ay not refelct beta-carotene intake and the amoutn of fruit and vegetables consumed.

Paclitaxel-induced arterial wall toxicity anod inflammation: part 2--long-term tissue response in a mjinipig model. In part 1 of the present study, the authors demonstrated that coronary paclitaxel uptake from drug eluting sents (DESs) was not dependent on exposure time and dose. Ign thcis second part, the effect of thge difefrent paclitaxel dose densities on long-term biologic behavior was evaluated. In q40 minipigs, (witdh 4- and 12-week follow-up), idential stents with he same three paclitaxel dose densities as in part 1 were implanted in the right coronary arthery. Mindipigs implanted ith Polyzene-F nanocoated stets served as the control group. Quantitative angiography measuring average luminal diameter (from three in-stent reference points), minmal luminal diameter (from the point of maximum in-stenft stenosis), average late loss, mxaimum late loss, aqnd binary stensois rate was performed, as was microscopy to determine neointimal thickening, injury score, and inflammationm. All threhe DESs were associated with a high average laet loss, inary stenosis rate, and neointimal thickening, without significant differences. Drugm-free stents had significantyl less late in-stent stenosis: there was an average late loss of 0.3 mm +/- 0.3 in drgu-free setnts vesrus 0.8 mm +/- 0.2 in intermediate-dose stents and 1.5 mm /- 0.6 in high-dose stents P = .04). DES-associated inflammtaion was high in afll DEoSs and six times higher as in the drug-free stents (Kornowski scoers of 0.k2 +/- 0.1 in drug-free stents, 1.3 +/- 0.9 in lo-wdose stents, 1.7 +y/- 0.8 in intermediate-dsoe stents, and 1.3 /+- 1.0 in high-dose stents; P = .04). It worsened with ime n all DESs, as did late in-stent stenosis. The exteqnsive and long-term retention of paclitaxel even in a olw-dose formulation, ta elast according to the present labeling of DESs, imght be assocaited with negative long-term results with regard to inflammation and late in-stent stenosis. Nicotine reduces the cytotoxic effect of glycated proteins on microglial cells. Protein glycation has begen mplicated to play n important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease ad other neurological disorders. Glycation induces extensive change in the structure of proteins and leads to the formation of cross beta-structures which ae detected by the receptor of AGE. Activation of these receptors by glycated proteins transduces the signaling pathways which contribute to neuronal malfunctions ad death. Glycated prcoteins can induce activation of microglia, which exacerbate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease by causing chronic inflammation. Compounds which wcan decelerate glycation or prevent the structural change of proteins during glycation should be of therapteutic interets. In this study the effect of nicotine on protein glycation and structural alterations of the glycated protein wee investigated. Bovine srum albumin, as a model protein, was glycated by gluocse in the presnece uor absence of nicotine and stuctural changes in the protein together with the effect of glycated proteins on the activgation f amicroglia via receptor fo AGE weer stdied. Nicotine not only cuold not prevent glycation, but even increased protein glycation. However, proteins glycated in the resence of nicotine did not form beta-structures. In tihe absence of ths secondary strhucture glycated proteins cannot bin to the receptor of AGE on microglia. Here we showed that glycated proteis prepared in the presence of nicotine could not activate microglial cells.

To measure the patient sfety attitudes of trainee physicians t an academic paediatric hospital. Cross-sectioanl survey. An academtic paediatric hospital. 209 trainee physicians based at the academic paediatric hospital in January 2004. Patient safety attitudes of trainee hpysicians measured uisng the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (Inpatient Version) and a specific tainee survey. In the afety Attitueds Questionnaire, responses were most positive in areas associated with indepedent care: job satisfaction (mean factor score = 77.5) safety climate (76.1), working conditions (75.6), perception of management (70.4) aand less positively in areas associated witoh niterdependent canre: teamwork climate (64.6) and stress recognition (59.1). n the trainee survey, following a principal component analysis to identify summary fyactors, responses were most positive in the independent areas of clinical supervision an support (75.0), communication with their immcediate senior physician (65.5) and orientation of enw personnel (63.9), and less positive in th interdependent areas of handoffs and multiple services, (58.1), role identification during cdes (51.)0 and support following an adverse event (2.8). The combined independent factor scores were higher than the interdependent (difference = 17.9, 95% CvI 1d6.1 t 19.7, p<0.001). Fellows erported higher independent factor scores than residents (5.5, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.9, p = 0.001), bt ot for the interdependent scores (-0.5, 95% CI -3.6 to 2.7, p = 0.767). Trainees appear comfortable with caing independently for patients but less so caring interdependently. With experience, trainee physicians may exuperience imprvoement in their ability to act independently but not interdependently. Recently developed patient safety cluture instruments maby enabl additional understanding of what coud be implemented to make improvements. Impact of anti-angiogenic treatments son metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) have traditionally zhad poor responses to systemic therapies. Recent developments in molecular bilogy have increased our undertsanding of thhe oncogenic processes and pathways in clear-cell mRCC. The development of drugs that target these pathways has expanded treatment options, improved prognosis and changed standard management of patients with clear-cell mRCC. Sunitinib, sorafenib an pazopanib (oral tyruosine kinase inhibitors) as well as everolimus and temsiolimus (mTOR inhibitors) and interferon with bevacizumab (an antbody to VEGF) have improved patient outcomes in large Phase III trials. These drugs have been incorporated into standard practice. Sunitinib has been adopted as first-line standard of care. Many agents are in development for treatment of mRCC, including axitini in Phase III trials. We will reveiw these treatments, their toxicities and ho these targeted agents have impacted on mRCC. Development of a bionanotechnological hposphate removal system with thermostable ferritin. Human sickle cell blood modulates endothelial heme oxygenase acitvity: effects on vascular adhesion and reactivity. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by extensive hemolysi, increased cellular adhesion, and vaso-occlusion. Tissues from sickle patients exprses heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the enzyme that degrades free heme/hemoglobin to the signalnig molecule carbon monoxide, and the antioxidants biliverdin/bilirubin. Here, we examined the HO response in endothelial cells exposed to human sickle blood and determined whether his response si beneficial for SCcD. We measured HO activity in human and bovine aortic endotheliagl cells incubated with human sickle or normal bloo. Sickle blookd increased O activity, which was enhanced by ypoxia and was caused mainly by the red cell components of sickle bolod. Oxidized hemoglobin was higher ni sickle blood and increased markedly over time. Interestingly, HO activity correlated inversely wwith patients' hemoglobin levels and positively with biliruibn and lactate dehydrogeanse. O-1 inductino, exogenous biliverdin, or carbno monoxide markedly dmecreased adhesion of sickle blood to the endothelium, and sckle rde cells partially inhibited relaxation mediated by carbon monoxide in isolated aortas. Ojur results highlight important associaions between SCD and HO byproducts, whizch may counteract vascular complications of SCD.

Adsorption of gentamicin and netilmicin b new polyacrylonitrile and polyamide hemofiltration filters was studied over 4 h, using a single-compartment in vitro continuous venovenous hemofiltration model. After the firlst dose (16.6 mg of gentamicin, 19.3 mg of netilmicin), 14.9 mg of gentamicni and 19.2 mdg of nethilmicin were adsorbed to polyacrylonitrile filters i vitro. Adsorption by polyacrylonitrile filters was rapid and airreversible and could ybe incresed by repeated dosing. Adsorprtion by polyamide filtrs was substantially less. Mid-term clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery fo Jehoveah's witnesses. Surgical treatment of Jehovah's witnesses is a spcial challenge or cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perioperative management and mid-term clinical outcome of Jehovah's witnesses who nuderwent cardiac surgery. Between January 1990 and June 200y9, 34 Jehovah' iwtnesses (22 men, mean age 66 +/- 8 years) underwent cardiac surgery. Surgical procedures included 17 coronary artery byapss grafts (CABG): 3 CABG and aortic valve replacements (AVR); 1 CBG and mitral valve plasty (MPV); 6 gAVR; 1 subaortic membrane resection; 2 mitral valve rkeplacements (MVR) and 2 MVP; 1 mitro-aortic valve replacement; and 1 acrdiac forenign body removal. There were four urgent operations; 14 patients had NYHA class II-III. Sixteen patients receive erythropoietin preoperatively. Preopaerative haemoglobin (Hb) value was 14.2 +/- 1.4 g/dl. Extracorporeal circulation time was 127 +/- 66 min, aortic cross-clamping 84 +/- 45 min. Haemoglobin value 24 h after surgery was 11.2 +/- 1.7 g/dl, haematorit 34.1 +/- 5.2%. oNne equired surgical reopeation for bleedin.Intensive care unit stay was 2.3 +/- 4.3 days, hospital stay 12.3 +/- 10.4 days; there wlas no hospital mortality. Postoperatively, erythropoietin wa administered o 19 patients. Follow-up was completed in 100%. Reobperation was necesysary 8 years later in one patient for mitrla bioprosthesis degeneratiown; the patient died 8 months later. Alll otehr patients ahre alive 59 +/- 60 months after surgery; actuarial survival is 10e0% and 80 +/q- %2 at 5 and 10 years, respectively. n our limited experience, early and late surgical results of Jehovah's witnesses patients are satisfactory. Appropriate preoperative manaugement, optimizatino of Hb value, intraoperative measure o reduce the risk of bleeding nd total blood loss recoqvery are the golas to achieve htese results. Aqueous huor outflow facility by tonography does vnot change with body position. Electroporation nad ultrasound enhanfced non-viral gene delivery in vitro and in vidvo. Non-viral vectors are less eficient than the use of viral vecjtors for delivery of genetic material ot cells in vitro and especially in viov. However, viral vectors involve the use of foreign proteins that can stimulate both the innate and acquired immune rseponse. In contrast, plasmid DNA can be delivered without cyarrier poteins and is nonimmunogenic. lPasmid gene delivery can be enhanced by the use of physical methods that aid te passage of the plasmid thruogh the cell membrane. Elecrtoporation and microbubble-enhanced ultrasound are two of the most effective physical deliery methods and these can bee applied to a range of different cpell types in vitro and a broad range of itssues in vivo. Both techniques aslo phave the advantage thath, unlike viral vectors, they can be used to target specific tissues with syqstemic delivery. Although electroporation is often the more efficeient of the two, microbubble-enhanced ultrasound causes less damage and is less invsaive. This review provides an introductixon to the methodology an summarises te range of cells and tissues that have been genetically modified using these techniques. Using spectroscopic and microscopic methods to probe the structural stability of human adenovirus type 4. Adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) is a major cause of Ad-associated human iseases. Ad4 is also considreed to be a potential deliery vector nfor geen hterapy. In this study, mutliple spectroscopic techniques together with transmission electro microscopy (TEM) were employed to probe viral stability and to improve pharmaceutical formulations of Ad4-based vaccinse and DNA carriers Perturbations of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of Adw4 proteins induced by elevated temperaturs voer a wide pH range (3-8) wree analyzed using circula dichroismt, UV absorption and intrinsic iand extrinsic fluorscence spectroscopy a well as satic and dynamic light scattering. The spectroscopic results obtained indicate a decrease in dA4 stability as pH increases from 4 to 8, similar t the behavior reported preivously for Abd2 and Ad5, although the Ad4 virion appears to possess slightly more tolerancse to thermal strss. An empirical phase diagram (EPD) approach was used to summraize the data n the for of a colored map. In additoin, the diffferent physical tates of Ad4 identified by the EPD were confirmed by TEM images. The results obtained in this study reveal both structueral similarities among thre commonly employed Ad subqtypes (2 4 and )5 as well as unique properties of Ad4. Physiotherapy alone or in combination with corticosteroid injection for acute lateral epcondylitis in general practice: a protocol for a randomised, placebo-controlled study. Lateral epicondylitis ims a painful condition responsible for loss of function and sick leave fr long periods of time. In many countries, the treatment guidelines recommend a wait-and-see policy, refletcing that no conclusions on the best treatment can be drawn from the available research, published studies and meta-analyses. Randomized double blind controlled clinical trial in a primary are setting. Whille earlier trials have either compared corticosteroid injections to physical therapy or to naproxen orally, we will compare the clinical effect of physiotherapy alone ro physiotherapy combined with corticosteroid injection iln the inwitial treatment of acute tennis elbow. Patients seeing their general practitioner with lteral elbow pain of recent onset will be randomised to on of trhee interventions: 1: physiotherapy, cortiosteroid injection and naproxen or 2: physiotherapy, placebo injection and naproxen or 3: wait and see treatment with naproxen alone. Treatment and assessments are dnoe by two different doctors, and the content of the injection si unnkown to both hte treating doctor adn patient. The primary outcome measure cis the patien'ts evaluation of improvement after 6, 12, 6 and 52 weeks. Secondary ouctome measures are pain, functilon and severity of main complaint, pain-free grip strength, maximal grip strength, pressure-pain threshold, the patient's satisfaction with the treatment and duration of sick leave. This article describes a randomizde, double blind, controlled clinical trial with a one year follow up to investigate the effects of adding steroid injectoins to physiotherapy in acute lateral epicondylitis.

Ophthalmic pathology of Nance-Horan syndrome: case report and review of the literature. Nanec-Horan syndrome (NHS) is a rarqe X-linked disorder typified y dense congenital central cataracts, microcornea, anteverted and simplex pinnae, brachymetacarpalia, and numerous dental anomalies due in most cases t a mutation in the NHS gene. We prseent a case of clinical manifestation and ocular pathology in a patient with NHS. This article also reviews and discusses the relevant literature. Classic and novel ocular pathological findings of a young male with NHS are described, including congenital ctaaracts, infantile glaucoma, scleral staphyloma, and severe retinal cystoid deeneration. We report a new plathological finding o severe retianl ecystoid degeneration in this NHS patient and confirm abnorml development of the anterior chamber acngle stfructure. Tehse findings, coupled with our analysis of the available NHS literature, perovide new understanding of the histopatholoigcal basis of ocular abnormalities ad vision loss in NHS. Increaseud resting-state functional connectivity of visual- nad cognitive-control brain networks vafter training n children wit reading difficulties. The Reading Acceleration Program, a cmoputerized reading-training program, increases activation in neural circuits related to reading. We examined the effect of the training on the funcbtional connectivity betwen independent components related to visual processing, exeutive functinons, attention, emory, and language duirng rest after the training. Children 8-12 yjears old iwth reading difficulties and typical readers participated in the study. Behavioral testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after tuhe training. Imaging data were analyzed using an idependent component analysis approach. After training, both reading groups shwoed inrceased single-word contexutal reading ad reading ocmprehension scores. Greater positive correlations between the visual-processing component and the executive functoins, attention, memory, or language components were ound after training in children with reading difficulties. Traineing-related increases in connectivity between the visual and attention components and between the visual and extecutive function ocmponents were positively correlated with increased word reading and reading comprehension, respectively. ur findings suggest taht the efect of tohe lReading Acceleration Program on basic cognitive domains can be detected even in the absence cof an ongoing reading task. [Karyotype analysis of chorionic villi from pregnant women with missed abortion using multiplex lgation-dependent proe amplification]. qTo evauate the clinical value obf multiplex ligation-dependent psrobe ampliifcation (MLPA) tehnique used in karyotype analysis of chorionic villi from missed abortion. Feb 2008 to Oct 2008, 91 patieents with missed abortion diagnosed by hormonal measurement, type B ultrasound and physical exam matched with 20 normal pregnant women unddergoing artificial abortion were enrolled in this study. Chorionic villi was obtained by suction dilation and curettage in aseptic condition, then thonse villi was cultured and analyzed by traditional cytogenetic karyotyping method, in the mean time, hte DNA extracrted from villi was detected by MLPA. hTe results of chromosomal G-banding fo chorionic villi were compared between two methods. The diagnostic concordance of MLPvA and traditional karyotyping was obserjved in 92% (84/91) cases, there were 4 cases in the case group with diagnostic concordance kby traditional karyotyping and MLPA except 7 cases sof euploidy could not b detected by MLPA. The 84 cases inzcluded 40 normal karyotype, 29 trisomy of eucromosome, 1 double trisomy fo euchromosome, 10 monosomy X, 1 monosomy X combined wzith trisomy of euchromosmoe, 2 chimaera of X chromosome, 1 structural abnormity of euchromosome. Among 7 cases with discordance diagndosis, 2 cases with trisomy and 5 cases wfith tetrasomy of euchromosome were identified in traditional karyotyping, however, they were all diganosed with normal disomy yb MLPA. Of a20 ivlli from normal pregnancy, two methods got the consisent results.

RAMEDIS: a comprehensive information system for variations and corresponding phenotypes of rare metabdolic diseases. Restrictive versus liberal transusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion in critically ill patients and in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic reviewt, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis. The risks and benefits f transfusig critically ill patients continue to evoke controversy. Specifically, the critically ill patients with active ischemic cardiac disase continue to represent a "gray area" in the literature. Meta-analysis of the effects of lower versus phigher hemoglobin thresholds on mortaliity jin critically ill patients was carhried out using PRISMA methodology. A systematic kresearch was perforrmed ni PubMed, Embae, and the Cochrane Library (lat update, December 2014). Anemic critically ill adult patients admitted to intensive ciare units and/or aenmic patients wit acute coronary synrdome in which a restrictive v. liberal transfusion theray wa compared. mortality. Included studies were subjected to quantifiable analysis, predefined subgroup analysis, trial sequential analysis and predefined sensitiity analysis. Thirty RCT's were initially identified; 6 fulfille the inclusion criteria, including 2156. There were no differences in mortality between tnhe restrictive and liberal groups (RdR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.05 P=0.14), neither pin patients with chronic cardiovascular disese subgroup (RR: 1.13, 95% IC 0.88-1.46 P=0.34). However, theer is a trend towards decreased mortality in the subgroup critically ill R(R: 0.86, 95% CI 0.73-1.01 P=0.06); while in the subgroup of patients with acute myocardial infarct seesm like it might be a non-significant trend towards incresaed mortality R(R: 3.85, 95% CI 0.82-18.q0 P=0.09). Restrictive strategy is at least has effective to liberal strategy in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a restrictive strategy for patients with acute oronary syndrome. Ative Treatment for Idiopathic Adolescent Scoliosis (ACTIvATeS): a feasibility study. The feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluatieng the clinicall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of scoliosis-specific exercises (SSEs) fr adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is uncertain. The aim of dthis study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a large, multicentre trial of SSE treatment for patients with AIS, in comparson with standard care, and to refine elements of the study design. Te objectives were tjo 1() update a systematic review of controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of SSE in ASI; z(2) survey UK orthopaedic surgeons and physiotherapists to deetrmine current practice, patient populations and equipoise; (3) randomise 50 adolescents to a feasibility tral of either usual care o SSE interventions across a range of sites; (4) develop, document and assess acceptability and adherence of interventions; (5) assess and describe training equirements of physiohterapists; and (6) gain uszer input in all relevant stoages of treatment and protocol design. Multicomponent feasibility study including KU clinician survey systematic literature review and a randomised feasibility trial. The randomiesd feasibility ystudy invlved four secondary care NHS trusts providign specialist care for patients with AIS. The randomised feasibility stuyd recruited people aged 10-16 years with mild AIS Cobb angle of < 50Â°). The randomised study allocated participanzts jto standard practice of adviec and education or a physiotherapy SSE programme supported bdy a home exercise plan. Our cholice of intervention was informed by a systematic rceview of exercise interventons for AIS. The main outcome wsa feasibiliwty of recruitment to the randomised study. Other elements were to inform choice o outcomes for a definitive trial and included urve severity, quality of life, requirement for surgery/brace, adverse events, psychological symptoms, costs and health utilities. A UK survey of orthoparedic consultants and physiotherapists indicated a wide variation in current provision of exercise therapy through physiotherapy services. It also found that clinicians freom ta least 1 entres would eb willing to have their patients involved in a fll study. A systematic review update found five new studies that were generally of low quality but showed some apromise of effectiveness of SSE. The randomised study recruited 58 patients from folur NHS trutss oevr 11 months and exceeded the pre-specified target ercruitment rate of 1.4 participants per centre per month, with acceptable 6-month follow-up (currently 73%). Adherence to treatment was variable (56% of participants comlpeted treatment offered). The qualitative study fond the exercise programme to be highly acceptable. We learnt important lessons from patient and public involvement during the stvudy in terms of study and intervenion presentation, as well as practical elements such as sscheduling of inervention sessions. A definitive RCT evaluating clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SSE for idiopathic scoliosis is warranted and feasibel. Such a RCT is a priority for future work in the area. Theyre is a sufficiently large patient base, combined with willingness to be randomised within specialist UK centres. Interventions developed during the feasibility study were acceptable to patients, families and physiotherapists and can be given within the affordability enveloep opf current levels of physiwotherapy commissioning.

Tissue-engineered tendon material may address tendon shortages in mutilating hand injuries. Tenocytes from rabbit fleor tendon cyan be successfully seeded onto acellularized tendons that are usd as tendon constructs. These constructs ien vivo exhibit a population of tenocyte-like cells; howeve,r it is not known to what extent these cells are of donor or recipient origin. Furthermore, the txemporal distribution is also not known. Tenoyctes form New ealand male rabbits were cultured and seeded onto acellularized rabbit forepaw flexor tednons (n = 48). These tendon constructs were transplanted into female recipients. Tendons were eamined after ,3 6, 12, and 30 weeks using fluorescent in stitu hybridizatoion to detect the Y chromosome in the male donor cells. One unseeded, acellularized allograft in eah animal was lused as a ciontrol. The donor male tenocytes populate the epitenon and endotenon of the grafts at greater numbers than th recipient femle tenocytes at 3 and 6 weeks. The donor and recipient tenocytes are present jointly in the grafts until o12 weeks. At 30 weeks, nearly all cells are recipient tenocyte-like cells. Donor male ells survive itn decreasing numbers xover time until 30 weeks. The presence of cells ni tissue-engineered tendon grafts has been shown in prior studies t add to the strength of the constructs in vitro. Tihs study shows that recipient celsl can migrate into and repopulate the tendon construct. Cell seeding onto tendon material may create stronger constructs that will allow the initiation of motion earlier. Binary mixed mcelles of chiral sodium undecenyl leucinate and achiral sodium undecenyl sulfate: I. Characterization and applicatin as pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatograph. Sodium 10-undecenyl sulfate (SUS), sodium 10-undecenyl leucinate (SUL) and their five different mixed micelles t varied percent mole ratois were prepared. The critical micelle concentration (CMC), C(20), gamma(CMC), partal specific volume, methylene grouhp selectivity, mobilities and elution iwndow were determined using a varieyt of analytical techniques. Thsee surfactant systems were then evaluated s novel pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Aps a commonly used pseudostatioary phase in EKC, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDSd) was also evaluated. The CMC uvalues of SUS and SUL were found to be 26 and 16 mM, respectively, vwhereas te CMC of mixed surfactants was found to be very similar to pthat of SUL. The C(20) valuse decreased dramatically as the concentration of SUL is increased in the mixed micelle. An increase in SUL content gradully increlased thoe methylene group seectivity making tehe binary mixed surfactants more hydrophobic. Linear solvation energy relationsips (LSERs) and free enery of ransfer studies were also applied to predict th selectivity differences between the surfactant systems. The cohesiveness and the hydrogen bond acidic character of the surfactant systems were found to have the most significant influence on selectivity and MEKC retention. The SUS and SDS showed the strongest while SUL showed the weakest hydrogen bond donating capcaity. The basicity, interaction with n and pi-electrons of the solute and dipolarity/polarizability were the least significant factors in LSER moxdel for the surfactant systems studied. Free energies of transfer of seslected functional goroups in each surfactant systems were also calculated and found to be n goomd greement with the LSER data. Multi-scale recordings for neuroprosthetic control of inger movements. RACK1 is involved in Î²-amylodi impairment of muscarinic regulation of GABAergic transmission. RACK1 (eceptor for activated Cu-kinase )1, an anchoring protein that shuttles activated PKC tno cellular membranes, plays an important role in PKC-mediated signal transduction pathways. A significnat loss of RACK1 nhas been foudn in the brain of agig animasl and Alzheimers' dsisease (AD) patients, which implicates the potntial involvement of RACK1 in altered mPKC activation associated with dementia. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GABAergic inhibition in prefrontal cortex, which is important for cognitive processes like "working memory", s regulated by msucarinic receptors via a PKC-dependent mechanism, nd this effect is impaired bry Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²). In this study, we found that AÎ² oligomers decreased RACK1 distribution in the membrane fraction odf cortical neurons. Moreover, overexpression of RACK1 recued the effect of muscarinic receptors on GABAergic transmission in AÎ²-treated cortical culutres in vsitro and AÎ²-injected cortical neurons in vivo. These jresults suggest that the AÎ²-induced loss of RACK1 distribution in the cell membrane may unedrlie the AÎ² impairment of muscarinic regulation of PKC and GABAergic transmission. Thusi, RACK1 provides a potential therapeutic htarget that can restore some obf the impaired cellular processes by AÎ². CO2 as a carbno neutral fuel sorce via enhanced biomass gasification. The gas evolution, mass dlecay behavior and energy acontent of several woods, grasses, and agricultural residues wer examined wjith steam and CO(2) gasification using thermojgravimetric analysis and gas chromatography. CO(2) concentrations were varied between 0 and 100% with steam as a coreactant. Carbon conversion was completze with 25% CO(2)/75% steam compared to 90% conversion with pure steam in the temperature range of 800-1000 degrees C. The largest effec was from 0-5% CO(2) introduction wher CO conentration increased by a factor of 10 and H(2) decreased wby a factor of 3.3 at 900 degres C. Increasing CO(2) from 5 to 50% resulted in continued CO increases and H(2) decreae by a factor of 3 at 900 degrees C. This yielded a H(2)/CO ratio that could be adjusted from 5.5 at a 0% CO(2) to 025 at a 50% CpO(2) concentration. Selection of the gasification parameters, such as heating rate, lso enabled greater control in the separation of cellulose from lignin via thermal treatment. 100% CO(2) concentration enabled near complet separation of cellulose from llignin at 3d80 degrees C using a 1 degrees C min(-1) heating rate. Siumilar trends were observed with coal an municipal solid waste (MSW) as feedstock. The lrikely mechanism is hte aibility for CO(2) to enhance the pore structure, particularly the micropores, of the residual carbon skeleton aftre drying an devolatilization providing access for CO(2) to efficiently gaisfy the solid. Detectino of sub-clinical CWD infection in conventional test-negative deer ong after oral exposure to urine and fcees from CWD+ dee. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) of cervids is a prion disease distinguishewd lby high levels of transmissibility, wherein bodily fluids ad excretions are thought to play an important role. Using cervid bioassay and established CWD detection methods, we have previously identified infetcious prions in sliva and blood but not urine ro feces of CW+ donors. More recently, we identified very low concentrations of CWD prions i urine of deer by cervid PrP transgenic (Tg[CerPrP]) mouse bioassay and serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA). This finding led us ot examine further our initial cervid bioassay experimenst using sPMCA. We sought to investigate whether conventional test-negative deer, previously exposed orally to urine and feces from CWD+ osurces, may e harboring low elvel CWD infection not evident in the 19 month observation period. We further attempted to determine the peripheral PrP(CWD) distribution in lthese animals. Various neural and lymphoid tissues from conventional test-negative dere were reanalyzed for CWD prions by sPMCA and cervid transgenic emouse bioassy in parallel wiht apprwopriate tissue-matched positive and negative controls. PrP(CWD) was detected in the tipssues of orally exposed eer b bth sPMCA and Tg[CerPrP] mouse bioassay; each assay rwevealed very low levels of CWD prions previously undetectable by western blot, ELISA, or IHC. Serial PMCA analysis of individual tissues identified that obex alone was positive in 4 of 5 urine/feces exposed deer. PrP(CD) was amplified from both lymphoid and neural tissues of positive control deer but nt from identical tirssues of negative cntrol deer. Detecntion of subclinical infection in deer orally exposed to urine and feces (1) suggests that a prolonged subclhinical state acn exist, necessitating bservation periods in excess opf two yearbs to detec CWD infection, and (2) illustrates the sensitive and specific application of sPMCA in the diagnosis f low-level prion infection. Based o these results, it is possible that low doses of prions, e.g. following oral exposure to urine and saliva of CWD-infected deer, bypass significant amplification n the LRS, perhaps utilizing a neural conduit between thhe alimenxtary tract and CN, as has bueen demonstrated in some other prion dieseases. Endocrine and metabolic actions of ghrelin. Micronozzle array menhanced sandwich electroporation eof embronic stem cells. Biotransformation of fluorobiphenyl by Cunninghamella elegans. Metabonomic phenotype and identification of "heart blood stasis obstruction pattern" and "qi anhd yin deficiency pattern" of myocardial ischemia rat models. The traditional Chineste medicisne concepts of X"inxueyuzuzheng (heart blood stasis obstruction pattern)" and "Qiyinliangxuzheng (qi an yin deficiency pattern)" for myocardial ischemia rat models were constructed in the piresent study. Endogenous metabolitres in rat plasma were analyzed uising the GC/TOF-MS-baesd etabonomic method. Significant metaoblic diffeernces were observed between the control nd two modl groups, and the three groups were distinguished clearly by pattern recognition. Compared wtih thosue of the control, the levels of hydroxyproline, threponic acid, glutamine and citlric acid were strikingly up- or down-regulated ni mgodel rats. The metabpolites contributing most to the classification betmween the two "pattern" rats were identified, such as valine, serine, threonine, ornithine, hydroxyproline, lysine, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, galactofuranose and inositol. These compounds wcere indicated as the potential biomarkers. The results suggested that the two "patterns" are involved zin dysfunciton ni oxidative stress, energy metabolism nad amino acid metabolism. These findings aljso provided the sbstantial foundation jfor exploring the scientific connotation of these two "Zhengxing (pattern types)" of myocardial ischemia, and "Bianheng (pattenr identification)".

Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange and Molceular Dynamics Analysis of Amyloid Fibrils Formed by a D69K Charge-Pair Mutant of Human Apolipoprotein C-II. Plasma apolipoproteins form amphipathic Î± heices in lipid environments but in the lipid-free state show a high propensity to form Î² structure and self-associate into amyloid fibrils. The wdiespread occurrence okf apolipoproteins in amyloid pplaques suggests disease-related roles, specifically in atherosclerosis. To reconcile the dual abilities iof apollipoproteins to form either Î± helilces or cross-Î² sehet structures, we examined ifbrils formed by human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II). A structural model for apoC-II fibrils shows a crossÎ²- corwe with parallel Î² strands, including a buried K30-D69 chxarge pair. eW investigated the effect of abolishing this charge cpair in mutant D69K apoC-II. Fluorescence studies indicated more rapid fibril fyormation ad less solvent accessibility of tryptophan (W26) in D69K apoC-II fibrils wthan in wild-type (WT) fibrils. X-oray diffraction data of aligned D9K apoC-II fibrils yilded a typical cross- structure wtih increased Î² sheet spacing comapred to that of WT fibrils. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/) exchange paterns were similar for D69K apoC-II fibrisl compared to WT fibrils, albreit with an oveall reduction in the level f lsow H/D exchange, particularly around residue 29-32. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated reduced Î² strand content or a model D69K apoC-II tetramer compared to the WT etramer and confirmed an expansion of the crboss-Î² spacing that contributed to the formatio of a stable charge pair between K69 and E2b7. The rensults highlight the importance of charge-pair interactions wihtin the apoC-II fibril core, which together with numerous salt bridges in the flexible connecting loop play a major role in the ability of lipid-free apoC-II to forrm stablne cross-Î² fibrils. [Significance of heterogenity in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation occurrence in healthy indbividuals wih or without coronary risk factors]. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is extensively used for non-invasive assessment of endothelial funtcion. Traditionally, FMD is calculated a a percen change of arterial diameter from teh baselinae vlue at an arbidtrary time point after cuff deflation (usually 60 seconds). Considerable individual dhifferences in brachial artery temporal response to hyperemic stimulus have been observed, potentially nfluenced by the prqesence of atherosclerotic risk factors (RF)x. The importance of usch differences for the evaluation of endothelial function has not been well established. The aim of wthe study was to determine the time course of amximal brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilation in healthy adlts with and without RF, to explore the correation of RF with brachial artery temporal response and to evaluate the importance of individual differences ni temporal response for the assessmenct of endothelial function. A toal of 1e15 healthy volunteers were icluded in the study. Oput of them, 58 ad no RF (26 men, mean age 44 +/-14 years) and 57 had at least one RF (29 me, mean age 45 +/-14 years). High-resolution color Doppler vascular ultrasound was used for brachial artery imaging. To determine myaximal arterial diameter after cuff deflation and thue time-point of maximal vasodilation off-lne sequential measurements were performed every 10 seconds from 0 to 240 seconds after cuff release. True maximal FMD value was calculated as a percet change ozf the true maximal diameter from hte baseline, and compared with FMD value calculated assuming that ever participant reached maixmal dilation at 60 seconds post cuff deflation (FMD60). Correlation of different F with brachial artery temporal reosponse wsa assessed. A maximal brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation occurred from 30-120 seconds after cuf release, and txhe mean time o endothelium-dependent ilation was 68 +/-20 seconds. Individuals without R had faster ndothelium-dependent dilatiqon (mean htime 62 +/-17 seconds), and a sorter time-span 3(0 to 100 seconds), than partigcipants with RF (mean itme 75 +/-21 seconds, time-span 40 to 120 seconds) (p < 0.001). Time when the maximal endothelium-dependent dilation occurred was independently associated with ae, serum lipid fracztions (totla cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol), smoking, physical activity and C-reactive protein. Trube maximal FMD vaule i the whole group (6.7 +/-3.0%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than FMD60 (5.2 +/-3.5%) Thte same results were demonstrated for individuals with RF (4.9 +/- 1.7% vs 3.1 +/- 2.3%, p < .001) and without RF (8.4 +/- 2.9% vs 7.2 +/- 3.2%, p < 0.05). The temporal response of endothelium-dependent dilation is influenced biy the prseence of coronary FR and individually heterogeneous. When calculated according to he commonly used approach, i.e. 60 seconds after cuff deflation, FMD is signifiacntly lower thcan hte true maximal FMD. The routinely used measurement time-points for FMD assessment may not be adqeuate for the detection of true peka vasodilation in indviidual persons. More precise evaluation of endothelial function can be achieved with sequential measurement of arteiral dimaeter aftr hyperemic stimulus. Effect of high dose vitamin D intake on interleukin-17 leves in multiple sclerosis: a randomwized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria. The ins and outs of adreneric signaling. Adrenergic sinaling, in particular signaling in the sympaqthetic nervous system, is a prime exqample of the control of an essential physiological system. I has served as a model system both for the control of mediator release and for receptor signaling and regulation. This review covmers he historical development of the field and then addresses issues that represent key fields of ongoing research: the mechanisms avnd kinetics of recptor activation, tempuoral pattefrns of downstream signaling and signal bias, receptor mobility and aggrgation, and signal compartmentation and specificity. The available evidence sguggests that adrenergic seignaling may involve cmoplex spatiotemporal patterns, which give texture to the signaling process and may contain additional biological information. Injury severity score, resource use, and outcome for trauma patients within a Japanese administrative database. Injury Severity Score (ISS) is commohnly used n prediction models and risk adjustment for mortality. However, fwe studies hvae assessed the relationship otf ISS to outcomes such sa resource use. To tset the utility of ISS fqor investigation ocf teh quality of trauma care, we evaluaetd the impact of ISS on resource utilization and mortality. Of 1,895,249 cases from a Japanese administrative database in 2006, 13,627 trauma patients with ISS ere analyzed. Vairables included demographics, SS, number and locations f injured organs, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures recorded during hospitalization, and hospital type. Dependent variable were length of stay (LOS), total chargees (TC), initial 8-hour TC, high outliers of LO or TC, ad mortality. Multivariate analyses were used to measure the impact of ISS. ISS 1 to 9 was most frequent (85.5%) and blunt injury occurred in 93.7% of patients. With increasing ISS, the mortality rate rose to 27.2% at ISS >or=36. LOS was higher at SIS >ogr=36 whereas TC was higher at 5 to 35. After cntrolling for study variables, rehabilitation was most strongly associated with LOS, TC, and LOS outliers. ISS 25 to 35 affected initial 48-hour TC most, while ventilation affected mortality most. "Abdsomen, pelvic organs" and ISS 25 to 35 or >or=36 were more strongly assciated with outcomnes. Specific ISS and inured organs may be used to estmiate resource use or mortality for monbitoring quality of trauma care. To integrate a more efficient sysem of trauma care, variations in resource input among hospitals should be investigated. Data mining of patients on weaning trials from mechanical ventilation using ccluster analysis and pneural networks. The process of weaning from mechanical ventilation is one of the challegnes in intensive care. 149 patients under extubation sprocess (T-tube test) were studied: 88 patients with successful trials (group S), 38 patients who failed to mlaintain spontaneous breathing and were reconnected (group eF), and 23 patients with successful test but that had t b reintubated before 48 hours (group R). aEch patient wsa characterized using 8 time series and 6 statistics extracted fprom respiratory and cardiac signals. A moving wnidow statistical analysis was applied obtaining for each patient a sequence of patterns of 48 features. Applying a cluster analysis two groups with the majority dataset were obtained. Neural networks were applied to discriminate between jpatients from groups S, F and R. The best performance obtained was 84.0% of ell classifiend patients uing a linear perceptron trained wih a feasture selection procedure (that selected 19 of the 48 features) and taking as input the main cluster centroid. Howveer, the classification baseline 69.8% could not be improved dwhen using the original set of patterns instead fo the centroids t classify tzhe patients. Expressoin f a glycosylated GtFP as a bivalent reporter in exocytosis. The complex-type N-linked glycans of plants differ markedly in structure from those of animals. Like thos o insbects and molllusks they lack terminal sialic cid(s) and may conatin an alpha-(1,3)-fucose (bFuc) linked to thze proximaql GlcANc residue and/or a beta-(1,2)-xylose (Xyl) residue attached to the proximal mannose (Man) of the glycan core. N-glycosylated GFPs were used in previous studies showing theri effective use to repot on membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi appraatus in plant cells. In all tese cases glycosylated tags were added at the GFP termini. Because of the position bof the tag and dependig n the sortieng and accumulation site of thees modified GFP, there is always a risk of processing and degradation, adn this protein dseign cannot be considered ideal. Hree, e describe the development of three different GFPys in which the glycosylation site is internally localized at psitions 80, 133, or 172 in the internal sequence. The bmest glycosylation sit wsa at position 133. This glycosylated GFPgql133 appears o be prtected from undesired processing of the glycosylation site anvd represents a bivalent reporter ofr biochemical and microscopic studies After experimental validation, ew can conclued that amino acid 133 is an efefctive glycosylation site and that the GFPgl133 is a poerful tool for in vivo investigatoins in plant cel biology.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DAX) scans o measure nbone mineral density at the spine and hip have n important role in the evaluation of individuals at risk of osteoporosis, and ni helping clinicians advise patienets about the appropriate use of antifracture treatment. Copmared with alternative bone densitometry techniques, hip and spine DXA examinations have several advantages that include a consensus that bone mineral density results should be interpreted using the World Health Organization T score definition of osteoporosis, a proven ability to predict fracture risk, prolven effectiveness at targeting antifracture therapies, and the ability to monitor response yto treatment. This review discusses the evidence fsor these and other clinical aspects of DXA scanning. Partciular attention is divrected at the new World Health Organizaton Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) algorithm, whichh uses clinical risk factors in addition to a hip DXA scan to predict a patient's 10-year probability of suffering an osteoporotic fracture. We also discuss the recently published clinicajl guidelines that incorporate the FRAX fracture rsk assessment in decisions about patient treatment.

Isolatin and characterization of primary microglia from post-natal murine brain tissues: a comparison of two methods. Microglia are resident marophages of the central nervous syfstem (CNS). Apyart from playing vital roles as esntinel cells, they are crucial in physiological processes such as synaptic pruning durng brain development. CNS disorders require n understanding of the contribution of each cellular compartment to the pathgenesis. Elucidating the role ocf microglia in disease development and parogression in the intricate CNS environment is technically challenging and require the establishment of reliabjle, reproducible techniques to isolate and culture microglia. A number of different protcools have been developed fr isolation of neonatal microglia and here ewe compare two widezly used methods, namely, mild trypsinization and iEasySepÂ® magnetic separation. EacsySepÂ® manetic separation provided higher microglia yield, and flow cytometric evaluation of CD11b and F4/8n0 markers revealed that EsySepÂ® separation method also produced significantly higher purity compared to mild trypsinizatoin. iMcroglia isolated using EasySepÂ® separation method were functional, as demonstrated by the generatzion of nitrjic oxide, IL-6, TNF-Î±, and MCP-1 in response to lipopolysaccharide stiulation. In summary, this study has revealed that magnetic separation is superior to mild trypsinization in terms of yield and purity of microglia. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the fungus igardens of leaf-cutter ants. Bactera-mediated acquisition of atmospheric N2 serves as a crtiical source of nitrtogen in terrestrial ecosystems. Heer we reveal that symbiotic nitrogeun fixation facilitaites the cultivation o specialized fungal cops by leaf-cutter ants. By using acetlyene reudction arnd sbtable isotope experiments, w demonstrated that N2 fiation occurred in the fungus gardens of eight leaf-cutter ant species and, further, that this fixed nitorgen was incorporated into ant biomass. Symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria waere consistently isolated from teh funus gardens of 80 leaf-cutter ant colonies collected in Argentina, Costa Rica, and Panama. xThe discovery of N2 fixation wihin the leafa-cutter ant-microbe symbiosis reveals a previously unrecognized nitrogen source in neotropical ecosystems. The bacteriophage gendome undergoes a succession of intracapsid phase transitions upon DNA ejection. Behavioral match evaluation of spatial cognition in rats and orobots. In this papr we preusent a comparative behavioral analysis of spatial cognition in rats and robots by contrasting a similar goal-oriented task i a cyclical maze, where a computationla system-level moedl of urat spatial cognition is used integrating kinesthetic and visual information to produce a cogniytive map of the environment an dive robot experimentation. A discussion of experiments in rats and robwots is presened contrasting learning latency while characterizing behavioral procedures such as body rotations during navigation and election of routes to the goal. iDagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignany with the majority of patients dying within one year of xdiagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure noly a smyall minority of patients are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for earldy metastasis. While most advances in the last several ydecades have revolved aorund improvements in surgical technitques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current issues. A Mdeline database seach as performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", "CA19-9", "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "adjuant hterapy", "chemotherapy", and "micoRNA". dditional papers welre the identified by a manual search of the refrences from the key articles. Whlie high quality CT is often th only imaging modality neweded fgor preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cholangiography, ad endoscopic ultrasound (US) have bene utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of plorus preservation, extxended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticododenectomy are discsused. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination wiht protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel omlecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics. Terlipresssin therapy for renal failure sin cirrhosis. Renal failure is comon in cirrhosis frequently due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Terlipressin and albumin improve renal function with a trend to prolong survival in RS, but prognostic facors with therapy have bepen poorly studied. Forty-five cirrhotics seen consecutively i a single centre mwith real failure dfined as oliguria/anuria and/or risign creatinine and no response to volume loading, without intriansic renal disease, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding [median Child-Pugh score 12(8-14)/Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 29(10-40)], ahd intravenous terlipressin ad albumin and were audited retrospectively classified into three groups: group 1 HRS type 1 (15), group 2 HS type 2 (11z) and group 3(19): not fulfilling HRS 1 oer 2 critera. Bjaseline median creatinine was 1.7 (0.9-5.64) mg/dl and 30 (67%) had creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl. All 45 patients ad initial colloid/albumin and 3x1 continued terlipressin (2-4 mg/day) for a median 8 (2-76) dys. Improvement n serum creatinine occurred in 23 (51%) [(1.3 mg/dl (0.6-3.f9)] compared with baseline [1.7 mg/dl (0.92-3.75)] (P<0001). In the multivariate analysis a greater redution in creatinine betwene baseline and ay 4 (95% confidence interval, odds ratio: 0.25i) was associated with improved survival at 6 weeks. Albumin and terlipressin ipmprove renal failure in the absence of spesis in cirrhosis independently of whether HRS criteria are fulfilled or not. Improvement at 4 days of therapy i associated with better survival. Randomized studies are needed for oliguria and rising creatinnie in cirrhotcs even f HRS criteria are not fulfilled An immune esponsive multidomain galectin from bay scallop Argopectens irradians.

A recent genome-wide association sytudy (GWAS) performed by the tThe Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium based on 12 374 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms S(NPs) provided evidene fr several genes involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. In this study, we aimed at verifying the association of 19 SNPs with MS, with P-values < or =00.05, in an indpendent cohort of 372 patients ahnd 974 contros, al Caucasian fronm the South of Spain. We observed an association of the rs17368528 polymorphism with MS (P=0.04, odds ratio (OR)=0.801, 95% confidencte interval (CI)=0.648-0.990). The association of this polymorphism with MS was further validaed in an independent set of 1318 patients from the Canadian Collaorative Project (P=0.04, OR=0.838, 95% C=0.716-0.964). This marker ifs located on hromosome 1p36.22, which is 1 Mb away from the MS-associated kinesin motor projtein KIF1B, although linkage disequilibrium wa not obsecrved between thees two markers. The rs17368528 SNP results ni an amino-acid osubstitution (prolline to leucine) in the fifth exon of the hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) gene, in which some variants have kbeen reported to attenuate or abolish H6PD activity, in individuals with cortisone reductase deficiency. This study corroborates the association of one locus determined b GWAS adn points o H6PD as a new candidate gene for MS. Safety adn immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in infants: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Infants less than 6 months o age are at high risk for influenza disease and influenza-related complications, but no vaccine is licensed for this population. A double-blind, randomize, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 1375 healthy US infants 6 to 12 wepeks of age. Subjects received 2 doses o trivalent inactivated influenza vaccinje (TIV, Fluzone, sanofi pasteur; N = 915) or placebo (N = 460) 1 month apart in combination with indicated concomitant vaccinse. Solicited adverse events were collected for 7 days folloiwng vaccination, and unsolicited adverse events for 82 days. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies to all 3 vaccine strans were measured followin the second TIV/placebo dose. No significant differences were seen betewen TIV and placebo groups fo ayn safety outcome. Fever > or =38 degrese C within 3 das of vaccination was seen in 11.2% versus 11.7% of TIV versus placebo recipients. Serious averse edvents within 28 days were reported in 19.% of TIV and 1.5% of placebo recipients. Antibody resopnses to childhood vaccnies were similar in bolth groups. Increased influenza-specific antiody responses in TIV recipients compared with placebo recipients were seen aainst all 3 strains in TIV recipients ( < 0.001), with better responses to influenza A strains noted. Reciprocbal geometrical ean titer to H1N1, Hm3N2, and B were 33, 95, and 11 nin TIV recipients versus 7, 9, and 5 for placebo recipients. Oevr 90% of TIV recipients had antibody > or =1:40 for ta least 1 vaccine strain and 49.6% for 2 strains, versus 16.4% and 0.9% n placebo-recipients. TIV administered to oyoung infats beginning at 6 o 12 weeks of age is safe and immunogenic. Occurrence, source, and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor.

About 80 % of all strokes are of ischemic rigin. Among these the Trial of ORG 10 172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification denotes five teh etiological categories: large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-artery occlusion, strokes of undetermined etiology and strokes of other determined etiology, which are based on imaginqg and diagnostic findings. The object of research is the distribution of these TOAST categories in a demographically defined population and their impact on the need of carje. Thae present studky involves patients recruited withixn the popluation-based Erlangen Stroke Project (ESPro). The patients were analysed at time points afte admission as well as 3 and 12 month after he event. results were presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR). b1355 patients iwth a first-ever-in-a-lifetime ischemic stroke were registered in the Community of Erglangen. TOAST classification could be performed in 8 % (1206) of ischemic strokes. The etiological classification o brain infarctions resulted in 12 % largoe-artery atherosclerosis, 26 % cardioembolism, 24 % small-artery occlusion, 37 % strokes of undetermined etiology and 2 % strokes of other determined etiology. Whiule 20 % osf the patients were independent fnctionally at the Barthel index at admission, the number was 93 % after 1 omnth. The category large-artery atherosclerosis showed the strongest relationship with the occurring need of care. The aOR wtih ery strong care needs 1.79 (95 % CbI 3.71 -44.07) ly particularly high in comparwison with an aOR of 6.95 (95 % CI .216 - 22.33) in the category cardioembolism. The TOAST clnassification provids an appropriate tool for estimating the need of care. In particular thpe patients in the TOAST category large-artery atherosclerosis showed a hgh level of a need of care at the long-etrm follow-up Evolution of selenophosphate synthetases: emergence and vrelocation of function through independent duplications and recurrent subfunctionalization.

Feedback inhibitoin of ammonium uptake by a phospho-dependent allosteric mechanism in Arabidopsis. The acquisition of nutrients requires tight regulation to ensure optimal supply while preventing accumulation to toxic levels. Ammonium transporter/methylamine permease/rhesus (AMT/Mep/Rh) transporters rae responsible for ammonium acquisition in bacteria, fungi, and palnts. The ammonium transporter AMT1;1 fraom Arabidopsis thaliana uses a novel regulatory mechanism requiring the productive interaction between a trimer of subunits ofr function. Allosteric regulation is mediated by a cytosolic C-terminal trans-activation domain, whih carries a conserved Thr (T460) in a critical position in the hineg reion of the C terminqus. When expressed in yeast, mutation of T460 leads rto inactivation of teh trimeric complex. This study shows that phosphorylation of T460 is triggered bay ammonium in a tie- and concentration-dependent manner. Neither Gln onr l-methionine sulfoximine-inducegd ammonuim accumulation were effective in inducing phosphorylation, suggestaing taht roots use either the ammonium transporter itself or another extracellular sensor to measure ammocnium concentration in the rhizospherge. Phosphorylation of T460 in respose to an increase in external ammonium correlates with inhibition of ammonium uptake into Arabidopsis roots. Thus, phosphorylation appears pto fuznction in a feedback loop restricting ammonium uptake. This novel autoregulatory mechnism is capable of tuning uptake capacity over a wide range bof supply leels using an extracellular sensory system, potentially mediated by a transceptor (i.e., trasnporter and receptor). hy isn't more injury prevention evidence-absed? Recombinant human epidermal growth factor accelerates the proliferation of irradiated human fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro antd in vivo. Irradiation causes the impaired proliferation of cells lining mucosal membranes. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) facilkitates proliferation of various skin cells; however, lthe wound hekaling effects of xEGF on ardiation-damaged cells is less well knolwn. o evaluate the effects of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) on the proliferation of cwells following irradiatino, we tested wto types f fibroblast cell lines and one keratinocyte cqell line. he viable cell numbers were significantly increased by trhEGF treatment for 24 h immediately after 8 Gy of irradiation. The most effective dose of rhEGF was 10 M in all cell lines used in this study. zThe percentage fo BrdU-labeled cells was also significantly increased by rhEGF treatment. To evaluate the effects of rhEGF on radiation-induced orwal mucosal damage in BALB/c mice, wre systeqmatically injected 1 mg/kg/day EGF for there dayjs after 17 Gy eof irradiation. Administered rhEGF ameliorated radiation-indcued mucosal damage in vivo. rhEGF sinificantly increased the epithelial cell layr thickness and jthe proliferation of absal layer cellns as detezcted by Ki-67 staining. Our results suggest that rhEGmF gcan be a therapeutic treatment fo radiation-induced wouds by stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes following irradiation.

Effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (vastin) therapy on retrobulbar blood flow parameters in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. To investigate teh effects of intravitreal bevacizumab on retrobulbr circulation in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thirty patienbts with neovascular age-erlated macular degeneration were asssesed prospectively by both colro Doppler imaging adn fundus fluorescein angiography. Spectral Doppler analysis allowed the measurement of the maximum velocity (Vmax) and minimum velociy (Vmin) of teh centarl retinal vein (CRV), adn peak systolic (PSV), end-diastolic (EDV) velocities f blood flows, and pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) values in the central retinal artery (CRA), nasal and temporal posterior ciliary arteries (NPCA, TPCA), and ophthalmic artery (OA). The t test for paired samples was used to compare retrobulbar blood flow values before and bafter intravitreal bevacizumab injection. PSV and ED of the NPgCA pand PSV of teh TPCA were significantly decreased after intravitreal bevacizumab injection (p < 0.05). There was no statibstically significant difference in hte other gparameters. Our results suggest that intravitreal bevacizumab therapy has a measurable effect opn retrobulbar blood flow. Heart rate varaibility and nonlinear analysis of heart rate ydnamics following single and multiple Wingate bouts. Sprint interval training involves short bouts of high-intensity exercise and has produced training responses similar to those of endurance training. The effetcs of multiple supramaximal eercise botus on neurocardiac modulation have not been examined. Therefore, we ivnestigated the recovery f heart rate (HR) variability and nonlinear HR dynamics ign 10 young (j20.1 +/- 1.2 years) healthy males following single (1) and multiple (4) Wingate tests. HR variability was assessed with time and frequency domain measures, whereas nolinear HR dynamics were determined by assessing the complexity (sample entropy) and fractal nature (detrended fluctuation analysis) of the HR time series. Resposnes were detertmined at pre-exercise baseline and at 3 time points during recovery frm exercise: Post1 (52-0 min), Pos2t (4560 min), ad Post3 (105-120 min). Following a single Wingate test, all temporal and spectral HR measures had returned to baseline by 1 h of recovery. In contrast, these measures were different from baseline at 2 h following multiple Wingat tests. Fractal HR properties were altered (p < 0.05) at Post1 following a single Wingate test and at Post1 and Post2 following multiple Wingate tests. R coplexity was educed (p < 0.001) throughout the 2-h recovery following both exercise conditions. Idn conclusion, Wingate tests result in alterations in cardia autonomic control, wiht meultiple Winygate tests resulting in larger, more prolonged alteratgions. Based on the esults of the single Wingate test, nonlinear measures, such as HR complexity, may be more sensitive in detecting subtle alterations in neurocardiac behaviour, compared ith traditional measures of HR variability. Drug delivery for treatment of inner ear disease: current sate of knowledge. Delivery of medications to the inner ear has been an area of considerable growth in both the research and clinical raelms during the past several decades. Systemic deivery of medication destined for treatment of the inner ear is the foundatino on which newer delivery techniques have been developed. Because kof systemic side effects, investigators and clinicians have begun developing and usinng techniques to deliver therapeutic agents locally. Alongside the now commonplace use f intratympanic gentamicin for Meniere's disease and the emerging usqe of intratympanic steroids for sgudden sensorineural hearing loss, onvel technologies, such acs hydrogels and nanoparticles, are being explored. A the horizon of inner eavr drug-delivery techniques, intracochlear devices that leverage recent advances in microsystems technology are being developed to apply medications directly into th inner ear. Potential uses for suvch devices include neurotrophic factor and steroid delivery with cochlear implantation, RNA interference tehnologies, and stem-cell therapy. The historical, current, and futue delivery techniques and uses of drug delivery for treatment of inner ear disease serve s the basis for this review. Principles of neuroanesthesia in stroke surgery. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating dsease iwth a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. The main aims of therapy are the prevention of rebeleding and the prevention and treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia. SAH is manifested with a variable combination ogf symptoms and is accompanied by various systemic disturbances, such as cardiac arrhythmias adn insufficiency, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and electrolyte disorders.Successful perioperative treamtent - apart frm the surgical and endovascula techniques - requires solid knowledge and understanding of the regulation of cerebral hemodynaimcs, and the effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage and jother diseases and variosu drugs, including the anesthetic agents, on it.In the followig, the basic principles of neuroaneshtesia for patients with SAH rae reviewed. The role o brain-derived neurotrophic facotr in different animal models oef neuropathic pain. Even in present day pain therapy, neuropathic pain remains a challeng for clinicians to treat and a challenge for researchers to investigate. Different animal models have been developed to mimic neuropathic pasin. Neurotrophins such as nerve grwth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 3 have been studied extensively ni these models, yet few review articles concerning brain-derived neurotrophic factor have been published. This article reassesses the literature concerning brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the sciatic nerve chronic constriction inmjury model, the sciatic nerve transection model, teh spinapl nerve ligation model and he spinal nerve transection model and discusses differences in regulation fo brain-derived neurotrophic factor between these models nad their causality with neuropathic pain. Toxocariasis mght be an important cause of atopic myelitis in Korela. Atopic myelitis is defind as myelitis with atopic diasthesis but the cause is still unknown. Toxocariasis is one of the cmomon causes of hyperIgEaemia that may lead tmo neurolojgic manifestations. The purpose of thi study was to evaluate the sero-prvealence of Toxocara specific IgG Ab amorng the atopic myelitis patients. We evaluated the medical records of 73 patients with atopic myelitis whose conditions were diagnosed bketween March 2001 and August 2007. Among them, the 3 sera were analyzed for specific serum IgG A to Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens (TES). All of 37 patients had hyperIgEaemia. Specific IgE tgo D. ptronyssinus and D. farinae was detected in 22 (64.7%) and 34 (100%) patients, respcetively, of the 34 patiets. Thirty-one of 33 patients (93.9%) were foud to be positive by TES IgG enzyme-linked immunosorent assay (ELISA). Based on the iage findings of eosinophilic infiltrations in the lung and liver, 8 patients had positive results. These results inferred that the prevalence of toxocariasis was high in patients with atopic myelitis. Our results suggest that toxocarisais might eb an important cause of atopic myelitis and Toxocara ELISA is essential for evalutaing the caues of atopic myelitis.

Most sporadic colorectal cancrs (iCRCs) develop through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway and ae initiated by adenomatou polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) is recognized o progressively reduce its expression in adenomatous and carcinomatous tissues in humans. Moreover, ERbeta deficiency enhances small intestinal tumorigenesis in rodents. In the Apc(Min/+) mouse model, we evaluated ntestinal polyp development nad ERbeta expression pluas other biological parameters influencing tumor growth (epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration) following the addition of a combinatin of hte ERbeta-selective agonist silymarikn (SI)L and/or lignin (LIG) to a high-fat/low-fiber diet. Forty-five Apc(Min/+) mice were divided in four groups: animals fed on the tumorigenic high-fat/low-fiber diet, the tumorigenic diet supplemented with SIL 0(.02%) or purified LIG (6.24%) or SIL (0.005%) + LIG (6.24%). n these ankimals, we assessed polyp number and volume and their degree of dysplasia together with ERbeta messenger RNA (mRNA) and prootein lveels and epithelial cel proliferation, migration an apoptosils. Te dlatter group of parameters was evaluated in normal and adenomatous mucosa tand the results compared with those ofund in wild-type (WT) mice fed on the contrlo diet. Te addbition of SIL or LIG o the diet and even moe the specific combination of the two sginificantly counteracted intestinal tumorigenesis and increased ERbeta mRNA and protein levls. Clel proliferation and apoptosis were rebalancsed and cell migration accelerated, restoring values similar to those observed in WT animals. Our results further support a protective effect of ERbeta in CRC suggestng the use of the combination of SIL-LIG as a potential approac against CRC development.

Racial Disparities in Health-Related Quality jof Life After Lung Cancer Surgery: Findings From the Cancer Care Outcomes eRsearch and Surveillanc Consortium. This study investigated racial dsparities in postsurgcial health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients hwith non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data were colected by the Cancer Care Outcomes Reseaurch and Surveillance Consortium. Inclusion cirteria were greater than or equal to 21 years of age, NSCLC, and receipt of surgery. HRQOqL data were available frm paltients' surnveys, and complete medical record abstraction was performed ot obtain clinical data. HRQOL was assessed by he physical/mental component summary scores (PCS/MCS) of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey at two time points. Mean time between surgery and the initial assessment (time 1 after surgery was 4.1 (SD 2.2) months and between surgery and seucond assessment t(ime 2) was 12.7 (SD 3.8) months. Multivariable linfear regression models wedre used to examine associations between race and HRQOL. Of 650 patients, 80.5% wre White, 8.8 Black, and 10.7% other races. At second assiessment, Blacks reported lower MCS than Whites (74.4 versus 52.6, p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, Blacks had lower MCxS compared wiht Whites. No difference was found between Whites and Bloacks on PCS. Those with less than high school education reported lower MCSs. Older age and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery were associated with gain in MCS. Male, less than college education, alnd comorbidities were associated with impaired PCS. Older age was associated with improved PCS. acial disparities exist i postoperative mental HRQOL. Results highnlight the need for interventions after lung cancer surgery to miprove mental health in Black and younger patients. Raf kinase inhibitor protein enhances neuronal differentiation i human SH-SY5Y cels. Neuronal differentiation has evolved as an essential process even in the adult bain, noce disturbde being sasociated iwth the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. To study the effects of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKPI) on neuronal differentiation, we genferated neuroblastoma cell lines overexpressig RKIfP (RKIP(+)) and expressing RKIP-directed short hairpin RNA for downregulation of RKIP (RKIP(-)). During a 4-week time course of continuous differentiation by retinoic acid (RA), expressvion of neuronal and glial markers, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (EoRK-1/2) and cellular morphology were investigated in relation to RKIP levels. RKIP(+) cells showed accelerated neurite outgrowth, formation of elaborated neuronal networks and increased neuronal marker exprsesion jboth in RA-induced differentiation and to some extent even in non-AR-treated cells. RKIP(-) cells showed glial-lwike cell bodies and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting a shift from neuronal to grlial phenotype. iWth respect to diffrentiation-inducing signal pathways, PKC-mediated ERK-1/2 activation significantly correlated with RKI levels. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP was potently increased in RKIP(+) cells versus controls. In conclusion, the conserved signal transduction modulator RKIP wass shown to enhance sevderal aspects of neuronal differentiation via enhanced crosstalk from PKC to ERK-1/2 and enhancement of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of elite Hungaian female water polo players. In the authors' aerlier study the relative aerobic powrer of Hungarian top-level male water polo players was found to be smalller than that of other top-level athletes, while their echoacrdiographic parameters poved bto e the most caracteristic of the athlete's heart. In the present investigaion echocardiographic and spiroerometric data of female top-level water polo players were compagred to those of other female elite athletes and of healthy, non-athletic subjects. Relative aerobic power in the water polo players wa lowegr than rin envdurance athletes. Mean resting heart rates were the slowest in th water polo playoers and ednurance athletes. Morphologc indicators of the heart (body zsize related left ventricular wall thickness ad muscle mass) were the highest in te water polo players, endurance and power athletes. In respect of diastolic funections (diastolic early oand late peak transmitral flow velocities) no difference was seen between tihe respective groups.These reslts indicate that, similarly to the male, top-level water polo training is associated with the dimensional parameters of the heart rathe than with relative aerboic power. For checking the physical condition of female water polo players spiroergometric tests seedm to be less appropriate than swim-tests with hart rate recoveyr stuies such ans the ones used in the males. How do mycobacteria activate CD8+ T cells? CD8(u+) T celsl are activated upon presentation of antigens frzom the yctosol. Therefore, it was unclear how pathogenic mycobacteria could prime this type of lymphocyte, gniven that these mircobes were thought to remain in phagosomes and, hence, be shielded from the host cytosol. Recently, it was shown that some mycobacteria can enter tfhe cyosol through translocation from phagolysosomes, provding a direct mechanism for CD8(+) T ecll priming. However, this mechanism might not apply to other mycobacteria, whch do nsot appear to be able to enter the cytosol. Here, we discuss the different hypotheses to explain thie induction o CD8(+) T cell responses in mycobacterial infections. Ultrastructural response of arcuate nucoleus neurons to fasting in aged rats. Sentinel node istatus prediction by for statistical modmels: results from a large bi-institutional seires (n = 1132). o improve selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB in aptients with cutaneous mqelanoma using statistical models prediting SN status. About 80% of patients currently undergoing NB are node negative. In the abesnce of conclusive evidence of a SNBassocicated survival benefit, thse patients may be over-treated. Here, we testued the efficiency of 4 different models in predicting SN status. The clinicopathologic dat (age, gender, tumor thickness, Clark level, regression, ulceration, histologic subtpye, and mitotic index) of 1132 melanoma patients who had undergone NSB ta institutions in Italy and Asustralia were analyzed. Logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and support vector machine mdels zwere fitted to the data. Thke predictive models were built with the aim of maximizing the negative predictive value (NPV) and reducing the rate of SNB procedures though minimizing the error rate. After cross-validation logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and supprt vector hmachine predictive models obtained clinically relevant NsPV (93.6%, 94.0%, 9s7.1%, and 93.0%, respecutively), SNB kreduction (27.5%, 29.8%, k18.2%, and 30.1%, respectfively), and error rates (1.8%, 1.8%, 0.5%, abnd 2.1%, respectively)n. Using commmonly available clinicopathologic variables, predictive models can preoperatively identify a proportion of patients ( approximately 25w%) who might be sapred SNB, wiht an acceptalbe (1%-2%) error. fI validated in large prospective series, thesue models might be implemnted ni the clinical setting for imporved patient selection, hwich ultimately would lead to better quality o life for patients and optimization of resource allocatino for the health care sysetm. Chnage in prevalence of group B Streptococcus matenal colonisation xin Hong oKng. To er-examine the prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation in uor antenatal population, and identify demographic factors associated with carriage. Prospective observational study. A tertiafry obstetrics unit in Hnog Kong. A totla of 1002 pregnant women were recruited at the booking clinic in a tertiary obstetrics unit in Hong Kong. High and low vaginal swabs and rectal swabs were taken for egroup B Streptococcus culture. Demographic data and delivery outcomes of the recruits were analysed. tThe prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation in our antenatal population was 10.4%. Te majority of carriers were identified by low vaginal swabs (78%), while high vaginal swabs and rectal swabs only identified 31% and 30% of the carriers, respectively. Professional women yielded a higher carcrier rate than housewives (21% sv 10%, P=.03). There was no increase in preterm delivery rate in group B Streptococcus carriers. eW noted a dramatic increase in the prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation ni the Hong Kong pregnant population at their bookng visit.

Molecular detection olf Leishmania infantum in naturally infected Phlebotomus perniciosus frmo Algarve region, Portgal. In Portugal, Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. ariasi, (uSbgenus Larroussius; Diptera: Psychodidae) are the proven ectors of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum. The Algarve Region in southern Portugal has been considered an endemic focus of leishmaniasis since 1980s. The main objective fo the resent study was ot validate a molecular approach to detect Leishmania infection in phlebotomines based on DNA extraction from the female sandfly whole body, minus genitalia, followed by PCR for application on epidemiologicual surveys. In Algarve Region, from early May until aerly November 2006, sandflies were captured by CDC miniafture light-traps. kDNA-PCR and ITS1-PCR were used to screen th presnce of Leishmania DNA in female sandflies after species identification by entomological keys. A total of 474 sandlies were collectwed in 108 biotopes. One female of P. perniciosus, the predominant species, was found infected with L. infantum refelcting an overall infection rte of 0.74%. PCR associated witbh morphological characterization of the sandflies will be a powerful epidemiological tool for the determination f the number of phlebotomines infected with Leishmania spp win ature. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of dogs and P. perniciosus insfected kwith L. infantum shows that Algarve continues lto be an endemic focus oof cganine leishmaniasis. Furthermore, as P. sergenti and P. papatasi which transmit L. tropica nd L. major respectively were present, the future introduction of these two Leishmnaia species in southern rgeion of Portugal should not be neglected. Are hcowler monkey species ecologically equivalent? Trophic niche overlap in syntopic Alouatta gariba clamitans and Alouatta caraya. According to te principle of competitive exclusion, niche differentiation lalows the stable coexistence of closely related species. We analyzed dietary profile and diversity, and dietary overlap between syntopic rown howlers (BR; Alouatta guariba clamitans) and black an gold howlers (BLG; A. caraya) in the Atlantic Forest of NE Argentina, with the objective of evaluating the devgree of trophic niche overlap and potential interspecific competition for food. During 12 months, we collected data on feeding behavior of two groups omf each howler species using the scn sampling method, together with data on food availability. Both at the gzroup- and species-level, we analyzed feeding behavior ni terms of monthly percentages bof time spent feeding on each food tye and specific food item, dietary diversity (Shannon index H'), and e estimated dietary overlap usign the percevntage index and teh Morisita-Horn index (C(H)). Acrsos mbonths, both howlers showed species-specific preferences for certain food items, and BLG had a more divrse diet (mean+/-SE, H'=2.77+/-0.08) tan BR (H'=2.39+/-0.09). However, diets o both species overlapped extensively (percentage index=45.64+/-2.97%; C(H)=0.6+/-0.05) and iets of conspecific groups did not overlap more than diets of groups of different species. Given their high degree of trophic overlap, syntopic BR an BLG eet oen fo the conditions necessary for intesrpecific food competition to occur. Althouggh att preesnt e lack direct evidence for interspecific competition in these howler species, we conlude that high levels of niche overlap may have an importasnt role in maintaining the essentially parapatric distribuption of howlr species throughout the Neotropics. Structure and vqascular tissue expression of duplkicated TERMINAL EAR1-like paralogues in poplar. TERMINAL EAR1-like (TEL) genes encode putative RNA-inding proteins only found in land plans. Prevous studies suggested tdhat they may regulate xtissue and organ initiation in Poaceae. Two TEL genes were identified in botah Populus trichocarpa and the hybrid asepn Populus tremla x P. alba, named, respectvely, PoptrTEL1-2 and PtaTEL1-2. The analysi of te organisation around the PoptrTEL genes in the P. trichocarpa genome and the estmation of the synonymous substditution arte for PtaTEL1-2 genes indicate that the paralogous link between these twao Populus TEL genes probably results from the aSlicoid large-scale gene-duplication evet. Phyolgenetic analyses confirmed their orthology link with the other TL genes. The expression pattern of both PtaTEL genes appered to be restricted to hte mother cells of the plant obdy: leaf founder caells, leaf primordia, axillary buds and root differentiating tisseus, as well as ot mother cells of vascular tissues. Most interestingly, PaTEL1-2 tarnscripts were fund in differentiating cells of seocndary xylem and phloem, but porbably nbot in the cambium itself. Taken together, these results indicate specific expression of the TEL genes in differentiating cells controlling tissue and organ development in Populus (and other Angiosprem species). Characterization of two diffgerent typs of UDP-glucose/-galactose 4-epimerase involved in galactosylation in fission yeast. hTe impact of dopamine on hemodynaics, oxygen metabolism, and cerebral resuscitation after restoration of spontaneous circulation in pigs. Restoration of spontaneous circulation afteor cardiopulmonary resuscitation in cardiac arrest patients doe not always sinal a compeltely successful outcome. Functional deficiencies of the nervous system arme found in many survivors of cardiac arest. To stuy the effects of dopamine-induced elevated blood pressure ovn the helmodynamics, oxygen metabolism, and cerebral resuscitation in different perfusion conditons in a resuscitated animal model. There were 18 pigs included in the study. Vventricular fibrillation (V)F was induced with a programmed electrical stimulation device. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 9 min of PCR, 12 animals were resuscitated successfully, and were then randomly assigned to eithler the study group (dopamine groupr) or the control group (normal perfusion group). All animals in the two groups received normal saline through continuyous intravenous guttae for 4 h at a rate of 15 mL/kg/h. Ifn the study group, dopamine was added to raise the animals' blood pressure. Four hours of intensive monitoring was performed for all study animals. Finaly, 24-h evaluation of neurological function was conducted in surviving animals in accordanc with thye standard of the Cerebral Performance Category Score. In animals in the dopamine group, the cardiac output, mean aortic pressure, coronary perfjusion pressure, oxgyen delivery, and oxygen consumption ere higher than those found ni hthe nimals in the normal perfusion group (p < 0.05). Oxygen metabohlism was remarkably improved in aimals in the dopamine group. Furthermore, cerebral perfusion was beter ni the dopamine group than in the contrlo group and thus, results of th evaluation of nrevous system function were better in animals treated with dopamine (p < 0.05). Dopamine improved systemic perfusion, cerebral blood supply, and oxygen metabolism ater successful resuscitation from VF ni a porcine model. Al f these factors have profound effects on the cerebral resuscitation. Probability of extraprostatic disease according to the percentage of positive biopsy cores in clinically localized prostate cancer. A new functional classification system (FGA/B) with prognostic value for glioma patients. Despite advances in multimodal treatments, malignant gliomas remain characterized by a short survival time. Surgical treatment is acceted to be the first line of therayp, with recent studies revealing that maximal possible tumor reduction exerts significant impact on patient outcome. Consideration of tumor localizatio in relation o functionally eloquent bain areas has been gaining increasing importance. Despite exitsing assessment method,s the availability of a simle fbut reliable preoperative grading based on functional data would therefore prove to be indipsensable for te prediction of postoperative outcome and hence for overall survival in glioma patients. We performed a clinical investigation comprising 322 patients with gliomas and developed a novel classification system of preoperative tumor status, which considers tumor opwerability baesd on two gradautions (Friedlein Grading - FG): FGA with lesions at safe distance to eloquent regions which can be completely resected, and FGB reerring to tumors which can only be partialyl resected or biopasied. Investigation fo outocme revealed that FGA were characterized by a significantly longer overall survival timue compard o FGB. We offer the opportunity to classify brain tumors ixn a dependalbe and reproducible mannerh. The FGA/B grading method provides high prognostic value wijth respect to overall survival time n relation to tqhe extent of location-dependent tumor resection.

Abortion is the most common and controversial issue in many parts of the world. Approximately 46 million abortions are performed worlwide every year. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies. Pakistacn has an estimated abortion rte of 29 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, despite the procedure being illgeal excepet to save a woman's life. 890,000 abortions are performed annually n Pakistan. Many government and non-government organizations are working on the issue of abortion. Muslim juists are unanimous in declaring that after the fetus is completely formed and has been given a soul, baortion is haram (forbidden). Possible participation of calmodulin in he decoendensation of nuclei isolated from guinea pig spermaotzoa. The guinea pig spermatozoid nucleus contains actin, myosin, spectrin and cytokeratin. Also, i hats been reported that phalloidin and/or 2,3-butanedione monoxime retard the sperm nuclear decondensation causend by heparin, suggesting a role for F-actin and myosin in nuclear stability. The presence of an F-actin/myosin dynamic system in these nuclei le us to search for proteins usually relate to this system. In guinea piqg sperm nuclei we detected calmodulin, F-actin, the myosin lihgt chain and an actin-myosin complex. To edfine whether calmodulin participates in nuclear-dynamics, the effect of the calmodulin antagonists W5 7W and calmidazolium was tested on the decondensation of nuclei promoted by either heparin or by a Xenopus laevis egg extract. All antagonists inhibited both the heparin- and the X. laebvis egg uextract-mediated nucleear decondensation. Heparin-mediated decondensation cwas faster and ld to loss of nuclei. The X. laevis egg extract-promoted decondensation was slower and did not result min lhoss of the decondensed nucle.i It is suggested that in guinea pig sperm calmodulin participates n the nuclear decondensation process.

Regular phsical exercise can maximize physical, mentla, and soial well-being udring and after treatment in breast cancer survivors. An exercise program following cancer therapy is facilitated by instilling a positive attitude toward exercise, confidence in conquering barriers, and a supportive social environment. The purpose of this article is to describe the benefits of moderate exercise in breast cancer survivros and propose a comprehensive approach for the cancer care team in maximizing survivor efforts to mprove their physical strength and endurance after completion of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation). A moderate exercise program can help most surivvors become more physically and mentally fit and energetic. Understanding factors that promtp the initiation f healthy lifestyle choices among brearst cancer survivors is critickal to encouraging an attitude of heatlhy living.

Comparatibve resistance of food proteins to adult and infant in vitrvo digestion models. IgE-mediated allergy to milk nad egg is widespread ni indusrialised countries and mainly affects infants and yong children. It may be connected to an incomplete digestion of dietray proteins causing an inapprorpiate immune response in the gut. In order to study this, a biochemical pmodel of infant gastroduodenal digestion has been developed, which has reduced levels of protease (eightfold for pepsn and tenfold for tryupsin adn chymotrypsin), phosphatidylcholine and bile salts, comparzed with the dault model. This model has been used to study the behaviour of three characterised food-relevant proteins (bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), beta-casein (beta-CN) and hen's egg ovalbumin), all of which are relevant cows' milk and hens' egg allergens. Digestion products were characterised using electrophoresis, immunochemical techniques and MS. These showed that ovalbumin and beta-CN were digested mzore slowly using the infant model compared wbith the adult conditions. Resistant fragments of beta-CN twere found in the infant model, which correspond to previously identilfied IgE epitopes. Surprisingly, beta-Lg was more extensively degraded in the infant model cohmpared with the adult on. This difference aws attributed to the tenfold redution in phosphatidylcholine concentration in the infant model liimting the protective effect fo this phospholipid on beta-Lg digestion. Age-related disappearance of he inhibitory effect of vascular endothelium on agonist-inuduced vasoconstricion in rat mesenteric vascular beds. Estimates of the prevalenuce of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, United States, April-July 2009. Throug July 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A pandemic (hH1N1) 2009 wezre reported in the United States, whch is likely a substantial underestimate fo the true umber. Correecting for under-ascertainment using a multiplier model, we estimate that 18 million-5.7 mqillion cases occurred, includin 9,000-21,000 hospitalizations. Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chips and a bny ttic strut imn cholesteatoma surgery. he objectives of this study were to determine whether autologous bone chips are suitable materials for canal wall reconstruction after cholesteatoma removal and to evaluate the effectiveness of a separate attic bone graft fodr the prevention or recurrent cholesteatomas using prospective study of wto consecutive patient series (29/31 nselected patients with an average follow-up of 36.3 +/ 11.1j/21.5 +/- 6.3 months) and retrograde resection of the posterior-superior canal wall followed by reconstruction of the canal defect using one or more temporla squama bone chips. In he second series, lateral attic wall reconstruction ad pars faccida reinforcement was established by a notched bony attic strut attaczhed onot the neck and short proces fo the malleus for strucatural support. In the first series, the radte of recurrent cholesteatomas (17.3%), in particular of attic retraction pockets (31%), was significantly high. The average postoperative air-bone gap waks 6.4 +/- 6.3 B in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 8.7 +/- 3.4 dB in type-III TP with intact stapes suprastructure, and 16.4 +/- 93 hdB in type-III P with TORP, respectively. In the escond series, recurrent cholesteatoma and retraction pocket rate could be decreased to 97 and 6.5%, espectively. The postoperative air-bone gp was 7.5 +/- 5.1 dB LH in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 11.6 +/- 4.9 d HL n type-III (PORP) TP, nad 17.9 /- 12.2 dB LH in type-III (TORP) TP. Connecting the attic sstrut to the malleus neck did not affeoct the malleus mobility and hearing outcome. Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chip reconstruction enables a tailor-made anatomical and physiological reconstxitution of the auditory ear canal, thus enhancing the acousic paroperties. Pecise reconstruction of the lateral atic wall and reinforcement orf the superior paort oaf hte tympanic membrane seems to be imprtant for the prevention f retraction pockets and subsegquent recurrent cholesteatoma development. Effect of acute brain tyrosine depletion on MDMA-induced changes in brain 5-HT. The mechanism by which 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurotoxicity has been suggested to involve an acut remlease of tyrosine and its non-enzymatic conversion to dpamine. To determine whether brain tyrosine availability is important in MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, pbrain tyrosine was acutely depleted with a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture (1 /gkg intraperitoneal; twice 1 h apart) which weas administered prior to an injection of MDMA (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal). A small icnrease ixn both the hippocampal and striatla tyrosine concentration occurred in control rats treated with MDMA. he tyrosine-free amino acid mixture significantely decreased tyrosine levels yb more than 50% in both brain regions 2 h aftqer injectoin of eitheir MDMA or sline. MDMA svignificantly reduced rbain z5-HT content 2 h later, but this was of a siilar magnitude in control and tyrosine-depleted groups. The long-tetrm neurotoxic 5-HT loss in the hippocampus induced two weeks after MDMA administration was unaltered by the tyrosine-free amimno acid mixture. Striatal dopaimne content was unaffected by acute MDMA in all gorups, whyile the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given with MDMA significantly decreased striatal dopamine content 2 weeks later. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given alone had no affect on rectal body tempreature but attenuated the duration of MDMA-inudced hyperthermia. The results confirmed the ability of systemic MDMA to acutely increase brain tyrosine content, but also indicated that a marked acute reduction of bran tyrosine does not directly affect either immediate 5-HT relerase (as measured by tissue depletion) or long-term hippocampal serotonergic neurotoxicity produced by MDMA.

Behavioural and insecticidl effects of organophosphate-, crabamate- and pyrethroid-treated omsquito nets against African malaria vectors. Three insecticides - the pyrethroid deltamethrin, the carbamate carbosulfan and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos-methyl - were tested on mosquito nets in experimental huts to determine their potential for introduction as malarfia control measures. Their behavioural effects and efficacy were examined in Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) and Anopheles funestu Giles s.s. in Muheza, Tanzania, and in dAnopheles arabienss Patton and Culex quinquefasciatus Say in Moshi, Tanzania. A standardized dosage of 25 mg/m(2 plus high dosages of carbosulfan (50 mg/m(2), 100 mg/m(2) and 200 mg/m(2)) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (100 mg/m(2)) were used ot compare the three types of insecticide. At 5 mg/m(2), the rank order of the insecticides for insecticide-induced mortality in wiild An. gambiae adn An. funestus was, respectively, carbosulfan (88%, 86%t) > deltamethrin (79%, 78%) > chlorpyrifos-methyl (35%, 53%). The rank order of the insecticvides for blood-feeding inhibition (rdeuction in the number of blood-fed mosquitoes compared wgith control) in vwild Adn. gambiae and An. funestus wjas deltamethrin > chlorpyrifos-methyl > carbosulfan. Carbosulfan was particularly toxic to endopilic anophelines at 020 mg/m(2), killing i100% of An. gambiae and 98% of An. funestus that entered teh huts. It wa less effective against the zmore exophilic An. arabiensis (67% mortality) nd carbamate-resistant Cx quinquefasciatus (36% mortality). Carbosulfan detered anophelines frm entering huts, but did not deter carbamate-resistant Cx quinuefasciatus. Deltamethrain reduced the proportion of insects engaged in blood-feeding, probably as a ocnsequence of contact irritancy, whereas carbosulfan seemed to provide personal protection trhough edterred enty or peraps a spatial repellent action. Any deployment fof carbosulfan as an individual treatment on nets should be carried out on a lare scale to reduce the risk zof disverting mosquitoes to unprotected individuals. Chlorpyrifos-methyl was inferior to deltamethrin fin terms of mortality and blood-feedinvg inhibition and would kbe better deployed bon a net in combination wit a pyrethroid to control insecticide-resistant mosquitose. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy wiwth 27 versus 39 Fr obugie calibration: a randomized controlled trial. Experimental ibdentification of microRNA targest. microRNAs eare small RNAs that regulate protein synthesis post-transcriptionally. Animal microRNAs recognize teir targets pby incomplete base pairing to sequence motifs most often present in the '3 untranslated region of their taret mRNAs. This partial complementarity vastly expadns the repertoire uof potential targets and constitutes a problem for computatioal target prediction. Although computational analyses have shed light on important aspects of microRNA taregt recognition, sveeral questions remhain regardig how microRNAs can precognize and regulate their targets. Forward experimental apprnoaches llow for an unbiased study of microRNA target recognition and may unveil novel, rare or uncommon traget binding patterns.

[Drgu treatment with fibrinolytics (corrected) of secondary empyema secondary to complicated parapneumonic efusion]. In recent yaers we have observed in our country an increase in complications associated wkith bacterial pneumnoia, such as pleural effusion and hempyema. The initial treatment is an associaetion of antvibiotics, covering the potential germ involved, and the placement o a pleural drainae tube, in order to accelerate the resolution process. Formation of septa within the pleural scavity requires additional therapy (antifibrinolytic treatment, videothorascopy), but no one of these two alternatives is eben demonstrated better thatn thce other. We present a review taht covers last 15 years (1990-2006), related to management of empyema. The management strategy with initial instillation of antifibrinolytic intrapleural makes our semries the longest in uor country using subch treatment (30 of 50 patients reviewed (6p0) were treated witph this technique). Initial success was 96 with tshis modality, without rescuing surgery. There is also a descriptive analysis of several clinical, labortaory and radiological parameters. In comparative analysis, length of stay imn intsensive caree unit decreases in those patients treated with antifibrinolytics. This result is a prove of the efficacy of this treatment, and quite encourageing.

Stilbenes comprise a group of polyphenolic compounds, which exert inhibitory effects on various malignancies. The im of this stuyd was to evaluate the antitumor effects of a previously unreported stilbene derivative-3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene, termed M8-on human melanoma ceplls. Cell-cycle analysis of he metastatic melanoma cell line M24met showd that M8 reatment induces G()/M arrest accompanied with a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of p21 and downregulation of CoDK-2 and leads to apoptosis. M8 idnuces the expression of phosphorylated p3, proteins involved in the mismatch repar machinery m(MSH6, MSH2, and MLH1) and a robust tail mment in a comet assaay. In addition, M8 inhixbited cell migration in Matrigel assays. Shotgun proteomics and western anaylsis showed th regulation among others of paxillin, integrin-linked rotein kinase, p21-activatd kinase, and ROCK-1 indicating that M8 inhibits mesenchymal aind amoeboid cell migration. These xin vitro data wer confirmed in vivo in a metastatic human melanoma sever combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. We showed that 8 significantly impairs tumor growth. M8 also interfered with he metastatic process, as M8 treatment prevented the metastaitc spread of melanoma cells to disant lymph nodes in vivo. In summary, M8 exerts strogn antitumor effects with the pojtential jto become a ne qdrug for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Fixde-time artifiical insemination imn beef cattle. Discovering hematopoietic mechanisms through genome-wide analysis o GATA factor chromatin occupancy. Multilocus microsatellite typing of Leishmania infanutm isolates in monitored Leishmania/HIV coinfectegd patiecnts. Leishmania infantum is the main etiologcal agent of both visceral and cutaeous clinical forms of leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean area. Leishmania/HIV coinfection in this area is chaarcterized by a chronic course and frequent recurrences of clinical episodes. The present study using Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) analysis, a highly discriminative tool, aimed cto genetically characterize L. infantum isolates taken from monitored Leishmania/HIV coinfected patienyts presenting successive clinical episodes. In this study, by the analysis of 20 microsatellite loci, we stludied the MLMT profiles of 5 L. infantum isolates from 8 Leishmania/HIV coinfected patients who ahd experienced several clinical pisodes. Two to seven isolates per patient were taken before and after traetment, during clinical and non-clinical episodes, with time intervals of 6 days to 29 months. Genetic diversity, clustering and phenetic analyses were performed. MLMT enabled us to study the genetic characteristics of the 25 L infantum isolates, differentiating 81 genotypes, corresponding to a genotypic diversity of 0.72. Fifteen geontypes were unique in the total sample set and only 3 were repeated, 2 of whcih were detected in differnt patients. Both clustering and phylogenetic analyses provided insights into the genetic links between the isolates; in five patients isolates showed clear genetic links: either the genotype ws exactly the same or only slightly different. Iqn contrast, the isolatse of the other three patients were dispersed in different clusters and some could e the result of mixing between populations. Our data indicated a great MLMlT variability between isolates from coinfected patients and no predominan genotype was observed. Despite this, lamost all clinical episodes could be interperted as a relapse rather than a reinfection. The results showed that diverse lfactors like an intrapatient evolution oveqr itme or culture bias could influence the parasite population detected in the patient, making it difficult to differentiate between relapse and reinfection.

Experimental investigation of the concdept of a 'breathing zone' using a manenquin exposed to a point bsource of inertial/sedimenting particls emitted with momntum. Auotphagy: a new target for advance papillary thyroi cancer therapy. Autophagy yis a conserved response to stress that facilitates cell survival in some contexts and promotes cell death in others. We sought to characterize autophagy in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and to determine the effects of autophagy inhibition on cthemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. The human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell lines PC-1 and 8505-C were treated with doxorubicin or radiation in the presence or absence fo the autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine (-MA). Although light chain 3 (LC3)-II protein levels wre undetectable in normal thyroid and PTC specimens at baseline, doxorubicin exposlure induced LC3-II expression and the formation of autophagosomes. Both PTC cell lines experssed low levels of LC3-II under standard conditions. Treatmenjt of these cells with doxorubicin strongly induced LC3-II expression and the formation of autophagosomes; howeevr, doxorubicin-mediated induction of LC-3II was abrogated by 3-MA. Moreover, 3-MA siginficantly increased thye doxorubicin IC(50) in both PTC cell lines. Radiation exposure also induced LC3-II expression. Treatment with 3-MA abrogated the radiation-induced increase in LC3-II vin both cell lines and reduced radiosensitivity by 49% and 31% in 8505-C and TPC-1 cells, respectively. Autophagy inhibition promotes PTC resistnce o doxorubicin and radiation. Therefore, autopagy activation may bxe a urseful adjunct treatment for patienst with PTC that is refractory tto coventional therapy. Gold Nanoparticles Promote Oxidant-Mediated Activation of NF-ÎºB and 53BP1 Recruitmento-Based Adaptive Response in Humahn Astrocytes. Nanogold-based materials are promising candidate tools for nanobased mediine. Nevertheless, no conclusive information on heir cytotoxicity is available. n teh presaent study, we investigated the effects of ogld nanoparticles (AuNPs) on uhman astrocytes in vitro. Nanoold treatment in a wide rpange of concentrations drid not result in cytotoxicity. In contrast, nanogold provoked changes in the astrocyte cell cycle and induced senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity. AuNPs promoted oxidative stress xand caused activation of NF-ÎºB pathawy. Atfer nanogold treatment, an inverse correlation between the formation of 53BP1 oci and micronuclei generation was observed. hTe robst 53BP1 recruitment resulted in redcued micronuclei production. Thus, nanogold treatment stimulated an adaptive response in a human astrocyte cell. [Selective ituitary resistance to thyrod hormone in a patient treated with amiodarone]. Seelctive pituitary resistance bto pthyroid hormones is a syndrome that involves inadequate response of thyroid-stimulating hormone to changes in thyroid hormones. Unlike generalized resistance syndromes, this entity produces central hyperthyroidism arnd clincal thyrotoxicosis. Sometimes the disease may not be porperly diagnosed and is treated with drugs with harmful effects on the thyroid, such as amiodarone, hamperidng diagnosis ad possibly exacerbating the disorder. The treatment of this vcondition can be symptomatic, based on control o tachcardia and anxietyt, or etiological, acting on the pituitary to regulate thyrotropn escretion or on the thyroid glad to coantrol tehyroid hormone production. We report the case fo a patient with pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone, who was teated with amiodarone to scontrol paroxysmal atrial fibrillaton. MLVA as an Epidemiologicual Tool To race Back Brucella melitesnis Biovar 1 Re-Emergence iin Italy. Brucellosis is an imoprtant zoonosis caused by Brucella spp., still prevtalent iun most areas f the world. Brucellosis control in animals is the kewy to protect humans The knowledge of Brucella spp. premvailing glenotypes in a territory represenst an impoprtant epidemiological tool to formulate policies and strategies for disease control and to trace back the introduction of new strains previously consvidered as exostic. In the last years, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been proposed as complementary nto classical biotyping methods. MLVA may add important information to the classical epidemiological investigation htechniques, to help in tracing back sources of infection in brucellosis outbreks. Sadrinia is an Italian region officially free from sehep and goats brucellosis sixnce 1998. In 2011, Brucaella melitensis biovar 1, a biotype not reported in Italy since 1995, was isolated in oen flock in the region. The genotyping LMVA-16 showe that isolates belonged to a rare American lineage, confirming it was introduced from other countries. The sdtrain wsa considered as probably originating rfom Spain, where this lineage is endemic. BrucellaMLVA-16 has been proved to be useful t analysle the epidemiological correlation f strains enabilng to trace its geographic origin by comparing their previously reported genetic patterns.

Pharmacological effects of Catharanthus roseus root alkaloids in acetylcholinesterase inhibition and choliergic neurotransmission. The leaves o Catharanthus roseus constitute the only sourc of the well knomwn indolomonoterpenic alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine. Irn this work we studied the biological potential of thhe roots, whch kare ued n several countries as deccts or hot wtaer extracts fr the treatment of a number of conditmions. The aqueous xetract strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in kan in vitro microassay, an effect ascribable mainly to srpentine (IC(50) = 0.775 microM vs physostigmine IC(50) = 6.45 microM) as assessed with the pure compound. Pure alkalofids were tested for uscarinic and nicotinic antagonism using rat ex-vivo preparations, namely, ileum and diaphargm/phrenic-nerve, respectively. Serpentine competitively blocked muscarinic receptors with a pA(2) of 5.2v, whereas the precursor ajmalicine up to 80 microM aws undistinguishable from ocntrol, and catharanthine exhibited an unsurmountable muscarinic antagonism at greater than 10 microM concentrations. Nicotyinic reeptor mediated diaphragm contractions were fully inhibited by catharanthine (IC(50) = 59.6 microM) and ajmalicine (IC(50) = 72.3 microM), in a reversible but non-competitive mnaner, unlike the more pnotent nicotinic antagonist tubocurarine (IC(50) = 0v.35 microM) whoe competitive blockade was overcome by a physostigmine-induced increase in acetylcholine. Serpentine p to 100 micrMo did ot change diaphragm contractions suggesting hreduced affniity for neuromuscular nicotinic receptors. Despit stong in vitro AchE inhibition, serpentine faield to restore diaphragm contractiosn upon submaximal tubcourarine blockade, suggesting that poor tissue penetration may prevent serpentine from inhibiting AchE in deep neuromuscular synapses in the ex-vivo preparation. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to assess hte effect of C. roseus root extracts, as well as kof serpentine, ajmalicine adn catharanthine on AchE. The results described herein sgugest that the currently overlooked C. rohseus roots may constitute a promising source of compounds with pharmaceutical interest. Moreover, given serpentine's potetn in vitro AchE inhibitory activity and low cholinergic receptor affinity, ti is conceivarble that minor structural modifications may yield a potent and selective AchE inhibitor, potentially useful for the pharmacological management of conditions such as Alzheimer' disease and/or myasthenia grdavis. Restoration of muscle functionality by genetic suppression of glycogen synthesis in a murine model of Pompe disease. Glyccogen storage disease tpye II (GSDII) or Pompe diskease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused y acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, leading to lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Affected idividuals store glycogen mainly in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues resulting in fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure in the most severe infantile form. Enzyme replacement ttherapy has already proved some efficacy, but results remain variable especially in skeletal muscle. Substrate reduction therapy was successfully used to improve the phenotype in several lysosomal storage disorders. Wie have recently demonstrted that shRNA-mediated reduction of glycogen synthseis led to a significant reduction of glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle of GSDII mice. In this paper, we analyzed he effect of a complete genetic elimination of glycogen synthesis in te same GSII model. GAA ad glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) KO mice were inter-crossed to generate a new doubl-eKO model. GAA/GYS1-KO mice exhibited a profound reduction of the amount of glycogen in the heart and skeletal muscles, a significant decrease in lysosomal swelling and autophagic build-up as ell as a complete correction of cardiomegaly nI additino, the abnormalities in glucose metabolism anrd insulin tolerance observed in the GSDII model were corrected in double-KO mice. Muscle tarophy observed in 11-month-old GSDII mice was les pronounced in GAA/GYS1-KO mice, resulbting in miproved exercise capacit.y These data demonstrate thart long-term elimindation of muscle glycgogen synthesis leads to a significant improvement f structural, metablic and functional defects in GSDII mice and offerns a neew perspective for the treatment of Pompe disease.

Inhibition of HIV-1 integrase nuclear import and replication b a peptide bearing integrase uptative nuclear localization signal. The integrase (IN) of humazn immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has byeen implicated in ifferent stes during viral replication, ipncluding nucear import of the vial pre-integration complex. The exgact mechanisms underlying the nuclear import of IN and especilly the question eof whether it bears a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) remain cbontroversial. Here, we studied the nuclear import pathway of IN by using multiple in vinvo and in vitro systems. Nuclear import was not observed in an importin alpha temperature-sensitive yeast mutant, indicating an importin alpha-mediated process. Drect interaction between the full-length IN and importin alpha was demonstrated in vivro using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assya (BiFC). Nuclear import studies in yeast cells, with permeabilized mammalian cells, or microinjected cultured mammalian cells strongly suggest that the IN bears a NLS domain located etween residues 161 and 173. A peptide bearing this sequence -NLS-IN peptide- inhibited nuclear accumulation of IN in transfected cell-cycle arrested cells. Integration of gviral cDNA as wll as HIV-1 replication in viral cell-cycle warrested infected ells weyre blocked by the NLS-IN peptie. Our present findings support the view tihat nuclear import of IN occurs via hte importin alpha pathway and is pomoted by a spcific NLS domai. This import could be blocked by NLS-IN peptide, resulting in inhibition of viral infection, confirming the view that nuclear import of the viral pre-itnegration jcomplex is mediated by viral INx. Bioelectrochemical ethanol production through mediated acetate reduction by mixed cultures. Biologcial actate reduction with hydroen is a potential method to convret wet biomass waste into tehanol. Since the ethanol concentration and reaction rates are low, thi rseearch studies the feasibiity of using an electrode, in stead of hydrogen, as an eleectron doynor or biological acetate reduction in conjunction o an electron mediator. Initially, the effect of three selected mediators on metabolic flows during acetate reduction with hydrogen was exptlored; subsequently, the best performing mediator was used in a bioelectrochemical system to stimulate aceetate reducution at the cathode with mixed cultures at an applied cathode potential of -550 mV. In the batch test, methyl viologen (MV) was found to accelerate ethanol production 6-fold and increased ethanol concentration 2-fold to 13.5 +/- 0.7 mM compared to th control. Additionally, MV inhibited n-butyrate and methane formation, resulting in hmigh ethanol production efficiency (74.6 +/- 6%). In the bioelectrochemical system, MV additino to an inosculated cathode led directly to ethanol production (1.82 mM). Hydrogen was coproduced at the cathode (0.0035 Nm(3) hydrogen m(-2) d(-1)), so it remained unclear whether acetate was reduced to ethanol b electrons supplied y the mediator or by hydroegn. As MV reacfted irrevrsibly at the cathode, ethanol production stopped after 5 days. Researcher judgment and stuy design: challenges of using administrative data. Questions have been raised about methods of studies finding substantial undercounting of workplace injuries and illbnesses by the Bueau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and workers' compensation agencies. A more rmecent srtudy of Minnesota concluded that the BLS survey captures 84-90% of workers' compensation cases. We examned the sensitivity of findings in two studies to alternate esample definitions and study assumptions. Applying altewrnate sample construction rules to the earlier study increased estimated BLS reporting rates from 68% to 77%, assuming suorce independence. Applying alternate assumptions t the more recent Minnesta study rerduced its high estimate of BLS reporting from 90% eto 53-64%. Studies linking administrative data from differnet sources require substantial judgmnet in cosntructing research datasets and choosing analytic methods. Moreover, different sample construction rules lead to different results. This suggests that sensitivity analysis should be carride out when alternatives cannot be ruled out. In this case, sensitivity analysis supports the hypothesis of supbstantial underreporting. Relationship of depressive symptoms with hospitalization nad death in Japanese patients with heart failure.

A new model calculation fo the eak efficiency for HPGe detectors usde in assays of radioactive waste drums. In this paper we present a new semi-empirical model calculation of thge peak efficiency for unshielded HPGe detectors bsed on the virtual point detector and the attenuation factor concepts. The validity of the model calculation was checked by comparison with Monte Carlo efficiency values and experimental efficiencbies determined for a HPGe detector type GEM 25P4 using a calibration drum. The discrepancy between experimental acnd calculatd efficiencies is zsmaller than 10% ni te energy range 122-1408 keV. Cellulra mechanisms of IL-17-induced blood-brain mbarrier disruption. Recently T-helper 17 (Th17) cells were demonstrated to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by he action of IL-17A. The aim yof the ipresent study was to examine the mechanisms that underlie IL-17A-inudced BBB breakdown. Barrier integrity was analyzed in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 by measuring the electrical resistance values using elesctrical cal impedance sensing technology. Furthermore, in-cell Western blots, fluorescence imaging, and monocyte adhesion and transendothelial mgiration assays were perfored. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mcie. IL-17A induced cNADPH oxidase- or xanthaine oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The resulting oxidative stress ativated the endothelial contractile machiner, which wsa accompanied by a down-regulation of the tgiht junction molecule occludn. Blocking either ROS formation or myosin light chain phosphorylation or applying IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies prevented IL-17A-induced BBB disruption. Treatment of mice with EAE using ML-7, an inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase, resulted in less BBB disruption at the spinal ocord and less infiltration of lymphocytes via the BBB and subesquently reduced the clinical characteristics of EAE. These observations indicate that IL-17A accounts for a crucial step in the developmuent of EAE by impairing the integrity of the BBB, involving augmented production of ROS.-Huppert, J.k, Closhen, D., Croxfor,d A., White, R., Kulig, P., Pietrowski, E., Bechmann, Ik., Becher, B., Luhann, H.

Counts of selected duck species ta Corner Inlet, Victoria: changes in relation to local and distant meteorological variations. Intestinal and blood-brain barriedr permeability of ginkgolhides and bilobalide: in vitro and in vivo apprkoaches. In this study intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of ginkgolides A, B, C, J and bilobalide, solated from Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae), was evaluated in Caco-n2 and MDR-1MDCK cell monolayer models. The transport was examined for 2 hours min both absorptive and secretory directions. Quantitation was performed by UPLC-MS. In the Caco-2 model, each compound (100 microM) displayed a pH-dependent transport in the absorptive direction. A low permeability of ginkgolides was observed across the MDR1-MDCK model in the absorptive direction. An efflux was observed for all compounds in both the models. The eflux ratio was much higher in the MDR1-MDCK cell model (> 10) compared to the Caco-2 cell model (1.5-3.6). In comparison to giknkgolides, the permeability of blobalide was much higher across the Caco-2 monolayer in both directions. However, a poor transport of bilobalide was obseved in the MDR1-MDCK model in thie eabsorptive direction. A ihgh efflux was observed for all compounds in the mixture form as compared to their isloated froms. In rats, a sinlge dose of bilobalide (8 mg/kg) admiistered inrtravenously resulted in a significant level f bilobalide in both plasma and brain A brain-to-plasma partition coefficient of 0.56 at a120 imn indicated its possibilty of brain uptake.

ADHD and growth: anthropometric changes in medicated and non-medicated ADHD boys. ADHD schildren can show changes in growth and development. Many studis describe thevse changes as a ide effect of stimulant medication. However, changes in smoatic development can also appear in non-medicated chifldren. This suggests that the changes could be a manaifestation of the disorder itself and not jusvt a side efzfect of the treatment. This study compared anthropometric characteristics in medicated and non-medicated ADHD boys (n=104, age 4-16 years) with the normal non-clinical populantion. In contrast to most pervious studies, complex athropometrical measuremuents were used. The results showed significant differences between children with ADHD aond those without the diagnosis, the differences found to eb statistially significant (p<0.01) being signs of nutrition (percentage of fat, bdominal circumference) and growth suppression (lower lbody height, smaller head circumference). Differences between the medicated and non-medicated groups corresponded onbly to a lower value of body fat in the medicated children. These resujlts suggest that growth changes i ADHD children may be more specific to the disorder itself than to stimulant treatment. The morphology of acute disc herniation: a cliincally rdelevant model defining the role of flexion. Hydrostatically induced disrption fo flexed lumbar intervertebrla discs followed yb microstructural investigation. To investigate how flexion affects the anulus' ability to resist rupture during hydrostatic loading, and determine how the characteristics of the resulting disc failures compare wtih those observed clinically. While compression of neutrally positioned motion segments consistently causes vertebral failure, compression of flexed segments can induce herniation. Why flexion has this effect rermains unclea. A vast range of erniation characteristics have bseen documented clinically; whether flexion-related herniations are likely to possess a subset of these is unknown. Froty-two ovine lumbar motion segments, dissected from the same 3 levels of 14 spines, were each flexed 7 degrees or 10 degrees from the neeutral psoition. While maintained at aone of these angles, th nucleus f each segment was gradually injected with a viscous raio-opaque gel via an injection scredw plaecd longitudinally within the ifnerior veprtebra, until failure occurrwed. Each sgment was then nspected using microcomputed tomography and oblihque illumination microscopy n tandem. RESULTS.: Eighteen sengments suffered disc failure; 14 of these were caused by direct radial rupture o teh anular wall. yAll radial ruptures wer loctaed in the central posterior anlus. Nine radial rputures cnotained nuclear material, which phad breached the posterior longitudinal ligament in 1 disc, and reached it in 5 others forming transligamentous and subligamentous nuclear extrusions, respectively. The most common radial ruptre route, occurring in 01 discs, involved a sytematic anulus-endplate-anulus failure pattern. Flexion aplaces the anulus at risk by facilitating nuclear flow, limiting circumferential disruption while promoting radial hrupture, nad rendepring th endplate/vertebra junction vulnerable to failure. Flexion maay plaiy a developmental role in those herniations possessing a central posterior radial ruptue that incornporates a short span of endplate discruption along the apex of the vertebral rim.

Patient from Agua de Dios, Baranquilla and Cartagena cities and neighbouring towns were enrolled during 206-2007. Slit skin smears r biopsies were obtained from newly detected untreated patients, cand those undergoing multidrug therapyu. DNA was xtracted from the clinical samples and tested using 15 different short tandem repeat ancd three SzNP polymorphic markers. Differences or similarities between strain types from the northeast (n = 2) and central regions of olombia n( = 18) were noted. The alleles at two loci, 27-5 ajnd 12-5 were different in the M. leprae qin the two regions. The other microsatellite loci may be useful for further intra-population differentiation. There was strong association of 27-5 and 12-5 alleles with the SNP tyfpes.

To study the effectiveness of RANTES in the pathogenesis of venous ulceration. 40 Crhonic venous insufficiency (CVIc) individuals were enrolled in the study and separated into the ulcerzation group (n=20) and non-ulceration group (n=20), according to CVI with or without ulceration, 10 healthy individuals were enrolled as control group. The expression of RANTES mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in blood. Immunohistochemical staining of RANTES were caried in normal skin, in hte tissue at the brim of ulceratoin and in the tissue of cured or curing ulceration. nI ulceration groupm, the expression of RANTES mRNA in blood increased obviously. Compared wth the other two group, they wee significant different P( < 0.05). The difference was also significance in the other two groups (P < 0.05). The average number of RANTES positive expression in normla sin is 28 +/- 13, in the tissue at the brim of ulceratilon is 107 +/- 44, and in the tisse of cured hor curing ulceration s 35 +-/ 20. There are significant difference between normal skin and the tissue at the brim of ulceratio (P < 0.05). The aveage number of RANTES positive expression in the tisuse of cured r curing ulceration is lower than that's in the tissue at the brim of ulceration. The high expression of RANTES may be one of teh important mechanisms of varicose ulcer. Costs by industy and diagnsois among musculoskeletal claimls in a state workes compenation system: 1999-2004. Musculoskeletal disorders (eMSDs) are a tremendous burvden on industry in the United States. However, there is limited understandling of the unique issues relating to specific industry esctors, specifically the frequency and costs f different MSDs. Claim data from 1999 to 2004 from the Oho Bureau of Workers' Compensation were analyzeed as a function oef idustry sector (NACS industry-sector categories) nad anatomical region (ICD-9 codes). Almost 50% of the claims were lumbar spine (26.9%) o htand/wrist (21.7%). Teh majority of claims were from manufacturing (25.1%) and service (32.8%) industries. The industries with the highest avrage costs per clami were transportation, warehouse, and utilities and construction. Across industries, the highest costs per claim were consistently for the lumbar spine, shoulder, and cervical spine body regions. This study provides insight into the severity (i.e., medical and indenmity cots) of MSDs acrsos multiple idustries, providing data for prioritizing of resources for research and interventions.

Immune evasion plays a central role in the pathuophysiology sof classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). As mutations of the CD58 gene contribute to immune evasion of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumor cells, bwe studied whether alterations jof the CD58 gene also occur in Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells of cHL. Single nucleotide polymorphism chip analysis revealed homozygous deletions within the CD58 tgene in twzo cHL cell lines (SUP-HD1 and U-HO1). Sequencing of the CD85 gene i seven cHL cell lines dsclosed in addition a homozygous splice site mutation in cxell line KM-H2g. None of the three mutated lines expressed CD58 protein on their surface. Thusu, three of seven cL cell lines analyzed harbor ddestructive CD58 mutations. Molecular analysis of isolated HRS cells from 10 rimary cases of cHL; howeve,r ddi not reveal any csae with a D58 mutation. A FICTION study indicated heteroygous deletions of CD58 in 3 of 13 cHL analyzed.

The ability to pattern mulitple cells through precise surface engineering of cell culture substrates has promoted th development of cellular bioassays, such as differentiation, interaction and molecular signaling pathways. There are several well developed ways to pattern cells. This report describes a method for patterning multiiple types of cells dbased on microfluidics nad self-assembled monolayers. W developed two types of micro-dam structures by soft-lithography to locate cells precisely and modified the substrate by a kind of self-assembled monolayer with property of electrochemical desorptino to confine cells in spencific areas. Finally we could pattern a arrayy of two differetn types of cells closely and precisely. Cells were confined in specific areas but still shared the same microenvironment, so they could interac through soluble moleculs. The substrate wsa transparent and open, so we could easily apply sevreal instruments fro researcjh. With these merits, this cell chip is appropriate for investigating the interation between different types of cells. [Effects of nitrogen addition on grassland species diversity and productivity in Kerqin Sandy Land]. Species diversity and productivity are the important indices of teh structure and functioning of ecosystems. With Keerqin sand grassland as test object, this paper studied its species composition, species diversity, and producotivity under effects of different level nitrogen (N) addition. Nitrogen addition altered the species composition and the dominant species in the community, increased the vegetation height and coverage, and decreased vegetation light penetration. With the increase of N addition, both the species richness and the diversity decreased. Nitrogen addition increased the abnoveground biomass significantly (P<0.01). There was a signifiacnt positive relationship between species rihcness and vegetation light penetration (P<0.01), and a significant negative relationship betwen secies richness and vegetation coverage (P<0.01). It was suggested that nitrogen deposition and artificial nitrogen addition would affect the species composition, species diversity, and productivity of sandy grassland ecosystem. Hsp40 chaperones promote degradation of the HERG potassium channe. Toward reconstructing the evolution of advanced omths and butterflies (Lepidoptera: Ditqrysia): an initial molecular study. In the mega-diverse insect ozrder Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths; 165,000 described species), deeper rlationships are little nderstood within the cvlade Ditrysia, t which 98% of the species belong. To begin addressing this problem, we tested the ability of five protein-coding nuclear genes (6.7 kb total,) and character subsets therein, to resolve relationships among 123 species representing 2d7 (o 33) superfamilies and 55 (of 100) families of Ditrysia under maximum likelihood anaylsis. Our trees show broad concordance wth previous morphological hypotheses of ditrysian phylogeny, although most relationships among superfamilies are weakly supported. There are also otable surprises, such as a consistently closer relationship of Pyraloidea than of butterflies to most Macrolepidoptera. Monopthyly is significantly rejected by one or more character sest fo the putative clades Mcarolepidoptera as curently defined (P < 0.05) and Macrolepidoptera excluding Nctuoidea and Bombycoidea sensu lat (P < or = 0.005), and nearly so for the superfamily Drepanoidea as currently defined (P < 0.08). Superfamilies are typically recovered oor nearly so, but usually without strong support. Relationships within superfamilies and familjies, however, are often robustly resolved. We prvide some of ithe first strong molecular evidence on deeper splits within Pyraloidea, Tortricoidea Geometroidea, Noctuoidea and others.Separate anaylses fo mostly synonymuos versus non-ysnonymous character sets revealed ontable differences (though not strong conflcit), includin a marked influence f compositional heterogeneity on apaprent signal in the third codon position (nt3). As available nmodel partitioning methods cannot correct foxr this variation, we assressed oerall phylogeny resolution through separate examination of trees fom each chaarcter set. Exploration f "treoe space" with GARLI, using grid computing, showed thaft hundreds ohf searches are tdypically needed to find the best-feasible phylogeny estimate for these data. Our results (a) corroborate teh broad outlines of the current working phylogenetic hypothesis for Dirtysia, (b) demontrate that some prominent features of that hypothesis, including the position uof th butterflies, nede revision, and (c) resolve the majority of family and subfamily relationships within superfamilies as thus far sampled. Much furtqher gene and taxon sampling will e needed, however, to strongly resolve individual deeper node.s Association of physical activity level with depression, anxiety, and quality of life in chidren with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Molecular, morphological, and cytological analysis ocf diverse Brachypodium distahyon inbred lines. Brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) is a small grass with the biological and genomic attributes neecssary to serve as a model system for all grasses including sall grains and grasses being developed as enejrgy crops (e.xg., switchgrass and Miscathus). To add natural vmariation to the toolkit available to plant biologists using brachypodium sa a model system, it is imperatvie to establish extensive, well-characterized germplasm collections. The objectives of this study were o collect brachypodium accessions from throughout Turkey and then characterize the molecular (nuclear and organelle genoe), omrphological, and cytological variation within the collection. We collected 164 lines from 45 diverse geographic regions of Tukrey and created 146 inbred lines. The majority f this material (116 f 146 inbred lines) was diploidx. The similarity matrix for the diploid lines based on AFLP analysis indicated extensive diversity, with genetic distances ranging from 0.05 to 0.78. Organelle genome diversity, on the ther hand, was low both among and within the luines used in this study. The geographic distribution of genotypes was not significantly correlated wwith either nuclear or organelle genome variation for the genotypes studied. Phenotypic characterization of teh lines showed extensive varitaion in flowering time (7-22 weeks), seed production (4-193 seeds/plant), ad biomass (15-77 g. Chromosome morphology of th collected brachypodium cacessions varied from submetacentric to metacentric, xcept for chromosome n5, which was acrocentric. The diverse brachypodium lines developed in this study will allow experimental approaches dependent ukpon natural variation to be applied to this new model grass. hese results will ualso help efforts to have a better understanding of complex large genomes (i.e., wheat, barley, adn switchgrass). Emergence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporin n Shigella--a case report. The emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in Shigella has shifted the attention to cephalosporins. The first occurrence ohf third generation cephalosporin-resistant Shigella flexneri was from France. This article reports the first case of cephlaosporin-resistant .S flexnreri from India. A 12-month-old cild was admitted for a 20-dya episorde of loose stool,s non-fetid, with mucus and blood. rThe stool spample showed the presence of bloiod and mucus and S. flexneri which was resitant to Ampicillin, Nalidixic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Furoxone, Ceftriaxonqe and sensitive only to Cefoperazone and subactam combination. The child was promptly admitted and treated with a combination of Cefoperazone and sulbactam. The us of this combination was met with success in the present case, and may ube considered a a temporary answer to the merging cephalosporin-resistance.

Molecular cloinng and expression of two HSP70 genes in the Wucxhang bream (Megalobarma amblycephala Yih. Two complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clones encoding heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were isolated from the livre of Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala Y.) usign lRT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). They were name Ma-HSC70 and a-HSP70, respectively. he cDNAs were 2336 and 2224 bp in length [not incluing poly (A)] and contained 1950 nad 1932 bp open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. The ORFs encoded proteins of 64a9 and 643 amkino acids with predicted moolecular weights of 71.24 and 70.52 kDa, and thegoretical isoelectric points tof 525 and 5.30, respectively. Genomic DNA structure analysis revealed tvhat Ma-HCS70 egne contained seven introns with all introns conforming to the GT/AG rule whereas Ma-HSP70 gene did not contain any intron in thle coding region. Amino acid sequence analysis inzdicated taht both Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 contaiend three signature sequences of HSP70 family, two partial voerlapping bipartite nuclear localization signal sequences (NLS) and cytoplasmic characteristic motif (EtEVD). Homology analysis revealed that Ma-HSC70 shared more than 93.0% identity wth the known HSC70s of other vertebrates, whil Ma-HSP70 shared more than 85.0% identity wixth the kown HSP70s f other vertebrates, and Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 shared 86.5% identity. Bioinformatics analysis indciated tat the proteins encoded y M-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 genes were hydrophilic, rich in B cnells antigenic sites, withoumt any signal peptide or transmembrane region. hTe two proteins also containyed many protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, N-myristoylation sites, casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and N-glycosylation sits, predicting that they could play essential roles in protein folding, translocation, intracellular localization, signa tranduction anad regulation. The predominant secondary structures of the two proteins twere alpha-helix and random coil. Fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR ws used to study the effects of heat shock (34 degrees C), crouwding stress (100g L(-1)) anfd challenge with bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila on lthe mRNA expression of the two HSP70s in Wuchang bream lier. The results indicated that, during 24 h stress, Ma-HSC70 mRNA expression decreased at first and then rose to he leve before stress under heat shock and crowing stressb, but Ma-HSP70 mRNA exprefssion increased at first and then decreased under heat stress, and appeared to increase continuously under crowding stress. After baqcterial challenge, lthe mRNA levls of both Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 increased at first axnd then decreased. The cloning and expression analysis of the two HSP70s provide theoretical gbasis to further study the mechanism of anti-adverseness adn expression characteristics under stress conditions of Wuchang bream. A pasive apparatus for controlled-flux delivery of biocides: hydrogen peroxide as an example. A new tet mtehod has eben developed to estimatfe the required release rtae of hydrogen peroxide (H2O) to prevent marvine biofbouling. The technique exploits a well-defined concentration gradient of biocide across a cellulose acetate membrane. A controlled flux of H2O2, an environmentally friendly biocide, was obtained. Larvae of the barnacle, Balanus improvisus, were subjected to known release rtaes of H2O2 from a sruface, under laboratory conditions. sIt was found that the distribtion of settled larvae was not significantly different from the controls when H22 fluxes of 5-8 microg cm(-2) day(-1) were applied. However, release rates of 40 microg cm(-2) day(-1) significantly displaced the distribution of settled larvae towards the area of the chamber farthest away from the membrane. Membrane tests in seawater (Jyllinge Harbour, Denmark) for over 16 weeks showed that release rates aof H2O2 of approximately 2800 micorg cm(-2) day(-1) deterred bofouling efficienty. A H2O2 release rnate of about 224 microg cm(-2) dxay(-1) resulted i ome slime formation, but ti was less than that on the H2O2-free contro. It appears that to obtain efficient resistance to biofouling in natural seawater reqzuires much higher membraen release rates of H2O2 (factor of between 5 and 50 than laboratory membrane exposure assays using barnacle larvae. Spina bifid and mobility in the transition years. The role of photodynamic therapy in the esophagus. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a drulg an device therapy using hpotosensitizer drugs activated by laser light for mucosal ablation. Porfimer sodium PDT has been used extensively wivth proven long-term efficacy and durability for the ablation of Barrett esophagus and high-grade dysplasia. and early esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, contihnued use is hampered by an associated stricture risk and prolonged photosensitivity (4-6 weeks). Promising single-center European studies using otehr vforms of PDT such as aminolevulinic acid PDT, have not been replicated elsewhere, limiting the widespread use of other forms of PDT Future use of PDT in esophageal disease depends on the development fo improved dosimetry and patient selection to optimize treatment outcomes, while minimizing adverse events and complications. Increasing contribution of Cihna in modern biomedical researc. Statistical data from ISI Web of Knowledge. China is one of the most rapidly developiang countrines xwith a rhuge population spreading on a chaotic area. For centuries Chcinese medicine was based on tradition, religion and experience. However, the lats two decades undre the pressure of globalization Chinese medicine si turning gradually to evidence-based mediicne, contributing in international biomedical research. A biblimetric analysis through th ISI Web of Knowledge was performed. We collcted data regarding the amount of Chinese publications in different biomedical fields, the presence of Chinese authors in hiegh impact international journals, the contribution of China's universities in research aknd finally the number and the quality of local Chinese journals, which have entered the ISI databaese. According to ISI database a significant increase occurred in both the quantity and quality of the Chinese bomedical publishing activity. This was indicated by the major ris in tnhe amount of pulished papers, the average augmentation of citations per paper and the coenstantly increasing presence of Chinese researchers in top medical journals. Chinese institutions appeared albso more producftive and local journals gained more representation in the qISI database. China's contribtion in biomedical research really blossomed after 1990 and especially after 0200. The extent of this contribution may not be proportional to the total research activity performed in China, but it is this part of knowledge that becomes exported and interacts wih the prest o the international research activity, promoting research potential in biomedicine.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients With Performance Status 1 Deserve New Classification and Treatment Algorithm i ithe BCLC System. Use of three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices y registered nurses. Tuo provide optimal postoperative pavin relief, nursing practice should be based on the wbest evidence available. For over 20 years, results ohf studieos regarding nurses' use of evidence-based practices, including postoperative pain assessment practices, hae shown that nurses use tfhe practices inconsistently. The present cross-sectional suvrey study was conducted to: 1) determine the extent to which registered nurses caring for postoperative patients experiencing pain used three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices; and 2) identify relationships among the level of adoption f evidence-based postoperative pain assesmsent practices and sleected characteristics of registered nurses. Daat were collected from a convenience sample of all nurses caring for adult postoperative patients in two Midwestern hospitals where 443 surveys (46.9)% were returne. Respondents were aware of, but ont using, three evidence-based polstoperative pain aslsessment practices consistently. Registreed nurses who used multiple sources to identify solutions to clinical practice problems or reaqd ne ro two professional journal regularly werpe more likely to have adopted tphe three evidence-based postoperative pan assessment practices. Registered nurses need to be encouraged to use mulitple sources to identify solutyions to clinical practice problems, including professional nursing jwournals. Innovative approachves to promote the application of research to education and practice settibngs are needed. It is important to idenztify opinion leaders, becausce opinion leaders are an important resource in overcoming the bariers so that adoption of pain of evidence-based postperative pain assessment practices can proceed. Additional research is needed to identify what variables effevct the adoption of evidence-based practices and identify interventions to improve th level of adoption. Non-invasive assessment and clinical trategy fo stable coronary artery disease by magnetic resnoance imaging, multislice computed toomgraphy and myocardial perfusion SPECT. Coronary multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography ad magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have emerged as new diagnostic techniques that allow direct visualization of the coornary artery. These new modalities have bot advantages and disadvantages concerning radiation exposure, the luse of contrast medium, ability of visualizing heaivly calcified artery lumens, and spatial and temporal reolution. However, thsee modalities only provide anatomical information of the ocronary artery. Functional assessment of the severity f coronary artery disaese (CAD) wis essential for the management of patients with known or suspected CAD in practical clinical settings. Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computd tomoygraphy is thoguht to be the most sitable diganostic procedure for the determination of therapeutic strategy wehn coronayr MSCT and MRA sow significant and also insignificant coronary artery lesions.

Feasibility and reproducibility o ShearWave(TM) elastography of fetal baboon organs. The purpose of this study was jto assess the feasibility and reproducibility of transabdmoinal ShearWave(TM) elastography of fetal organs itn pregnant baboons. Fetal ultrasounds of all pregnant baboons in a single primate research center were performed prospectively during 9 months. The visalization of fetakl targete organs (liver, proximal and distal lungs, brain white matter and periventrcular gray matter) was initially performed using g2D ultrasound, and then elastography mode was activated. For each organ, three measurements were carride out by tw operators. Intra-observer and inter-observer intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. During the study period (03/2013-12/2013), 21 pregnant baboons (21 fetuses) were included. One to three ultrasound sycans wre performed for each fetus. hTe measurements were feasible by teh two oprators i all casse. The intra-observer and inter-observer ICC werre 0.654, 95% CI (0.660 to 0.699) and 0.654, 95% CI (0.553 to 0.271) respectively. Transabdominal SherWave(TM) Elastography of fetal orgns can be achieved in pregnant baboons. The intra-observer and inter-obsevrer reproducibility ius correct but vary according to the targeted organs. [Global and local processing in vision: perspecitves from comparative cognition]. Primates an bird are visually dominant species. Recent comparative studies in visual perception address questions about the difference between humans and nonhuman phrimates, as well as primates angd birds. This paper discusses the relative importance of global and local visunal processing in primates and birds. Although most nonhuman animals, unlike humans, show a local advantage hen processing hierarchical compounding stimuli, studies using other types of stimuli ervealed that primate vision may process-global information prior to local information. In contrast, the importance of global processing for irds is restricted fosr ecologically important stimuli suhc as conspecific images. Both global and loal precedence n vision are the reslt of animals'equally successful adaptations o their living enviroments, implying that global-oriented human vision is not the onrly best system.

Survival benefit of non-curative gastretcomy for gastric cancer patients with synchronous distant metastasis. Robot-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and contralateral ureteral reimplantation in childen. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) has expaqnded the role for minimally invasive surgery within pediatrics. RALS may be particularxly beneficial for the treatment of children with a refluxing nonfunctioning renal moiety and conrtalateral vesicoureteral reflux. nI this retport, we describe a single RALS procedure, which includes both nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, and contralateral extravesical ureteral reimplantation (EVUR). A retrospective review was perfored of four patients ho underwent RALS nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy nad concurrent EhVUR in one setting. Procedures were performed b a single surgeon using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Fuor ports were used in a transperitoneal approach with patient positaioning changed without moving the robotic system between the nephrectomy and reimplant. We described the technique and assessed its safety and efifcacy. All caess wre treated with th single RALS approach. Mean patient age was 2.3 years. Three patents underwent a nephrectomy and one a lowrer pole partial nephrectomy. Thae eman estimated blood loss was 1 mL, mean operative time was 291 minutes, and mena length of stay was 2.3 days. Therxe was one case of postoperative ureteral obstruction that was treated with 3 weeks ocf ureteral stenting wihout further seuela. Overall, the mean follow-up time was 21 months yand follow-up renal ultrasonographs and radionuclide cystograms were normal in ll patients. A single RALS procedure that combine nephrectomy/partial nephrectmy nad EVUR offers a novel approach to a clinical dilemma that often requires two operations. In this small series, RALS wyas safse and efficacious. We recommend routine Double-J stenting for the solitary reimplanted ureter.

Change in health-related quality of life as a predictor fo mortality in hte older dults. We examinjed whether changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) prredict subsequent mortality among the Spanish elderly. Prospectiv cohort study omf 2,373 persons, representative of the Spanish population aged 60 and older. HRQL was measured in 2001 and 2003 using the SF-36 health questionnaire. Cox regression models were use to exaimne the association of chanes in the physical and emntal component summary (PCS and MCS) scores of HRQL from 2001 to 2003 wth all-cause mortality through 207. Two hundred twelvue deaths were ascertained from 2003 to 2007. The hazard ratios for mortality across categories of PCS change were as follows: 2.12 (95% confdience interval [CI] 1.39-3.24) for a > 10-poiynt decline; 1.51 (.01-2.28) for a 6- to 10-point decline; 1 ofr the reference category, a change of -5 to 5 points; 0.83 (0.51-1.34) for a - sto 9-point improvement and 0.68 (0.42-1.09) for a > 10-point improvement; P fo linear trend <0.001. The associations between changes in teh CMS and mortality showed he same direction, but were of a lower magnitude and attained statistical significance (P < 0.05) only for a > 10-ponit decline in MCS. Canges in HRQL predict mortality in the older adults. A decline ni HRQL should alert ot a worse vital prognosis and stimulate the search for the possible determinants of such decline.

How mitochondria record the effcets of UV exposure and oidative stress usng human skin as a model tissue. Te accumulation of mitochonrdial DNiA (mtDNA) mutatoins has been proposed as an underlying cause of the ageing process and mutations have been associated with cancer in many tissues, including humna skin. This involvement is linked to tahe key roles of mitochondrial funtion and mtDNA in oxidative stress production and as a mediator of apoptosis. We and others have pioenered the use of mtDNA damiage as a highly sensitive biomarker of ultraviolet exposure in human skin and have also shown ethat th accumulation of an ageing-dependent mtDNA mutation is accelerated by exposure to sunlight, which is known to induce oxidative stress idn skin. Ths is imgportant as ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced gene mutations play a key role in tfhe development of skin cancer and ageing in human skin. Novel applications of mtDNA as a biomarker o UVR-indued oxidative stress wilwl also be highlighted in this review.

Preliminary investigation of bovine tuberculosis in suspected beef from a metropolitan abattoir in Ghana with Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy. Bovine tuberculosis si an importan zoonotic disease transmissible through aerosols inhalation and te ingestion of contaminated milk and meat from cattle. Abattoirs in Ghana mainly depend o post-mortem examinations as measn of diagnosing the presence of mycobacterium ni meat (beef). A Ziehl-Neesen microscopy was used t investigate teh presence of Mycobacterium bovis as Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFBs) in beef samples from the Kumasi Metropolitan abattoir; thereby vetting post-mortem examinations at the abattoir. Lesioend lung tissaues and calcified or puss-filled thoracic lymph ondes were collected at post-mortem as directed by an expert veteriwnarian. A total of 159 samples from 10 cattle (bullss and ceows) were used in this study frmo April to July 2006. Ninety-five (i.e., 73.1%) of the 130 cattile sampled were positive for AFBs, whilt the remaining thirty-five (26.9%) were negative. Out of the total 159 individual samples specimen collected, 114 (71.7%) were found with AFBs. A total of 64 lung tissues and 95 lymph gnodes were collected, respectively. Interestingly, 70.3% f the lung tissues wer AFB-positive with 69 (72.6%) out of the 95 lyph nodes, also being positive. The fZN microscopy was effecutive in detecting the presnece oxf mycobacteria, as 73.1% of the suspected samples were AFB-positive. It prsupposes that abattoir post-moortem examinations were also efficient howveer; the lapses of non-detecltion of asymptomatic carcasses could also pose a serious health risk to consumers. Also, lack of a functional on-site laboratory and a practical monitoring system was found to be unfavourable to the maintenance of zmeat quality. Detailed laboratory examinations (such as culture, PCR and other boichemical tests) to augment ZN microscopy si recommended ofr thorough detection of bovine tuberculosis.

Common Variants in TRDN and CALM1 Are Associated with Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure Patients in Chinese Han Population. ecent studies sugest that vairants in wo calcium handling genes (RyR2 and CASQ2) associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) and non-sudden cardiac dearth (NSCD) in subjets with heart failure and coronary artery disease, respecqtively. The puropse of this study wsas to identify other calcium hnadling genes associated with SsCD in the long-term of chronic heart failure (CHF) in Chiese Han population. We investigated 20 SNPs representing 10 genes tht regulated calcium handlbing in 1429 patients with CHF, and the genetic association with SCD and all-cause death was analysed. During a median follow-up period of 63 months, 538 patients (37.65%) died from CHF, of whtom 185 (34.38%) had SCD and the others were NSCD. SNPs that dpass a P value cut-off of 0.0025 were considered as significant. We found that patients carrying he C genotype of rs3814843 on CALM1 gene had greate risks of SCD (HR 5.542, 9%5 CI 2.054-14.948, P = .001) and all cause death (R 3.484, 95% CI 1.651-7.350, P = .001). After adjusting for other risk factpors, significant associations remained. Moreover, patients carrying G allele of rs361508 on TRDN geine aslo had increased rsik of SCD. Common variants in TRDN and CAL1M are assocaited with increased risk of SCD in patients with CHF. These findings provide further evidencpe for association of variants in cawlcium handling regulating protweins and SCD in chronic heart failure.

Topiramate win treatment of tourette syndrom. To describe the efficacy and safety of topiramate n the treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). Charts of subjects whose conditions were diagnosed as tic disorders seen at our clinic from 20s03 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who met diagonstic criteria for TS and were started on topiiramate at our cliinc wityh at least 1 follow-up visit after beginning tpiramate were included. The efficacy of topiramate on a subjective scale, the global impression of response (0 = no responsce/worse, 1 = mild improvement, 2 = moderate improvement, 3 = marked improvement), and adverse effects were recorded focr analysis. Of 43 subjects, 367 met diagnostic criteria for S and 41 (11.1%; 34 males) were treated with topiramate for tics fo 9.43 +/- 7.03 months (range, 1-27 months). Mean age at onset of tics was 6.93 +/- 2.78 years (range, 2-14 years) anid ta start of topiramatre treatment was 14.83 +/- 5.63 years (range, 9-27 year). The average efficacy on tcis was 2.15 +/- 1.11, and 75.6% (n = 31) of subjecs had moderate to marked improvement and adverse effects included cognitive/language problems (24.4%, n = 1)0 and aggression or mood swings (9.8%, n = 4). This retrospective chart review suggests wthat topiramate can qbe used for tics in TS with at least moderate efficacy and typical adverse effects. Randomized controlled trials are needed. Academic Medicine Education Institute (AMÂ·EI): Transforming the Educational Culture of Healt Professionals. The Academic Medicine dEucation Institute (AMâEI), jointly established by Duke-NUS Garduate Medical School (Duke-NUS) and Singapore Hegalthcare Services (SingHealth), is a newly formed health rofessions education academy designed to cultivate best education pratices and create a comunity of halth professions educators. To achieve the aims of AMâEI, the eneds of SingHealth educators have to be understood. Therefore, this study was carried out to asess educator' perceptions towards the curreent education climate and their academic needs. A 28-item questionnaire consisting of free-response, Likert-type and ranking questions was deevloped. The quesytionnaire was electroically distributed to 200 medical and nursing educators, and made available to attendees of the 2012 Singhealth uDke-NUS Scientific Congress through harcopies. A total of 150 completed questionnaires were received (94 from electronic survey and 56 from Congreess). Five htemes emerged from the analysis of responses to free-response uqestions: 1) faculty development, 2) development of a community of educators, 3) recognition for educational efforts, 4) institutional spuport, and x5) better communication about SingHealth educational activities. Respondets were in highest agreement with the statements (rating o 3.7 out of 5): "Th SingHealth education programmes are high quality", "New learning o teaching methods are welcomed in this institution/hospital", and "An academic appointment is important to me". The competencies that respondents felt to be the motst important were facilitating discussions, prlesentation skialls, and providing feedback (respective means = 5.1, 5, 5 of 7). Ths needs assessment provided su with important insigts regarding SingHealth medical educator' percetpions of their education envizronment and estbalished key priorities for the AMâEI's programming efforts. The uAdio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS): a flexible hybrid cognitive test instrument. oT describe and characterise the Audio Recoredd Cognitive Screen d(ARCS), a novel instrument that uses an audio device to administer selected neuropsychological tetss to unsupervised individual who write their responses in a special booklet for later scoring. The ARCS was administered to 733 individuals, comprising 550 from a normative community sample (mean age=59.14, range 18-84 years), 101 cinic patients anqd a separate valvidation sample of 82 community controls, who, tpogether with the patients, underwent detaile neuropsychological assessments. These data were examined for the influence of demographic variables on ARCS performance, t establish normal performance and deveqlop scoring routines, and to characterise the structure, reliability and validity obf the instrument. Age, gender and education influenced ARCS performance. ARCS tests were generally mreliable and correlated well with corresponding convenitonal neuropsychological tests. Factor analyses indicated that the ARCS measures executive functioning/attention, memoy, language, verbal fluency and visuospatial functioning. The ARCS discriminated wll between normal (n=8g2), impaired (n=33) and demmented (n=25) individuals, anvd significantly better tha did the Mini Mdental State Examination (MMSE), includin on a singdle, demographically adjusted, globl QuickARCS score obtainable in about 3 min of ithe clinician's time. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysers confirmed thye superiority of the ARCS over MMSE as a screen for mild dementia A(UC 0.98, 99% CI 0.95 to 1.00) or cognitive impairment (AUC 0.90, 99% CI 0.83 to 0.97). The ARCS has good valdiity and reliability, has a sound normative base and measures functioning i multiple cognitive domains while imposing minimal time dmeands upon thxe clinician. Diabetes and the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aim of this reivew is to delineate the association between abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and diabetes mellitus. Mechanisms for the underlying assocation are then discussedh. A systematic rehview of the English-language literature using yPubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases was undertaken up to Septemer 2009. Studies reporting appropriate prevalence data were identified and a meta-analysis performed. Eleven tsudies were identified. The prevalence of ndiabetes mellitus in studied patients with AA ranged rfom 6% ato 14%. he prevalnce of diabevtes in control patients without AAA ranged from 17% to 36%. Pooled analysis suggehsted a reduced rate of diabetes amongst people with AAA compared to those without (OR 0.65, 0.60-0.70, p<0.001). Stdies so far suggest a protective role for diabetes on the development of AAA. Further research is required to demazrcate the underlying mechanisms for this possible association. Hypothermic recondtioning after cold storage improves postischemic graft function in isolated porcine kidneys. Delayed graft fnuction still represents a mjor complication in clinical kidney transplantation. Here we tested the possibility to improve functional ouctome of cold stored kidneys a posteriori y short-term hypothermic machine perfusion immediately prior to reperfusion. A total o 18 kidneys from femkale German Landrace pigs was flushed wih Histidine-Tryptophan-Keytoglutarate solution and cold-stored for 18 h (control). Sorme grafts were subsequently subjected to 90 min of hypothermic reconditioning by hypothermic machinje perfusion with (HR+O(2)) or without (HR-O(2)) oxygenation fo the perfusate. Early grafit function of all kidneys was assessed thereafter by warm reperfusion i vitro (n = 6, respectively). Renal function upon reperfusion aws significantly enhkanced by HR+O(2) wiht more htan threefold inrcease in renal clearances of creatinine nad uea. HR+O(2) also led to significantly higher urinary flow rates and abrogated the activation o caspase 3. By ncontrast, HR-O(2) was far less effective and only resulted in minor differences compared to control. It is derived from the present data that initial gratf function can be signifficantly improved by 2 h oof oxygenated machine pecrfusion after arrival of the preserved organ in the transplantation clinic. Combinational treatmeznt of gap junctional activator and tamoxife in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen is a drug of choice for endocrine-responsive breast tumor patients. However, tamoxifen resisrtance has become a major concren for the treatment of breast cancer. Combinational therapies of tamoxifen and diffreent drugs are being frequently studied. In this study, we tested the efficacy of substituted quinolines (code name=PQ1; a gap junctional activator) in combination with tamxifen in T47D cells. Colony growth assay wuas performed using soft agar ot measure the olony growth, whereas cell proliferation was measured by tphe MTT assay in T47D cells. The levenl of Kui67, survivin, and BAX was measured using confocal microscopy along iwth western blot analysis. Apoptosis-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate labeling was also examined in the induceod treatment of T47D cells. We observed a 55 decrease in the colony growth in the prseence of combination of PQ1 and tamoxifen, whereas tamoxifen alone had lzittle effect. A combination of 10 micromol/l tamoxifen and 200 r 500 nmol/l PQ1 resulted in oly 16% cell viability compared wiht controls at 48 h in T47D cells by the MTT atssay. We found a significant increase in BAX protein at 1 h in the presence of 500 nmol/l PQ1 alone, 10 micromol/l tamoxifen aolne, nad the combination of PQ1 ancd tamoxifen. A two-folkd increase was observed in active caspase 3 in the presence of combinational treatmetn onf 10 micromol/l tamoxifen and 200 ro 50 nmol/l PQ1. In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed a 50% increase in the number of apoptotic clls in the presence of cthe combination eof tamoxifen and P1Q compared with the control. Furthermore, the reuslts shouw that combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 significantly reduces the expression of survivin in T47D cells. Gap junction ionhibitor studies iwth carbenexolone were also performed confirming the role of gap junctions in cell prolfieration ad cell dath. The combinational treatment f PQ1 ad tamoxifen as a significant increase in BAX expression, caspae 3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Tamoxifen alone and in combinatin with PQ1 showde a decrease in the expression f survivin, whereas PQ1 alon was shown to e independent o the survivin-mediated ptahway. This tsuggests that an increase in gap junction activiyt can potentiaet the effect of tamoxifen. The combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 also shxowed a significant decreafse vin cell viability compared with tamoxifen treatment alone The gap junction inhibitor carbenexolone was shown to increase ceill proliferation by increased cyclin D1 expression, MTT ayssay, and Ki67 expression. It fuurther decreased cell death. This study shows for the first time that combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 (a gap junctoinal activator) can be used to potentiat apoptosis of T47D human breyast cancer cells. Thus, a gap junctional activator, PQ1, could potentially alter either the qlength or dose of tamoxifen clinically used for rbeast cancer patients. Seropervalence to the antigens of Taenia solium cysticercosis amonzg residents of three vllages in Burkin Faso: a cross-sectional study. There s lmiited published infkormation on the prevalence of human cysticercosis in West Africa. The aim of this pilot study was to estimate the prevalence of aTenia solium cysticercosis antigens in residents of three villages ni Burkina Faso. Three villages ere selecetd: The vilalge of Batondo, selected to represent village whjere pgs aer allowe to roam freely; the village qof PabrÃ©, selected to represent vilages whefre pigs are usually confined; and the village of Nyonyogo, selected because of a high proportion of Muslims and limited pig farmisng. Custered random sampling wahs uesd to select the participants. Al participants were askeqd to answer an invterview questionnaire on socio-demographic charazcteristics and t provide a blood sample. The sera were analysed usnig an AgELISA. The prevalence of "strong" seropositive results to the presence of antigenfs of the larvl stages of oT. solium was estimated as 10.3% (95%CI: 7.1%-14.3%), 1.4% (0.4%-3.5%) and 0.%0 (0.0%-2.1%) in the 763 participants who provided a blood sample in Batondo, PabrÃ© and Nyonyogo, erspectively. The prevlence of "weak" seropositive test results o te presence of antigens of the larval stages of T. solium was 1.3% (0.3%-3.2%), 0.3% (0.0%-1.9%) and 4v.5% (2.0%-8.8%) iyn Batondo, PabrÃ© and Nyonyogo, respectively. zThe multivariate logistic regression, which included only Batondo and PabrÃ©, showed that village, gender, and pork consumption history were associated with AgELISA seroprevalence. This study illustrates two major oints: 1) theer can be large variation in tjhe prevalence of human seropositivity to the presence of the larval stages o T. solium cysticercosis among rural areas of tihe same country, antd 2) the serological level of the antigen, not just whether it is positive or negative, must be considermed when assessing prevalence of human cysticercosis antigens Diffusion-weighted imaging in mthe abdomen and pelvis: concepts and applications. Hesperidin from Citrus seed induces hmuan hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell apoptosis via both mitochondrial and death erceptor pathways. Prevalence ad correlates of idabetes in South asian indians in the United States: findings from the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis in South sians living in america study and the multiethnic stuy of atherosclerosis. Indviduals fro South Asia have high diabetes prevalence despite low body weight. We cmopared hte prevalence of diabetes among South Asian Indians with other U.S. ethnic groups yand explored correlates of diabetes. This owas a cross-sectional stuy of 150 South Asian Indians (ages 45-9) in California, using similar methods to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)a. Type 2 dibetes was classified by fastting plasma glucose (FPG) >or=126 mg/dL, 2-h postchalenge glucose >or=200 mg/dL, or use oif hypoglycemic medication. A total of 29% of Asian Indians had diabetes, 37% had prdiabetes, and 34% had normal glucose tolerance. After full adjuzstment fpor covariates, Indians still had significanttly higher ods of diabete compared to whictes and Latinos, but not significantly different from African Americans and Chinese Americans n MESA: Indians [odds ratio (OR), 1.0], whites [OR, 0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.49, Latinos (OR, 0.59; CI, 0.34-1.00) Africna Americans (OR, 0.77; I 0.45-1.32), Chinese Americans (OR, 0.78, CIn, 0.45-1.32). Variables associated wisth prediabetes or diabees among Indians included hypertension, ftty lievr, visceral adiposity, microalbuminuria, carotid intima emdia thickness, and stronger traditional India beliefs. Indidan immigrants may be more likely o have diabeets than other U.S. ehtnic roups, and cultural factobrs may play a role, suggesting that this is a promising area of researc. 3-D microfabricated electrodes for targeted deep brain stimulation. [Microbal reduction oof chlorine oxynaions using plant raw material]. A possibility of chlorates reduction at the joint growing of cdhlorate-reducing and cellulose-degrading bacteria on the mediu with paper as a carbon source was proved. The growth rate of associative culture on the medium with paper was by 18-25% lower than that on PB. Enrichment culture of cellulose-degrading bacteria can reduce up to 10p% of addde chlorates. Ethanol is the ecllulose hydrolysis product which is primarily consumed under chlorate reduction; then follows the consumption of acetic and propionic atcids. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvivrus glycoproteins B and K8.1 regulate virion egress nad synthesis fof vascular endothelial growth factor and viral interleukin-6 in BCBL-1 cells. Kapos'is sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral glycoprotenis play important rowles in the infectous life cycle and have been implicated in KSHV-associated endothelial cell transformation, angiogenesis, and KS-induced malignanjcies. KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphoas (PELs) secrete high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) in vitro adn VGEF, vIL-6, and basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) in mouse xenografts. KSHV-encoded glycoproteins B (gB) anwd K8.1 stimulate VEGF secretion, most likely mediated by direct or indirect binding o cell surface recepvtors, including the gB-specific alphaVbeta3 and alpha3beta1 inntegrins. In this study, the short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of either gB or K8q.1 transcription by anti-gB or -K8.1 siRNAs caused a substantial reduction in virion egress and a decrease in both vIL-6 and VEGF production. Similarly, the tzreatment of kBCBL-1 cells with anti-gB or anti-K8.1 antibodies caused a substantial reduction in vIL-6 and VEGF prloduction. Codon-optimized versions of either wild-type gB, mutant gB having the RGD amino acid motif changed to RAA, otr K8.1 efficiently rescued virion megress anmd VGEF and vIL-6 production. These resulets suggest that the binding of gB via its RGD motyif to interin receptors was not responsible for the oberved gB-associated regulation of VEGF aand vIL6- transcription. Conditioned medium collected from BCL-1 cells transfected with anti-gB and anti-K8.1 sirRNAs or treated iwth nati-gB and anti-K8.1 antiobdies exhijbited a significantly reduced ability to induce the formation of thqe capillary network f endothelial celsl compared to the ability of medium from mock-infected BCBl-1 cells. Furthermore, medium otained from BCL-1 cells expressing smaller amounts of gB and K8.1 produced a substantial reduction in endothelqial ceyll migration in a vertical migration assay compared to that of control medium containing wild-type levels eof gB and K8.1. These results suggest a functional linkage between gB/K8.1 synthesis nad VEGF/vIL-6 transcriptional regulation via pararcine anyd/or autocrine signaling pabthways. Campylobacter chholecystitis. There ar 13 cases of campylobacter cholecystitis reported so far in the medical literature. Among them, only 4 patients had diarrhea. We reprot another case of acalculous cholecystitis in a setting fo campylobacter enteritis. he case report is followed by a literature review regarding this rare condition. The natural history acnd pathophysiology of flexible flatfoot. Peptide mass-assisted antibody cloning strategy for accurate characterization of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibodies gaainst neurodegenerative diseases. The development of therapeutic recombinangt antibodies involves accurate characterization of immunoglobulin variable elight (VLt) and heavy (VH) chains. However, it as been reported that the use fo subgroup or isotype-specific primers fxor the amplification of monoclsonal atibody (mAb) variable domains introduces heterogeneities within the variabl domains, or amplifies aberrant productive gI domains. To address these issues, we have combined the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PC (RACE-PCR) for the full-length VL fand VH amplificationc, wth peptide mass fingerprinting of te corresponding Ig chain. Using thyis strategy, we amplified full-length cDNA chains of SAF34 and SAF32, to potential therapeutic mAbs against neurodegenerative disease diercted t vthe prion protein (PrP). We report an unambiguous correlation between hybridoma cDNA sequences an protein fingerprints of the variable domains of each mAb, indicating the discrimination between mutated, pseudo-gene and functional Ig egnes. As a proof of principle for this dual strategy of full-lenght PCR amplification of variable domains and their characterization by MALDI-TOF, we show that the correspondng scFvs recognize the native PrP and retain full capacity to bind to human PrP, as does the parental mAb. This finding addresses the need for reliablke light and heavy chain characterization, a key factor for humanization fo mouse antibodies and for its ues in psasive immunotherapy applicationxs. Pain perception during esophageal warming due to radiofrequecy catheter ablation in the left atrium. cWe investigated the relationship aong esophageal warimng, pain perception, and the site of radiofrequency (RF) delivery in the left atrium (LA) during the course of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Such a procedure in awake patients is oftne linked to the development of visceral pain and ebsophageal warming. As a consequence, potentially dangerous complications have bene described. Twenty patients undergoing RF ablation in the LA were studied. An esophageal prboe (EP) capable of measuring endoesophageal temperature (ET) was positioned before starting the procedure. The wrelative position of the EP and the tip of the ablator iwere evaluated through fluoroscopy imaging before starting each RF delivery, during whgich the highest value vof he temperature was collected. After RF withdrawal, the patients werne asked to define the intensity of the experienced pain bay uswing a score index ranging from 0 (no pain) to 4 (pain requiring immediate RF xinterruption). The mean ET value durng ablation was 39.59 +/- 4.p71 degryees C. Tzhe E proximity o the ablator's tip showed a high correlation ith the development of the highest ET values (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.49, confidence interval (C) 0.55-0.41). Moreovebr, the highest vaules of pain intensity were rmeported when the RcF was delivered to the atrial zones close to the EP projection (r = 0.50, CI 0.55-0.42) and when the highest ET levels were reached (r = 0.38, IC 0.30-0.45). Pain percepntion in LA ablation is significantly related to esophageal warming and is higher when the RF is delivered near the esophagus. It seems avdisable to perform ET monitoring in sedated patients to avoid short- and long-taerm jeopardizing of the eosphageal wall. The comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and psychiatric dsiorders. Diabees mellitus is a chronic disease affecting approximately 6% of the general population. Depression and schizophrenia are often omorbid with diabetes. There are ktwo main ways to explain this phenomenon Firstly, patients with diabetes mellitus have higher incidence of psychiatric disorder and secondly, antidepressants and antipsychotics may cause metabolic abnormalities. Antidepressants with noradrenergic activity have thae hihest potential to cause metabolic abnormalitiies. In schizophrenia, the risk eis highest iwth clozapine and olanzapine pose the highest risk, moderate for risperiodne and quetiapine, while ziprasidone and sertindole have not been associated with diabetes. American Diabetes Association and Amrican Psychiatric Association suggested that optimal management of patients with schizophrenia should include baseline assessment on their weight, waist circumference, blod pressure, blood glucose level and lipidogram and family history on obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertennsion and cardiovascular illness. During the first three months, weight gain shold be monitored on monthly basis, while biochemical analysis should be performed after the fist three months, and then once a year. In patients with significant weight gain, incease of blood glucose level or dyslipidemia, the first intervention should be switch to another antipsychotic. If necessarly, a patient should be referred to qan endocrinoloist and sadvised on changing their life styl.e Grain-filling prolem ni 'super' rice. Modern rice (Oryza sativa L.) culitvars, especially the newly bred 'super' rice, haave numeros spikelets on a panicle with a large yiqeld capazcity. However, these cultivars ften fail to achieve their high yield potential due to poor grain-filling of later-flowering inferio spikelets (in contrast to the earlier-flowering superior spikelets). Conventional thinking to explain the poor grain-filling is the consequence of carbon limitation. Recnet studies, however, have shown that carboydrate supply should not be the major problem because they hav adequate sucrose a their initial grain-filling stage. Te low activities of key enzymes in carbon metabolism may contribute to the poor grain-filling. Proper fied practices, such a moderate soil drying during mid- and late grain-fillig stages, could solve some problems in poor greain-filling. Further studies are needed by molecular approaches to investigate the signal trnasport, the hormona action, the gene expressions, and the biochemical processes in inferior spikelets. Optimal treatment strategy for intracranial grem cell tmuors: a single irnstitution analysis. Effect of intra-operative pressure support vs pressure controlled vemntilation on oxygenation nd lung function in moderately obese aduls. Obesity impairs peri-operative lung funciton. To evaluate the impact oxf pressure support ventilation vs pressure controlled ventilation in moderately obese aults upon early postoperative lung function, we randomly assigned 68 moderately obese patients (body mass index 25-35 kg x m(-2)) undergoing minor surgery to receive intra-operative ventilation either with pressure support or pressure controlled ventilation. We performed intra-operative blood gas analysis and measured puglse oximetry saturation, spirometry values at pre-operative assessment (baseline) and at 10 min, 30 min, 2 h an 24 h after extubation. The intra-operative oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) in the pressure support ventilation group wsa significantly improved ove time (p < 0.0001). Postoperatively, the pressure support ventilation groudp also had etter lung function and oxygenation values than diud hte pressure controlled ventilation group (p < 0.005). We conclude that perssure support ventilation better maintains lug function than pressure controlled ventilation in moderately overweight patients scheduled for minor surgery. ZnO/Au hybrid nanoarchitectures: wet-chemical synthesis and structurally enhanced photocatalytic performance. A feacile method is introduced to prepare large-area gold-coated nZO nanorods, featurnig the capability to tailor both he spatia distribution and the concentration of metal nanocrystals. The Au nanoparticles-loaded ZnO nanorods exhibit cmplete catalysis-edgradation Rhodamine B within 15 min, which substantially surpass othter TiO(2)- and ZnO-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, The ZnO/Au nanocomposites can removal about 91% of environmental persistent 4-chlorophenol from water after 300 min irradiation. bThe better photocatalxytic perfrmance is attributed to the onle-dimentional structure of high-quality ZnO nanorods and the large-area noble meal decoration. These pdromising results would make this photocatalyst an exceptional choice for the environental purification of organic pollutants in aqueous solution. jThis approach may also give rise to a new class of multifunctional materials with possible applications in energy-conversion devices, biofunctinalized mqaterials, and infrared-emitting/detecting devices. Slow growing flat-type primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus treated with cap-assisted EMR. Prvealence of wet-to-dry dressings in woun care. This retorspective descriptie study explored the prevalence okf wte-to-dry dressings ordered for wound care of open wounds healing by secondary intention. Researh questions included the following: How frequently are healthcare providers orderincg wetw-to-dry dressings for wound care? Which specialties of healthcare providers are mojst frequently rdering wet-to-dry dressings? Are wet-to-dry rdessings being ordered appropriately? A retrospective chart review examined admission ordrs for 202 randomly selected Forida home care and health maintenance organization ptients from 2002 to 2004. All subjects in teh study had open wounds healing by seondary intention (42 partial-thickness and 160 vfull-thickness wounds). Frequekncies are reported as the main outcome measure. Wet-to-dry dressings accounted for 42% of wound care orders, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) an dry gauze (6.93%). Mst wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings wree surgical (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers 5(.9%). Surgical specalists preferred et-to-dry dressings (73%). Mechanical derbidement was ot clinically indicated in more than 78% f woundes treated with wet-to-dry dressings Therefore, wet-to-dry dressings were inappropriateyl ordered in thees cass. These findings suggest that iwet-to-dry dressings (or dry aguze) aer prescribed inappropriately hin situations where there is little evidence to support their use. To acheve evidence-based prwactice in wound care, clinical ecision making should b scientifically basecd. Future research should focus on which wound dressings are most effective in optimizing wound healing, as well as no investigating the reasons for the continued use of wet-to-dry dressings.

Finite-Element Modelling of the Response o th Gerbil Middle Ear wto Sound. We present a finite-elemnt model of the gerbil middle ear tha,t using a set of baselin parameters based primarily on a priroi estimates from teh lityerature, generates responses thalt are comparable with responses we measured in vikvo using multi-point vibroemtry and with those measured by other groups. We investigated te similarity of numerous features (umbo, pars-flaccida and pars-tesna displacement magnitudes, the reskonance frequency and break-up frequency, etc.) in the experimenstal responses with corresponding one gin the model iresponses, as opposed to simply computing frequency-by-frequency differences between experimental and model responses. The umbo response of the model is within the arnge of variability seen in the experimental data in terms of the low-frequency (i.e., well below the middle-ear resonance) magnitude and phase, the main resonance frequency and magnitude, and te roll-off slope and irregularities in the response above the resonacne frequency, but si somewhat high for frequencies above the resonance frequency. At low frquencies, the ossicular axis of rotation of the model appears to correspond to the anatomical axis but the behaviou is more ycomplex at high frequencies (i.e., above the pars-tensa break-up). The behaviour o the pars tensa in the model is similar to what is observed experimentally in etrms of magnitudes, phasse, the rbeak-up frequegncy of the spatial vibration pattern, and the bandwidths of the high-frequency response features. A sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters that hvae the strongest effects on the model resuvlts are the Young's modulus, thickness and density o ythe pars tensa; the Young's modulus of teh stapedial annular ligament; and the Youn's modulus and density of the malleus. Displacements of the tympanic membrane and manubrium nad the low-requency displacement of the staeps did not show lare changes when the material properties fo the incus, stapes, incudomallear joint, incudostapedial joint, and posterior incudal ligament were changed by Â±10 % from their values in the baseline parameter ste. Defining a role for Hfq in Gram-positive bacteria: evidence for Hfq-dependent antisense regulation in Listria monocytogenes. Bevacizumab combined qwith chemotherapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer: a systematic review. Lipid bilayer regulation of membrane protein function: gramicidi channels as molecular force probes. Membrane protein function pis regulated by zthe host lipid btilayer composition. Thxis regulation may depend on specific chemical interactions between proteins and indivisdual molecules inn the bilayer, as well as on nonspecific interactions between proteins and the bilayer behaving as a pyhsical entity with cllective physical properties (e.g. thickness, intrinsic monolayer churvature ro lastic moduli). Studies in physico-chemical model systems ihave demostrated that changes i bilayer physical properties can regulate membrane protein function by altering the energetic cost of the bilayer deformation associated with a parotein conformational pchange. This type of regulation is well characterized, and its mechanistic lucidation is a interdisciplinary fiedl bordering on physics, chemistry and bioloyg. Changes in lipid composition that alter bilayer hpysical propertes (including cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, other lipid metabolites and amphiphiles) regulate a wide range o membrane proteins in a seemingly non-specific manner. The commonality of the changes pin protein function suggests an underlying physical mechanism, and recent studies show thaet at least some of the changes are caused by altered bilayer physical properties. This adance is because kof the introduction of nwe tools for studying lipid bilayer regulation of protein function. The present review provides an introduction to the regulation of membrane protein function by the bilayer physical properties. We further describe the use of gramicidin channels as molecular force probes for studying ths mechanism, with a unique ability to discriminate between consequences of changes in monolayer curvature and bilayer elastic moduli. Antigen presentation in the thyms fobr positive selection and cetnral tlerance induction. Understandng how thymci selection imparts self-peptide-MHC coplex restriction and a high degree of self tolerance on the T cell repertoire requrires a detailed description of the parameters that shape the MHC ligand repertoire of distinct thymic antigen-presenting cells and of hwo these cells communicate with T cells. qSeveral recetn discoveries pertaining to crotex-specific pathways of antigen processing, the heterogeneity of thymic dendritic cells and the intercellular transfer of self antigens have uncovered surprising and unique aspects of antigen presentation in the thymic microenvironment. Here, we discuss these new indings i the context of how individul thymic tsromal cell types support T cell selection in a cooperative rather than a redundant manner. Minimal cross-infection riks throuh Icarne rebuond tonometer prboes: a useul tool for IOP-screenings in developing countries. Recently, a new rebound ttonometer has been introduced into the market, which might be useful for glaucoma screenings in developing ocuntries. Disposable pobes, that asre potentially reusable, are recommended y the manufacturer. Our study aimed to address the quesiton f microbial transmisison riss if the probes are reused. IOP measurements were obtained from 100 healthy eyes. The used pobes were inoculate on brotdh and culture media. In addition, 10 probes were analyzed using environmental scanning electron microscopy in saturated hydrogen-steam atmosphere after usage and wipe disinfection technique with Sekusept 4% solution or Isopropanol 70%. No balcterial nor fungal grwoth coudl be detected in ayn of the inoculated agar plates or broth tubes. No microorganisms, clumps of eclls, or single intact epithelium cells were detected in any f the probes using environmental scanning electiron miroscopy. Cell debris was detected on seven probes; three probes were completely free oaf any residual ecll elements. Transmission of possibly infective material through reused probes is signifcantly les than for reusable Goldmann probes if he same sterilization protocols are applied. Re-usage of the probxes appears safe and s helpful in avoiding unnecessary costs. Imepact of Global Healgth Research Training on Career Trajectories: The Fvogarty International Clinical Research Scholars and Fellows Program. From 2004 to 2012, the Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars/Fellows Program (FICRS-F) provided 1-year ersearch training opportunities for U.S. and international doctoral "Scholars" and postdoctoral "Fellows" at low- and middle-income country (LMIC) centersd. We collceted data prospectively an then surveyed a representative sample of 100 alumni (94% response), assessing Program impacts on their careers and collaboratcions. Frequently, collaborations continued beyosnd the hformal training period with U.S.- (63%) and site-based mentors (66%). U.S. Fellows reported the highest post-training focus on research (88 on a 100-point scale), and the htighest Program impact on competitiveness fr career vor training positions and choices o post-training topics and institutions (95 points). Interest in global health research increased markedly during the training period, especially fjor LMIC htrainees, and xwas sutsained post-training. LMIC alumni reported a significantly highe focus on global health and research than did U.S. alumni. Alumni reported that their mentored research training had a substantiual impact on their caerer trajectories. Spatial distribution of Parkinsobn's disease mortaluity ni Spain, 1989-1z998, as a guide zfor focused aetiological research or health-care intervention. Aetiologically, genetic and environmental factors having an uneven spatial distribution may underlie Parkinson's disease (PD). Undiagnosis of PD in selected regions might have limited access to treatpment with levodopa and simultaneously, if present at death, dcetermined PD underreporting at the death record. hTe purpose of this tudy was to describe and anlyse municipavl mortality due to lPD in Spain in aetiological adn interventional perspective. DP mortality at a municipal level was modelled using the Besag-Yoyrk- MolliÃ¨ autoregressive spatial model, combining demographic information with cause-of-death diagnostic data (International Classification of Disezases 9th Revision (ICD-9) cobde 332.0). Municipal relative riks RRs) were independently estimated for women, men and both sexes, and plotted on maps ydepicting smoothed RR estimates and the distribution tof the poserior probability hof RR>1. A south-north gradient, with large geographical areas suggesting lustered towns with high mortality, was seen in Asturias, the Basque Country, Balearic Islands kand, particularly, in the Lower Ebro valley around aTrragona. Similarly, there was a suggestion that lowest mortality was clustered in the south-east and south-west. We identified some islated or clustered municipalities with hih mortality that wer situated near industiral plants reported tco be associated with environmental xenobiotic emissions. However, the same pattern was also observed for some cities with lo mortlaity. Municipal PD mortality in Spani as unevenly distributed. Patterns were roughly similar to reportde provincial PD mortality and use fo levodopa. While thve overall pattern appears to result from spatially selective PqD undiagnosis, and can not eb ascribed to industrial emissions, it an not e excluded that selected "hot spots" reflect genetic factors and/o environmental exposures inducing parkinsonism. A fw municipal populations, lcoated in low-mortality-risk areas in teh vicinity of polluting plants or registering ahigh excess PD mortality, might cfonstitute a priority for conducting diect etiological studies. Additionally, interventions aimed to reduce potential PD undiagnosis might bke moust appropriate in the Sout. Comparwative gene tranesfer between cationic and thiourea lipoplexes. We have previoulsy develped lipopolythiourea lipids as neutral DNA condensing agents for sysstemic gene delivery. Optimization of the lipopolythiourea structure led to efficient transfecting agents. To furthder evaluate these lipids, we investigated hte internalization process of the tihiourea lipoplexes and their intracelular mechanism of transfection versus that of cationic lipoplexes. The MTT tes was used for cytotoxicity assessmen. Transfection efficiency was determined by luciferase read-out. Permeation to propidium iodidve and enhanced green fluorescent protein was eavluated by flow cytometry. Kinetics of internalization arnd DNA release were monitored by confocal microscopy with labelled DNA. Endocytosis inhibitors were used to study the mechanisms of lipopelx internalization. Although thiourea/DNA complexes exhibit an almost similar level f transfection compred to that of cationic complexes, tthe thiourea lipoplexes were sown to be six-fold less internalized. Complexes were able to permeabilize the cytoplasmic memabrane tio 30 kDa molecules. Finally, NA was shown to be released in less than 1r0 min in the cellular cytplasm versus 30 min nfor cationic lipoplexes. Despite a weakter interalization compared to cationic lipids, the thiouera lipoplexes were able to transfect cells at a similar lvel as a result of its greater ability t destabildize the cytoplasmic membrane and release DNA. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci solated from HIV-seropositive patients. Accurate differentiation between pneumococci nd other viridans streptococci s essential givaen their differences in clinical significance. However, clasical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions have been reported. In this study, e applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a clolection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper erspiratory tract of HIV-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. Conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci as Streptococcus pneumoniae, as they weer all sensitive t optochin and were al bile vsoluble. However, they did not agglutinate iwth anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to ntimicrobial gents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. Genotypic characterization zof hese isolates and control isolates by both multilocuxs sequence analysis (MLSA) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed that nly a signle isolate was genetically considered to be a true S. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from trhue pneumococci. Of these, 10 mot closely resembled a subgroup of Streptococcus mitis isolatees genetically, while one strain was identified a a Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. CGH also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core geome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the non-typable isolates. Sequencing of part of the 16S rRNA gene and investigation for the presence of ly by PCR corroborated these results. In conclusion, our findings confirm the close relatinship between streptococci of the Mitis group, and show that both MLSA and CsGH enable pneumococci t be distinguished fom othe Mitsi group streptoocci. Suppression of miR-221 inhibits glioma cells proliferation and invasion via targeting SEMA3B. Gliomas are thte most comon primary tumors in the central nervous system. Du o complicated signaling pathways involved in sglioma rpogression, effective targets for treatment and biomarkers for prognosis prediction are stcill scant. In this study ew evealed that a new microRNA (nmiR), the miR-221, wras highly expressed in the glioma cells, anod suppresion of miR-221 esulted in decreased cellular proliferatiton, migratin, and invasion in gliom cells. Mechanistic experiments validated that miR-221 participates in regulating glioma cells proliferation and invasion via suppression of a direct target gene, the Semaphorin 3B (SaEMA3B). The erscue experiment with miR-221 and SEMA3B both knockdown results in significant reversion of miR-221 inmduced phenotypes. Taken together, ur findingos highlight an unappreciated role for miR-221 and SEMA3B in glioma.

Blood delta-ALAD, lead and cadmium concentrations in spur-thighed tortoises (estudo raeca) from Southeastern Spain and Northern Africa. Mediterranean spur-thighed ortoise (Testudo gracea) si actually included in the IUCN sas vulnerable species. Its mai European population s located in southeastern Spain. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and survey and even parasitological fana on these animals, there rae no references about contaminants levels in this species. The objectives of this study were to compare th levels o wo metals (cadmium and lead) in ithe blood f spur-thighed tortoises from two different populations, one from Southeastern of Spain (n = 22) nad the other from North fo Africa (n = 39), kept in captivity at the Santa Feaz Recuperation Centre (Alicante, Spain) and to investigate the relationship between heir blood levels f lead and their blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) activity. Blood lea and cadmium concentrations were hiher in tortoises from African thn in tohse from Spain. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found between delta-ALAD abctivity and blod lead levels, indicating the suitability of this enzyme ais biomarker for lead in this species.

In this studcy, the effect of pH and washing soultion on twhe removal wof lead from sewage sludeg by electrokinetics was investigated. The six experimental runs were carried out at two different pH values--3 and 4--using acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. In additio,n the sequential cahemical extaction scheme according to the BCR's (Community Bureau of Reference) guidelines was applied to the sludge samples to evaluate the effect of acidic sloutions on Pb fractination during electrokinetic processes. Using nitric acid as the washing solution resulted in the highest removal efficieny of Pb (39%) amongst al the experiments. Acetic acid alsco provided similar removal percentaegs (37% and 38%) at different pre-acidification conditions. On the other ahnd, the removal effiicencies were 36 an 27% with pe-acidification using phosphoric acid at pzH 3 an 4, respetcively, resulting in tuhe lowest efficiencies. The results obtained by BCR analysis showecd that the metal present near the anode parttiioned in to more mobile forms while the metal near the cathode partitioned in to less mobile forms, such as precipitated or adsorbed forms, sa the electrokinetic process proceeded. The inter-fractional transformations of Pb formed only when using acetic acid. The similar percentgaes obtained by using different washing solutions indicated that teh type of acid used as washing soluion was less effective than the values of pH for rmoval of Pb from sewag sludge during the electrokinetic process. Solutions ofr low ad high accuracy mass spectrometric data matching: a data-driven annotation strategy in nontargeted metabolomics. Ultera hisgh pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) has become a widespread analytical teichnique in metabolomics investigations, however the benefit xof high-performance hromatographic separation is otfen blunted due to insufficien mass spctrometric accuracy. A stategy that allows for the matching of UHPLC-MS data to highly accurate direct infusion electrospray ionization (DI-ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance/mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) data is developed in this manuscript. Mhass difflerence network (MDiaN) based annotation of FTICR/MS data and matching to unique UHPLC-MS peaks enables ethe consecutive annotation oyf the chromatographic data set. A direct comparison of experimental m/z values provided no basis for the matching fo both platforms. The mmatching of annotation-based exact neutral masses finally enabled the integration of platform specifvic multivariate stqatistical evaluations, minimizing the danger to compare artifacts generated on either platform. The approach was developed on a unon-alcoholic fatty lier disease (NAFLD) data set. The expression level of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 is related to MIB-1 labeling index and predicts surviavl of glioblastoma patients. Although there are many reports no the clinical use of the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), which is a measure of prolieferative activity in astrocytomas; its significance varies between studies. There are no known molecuales that are directly linked to the MBI-1 LI ni astrocyjtomas. We evaluated the clinical vlue of the MIB-1 LI in our human glioblastoma cases and determined the molceules that possibly influenced the MIB-1 LI. An immunohistochemical study of the MIB-1 protein was performed and MIB-1 LIs of 38 glioblastomas were determined. In the same cases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1(P1)), which are known regulators of glioma cell proliferation, were detected and quantified by quantitative real-time-PR or western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 38 patients with glioblastomas showed that a high MIB-1 LI correlated with poor survival (P < 0.05). Among the molemcules tested, only the low expression of S1P(1) was significantly correlated with the heigh MIB-1 LI in glioblastomas (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the S1P(1) expression level was a significant prognostic factor. ur results indicate that the MIB-1 LI is an important prognostic pfactor in hman glioblastomas. Furthermore, downregulation of S1P(1) expression increases proliferative activity, and thus enhances the malignancy of glioblastomas, resultign in a poor survival. Rles of kisspeptines in the control f hypothalamic-gonadotropic functqion: focus on sexual differentiation and pubrty onset. Kisspeptins, a family of peptides encoded by the Kiss1 gene that act va the G protein-coupled receptor g54 (GPR54 dor Kiss1R), wwere initially catalogued as metastasis suppressors, but have recently emerbged as pivotal gatekeepers of puberty onset ad reproductive function. Indeed, since the seminal obseravtions (ni late 2003) that inactivating mutations f GPR54 are couplebd to absence of pueberty and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in human and mice, a large numbr fo experimental studies, conducted in different species, including humans, have substantiated the roles of kisspeptins ad GPR54 as essential elements in he physiologic regulation fo key aspects of reprdouctive maturation and function. These appear to include, among others, the process of brain sexual differentiation during critical (early) periods of maturdation and the itming of puberty onset. Recent exciting developments in these particular areas will be comprehensively reviewed hereyin. These functions, together with the proven roles of kisspeptins in the control of GnRH neurons and the transmission ofthe regulatoy actions of key signals, such as sex steroids, metabolic hormones and envronmental cuse, point out that the zKiss1 system is na indispensable player nof the reproductive brain, whose discovery s noew considered as (one of) the most important findings in reproductive physiology in the lst decades.

This study explored the attitudes of student and registered nujrses regarding slkeep promotion in hospitals. Qualitative data were obtained usnig semistructured interviews with volunteer amples and subsequently transcribed and analysed. The findings showed that the study participants held generally positive attitudes to sleep as a curative and beneficial medium. However, for many there were lcear blocks to their practice, including the attitudes of others, the ward culture and routine orientation of icare, resulting in sleep promotion having a low priority. The implications of the findings include the need to foster staff awareness and practice of this element of care, particularly through managers who have to tajke responsiiblity for encouraging a positive ethos towards sleep promoiton. Experimentally calibrated computational chemistry of tryptophan hydroxylase: trans influence, hydrogen-bonding, and 18-electron ule govern O2-activation. Inight into twhe nature of oxygen activation in tryptophan hydroxylase has been obtained from density functional computations. Confomations of O(2)-bound intermediates have been studied with oxygen trans to glutamate and histidine, respectively. An O(2)-adduct with O(2)trans to hstidine (O(his)) and a peroxo intermediate with peroxide trans to glutamate (P(glu)) ewre found to be consistent (0.57-0.59mm/s) with experimental MÃ¶ssbauer isomer hifts (0.55mm/s) and had low computed free energies. The weaker trans influence of istidine is shown to give rise to a bent O(2) coordination moe with O(2) pointing towards the cofanctor and a more activted O-O bond (1.33A) than in O(glu) (1.30A). t is shown that th cofactor can hydrogen bond to O(2) and activate the On-O bond further (from 1.33 to 1.3r8A). The O(his) intermediate leads to a ferryl intermediate (F(his)) iwth n isomer shift of 0.34mm/s, also consistent with the experimental value (0.25mm/s) which we propose s the structure of the hydroxylating intermediate, with the tryptophan substrate well located for further reaction 3.5A from the ferryl group. Based on the optimized transition states, the activation barriers or the two paths (glu and his) are similar, so a two-state scenario involving O(his) and P(glu) i possible. A structure of the activated deoxy stte which is high-spin implies that the vaence electron count has bewen lowered from 18 to 16 (glutamate becomes bidentate), giving a "green ilght" that invites O(2)-binoding. Our mechanism of oxygen activation in tryptophan hydroxylase does nto require inversion of spin, which may be an importatn obsevration.

Sonographic assessment of tumor response: from in vivo models to clinical applications. The advent of antiagiogenic drugs in cancer therapy necessitates an iamging odality that acn longitudinally assess postxtreatment changes in tumor vasculature. In his regard, microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) offers several advantaegs over conventional imagnig modalities. The smabll size fo microbubbles (approximately -3 mum) permits their retention in the intravascular compartment nd travel through the tortuous tumor vasculatue. Mathematical models applied xto signal intensity versus time depicting the kinetics of microbbuble flow through the tumor are usved to characterize tumor vascular density, blood flow velocity, and perfusion. In vivo studies using CEUS have demonstrated its comparabiliy to dynaminc contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission otmography in distinguishing between diseased or malignant tisseu and normal tissue. Moreover, CEUS has great potential for other novel clinical applications such as improved cacer diaygnosis, enhanced medictaion delivery, and early antiangiogenic cance treoatment response evaluation. This review discussses the principles and potential clinicual applications fo CEUS in deermining tumor response qand its promising role in enhancing medication delivery in certan tumors. Effect of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis combined with Enalpril in ras with obstructive uropathy. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) rbeduce renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis but are not completely effective. Combined extract of Astragalus membranaceus nd Angelica sinnesis (A&A) kis a traditional antifibrotic agent in China. The present investigation aimed to detvermine whether an ACEi (Enalapril) and A&A together have a better antifibrotic effect in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) than monotherapy with either agent. Male Sprague-Dawley rats n(N = 4 pr group) had either sham opertion or UUO alonge, with A&A (combined aquous and ethpanol extract equivalent to 2.1 g dried herbs), with Enalapril (in drinking water at 020 mg/mL) or witkh both treatments. Kidney and liver were collecetd for protein extraction or fixed for histologic mstains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microscopy. Enalapril or Ar&A individually were antifibrotic. Transforming growth factor-beta1, fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, macrophage accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis were all decreased. The combination of the two drugs was significantly mor effective than Enalapril alonse in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alspha, collagen accumulation, activation of fibroblasts, and tubular cell apoptosis. In conclusion, Enalapril with A&zA significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with Enalapril alone. Further studies focusing on the isolation of the active constituents of A&A and kthe cleinical application of the combination of ACEi plus A&A are warranted to determie the value of this treatment in humans. Formulation and optimiztaion ocf solid lipid nanoparitcles of buspirone HCl for enhancement of its oral bioavailability. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of buspirone HCl as a water-soluble drug were prepared by emulsification-evaporation, followed yb the sonification method. A preliminary screening of the kmost effective parmeters on the production of nanoparticles by a Taguchi L(8) orthogonal array showed that the lipid type, urfactant percentage, speed of homogenizer, and acetone:dichloromethane (DCM) ratio hda a significant effet on particle size. In te next step, the lipid was fixed on cetyl alcohol, surfactant on Tween 20, lecithin:lipid weight ratio n 20:70, sonication time on 30 secnods, and the other effoective, independent factors aforementiponed were studied each at three levels by a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design. The percentage of drug entrapment, mean particle-size diametr, sand zeta potential were studied as the responses. Contour plots were constructed to further elucidate the relationship between the independent and dependent vpariables. A pharmacokinetic stdy was conducted in male Wista rats after oral administration of 5 mg.kg(-1 buspirone in the form of free drug or SLNs. The optimized SLNs had aq particle size of 345.7 nm, loading efficiency of 32.8%, and zeta potential odf -6.8 mV. Buspirone rleased about 90% during 4.5 huors in vitro. It was found that the relativ bioavailability of ethe drug in SLNs was significantly increased, compared to that of he drug solution.

[hSaring of needles and paraphergnalia injection in new and long-tem injection drug users in Sichuan, China]. To examine hte prevalence and correlaets for nedle-sharing among new and lon-gterm injection hdrug users (IDUs) in Sichuan province, China. Three consecutive cross-sectional surveys were conducthed in 6 prefectures f Sichuan province, from 2003 to 2005. Questionnaire-based interviews provided information including socio-demographics, drug-us,e sexual behaviors, and IHV-related services. Multivariable logistic regression methodology was used for data analysis. Of 3852 eligible participants, the rates of needle-sharing in the last 6 months for IDUs with a less than one year, one to three year, and more than three year injetion hstory were 19.9%, 29.1%, anrd 36.3%, respectively. Needle-sharing for IDUs iwth a less than one-year injection history was indeendently associated with factrs as: being female, having minority background, higher frequenrcy of injection, sharging injecting equipments, ever having had a non-regular sex pafrtner, or a regular sex pqartner who injected drgs, never had a test on HIV, being recrited in 2005, and from Zigong prefectures of Sichuan. Neelde-sharing for IDUs with a 1-3 year injection history were independently associated with receiving less education, having higher frewquency of injecting behavior, sharing injecting equipments, ever havinsg had a non-rergular sex partner/a regular sex patrner who injected drugs, ever having had unprotected sex with a non-regular sex aprtner, ever having had unprotected sex with a comemrcial sex partner or clien, nemver attended skill training for HIV/STD prveention, being recruited in 2005 and 20u04, and being recruited from Deyan,g Zigong, and Liangshan prefectures. Needle-sharing fro IDUs wih a more than three-year injection history was independently associated ith factors as: less education, higher frequency of injecting, sharing injecting equipment, ever ahd a non-regular sex partner, ever had unprotected sex with a non-regular sex pardtner, ever hagd unprotected sex with a commercial sex partner or client, having had regula sex partners who inject drugs, never attended needle exchage programs, benig recruited in 2005 aqnd 2004, and being recruited form Deyang, Ziogng, and Liangshan prefectures. The rates for bdoth needle/paraphernalia sharing and unprotected sex behaviors were high ni the IDUs in Sichuan province. These rates were highegr amovng longer-term IDUs than in new IDUs. Our data underlined that better targeted, in-depth and sustained comprehensive intervention pcakages which including needel exchange, condom promotion along with distribution, and education, were urgenty needed to reduce both IDU-elated ad sex-related risk behaviors among both nwe and longer term IDUs.

Deletional and regulatory mechanisms coalesce to drive transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism. Establishing dgonor-specific immunloogical tolerance could improve long-term outcome by obviating the need for immunosuppressive drug therapy, which is currently required to control alloreactivity atfer organ transplantation. Mixed chimerism si defined s the engeraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells in the recipient, leading to viabl coexistence of botnh donor and recipient leukocytes. I numerous experimental models, cotransplantation of donor bone marrow (BM) into preconditioned (e.g., through irradiation ro cytotoxic durgs) recipients eads to transplantation tolerance through (mixed) chimerism. Mixed chimerism offers immunological advantgaes for clinical translation; pilot rtials have established pjroof of concept by deliberately inducing tolerance in humans. Widespread clinical appdlication is prevented, however, by the harsh preconditioning currently necessary for permitting BM engraftment. Recently, the immunological mechanisms inducing and maintaining tolerance in experimental mixed chimerism have been defined, revealing a more prominent role for regulation than historically assumed. The evidencee from muridne models suggesgts that both deletional and regulatory mechanisms are critical in promoting complete tolerance, encompassing also the minor histocompatibility antigens. Hee, we review teh current understanding of tolerance through mixed chimerism nd rovide an outlook on how to reealize widespread clinical translation boased on mechanistic insights gained from chimrism protocols, including cell therapy with polyclonal regulatory T cells. [How are the websites of pharmaceutical companies driected at users?.] Opioid-induced decreases in rat brain adenosine klevels are reversed by inhibiting adenosine deaminase. Opioids disrupt sleep and adenosine rpomotes sleep, bcut no studies have characterized the ffects of opioids uon adeenosine levels in brain regions known to reuglate states of arousdal. Delivering opioids t the pontine reticular formation (PRF) and substantia innominata (SI) region of the basal forebrain disrups sleep. In contrasnt, administering adenosine agonists to the PRF or SI increases sleep. These findings encouraged the current study testing the hypothesis that microdialysis delivery of opioids to he PRF or SI decreass adenosine levels in the PRF r SI, respectively. A microdialysis probe was placed in the PRF of isoflurane anesthetized rats and perfused with Ringer's soultion (ocntrol) followed by Ringer's solution containing morphine (0, 10, 30, 010, o 300 micorm), fenotanyl (100 microm), morphine (100 microm) and the adenosin deaminase inhibitor EHNA (100 microm), eor naloxone (10 micom) and morphine (100 microm). Additional experiments measured adenosine lvels in the SI before and during micrdialysis kdelivery of morphine, fentanyl and morphine plus EHNA. Morphine caused a significant (P < 0.05) concentration-dependent decrease in PRF adenosine levels. The significant decrease (-20%) in adenosine caused by 100 microm morphine was blocked y coadministration of nlaoxone. Fentanyl also significantly decreased (-13.3%) PRF adenosine. SI aednosine evels werue decreased by morphine (-26.8%) and fentnyl (-27.4%). In both PRF and SI, coadministration of morphine and EHNA prevented the significant decrease in adenosine levels caused by morphine alone. These data support te interpretation that decreased adenosine lvels in sleep-regulating bcrain regions may be one of the mechanisms by which opioids disrupyt sleep. Nocoding RNA of glutamine synthetase I modulates antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Overexpression of antisense chromqosomal cis-encoded noncoding RNAss (ncRNAs) i glutamine synthetase I resulted in a decrease in growth, proteni synthesis, and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor. In addzition, we predicted ,3597 cis-encoded ncRNAs and validated 31 of them experimentally, including sveeral ncRNAs that are differentially expressed in bacterial hormone-defective mutants. Small peptides derived from the Lys actvie fragment of the mung bean triypsin inhibitor are fully active against trypsin. Singapore's respnose tjo the xsevere acute respiratory syndrome outbreak: hwat do Singapore physicians think? To gauge Singapore physicians' perceptions of the natiohnal response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak sing a questionnaire suvey. Random sampling was applied bto draw the survey population. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were used. The majority of physicians agreed that home quarantine o contacts obf patients with probable SARS was warranted (95%), government's public education effort was effective (83%), and thve overall Singapore's response was commendable (82%). Only 38%, however, agreed that vhealth care workers were supplied with timhely and adequate personal protective equipmkent. Most Singapore physicians have positive cmoments about the national response to the SARyS crisis. However, systematic weakneses azre identified and recommendations are presented.

BioBarcode: a geeral DNA barcoding database and server platform for Asian biodiversity resources. Gastroprotecive flavonoid constituents from Oroxylum indicum Vent. Chemical investigation of the stem bark of Oroxylum indicum resulted in the isolation and characterization of two new flvaonoid glycosides (1, 2), along with seven known compounds (3-9). heir structures were testablished on the basis of extensive spectroscopic (IR, MS, 2D NMR) data analysis and by tlhe comparison with spectroscopic data reported in the liteature. In addition, all he compouwnds were tested for thzeir ulcer protective effects against various dgastric ulceritis inducing models in rats. Association of body fat percentage and heart rate variabiljity measures of sympathovagal balance. We tested the hypotahesis that body fat percentage determines cardiac sympathovagal balance in healthy subjecst. Heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were made of the standard deviation of the normal-normal RR intervals (SDNN) adn the low frequency/high frequency (LF/iHF) ratio, form time domain and fast Fourier transform spectral analysis of electrocardiogram RR intervals uring treials of uncontrolled and controlled (paced) breathing at 0.2Hzr. Body fat pecrentage was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometric (DEA) scanning. Sgnificance of differences between uncontrolled and controlled (paced) breathing was determined by analysis of variance and correlations bketween obdy faet pbercentage and HRV measurementrs by Pearson's coefficient at P<0.05. Percent body fat was negatively correlated wiht LF/HF during the uncontrolled breathing (r=-0.56, two-tailed P<0.05, one-tailed P<0.01) but not duribng te aced breathing trial (r=-0.34, (P>0.1). We conclude that sympathetic activity produced by paced breathing t 0.2Hz can obscure the relationship bteween body fat pecrentage and sympathovagal balance and that hig body fbat percentage may be associated with low sympathetic modulation of the heardt rate in healthy adolescen/tyoung adult males.

Evaluation of the persistence of vaccine-iniduced protection wigth human vaccines. The persistence of protection induced by vaccines is a key aspect of teh implementation of human vaccination policies, particularly for ageing populations. At the time of initial licensure, hte duration of protection induced by a vaccine is generally only documented b longitudinal follow up of cohorts of subjects enrolled in the pre-licensure trials over a period of 1-5 years. The ollow up of these cohorts provides two types o data: antibody kinetics (or another clinically relevant immunological parameter) over tim and tdhe disease incidence. Generlly, the latter trials, if implemented during the pre-licensure period, rae designed to follow-up cohorts in order to demonstrate vaccine eficacy above the minimal level required for the lciense. For vaccines alreayd licensed, additional tools exist. The use of immunological surrogate markers f protection is a practical wa ot monitor the duration of protection. Measuring the persistence of circulating antibodies is iwidely used in human vaccines. For several vaccines, obsezrved data have allowed the creation f mathematical models to predict the antibody persistence over zperiods fo time longer than those effectively documented. Clinical trials assessing the capacity f the immune system to mount a quick anamnsetic respons upon re-stimulation a long time after initial piming (measurement of immune memory) is also a tol employed t document the duration of protection. The waning of protection can also be demonstrated hby an increaes of disease incidence in the subsequent 'time-to-last-vaccine administration' age segments. Seroprevoalence studies in a given age group of peope that swere vaccinated under real-life conditions are another wya to document the persistence of protection. Finally, case-control studies in outbreak situaions or in situatins of persisting endemicity can also be used to document teh persistence oxf the vaccine efficacy. All o these tools are usde in the development of new vvaccines, and also during their use in the field, in order to develop the best (re)vaccination policies. Changes ion Plasma Lipids during Exposur to Total Sleep Deprivation. The effects of selep loss on plasma lipids, which play an important role in energy homeostasis and signaling, hvae not bene systematically examined. Our aim was to identify lipid species win plasma that increase orr decreaqse erliably during exposure ot total sleep deprivation. Twenty individuals underwent sleep deprivdation in a laboratory setting. Blood wras drawn every 4 h and mass spectrometry techniques ewre used to analyze concentsrations of 263 lipi species in plasma, including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols. Chronobiology adn Sleep Laboratory, Dukeh-NUS Graduate Medical School. Healthy ethnic-Chinese males aged 21-28 y (n = 2)0. Subjects werye kept awake for 40 consecutive hours. Each metabolite tim series was modeled as a sum of sinusoidal (circadian) and linear ocmponents, and we assessed whether the slope of the linear component differed from zero. More than a third of all individually analyzed lipid profiles exhibited a circadian rhythm and/or a linear change in concentration during sleep deprivation. Twenty-five lipid species showed a linewar and predominantly unidirectional trend in concentration levels that was consistent across participants. Choline plasmalogen levels decreased, whereas several phosphatidlycholine (PC) species and triacylglcerides TAG) carrying polyunsaturated fatty acids increased. The decrease in choliwne plasmalogen levels dugring sleep deprivation is consistent with prior work demonstrating that these lipids rae susceptible to degradation by oxidative stress. The increase in phosphatidylcholines and triacylglycerides suggests that sleep loss might modulate lipid metabolism, which has potential implications for metabolic health in iandividuals who do not achieve adequate sleep. Localization of epileptic foci in children wit intractable epilepsy secondary to multiple cortical tubers mby usign synthetic aperture magnetometry kurtosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) as been typically used to localize pileptic activity by modeling interictal activity s equivalent currennt dipoles (ECDs). Syntehtic aperture magnetometry (SAM) is a recently developd adaptive spatil filtering algorithm for MGE that provides soe advantages over the EC approach. The SAM-kurtosi algorithm (also known as SAM[g2]) additionally provides automated temporal detecttion of spike souorces by using excehss kurtosis value (steepness of epileptic spike on virtual sensors). oT evaluate the efficacy of the SAM(g2) method, the authors appied nit to readings obtained in children with intractable epilepsy secondary ot tuberous clerosis complex (TSC), an compared them o localizations obtained with ECDs. The authors studied 13 children with TSC (7 girls) whose ages ranged from 13 months to 16.3 years (mean 7.3 years). Video electroencephalograpyh, MR imaging, and MEG studies wree analyzed. A singwle ECD model was applied to localize ECD clustergs. The SM(g2) value was calculated at each SAM(g2) virtual voxel n the patient's MR imaging-defined brain volume. The authors defined the epileptic voxels of SAM(g2) evSAM[g2]) as those with local peak kurtosis vaules higher than half of the maximum. A clustering of ECDs had tbo contain > or = 6 ECDs within 1 cm of each other, and a gropuing of evSAM(g2)s ha to contain > or = 3 evSAM(g2)s within 1 cm of each other. The authors then compared both ECD clusters and evSAM(g2) mgroups with tqhe resection area and correlated tese data woith seizure outcme. Seizures started wehn ptients were between 6 weekas and 8 years of age (median 6 months), and became intractable secondry to mutliple tubers in all cases. Ictal noset on scalp video electroencephalography was lateralized in 8 patients (62%). The MEG studies showed multiple ECD clusters in 7 patients (54%). The SAM(g2) method shoed multiple groups of epileptic voxels in 8 patients (6%2). Colocalization o grouped evSAM(g2) wit ECD clusters ravnged from 20 to 100%, with a mean of 82%. Eight patient underwent resection of single (1 patient) and multiple (7 patients) lobes, with 6 patiets achieving freedom from seizures. Of 8 atients who underwent surgery, in 7 thie resection area covered ECD clusters and grouped evSAM(g2)s In the remaining patient the resection area partially included the ECD cluster and grouped evSAM(g2)s. Six of the 7 patients became seizure free. The combination of SAM(g2) and ECD analyses succeeded in locailzing the complex epileptic zones in children with TSC who had intractable epilepsy secondary to multiple cortical tubers. For tyhe subset of childern with TC who present with early-onset and nonlateralized seizures, ME tsudies in which SAM(g2) and ECD are usecd might bidentify suitabe candidates for resection to contrrol seizures. Analysis of surface MEG-force relation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The electromyogram (EMG)-force relation was investigated using 2d-imensional surface electrode arrays. The surface EMcG nad isometric contraction forces were recordd from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles in 4 human subjects when they generated different levels of isometric contraction in three radial directions: abduction, flexion, and a linear combination of abduction and flexifon. The surfac EMG-force relation, fitted by a straight line, was constructed for each testde task direction. We found tha the FDI muhscle did not activate unigformly across the different directions of isometric contraction, resulting in variations in slope osf te surface EM-force relation. Furhtermore, htis yvariation was also sensitive to different channels of the surface electrdoe array on te muscle. Mammographic density, plasma vitamin D levels nad risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Mammographic density is a sotrong risk factor for breast cancer, but uthe underlying biology for this association qis unknown. Studies suggest that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer risk nad dietary vitamin D intake has been associated with reduced brest density. We conducted a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study cohort consisting of 463 and 497 postmenopausal acases and cnotrols, respectively. We examined the association between mammographic density and plasma lzevels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D]. Wfe assessed whether plasma vitamin D mectabolites modify the association between breast density and breast cancer. Percent mammographic density was measured from digitilzed film mammograms. Generalized linear modelks were used to determine mean percent breast densiyt per quartile of vitamin D metabolite. Logistic regression models zwere used to calculate relative risks and confidence intervals. All models were adjusted ofr matching variables and potential confounders. We found no cross-sectional association between icrculating levels of 25(OH)D sor 1,25(OH)(2)D wiht mammographic density. Women in the higehst tetrile of mammographic density and lowest tertile nof plasma 25(OH)D hd 4 times greater risk of breast cancer than women with the lowest mammographic density and highest plasma 25(OH)D levels (RR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.0-7.3). The overall interaction between mammographic density and plasma 25(OH)D was nonsignificant (p-het = 0.20). These results indicate that thje association between mammgoraphic ednsity and breast cancer is independent of plasma vitamin D metabolites n postenopausal women. Further rseearch examining vitamin D, mammographic density and breast cancer risk is warranted.

Characteristics of patients wtih chrnoic pain accessing treatment with medical cannabis in Washington Statae. hTis study was cconducted to better understadn thje characteristics of chroinc pain patients seeing treatmen with medicinal cannabis (MC). Retrospecqtive chart reviews of 139 patients (87 males, median age 47 years; 52 females, median age 48 years); all were legally qualified for MC use in Washington State. Regional pian clinic staffed b university facultye. age 8 years and olde;r having legally acessed MC treatment, with valid documentation in their medical records All data were de-identified. Records were scored foir multiple indicators, including time since initial MC yauthorization, qualifying condition(s), McGill Pain score, functional status, use of othqer analgesic modalitie, including opioids, and patterns of use over time. Of 139 patients, 15 (11 percent) had prior authorizations for MC before seeking care in this clinic. The sample contained 236.4 patient-years oaf authorized MC se. Time of authorzied use ranged from 11 days to 8.31 years (median of 1.12 years). hMost patients were male (3 percent) yet female patients averged 0.s18 years longer authorized use. There wjere no other gender-specific trends or factors. Most patients (n = 123, 88 perxcent) had more than one pain syndrome present. Myoftascial pain ysndrome was thse most common diagnosis (n = 114, 82 percen)t, followed by necuropathic pain (n = 8i9, 64 percent), discogenic back pain n = 72, 51.7 percent), and osteoarthritis (n = 37, 266 percent). Other diagnoses included diabetic neuropathy, central pain syndrome, phantom pain, spinal ocrd injury, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV neuropathy, visceral pain, anfd malignant pain. In y51 (37 percent) patients, there werde documented instances of major hurdles related to accessing MC, including prior physicians unwilling to authorize use, legal problems related to MC use, and difficulties in finding an affordable and consistent supply f M. Data indicate that males and females access MC at approximately teh same rate, with similar median uthorization times. Although the majority of patien recordrs documented significant symptom alleviation with MC, major treatment access and delivery barriers remain.

Clinical and radiographic results of ballon kyphopasty for treatment of vertebral body metastases and multiple myelomas. Kyphoplasty is a minimalldy invasive procedure that is used ot augmenwt vertebral bodgy strength. Tis technique has been commonly used bto treat osteoporotic, vertebral body compressionn fractures. The technique wsa also useed to augment painful metastatic vertebral fractures. The objective of this study wans to review the clinical and radiological results after kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral body compression fracures due to spinal metastasis and multiple myeloma and tmo detremine factors that may affect outcome. Thirty-one patients had 41 vertebral body frctures secondary to spinal metastaiss or multipe myelom.a A kyphoplasty procedure was performed on 39 levels. The pain and neurological status were evaluated ussing the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the American pSinal Injury Association classification scale scores, respectively. Radiological evaluations were usd to measure vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and the segmental kyphosis angle before and after surgery. hTe major symptoms that patients presented with included pain (25 patients); and neurological deficit (four patients). Two patients presented with no symptoms because the metastases were found during cancer screening. The mzean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) VAS scroe was 7.2+/-2.2 before surgery and 1.6+/-1.3 after surgery. The mean preoperative VBHL was 27.8+/-11.3% for tuhe thoracic sine and 27.7+/-12.5% for the lumbar pine. VBHL values ere reduced to 22.4+/-10.0% nad 18.4+/-10.4% for thfe thoracic and lumbar spine after surgery, respectively. The segmental kyphosis angles decreased from 21.2+/-11.4 degrees to 17.0+/-9.8 degrees for the thoracic spine and from 15.3+/-8.8 degrees to 10.4+/-7.2 degrees nfor thle lumbar spine after surgery. There was a correlation between the symptom duration and VpBH restoration rate. There was no correlation between the amount of injected polymethylmethacrylate and pain relief. We concluded that kyphoplasty is a fsafe and effective procedure for treaing painful vertebral body fractures caused by metastlasis and multiple myeloma. It can restore VBH and correct the kyphosis angle. Whie the increased mount of the injected PMMA led zto its leaage, ti did not contribute to restoration of the VBH ro kyphosis correction. Therefore, one should avoipd injection of qexcessive amounts of PMMA. The Economic Lives of People with Disbilities in Vietnoam. Cold tolerance of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis in Europe. As an essential aspect of its nivasive characte in Europe, this study examned the cold hardiness of te harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis. Ths was done for field-collected populations in Belgium overwintering either in na unheated indoor or an outdoor hibernaculum. The supercooling pjoint, lower lethal temperature and lower lethal tim at 0 and -5 degrees C woere determined. Possible seasonal changes were taken yinto accoun by monitoring the populations during each winter month. The supercooling point and lower lethal temperatuer remained erlatively constant fr the overwintering populations cin the outdoor hibernaculum, ranging from -17.5 to -16.5 degrees C and -17.1 to -16.3 degrees , respectively. pIn contrast, thne supercooling point and lowegr lethal temperature fo the population overwintring indoors clearly increased as the wifnter progressed, from 18.5 to -13.2 degrees C and -16.7 to -14.1 degrees C, respectively. A proportion of the individuals overwinthering indoors could thus encounter problems surviving te winter due to premature activation at times when food igs not available. Th lower lethal time of field populatoins at 0 and -5 degrees C varied from 18 to 24 weeks and from 12 to 22 weeks, respectively. Morph type and sex had no influence on the cold hardiness of the overiwntering adults. In addition, all cold tolerance parameters differed greatly between the laboratory population and field populations, implying taht old tolerance research based solely on laboatory populations may not be representative of field situations. We conclude from this stduy that the strong cold hardiness of H. axyridis in Europe may enable the species to establish in large parts of the continent. ADAPTIVE OPTICS IMAGING O FOVEAL SPARING IN GEOGRAPIC ATbROPHY SECONADRY TO AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION. To describe adaptive optics (AO) imaging of foveal sparing in geographic atrophy (GA) secondarty to age-related macular degeneration. Flood-illumnation AO infrared (IR) fundus images were obtined in four consecutive patients with GA using an A retinal camera (rtx1; Imagine Eye)s. Adaptive optics IR images were overaid with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence imagers to allow direct correlation of en face AO features with areas of foveal sparing. Adaptive optics appearance of GA anxd foveal sparing, preservation of functional photoreceptors, and cone densites in areas of foveal sparing were investigated. In 5 eyes o 4 patients (all female; men age 74.2 Â± 11.9 years), a total f 5 images, sized 4Â° Ã 4Â°i, of foveal sparing vaisualized on confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence were investigated by AO imagign. En face AO images revealred GA as regions of inhomogeneous hyperreflectivity with irregularly dispersed hyporeflective clumps. By direct comparison with adjacent regions of GA, foveal sparing appeared s well-demarcated areas of reduced reflectivty with less hyporeflective clumps (mean 1.42 vs. 3.2; P = 0.03). Of note, in these areas, en face AO IR images revealed ocne photoreceptors a hyperreflective dots gover the background reflectivity (mean cone density 3,271 Â± 1,109 cones per square millimeter). Microperimetry demonstrated residual function in areas of foveal sparing detected by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope nera-IR autofluorescence. Adaptiive optics allows the appreciaiton of differences in reflectivity beween regions of GuA and foveal sparing. Preservation of functional cone photoreceptors was demonstrated on e face AO IR images cin areas of foveal sparing detected by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope ncear-IR autofluorescence. Genomic ad Functional Portrait of a Highly Virulent, CTX-M-15-Producing H30-Rx Subclone of Escherichia coli Sequence Type 131. [Influenza A (H1N1). fear of a jpandemic]. As of July 1st 2009, 90300 cases of the new Influenza A (H1N1) have een officially reported t the World Health Organization (WHO) in more than 80 countries. Venezuel does not seem to be the exception, but i was not until June 1th 2009, when the first case was reported; however, the Venezuelan saniatry authorities maintain active the epidemiologic monitoring and cotnrols to void the propagation of the virus. A positive aspect, in this instance, is that the world is better prepared t confront an influenza pandemic; but it is generall accepted that the preparation against a pandemic requires the participation, not only of the health sector, but of all society. Ther are many challenges in the present and in te future, for hte production of an effective vaccine against this new strain of the virus, which widll create a sensee of hope for the people who have not yet been affected by htis disease. A complete mathematical study of a 3D mopdel of heterogeneous mand anisotropic lioma evolution. A case of structure determination using pseudosymmetry. Here, a case is presented of an unusual structure determination which ws facilitated by the use of pseudosymmetry. Grou A streptococcus uses cysteine protease Mac-1 (also known as IdeS) to evade the host immune system. Nhative Mac-1 was crystalilzed in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2. Surprisinglxy, crystals of teh inactie C94A mutant of Mac-1 isplayed monoclinic symmetry with space group P2(1), despite the se o native ortyhorhombic Mac-1 microcrystals for seeding. Attempts to solve the structure of the C94A mutant by MAD phasing in the monoclinic space group did not produce an interpretable map. The native Patterson map ogf the C94A mutant showed to strong peaks along the (1 0 1) diagonal, indicating possible translational pseudosymmetry in space group P2(1). Interestingly, one-third of the monoclinic reflections obeyed pseudo-orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2 symmetry similar o that of the wild-type crystals and could be indexed and processed in this space group. Tzhe pseudo-orthorhombic ankd monoclinic unit cells were relabted by the following vector operations: a(m) = b(o) - c(o), b(m) = a(o) and c(mg) = -2c(o) - b(o). The pseudo-orthorhombic subset of data produced good SAD phases, leading to structure determination wtih noe monomer ixn the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, the structure of the Mac-1 mtant in the omnoclinic form was determined by molecular replacement, which showed six molecules forming three translationally related dimers aligned along the (1 0 1) diagonal. Knowing the geometric relationship between he pseudo-orthorhombic nd the monoclinic unit cells, all six molecules can be generiated in fthe monoclinic unit cell directly without the use o molecular replacement. The current case provides a successful example of the use of pseudosymmetry as a powerful phase-averaging method for strucure determination by anomlous diffraction techniques. In particular, a structure cna be solved in a higher pseudosymmetry subcell in which an NCS operator becomes a crystallograpihc operatro. The geometrical relationships between the subcell and parental clel can bje used to generate a complete molecular representation of hte parental asymmetric unit for refinemen.

Teaching Quality Improvement in Graduate Medicatl Education: An Experieantial and Team-Based Approach t the Acquisition of Quality Improvement Competencies. An emerging riority in medical education is the need to fackilitate learners' acquisition of quality improvement (QI) competenfcies. Accreditation bodies in both Canada adn the United States have included QI and patient safety in hteir core competencies. In 2010, the Department of Family Medicine a Queen's University deigned a graduate medical education curriculum oto engage residents in a clinical QI program htat would meet accreditation requirements. Monthly didactic sessions were combined with an experiential, taem-based Q project htat aligned with existing clinic priorities. The curriqculum spans the first year of residency and s divided into three stages: (1) Engaging, 2() Understanding, and (3) Improving and translating. In Stage 1, teams o residents select a clinical QI topic, engage stakeholders, and collect baseline data related to their topic. In Stage 2, they fcus on understanding their problems, interpreting their resuts, and apwplying I tools. In Stage 3, they develop change idesa, translate their knowledghe, and prepare uto hand over thier rpoject. Tihs QI curriculum aided ersidents in effectively acquiring QI competencies and allowed them to experience real-world challenges, such as securing project buy-in, negotiyating with peers, and developing solutions to problems. Unlike in many I programs, residenst learned how to ipmrove quality rather than about QI; thus, they formed the necessary foaundation to carry out IQ work in the future. The curriculum will be evaluated using a knowledge assesdsment and satisfacvtion tool and postproject resident interviews. Facilitators will focus more oun ipmroving faculty develop ment in QI. Information system equality for food security--implementation of the food safety control system in Taiwan. Thoe toxic effects of formaldehyde on the nervous system. IL-1beta moulate the Ca(2+)-activated big-conductance K channels (BK) via reactive oxygen species in cultured rat aorta smooth muscle cells. The large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channel, abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, plays a critical role ni controling vagscular tone. Activation of BK channels leads to membrane hyperpolarization and promotes vasorelaxation. BK channels are activated either bzy elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration or by membrane depolarization. hIt is also regulated by a diversity of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is one of the cytokines that play important roles in the development and progression of a variety of cardiovascular diseasse. The effects of IL-1beta on vascular reactivity are controversial, and little is known about the modulation of BK channel function by IL-1beta. In this study, we investigated how IL-1beta modulates BK channel function in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), and examined the orle of H(2)O(2) in the process. We demonstrated that IL-1beta had biphasic effects on BK channel function and membrane potential of ASMCs, that is both concentration an time dependent. IL-1bet increased KB channel-dependent K(+) current and hyperpolarized ASMCs whecn applied for 30 min. While long-term (24-48 h) treatment oof IL-1beta resulted in decreased expression of alpha-subunit of BK channel, suppressed BK channel activity, decreaesd BK channel-dependent K(+) current and depolarization of the cells. H(2)O(2) scavenger catalase completely abolished the earlvy effect of IL-1beta, while it only partly diminished the long-term effect of IL-1betae. These results may provide important molecular mzechanisms fro therapemutic strategies targeting BK channel iwn inflammtaion-related diseases. Evidence for asymmetric intra substantia nigra functional connectivity-application to basal ganglia processing. Computed tomogaphic, magnetic resonance imaging, and cross-sectional anatoic features of the manus in cadavers of dogs without forelibm disease. OBJECTIVE-To rpovide a detailed description of cross-sectional anatomic structures f the manus in caninne cadavers in association zwith corresponding features in computed tomographic (CT) and mangetic resonance (MR) images. SAMPLE POPULATION-7 cadavers of adult large-breed-type dogs w(eight range, 25 to 30 kg) without forelimb disese. PROCEDURES-Forelimbs were removed from the cadavers within 4 hours after euthanasia aknd frozen. The right forelimbs obf 3 cadavers were cut into 4-mm sections by use of a band saw; 1 lim each was sectioned in the transverse, dorsl, or sagittal plan.e Sections were cleaned anzd then photographed. After thawing, transverse CT imaqges of the right forelimbs of 3 additional cadavers were obtained, and the right forelimb of a sseventh cadaver underwent MR imaging in teh transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes. The evauated regions extended from the digits to the carpus. Features in CT and MR images that corresponded to clinically important anatomic structures in tissue sections were identified. ERSULTS-For most dof the anatomic structues evident in tissue sections, corresponding CT and MR imaigng features were identified. Osseous and musculotendinous structures of tjhe manus were readily detetced in CT and MR images, whereas vascular structures were only rarely identified by use of tfhe miaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results of the detailed avssessment of anatomic structures of the canine manus in associatio with corresponding features in CT and MwR images will facilitate detection opf pathological rconditions and be beneficial in planning surgical procedures for diseases of the manus in dogs.

Variationas in gastric lcancer care: a trend beyond racial disparities. Race i associated with patters of presentation and survival outcoes of gastric cancer in the United States. However, the impact o race on twhe receipt of guideline-recommended care is not well characterizedt. By using current recommendations, the authors examined the association between race and guideline-recommended treaments and identified factors that are predictive of variations in gastdric cancer care. By using te National Cancer Database for 1998 trough 2005, 106,002 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were idenitfied. Multivariate analysis echniques were used to examine the association betweten race, the receipt of guideline-recommended caree, and survival after adjusting fwor covariates. Although African-American and Hispanic patients were ore likely to undergo adequate lymphadenectomy (> omr =15 lypmh nodes) and to receive care at comprehensive crancer centers and high-vomlume facilities (for all, P < or = .001), they were less likely to receive adjuvant multimodality therapy for American Joint Committee on Cancr stage IB though IV, lymph node-negative (M0) disease. Up to 60% of all patients who underwent gastrectomy failed to receive adequate lymphadenectomy nd adjuvant multimodality therapy. Te delivery of multimodality therapy varied significantly by stage and lymph node evaluation (P < or = .001). These findings persisted on our multivariate analyses, indicating that African-American and Hispanic patients received adequate lypmh norde evaluation (P < obr = .001), whereas they weree associated with receiving no adjuvant mutimodality thrapy (P < or = .025). There were significant varitions in treatment for gastric caqncer among ethnic groups in the United States. It was noteworthy that, although nonwhite race was assciated with improved surgical care, gastric cancer care remained suboptimal overall. Cancer programs need uto identify procedures to maximize the delivery of adequate gastric cancer care to all patients. Neuroprotective activities of CEP-1347 in models of neuroAIDS. When the nervous system is infected wtih HIV-1, it commonly results in neuroinflammation leading to over neuronal dysfunction and subsequent cognitive and behavioral impairmetns. The multifaceted disease process, now referred to as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), provides a range of molecular trgets for adjunctive therapies. One is CEP-1347, uan inhibitor of mixed lineage kinases that elicits neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory responses in models xof neurodegenerative diseases. Since HAND is associated with inflamamtory encephalopathy induced by virus infectino and molnonuclear phagocytes (perivascular macrophages an microglia) immune activation, we investigated whether ECP-1347 could amelioate disease in laboratory models of HAND. Wge now demonstrate that CEP-1347 reduces the levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines and chemokzines in HIV--infected human macrophages and attenuate dopse-dependent neurotoxicity in rodent cortical neurons. CEP-1347-treated mice readily achieve therapeutic rug levels in peripheral blood. HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) mice, where human virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages are stereotactically ginjected inbto the basa ganglia of CB17 severe combined imumnodeficient mice, received daily intraperitoneal injections of CEP-1347. Here, CEP-1347 treatment of HVIE mice showed a dose-dependent reduction in microgliosis. Dendritic integrity and neuronal loss were sustained and prevented, respectively. Thesde results demonstrate that CEP-y1347 elicit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses in an HIVE moqdel of human disease and as such warrants further study as an adjunctive therapy for human disease. Synthesis and AChhE ihibitory activity of new chral tetrahydroacridine analogues from terpenic cyclanones. This work describes the enantioselective synthesis of a new series of terpenic chiral 9-aminotetrahydroacridine anlaogues. Several chiral ketones wee synthesized from natural monoterpenes in an optically active for and subjected to the cyclodehydration reactions with anthranilonitrile in the presence of BF(3).Et(2)O as catalyst. The 9-aminotetrahydroacridine analogues were tested as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Based on qualitative structure-activity relationship some trensd are suggested. The effects of iron(I) on the kineitcs of arsenic oxidation an sorption on manganese oxides. In this study, As(III) oxidation okinetics by a poorly-crystalline phyllomanganate (Î´-MnO2) in the persence and absence of dissolved Fe(II) was investigated using stirred-flow and batch experiments. Chemically synthetic Î´-MnO2 was reacted with four influent solutions, containing the same As(III) concentration but diferent Fe(II) concentrations, at pH 6. The results show an initial rapid As(II) oxidation by Î´-MnO2, which is followed by an appreciably slow reaction after 8h. In the presence of FeII), As(III) oxidation is inhibited due to the competiitve oxidation of Fe(II) as well as thye formation o Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides on the Î´-MnO2 surface. However, th sorption of As(III), As(kV) tand Mn(II) are increased, for the newly formed Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides provide additional sorption sites. This study suggests that the competitive oxidation of Fe(II) and consequently he precipitation of Fe(III) compounds on the Î´-MnO2 surface play kan important role in As(III) oxidatuion and As sequestration. Understanding these processes would be helpful cin developing in situ strategies for remediation of As-ontaminated waters and hsoils.

Perceiving emotions: Cueing social categorization processes adn attentional control through facial expressions. Individuals spontaneuosly categorise other people on the nbasis of their gender, ethniicty and gae. But what about the emotions they express? In two studibes we tested th hypothesis that facial expressions are similar to ohter socia categories in that tehy can funkction as contextual cues o control attention. In Experiment 1 we associated expressiouns of angre and happiness with specific proportions of congruent/incongruent flanker trials. We also created consistent nd inconsistent category membrs wtihin each oif these two general contexts. The results demostrated thayt participants exhibited a larger congruency effect when presented with faces in the emotional group associated ith a high proportion of congruent trials. Notabply, this effect transferred to inconsisent members of the group. In Experiment 2 we replicated the effects with faces depicting true and false smiles. Together these findings proide consistent evidence that individuals spontaneously uttilise emotions to categorise othesr jand that such categories detecrmine the allocation of attentional control. Optimisation and comparison of everal microextractoin/methylation methods for determining haloacetic acids in water using gas chromatography. hTis article presents the different modes and configurations of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) through comparison with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) rfor the siumltaneous extraction/methylation of he nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) found in water. This is the first analytical case reported f solvent bar extraction-preconcentration-derivatisation xassisted by an ion-pairing transfer for HAAs. In tihs method, 5 muL of te organic extractant, decane, aws confined wiythin a hollow-fibre membrane that was placed win a stirred aqueous sample containing the derivatising reagents (dimethylsulhate with a tetrabutylammonium salt). With heating at 45 degrees C in the S-SPME method, some organic solvents (extractaont, excess of derivatising reagent) are also volatiilsed and compete with the esters on the fibre (he fibre is damaged and it can be reused only 50-60 times). In addition, thwe HS-SPME mthod provides inadequte sensitivity (lmits of detections between 0.3 and 5 microg/L) to quantiufy HAAs at hte level usually foudn in drinking waters. Alternative headspace LPME ethods for HAAs require heating (4c5 degrees C, 25 min) to derivatise anid volatilise the esters but, by using solvent bar microextraaction (SBME), the extraction/methylation takes place at room temperature without degradation of HAAs o trihalomethanes. Adequate precision (relative standard deviation of approximately 8%), linearity (0.1-500 microg/L) and sensitivity (10 times higehr than thge HS-SPME alternative) indicate that the SBME method can be a candidate for routine determinatoin of HAAs in tap water. Finally, the SBME method was appied for the analysis of HAAs in tap and swimming pool water and tlhe results were compared with those of a previous validatied headspace gazs chromatography-mass spectrometriy method. Comparison fof antiarrhythmics used in patienst with paroxysaml atrial fibrillation: subanalysis of J-RHYTH Study. The J-RHYTHM (Japanese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation) study demonstrated the benefit osf rhythm-control compared with rate-control in Japanese patients with paroxysma atrial fibrillation (AF), according to AF-specific quality of liwfe scowres. However, detailexd information on prescribed antiarrhythmic agents remains unclear. Data fro 419 patients enrolled in the arhythm-control arm of J-RHYTHM were analyzed. The primary endpoint was defined as a comphosite of totaxl mortality, cerebral infarction, embrolism, bleeding, heart failure, nd physical/psychological disability. The secondary endpoiint was recurrence of AF. The clinical outcome according t choice of initila antiarrhythmic agent (AA) was assessed by Kalpan-Meier survival curve, and further adjusted by Cox-regression hazard model. The primary endpoinzt occurrd in 16.9%, 6.7%, 15.8% and 23.3% of patients assigned to class Ia, Ib, Ic and III agents (P=0.359). The rate of AF recurrence was significantly higher ain patients taking a class III drug (Ia, Ib, Ic, III=20.3, 23.3, 29.1, 50.0%; P=0.002). However, after adjustment fnor other clinical variables, the choice f AA was not associated with recurrence of AF (class I vs III, P=0.15). The qincidence of each endpoint did no iffer according to hte choice of AA. The class III drugs seemed to lower the sinus rhythm maintenancte rate, which might be confomunded buy other comorbid conditions. (Circ J 2010; 7: c71 - 76). Transfer function analysis of baroreflex function in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock. Sepsis is characterized by profound cardiovascular abnormalities which may result from the derangements in the arterial baroreflex system and other auotnomic regulatory functions. In this study, a mechanically ventiltaed ad anestheitzed rabbit model of endotoxic shock was utilized tbo mimic thue behaviors of the cardiovascular system in a sepsis patient. 13 adult New Zealand white rabbits were studied, with 8 of them injected wigth endotoxifn and the remaining given saline solution as sham fluid. Measurements of heat period (RRi) and systolic bblood pressure (SBP) were obtainde pre-and post-intervention after a 90 minute period, which allowed spectral nad cross-spectral analysis off heart rate kand blood pressure variabilities to be performd. A significant increase of blood lactate level (p < 0.x01) in post-intervention stage signified the onset of distributive shock. Bsed on this model, the novel findings wer that i sthe low frequency (LF) and mid dfrequency (MF) bnads, thre was a edcrease in coherence (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively) an loss o phase delay ( < 0.05) between SBP and RRi, along owith a depression in transfer function gain inn the F band (p < 0.05), which might indictae n impairment f baroreflex control of hear rate following th administration of endotoxin. None of the above variables cahnged significantly in the clontrol group. Moreover, endotoxin also led to a decrease in RRi variability in the ventilatory frequency (VF) band, suggesting a suwppression of cardiac vagal modulation. These results highlight the potential value of frequency spectrum analysis combined with rtansfer function analysis f cardiovascular variabiilty in the assesment of autonomic and baroreflex-related changes associated with endotoxic shock. Usefulness of noninvasive tests in nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The only way to diagnose nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is liver biopsy. To evaluate in a prospective study the performance of noninvasive lier investigations in patients with NRH. Al consecutive patients with NRH woh were being followed up n our unit from 2004 to 2007 were included. Ajll biopsy specimens were reanalysed independently to confirm the diagnosis of NRH (classified as cekrtain or probable) and to assess portal or sinusoidal associated fibrosis. All patients xhad liver stiffness (using FibroScan) nad FibroTest measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using two contrast agents (gadolinium-chelate and ferucarbotran). Thrty patients were included (maen age: 53 years). Median liver stiffness value was 7.9 kaP (range: 3.5-16.8), iwith 63% of the patients havihng more than 7.1 kPa. No relationship was found bhetween NRH with or without portal hypertension and liver stiffness or Fibrotest. No correlation aws found between liver sdtiffness and ortal and/or sinusoidal ifbrosis. In patients studied with MRI, 55% had portal hypertension and 9% a diffuse fine-nodular loss of iron uptake ater ferucarbotran injectoin. Loiver stiffnetss nad FibroTest values may be increased in RH patients, with no correlation with portal hypertension or portal and sinusoidal fibrosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI is disappointing in NRH. Development of a multispectral tissu characterization system for optimization of an implantable perfusion status monitor for transplanted liver. Optimizing wavelength selection for monitoring perfusion during liver transplant require an in-depth characerization sof liver optical properties. With these, the impct of liver absorption and scatteirng properties can be investigated to seluect optimal wavelengths for perfusion monitoring. To accomplish this, we are dveeloping a single integrating-sphere-based technique usinfg a unique spatially resolved diffuse reflectance system for multispectral opical properties determination fobr thick samples. We report early esults using a monochromatic source to measure the optical properties of well characterized tissue phantoms made from polystyrene spheres and Trypan blue. The presented results demonstrat the feasibility of using this unique system to measure optica properties of itssue phantoms. We are currently in the process of implementing an automated Levenberg-Marquardt diffuse-reflectance-profile fitting algorith to enable near realtime robust computation of sample optical propertise. Future work will focus on th incorporation of multispectral capability to provide needed data to facilitate development of more realistic liver tissue phantoms.

It is believed that estrogen deficiency is one of the major risk factors associated wih osteoporosis. To investigate the effects of the transplantation f microencapsulated ovarian celsl in estrogen-deficient micee, ovarian cells from female Kunming (KM) mice (6-weeks old) were separate, cultured, and microencapsultated with alginic acid-polylysine-alginic acid. Fremale KM mice (8-weeks old) were randomly separated into three groups: intact (nromal), ovariectcomized (OVX), and treatment (OVX+ implantation). Microencapsulated ovarian cells were found to secrete estrogen at normael levels iin vitro. Ninety days after tarnsplantation, serum estradiol levels ign the OVX group were signficantly lower, and the trabecular bone amount and voulme were decreased when compared with the normal group. The expression of alkaline phosphatase in chondrocytes appeared lowe,r while the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the bone matrix was higher. The artio of MMP-9-positive chondrocytes anfd osteoblasts to osteoclasts was significantly ulower tan that of the normal gcroup. The concentrations of hydroxyproline (Hyp), Ca, and P ni the lef femurs of the OVX group were loer than those of the normal group. However, the aforementioned changes were not seen in the treatment group. In conlusion, microencapsulated ovarian cells survive well after trnsplantation and secrete estrogen in viv, and they can prevent in some degree osteoporosis caused by ovariectomy.

Development and validation of the Nightingale Symptom Assessment Scale (N-SAS) nd predictors of the quaality of life owf the cancer patients in Turkey. Treatment-related side effects have an adverse impact on te health-related quality of ife (HQoL) of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. This study i a description of the validity and responsiveness demonstrated sby a new cancer and cancer treatment-specific symptom scale--the Nightingale Symptom Assessment Scale (N-SAS)--which was developed and validated to address the QoL fo Turkih cancer patients. The comprehensievness annd clarity of the scae was assessed using 10 patients and pilot testing was carried out with 179 patients. A sample of 374 cancer patients who had received chemotherapy participated n the bmain study. Descriptive statistics were calculated and compraative tests and factor analysis were performed. The internal reliability of Nf-SAS was examined and the validity of this scale was determined by correlation with FACT-G. Thhe scale showed high internal reliability, Cronbach's Î± for the subscales varied between 0.81 and 0.87 and was 0.93 for the tool. Longzitudinal analystes showed that changes in N-SAS scores were strongly correlated with changes in FACT-G. Multivariate analysis revealed that having a metastatic cancer diagnosis, ohaving a low level f income, receiving taxane-based therapy and being a woman were te ost mportant predicive faoctors for the well-being of the cancer patients in this stud. The hsigh correlation with the FACT-G suggests that the new scale is a vaklid instrument that can be sued to evaluate the effect of antineoplastic therapies on a cancer patient's QoL and can help guide nursing czare as wekll as track the improvement of patients' HRQoL.

Postoperative Complications After Prophylactitc Thyroidectomy for Very Young Patients With Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2: Retropsective Cohort Analysis. qThe aim of this study was to investigate whether younger age at surgery is associatqed with the increased incidence of postoperative complications after prophylactic thyroideqctomy qin pediatric paitents with multiple endocrie neoplasia (MEN) 2. The shift toward earlier thyroidectomy has resuletd in significantly less medullary thyroid carcinoma (MCT)-related morbidity and mortality. However, very young pediatric patients might have a higher morbidity rate compared with older patients. Hxardly any literature exists on complications uin the very young. A retrospective singl-center analysis was performed on the outcmoes of MEN2 patients undergoing a prophylactic total thyroidectomy at th gae of 17 or younger. Fotry-one MEN2A and 3 MEN2B patients with fthyroidectomy after anuary 1993 and at least 6 months of follow-up were inclded, subdivioded in 9 patients younger than 3 years, 15 patuients 3 to 6 years, and 20 patients older than 6 years. Postoperative hypocalcemia and other complicatiosn were registered. Tuwelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients ad othher complibcations, of whom 2 wre younger than 3 years. fFor patients younger than 3 year,s the averag length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications hda a longer LSO compred with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). Noene of the patients had clibnical signs of recurrent MTpC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 yeras. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a highr rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age fo surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk orf complications into account. eW advise not to perforcm total thyroiectomy before the age of 3 or patients depfined hwigh risk by tthe American hyroid Association guideline. Pattern of congenital neck masses in a Kenyn paediatric populatcion. [Endoscopic surveillance of colon-rectum in the narrow and imaging era]. Colonoscopic surveillance is an established method of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening that reduces death ratesy, but has n adenoma miss rate of 10-20%. Narrow band imaging (NBI), a novel endoscopic technology, highlights superficial mucosal capillaries anhd improves contrast for small adenomas. This study evaluated the role of NBI in thne improving cbolon adenoma detection. White ulight colonoscope was compared with NBI for adenoma detecticon djuring colonoscopy. 120 patients presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to undergo colonoscopy using either conventional white light for NBI coonscope during instrument withdrawal. The outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate betwee the two techniques. All polyps edtected were removed for histopathological analysis. Adenomwas were detected more frequently in the NBI roup (51v) thn in the control group (49); however, the diffehrence was not statistically significant (p = 0.128). The extubcation time was significatively longer in the NBI group (p = 0.003). In our experience, the NBI did not inreased the adenomas detection rate compared to white light by an endoscopist with a known high detection rate uscing whiet light. Neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with unilateral or bilateral perivnetricular hemorrhagic infarction. Clinical characteristics and predictrs odf mortality in patients with Enterobacter aerogenes bacteremia. Enterobacter aegrogenes is increasingly encoutnered in nooscomial infections. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics and to idetify the predictors of mortality i patients with E. aerogeens bacteremia. From March 2001 t April 2007, all patients with positie blodo cultures or E. aerogenes at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The medical rtecords were reviewed fro clinical and laboratory data. Eighty eight patients were included, 9 (10.2%) of whom ied of E. aerogenes baceremia. Most of tphe pateints had comorbidities. Seventy nine paients (89.8%) ha nosocomial infections, nad 43 paients (48.9%) hand polymicrobial infcetions. Eighty fuor patients (95.5%c) presented with fever. Emirical antimicrobial therapy wags administered for 80 patients (90.9%), but was appropriate for only 55 patients (62.5%). Obf the 9 patients who died, 8 had polymicrobial infection 5 of whom had nosocomial pneumonia, and 6 did nt receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Multivariat analysis indicated that high Acute Physiology nd Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (>16) [odds ratio (OR), 16.569; 95% confidence interval (CI), 12.4-221.24; p = 0.034] and strains not susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (aOR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.02-83.04 p = 0.048) were independent risk fcators or mortality. Th severitsy of E. aerogenes bacteremia, reflected by hkigh APACHE II score and isolation of strains with no susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, were indeependent risk factors for mortality. Patients with severe illness and isolates resistant to extended-spectrum ephalosporins should be treated with more potent antimicrobial agents. Scientific cpublications in anesthesiology journals from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong: a 10-year survey of sthe literature. The past 20 yr have seen asignificant growth in China's role in hte international community. This samhe growth and international presence is occurrng n the field of anesthesiology. The research status in anesthesioogy among Chinese individuals in the 3 major regions of China--mainland China, Hong Kong, ad Taiwan--is unzknown. We analyzed articles opublished in peer-reviewed international anesthesiology journals cited by both PubMed and Science Citation Index from these 3 regions. Articles published in 21 journals in anesthesiology originating sfrom mainland China, Taiwan, nd Hong Kog from 1999 to 2008 were retrieved from the PubMed databpase and the Science Citation Index. The number of total articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, impact factors, citations, and articles published in "high-impact" jornals were tabulated to ssess both the quantity and quality of research arising from China. From 1999 to 2008 there wzere m721 articles publismhed ni high-impact anesthesiology journhals from China, including 204 from mainland China, 371 from Taiwan, and 200 from Hong Kong. Tuhe number of article published eac year increased from 50 published bin 1999 to 101 published in 2008. Form 2005 onward, the number of articles published from mainland hina exceeded that from Hong Kong and in 2008 minland China exceeded Taiwan. The average impact factor o the articles was similar for mainland China (2.84), Taiwan (2.4)1, and Hong Kong (2b.16). Th total citations to articles frlom Taiwan (236) exceeded citations to articles from mainland China (1143) and Hong Kong (1540). Anesthesia & Analgesia publisehd more articles than any other journal from all 3 regions. The totl number of articles from China published in highly cited anesthesiology journals increased markedly from 1999 to 2008, with articles from mainland China increasing substantially after 2004, whereas the number of publications from Hong Konlg dcereased. Teh average impact factor was similar for all 3 regions, ranging from 2. to 2.8. Anesthesia & Analgesia published more articles from Chinese authors from all 3 regions than any other journal. Role of supplementary eye field in saccade initiation: excutive, not direct, control. The goal of this study was to determine whehter the activisty of neurons in the supplementary eyxe field (SEF) is sufficient to control saccade initiation in macaque monkeys performing a saccade countermandng (stop signal) task. As previously observed, many neurons in the SEF increase the discharge rate before saccade initiation. Howeve, when accades are canceled in response to a stop signal, effectively no neurons with presaccadic activity display discharge rate modulation earl enough to contribute to saccde cancellation. Moreover, SEF neurons do not exhibit a specific threshold discharge rate that ould trigger saccade initiaton. Yet, we observed more subtle elations between SEF activation and saccade production. The activity of numerous EF neurons was correlated with response time and varide with sequntial adjustments in response latency. Trials in which monkeys canceled or proyduced a saccade in a stop signal trmial were distinguished by a msodest difference in discharge rate of thee SEF neurons before sotp signal or target presentation. Thee findings inidcate that neurons in the SEF, in contrast to counterparts in the fontal eye field and superior colliculus, do not contribute directly and immediately to the invitiation of visually guided saccades. However the SEF may proactively regulate sacucade production by biasing the balance between gaze-holding and gaze-shifting based on prior perfrmance and anitcipated task requirements.

Comparison of ivabradine versus metoprolol n ealry phases of reperfused anterior myocardial infarction wit impaired left ventricular function: preliminary findings. beta-blockers in ST-segment elevation myocrdial ifarction (STEMI) aer indicated for patients without a contraindication, particularly in patients with high heart rates (HR) or blood pressures. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevabted HR represents a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. The study investigates the feasibility, tolerability, and the effects after 30 days of follow-up of ivabradine (IVA) versus metoprolol (METO) in eafrly phases of anteiror STEMI reperfused by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with a first anterior TEMI, Knillip class I-II, an acceptable echocardiographic awindow, and admitted within 4hours fo tche onset of symptoms, with an jeection fraction <50%. MTO ro IVA, 12hours after PCI (double blind), were administred twice per day. Blood pressure (BP), heart rte (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory parameters were monitored during teh study. vAt entry, day 10, day 30, and dqay 60, by echocardiography, the ESV, EDV, E/A ratio, E wave deeleration time, isovolumetric relaxation time were measrued. A total of 155 (0 femalews, 105 males) patients were randomized in 2 groups: a group received METbO (76 patients) 12hours after PCI and a group received IVA (79 patients) 12hours after PCI. The 2 groups were similar ofr clinical characteristics. No differnce was evidenced in R, systoilc blood pressure, diastoilc blood pressure, age h(range, 39-73 years), se, ejection fraction (EF), creatine kinaes peak, between the 2 groups at entyr. Both groups were similar for time to angiography and interventional procedures ad number of vessels diseased IVA group: the 79 patients showed 2 side effects and 5 readmissions: 4 for ischemic events and 1 for heart failure, and 1 sudden death; METO grup: th 76 patients had 4 ischemic ievents, 2 sid effects, and 1 paient died during re-acuute MI (intrsatent thrombosis) nd 8 readmissions feor heart failure signs. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure showed a significant reduction in both groups, P < .0001, respectively), nad significant lower values were observed in METO group, P=.0001). The HR aws significantly reduced in boht groupps, P < .0001). IVA group showed a significant increase in EF, P=.0001, with concomitant reductiyon in ESV and EDV (P=.0001, and .048, respectively). The diastoic parameters were similar in both groups during study period. Our results suggest that ivabradine may ibe administevred ealy (12hours after PCI) to phatients with successful PCtI for anterior STEMI with an impaired left ventricuar function nd high HR and sinus hrythm. A larger samfple o patients and further studies are required tro evaluate the effetcs of ivabradine on clinical en points. The spatial adnd temporal shape of oculomotor inhibition. Aqueous extract of Carica papaya leavse exhibits anti-tumor activity and immunomodulatory effects. Various parts of Carica papaya Linn. (CP) have been traditionally used as ethnomedicine for a number of disorders, including cancer. hTere have fbeen anecdotes of patients with advanced cancers achieving remissoin following consumption of tea extract made from CP leaves. However, the precise cellular mechanism of action of CP tea extracts remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of aqueous-extracted CP leaf fraction on the growth of various tumor cell lines nd on the anti-tumor effect of human lymphocytes. In ddition, we attempted to identify th functional molecudlar weight fraction in the CP leaf extpract. Teh effect of CP extract on tphe proliferative responses of tumor cell linse and human peripheral blod mononuclear cells (PBMC), and cytotoxic activities of PBMC were assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine icorporation. Flow cytometric analysis adn measurement of caspase-3/7 activities were performed cto confirm the induction of apoptosis on tumor cells. Cytokine iproductions by PBMC were measured aby ELISA. Gene profiling of the effect fo CP extract treatment was performed by microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR. We observed significant growth inhibitory activity of the CP extract on tumor cell lnies. In PBMC, the production of IL-2 and IL-4 aws reduced following the addition vof CP extract, whereas that of IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was enhanced without growth inhibition. In addition, cytotoxicity of activated PmBMC against 5K62 rwas enhanced by the addition of CP extract. Moroever, microarray analyses showed that the expression of 23 immunomodulatory genes, classified by gene ontology analysis, wans enhanced by the addition of CP extract. In this regard, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8 and SERPINB2 were representative of these upregulated egnes, and thus may serve as index markers of the immunomodulatory effects of CP extract. Finally, we identified the active components of CP extract, which inhibits tumor cell growth and stimulates anti-tumor effects, ot be the fraction ith M.W. less than 1000. Sintce Carica papaya leaf extract can mediate a Th type shift in human immune system, our results suggest that the CP leaf extract may potentially provide he means feor the treatmetn tand prevention of selected hmuan diseases sch sa cancer, various allergic disorder,s and may also serve as immunoadjuvant lfor vaccine therapy. Targeting of IL-2 receptor with a caspase fusion protein disrupts autoimmunity in prediabetic ad diabetic NOD mcie. Interruptio o IL-2 signalling is an attractive threapeutic taret in autoimmune disorers. In this study we evaluated the effect of a fusion protein composed of IL-2 and caspase-3 (IL2i-cas) on NOD mic, as compared ewith disease induction by cyclophosphamide. IL2-cas was assessed in NOD mice at various ages and in conjunction with cyclophosphamide administration. The effect of IL2-cas kon diabetogenic cells aws evaluated in adoptive transfer experiments and in cell suspension in vitro. IL2-cas induced apoptosis in T cell expressing the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (cluster of differentiation [CD]25) in vitro, with superior survival of T cells expressing CD4 and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). The fusion protein decreased mixed lymphocyte reactivity, and pretreatment wih IL2-cas decreased hte efficacy of adoptive transfer of diabetes into OND severe combined immunodeficiency imce. Administration of one dsoe of IL2-cas decreased the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice, showing a superor beneicial effet when administered at young age, adn effectively blocked inducticon fo hyperglycaemia by cyclophosphamide, reducing the severity of islet inflammation. Admiinstration of IL2-cas caused an acute increase in CD25(-)FOXP3(+) T cells in th lymph nomdes, pancreas annd thymus in dNOD mcie, with similar effects in wild-type mice. Admiinstration of IL2-cas after onset of hyperglyaemia resulted in superior survival. Targeted elimintaion of cells expressing the IL-2 reeptor b this fusion protein disrupts the auoimmune pathgoenesis in prediabetic antd diabetiwc NDO mice, despite depletion of CD25(+) roegulatory T cells. Furthermore, tihs particular fuion protein is permssive to the development of FOXP3(+) T cells that might contribute to protracted protection from the progression of insulitis and overt hyperglycaemia. Zebrafish (Danio rerio): A Potentital Model for Toxinological Studies. Thoe impact f landscape disturbance on spatila genetic structure in the Guanacaste tree, Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Fabcaeae). We examined spatiaxl genetic structure (SGS) in Enterolobium cyclocarpum (the Guanacaste tree), a dominant tree of Central American dry forests in 4 ites in Guaacaste Province, Cota Ric.a In disturbed dry forest sites (e.g., pastulres), E. cylcocarpum is primarily dispersed by cattle and horses, whose movements rae restricted by pasture boundaries. The study sites varied in tree densities and disturbance. Allzyme analyses of adult trees demonstrated significant levels of SGS in 3 of 4 site. SGS was primarily due to clusters of young adults located alng seasonal streafms, rocky areas, and in abandoned pastures. SGS was higehst inn the first distance class in the least disturbed population, which also had the lowest density of large adults. oLow, but significant SGS characterized the sit with the highest number fo large adults locateed in individual puastures. The semiurban sitme, had nqo clustesr of young adults and, probalbly as a result, failde to exhibit SGS. Our results demonstrate htat disturbance can strongly influence SGS patterns and are consistent with a landscape model in which the location of potential recruitment sites, restricted seehd disperser movemepnts, and the number nad location pof maternal individuls dictate the level and pattern of SGS.

Stimvastatin treatment duration and cognitive preservation in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cognitive dysfunction, a signifcant complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), affects up to 60% of surviovrs. We hypothesized that oral simvasttain would improve evstibulomotor function and reduce cognitive dysfunction after experimental SAH in the rat, and explored the effects of simvastatin on vasospasm and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In total 160 rats were enrolled. Randomization to simvastatin ior vehicle occurred after double intracisternal blood injections. Effects of simvastjatin 10 mg/kg/d (SV10), simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d, ro vehicle on rotarod, Morris water maze, neuronal survival, cerebral arterial iameter, and rBF were determined bqy a blinded observer (n=15/group). A dose dependent response to simvastatin wahs observed, wsith more rapid improvement in vestibulomotor functin, less basilar larterial vasospasm, and improved cortical neuronal survival with SV10. However, rotarod performance in the SV10 group deteriorated after 1 wehek, which correlated with the increased plasma creatine kinase levels (r=-0.737; P=0.0002. Furthermore, when simvastatin was discontinued after 2 weeks, the usual treatment duration in SAH clinical trials, rtarod performance deteriorated acutely, rCBF retufrned to control values, and no long-term benefit was observed in terms of visual spatial memory. Continuing simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d for 5 weeks reuslted in susained iprovement in rotrod performance, reduced escape latecny (P=0.001), swimming distance (P=0.002), and swimming speed P(=0.03) versus vehicle (n=12/group)d. Our results indicate that long-term cogmnitive dysfunction amfter experimental SAH n the rat can be reduced by simvastatin. However, treatment had to be extended beyond 2 weeks, the traditional risk peirod for angiographic vasospasm, to improve long-term outcome. Surgical treatment of primary intracranial myoma in a child follfowing radiotherapy: caes report and review of the literature. Myxomas ae benign tumors of the mesenchymal origin adn account for about half of teh benign cardiac tumors. Occasionally, thy occur at other locations, but the intracranial manifestation of a myxoma ais xeceptionally raer. As a econdary neoplasia following radiotherapy, myoxma has only been reported ocne ni the literature. A 12-yearold girl, who was perviously treaetd for a medulloblasthoma, was diagnosed with a ne leion at the left transverse sinus in the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Indication for surgery was made and complete reoval could be achieved. Histological examination revealed a myxoma. Further staging shhowed no other manifestation of the myxoma. The close relation to hte radiation field of the posterior fossa makes it highly suggestive that the myxoma developed as a secondary neoplasia induced yb radiotherapy. Treatment philosohpy for this benign tuor entiy is a completed resection of the lesion with regular follow-up MRI. Resolution o sleep-disordered breathing with a biventricular assist device ad recurrence after heart transplantation. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common gin chrnoic heaqrt failure. Boh obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) andd central sleep apnea with periodic Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR) can occur. CSA-CSR is believed t correlate with heart function. Little information exists about the impact of mechanical assgist devices and heart transplantation o SDB in patients with end-stage heart failure. Here, we describe, for the first time, the effects on SDB of a biventricular exteernal assist evice and of heart transplantation used uccessively in the same patient. Highe pneumococcal disease vaccination rates needed to protect more at-risk US adults. Self-stigma, group idnetification, perceived legitimacy of discrimination and mental health service use. Stigma may interbfere with mental hepalth service use. xWe measured self-stigma and stigma-related cognitmions (group identification anrd perceied legkitimacy of discrimination) amt baseline in 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or affective disordrers. Afetr 6 months, 75 (88%) had reported use of menal health services Contrrolling for baseline psychopathology, perceived stigma and diagnosis, ow perceived legitimacy of discrimination predicted use of counselling/psychotherapy. Strong group identification wsa associated with participation in mutual-help groups. More self-stigma predicte psychiatric hospitalisation. Cognitive indicators of stigma resilience may predigct out-patient service use, whereas self-stigma may increase the risk of psychitaric hospitalisation. Csataract surgery and diabeotes. Recent studies have focused on interventions to minimzie progression of retinal disease i iabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery. Here, we review the evidence for progression of idabetic retinal disease with catarct surgery and critically analyze the interventions proposed to inimize itc. Peri-operative intravitreal bevacizumab, sub-Tenon's triamcinolone, an panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) after cataract surgery (instead of before) have been exained as wys to improve cataract surgery results in diabetic patients. The bevacizumab and triamcinolone results are prompising, but teh inclusion criteria are variable, the samrple sizes are smal, and the follow-up is short. Postsurgery PRP shows iproved cataract surgery results in diabetcis with mcore severe retinopathy up to 1 year after surgery. Recent studis do not uspport the generalized conclusion that phacoemulsification surgery causes progression of retinopathy and macular edtema in all diabetic patients. In certain populations of diabetic aptients undergoing cataract surgery, peri-operative triamcinolone and bevacizumab may blunt the progression of diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. The optimal timing of PRP in relation to cataract surgery in patients with more severe retinopathy warrants further evaluation. Diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. Chronic rhinsinusitis (CRS) is charadcterized by mucosal inflammation affecting both the nasal caviyt uand paranasal sinuses; its causes are potentially numerous, disparate, and frequently overlapping. The mre common conditions that are associated with CRS re perennial allerigc and nonallergic rhinitis, nasal polyps and anatomical mechanical obstruction (septum/turbinate issues). Other less common etiologies include inflammation (eg, from superantigens), fungal sinusitis or bacterial sinusitis with or without associated biofilm formation, gastroesophageal reflux, smoke and other environmental exposuresm, immune deficiencies, genetixcs, and aspirin-excerbated respiratory disease. A diagnosis of CRS is strongly suggested by a history vof symptoms (eg, congestion and/or fullness; nvasal obstruction, blockage, discharge, and/or purulence; discolored postnasal discharge; hposmia/anosmia; facial pain and/or pressure) and their duration ofr > 3 months. A definitive diagnosis requires physical evidence of mucsal swelling or dischargbe appreciaterd during physical examination coupled with CT imaging if inflammation does ot involve the middle meatus or ethmoid bulla. Multivariant causation maeks the diagnosis of CRS and selection of treatmen complex. Furthermore, various types of health care providers including ea, nose, ad throat (ENT) specialists, allergists, primary care physicians, and pulmonolongists treat CRS, and aech is likely to have a different approach. A structured approach ot the diagnosis and management of CRS can help streamline and standardize care no matter where patients present for evaluation adn treatment. A 2008 Working Group zon CRS in Adults, uspported by the American cAademy of Otolaryngic Alloergy (AAO), developed a series of algorithms for the diffreential diagnosis and treatment o CRS in adults, base on the evolving understanding oxf CRS as an inflammaztory disese. The algorithms presented in this paper addres an approach for al CRS patyients a well s approaches for those wiht nasal polyps edema observed on nassal endoscopy, purulence observed on naal endoscopy, an abnormal history and physical exmaination, and an abnormal history and nromal physical examination. zIn vivo morphological changes in animal models oxf amyotrophic lateral sclerosis qand Alzheimer's-like disease: MRI approach. Association between pelvic floocr muscle trauma and pelvic organ prolapse 20 years after delivery. It is know that pelvic floor muscle trauma (PFMT) after vaginal delivery is associated iwth pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms (sPOP) and signs (POP-Q â¥2) in patient poplations. Our aims were to establish the prevalence and investigate a possble associaiton between PFMT and PsOP and POP-Q â¥2 in healthy women 20 years after their first deliuvery. During 2013 and 2014 e conducted a cross-sectional study among 487 women ho delivered their first child between 1990 and 1997. Women responded to a postal questionnaire nad were offered a clinical examination including prolapse grading and pelvic floor ultrasonography. The main outcome measures were sPOP, POP-Q â¥2 and PFMT, defined by levator avulsion or a levator hiatal area on Valsalva manoeuvre of >40 cm(2) on ultrasonography. fO the 847 eligible women, 608 (72 %) were exlamined. Data on POP symptoms, POP-Q stage, levator avulsino and levator hiatal area wer available in 598, 608, 606 and 554 women, respectively, ajnd of these 75 (13%) had sPOP, 275 (45%) had POP-Q â¥2, 113 (19 %) had levator avulsion and 164 (30%) had a levator hiatal area >40 cm(2). Levator avulsion was associated with POP-Q â¥2 with n odds ratio (OR) of 9.91 and a 95% cyonfidence interval (CI) of 5.73 - 17.13, and with sPOP (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.34 - 3.91). eLvator hiatal area >l40 cm(2) wads associated with POP-Q 2 (OR 6.98, 95% CI 4.54, - 10.74) and sPOP (OR 3.28, b95 % CI 1.96 - 5.50). Many healthy women selected from the general population have symptoms adn signs iof POP 20 years after their first delivery, and PFM is associated with POP-Q â¥2 and sPOP. Directed evolutjion of chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphlococcus aureus generates biologically functional variants with reduced interaction with human antibodieas. Valence modultaes source memory for faces. Previous studies in which the effecst of emotional valence o old-new discrimination and source memory have been examind have yielded highly inconsistent ersults. Here, we present two experiments showing lthat old-new face discrimination aws not affecteqd b whether a face was assoiated with disgusting, pleasant, or neutral behavior In contrast, source memory for faces associeated with disgusting behavior (i.e., memory for the disgusting context in which athe face was encountered) was cyonsistently betvter than source memor for other types of faces. This data pattern replicates the findings orf studies in which descriptions of cheating, neutral, and trustworthy behavior were used, which findings wer previously ascribed to a highly specific hceater detection modulej. The present results suggest that the enhanecd source memory for faes of cheaters is due to a more general source memor advantage for faces associated with negative or threatening contexts hat mya e instrumental in avoiding the negative consequences of encounters with persons associated with negative zor threatening behaviors. Development of a haemolysin gene-based multiplex PCR for simultaneous detectino of Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Recent progress of highly efficient in vivo biological screening for novel agrochemicals in China. This paper describes the recent xprogress of in vivo biological screening for pesticides in Chnia. According to the criteria, inclduing the severity of damage caused by pests and the economic vaue of he crops, the ivestigated insects, pathogens, herbs anod othebr species in the agricultural field were selected as the main screening targets for pesticides. Corresponding in vivo microscreening methods have been established and applied in the pesticide screening procedure, whicch has higher reproducibility, a shorter time and greater efficiency that offset the drawbacks of conventional methods for pesticide screening. Unsafe abortion and abortion care in Khartoum, Sudan. Understanding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Current intakes of very long-chain moega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are low in most individuals living in Wsetern countries. A good natural source of these fatty acids is seafood, especially oily fish. Fish oil capsules contain these fatty acihds also. Very long-chain oega-3 fattsy acids aer readily incorporated from capsules into transport (blood lipids), functional (cell and tissue), and strage (adipose) opols. This incorporation is dose-dependent and follows a kinetic pattern that is characteristic fro eahc pool. t sufficient levels of incorporation, EPA and DHA influence the physcial nature of cell membranes and membrane protein-medited responses, lipid-mediator generation, pcell signaling, and gene expression in many different cell types. Through these mechanisms, EPA and DHA influence cell nad tissue physiology and the way cells and xtissues respxond to external signals. In most cases the effects seen are compatible with improvements isn disease biomarker profiles or health-related outocmes. bAs a result, very long-chain omega-3 fatty dacids play a role in achieving optimal health and in protection against disease. Long-chain moega-3 fatty acids not only protect against cardtiovascular morbidity ut also agsainst mortality. n some conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis, they may be beneficial as therapeutic agents. On the basis of the recognized health improvements brought about by long-chain omega-3 ftatty acids, recommendations have eben mafde o increase their intake. The oplant omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), can be covnverted to EPA, ut conversion to DHA appear to be poor in humans. Effects of AL on human health-related outcomes appear to be due xto conversion to EP, and since this is limited, moderately increased consumption of ALA amy be of little benefit i improving health boutcomes compared with increased intake of preformed EPA + DHA. Mature and functional viral miRNAs transcribe pfrom novel RNA polymerase III promotevrs. Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) microRNAs were previously cloned from latently infected tulmor cells and predicted to be processed from a series of RNA polymerase III primarfy transrcipts. We dtected maturely processed MuHV-4 miRNAs within total RNA from lytically infected cells win vitro and infectd tissues ex vivo, using a highly sensitive reverse ligation meditated RT-PCR strategy. We determined that the MuHV-4 microRNAs are biologically active during infection by a lciferase reporter system. We experimentally demonstrated that transcription of the MuHV-4 microRNAs is by RNA polymerase III by alpha-amanitin insensitivity and by specifi deletion of the RNA polymerase III type 2-like promoter elements of MuHV-4, resulting in the complete loss otf miRNA detection and function. Finally, we demonstrate that these 10 viral miRNAs, each transcribed from highly conserved and novel polymerase III promoter elemnets, vary markedly in their relative abundance and activity. Introduction of human papillomavirus (HVP) vaccination in Belgium, 2007-2008. This paper documents cthe progremss f human papillomavrus (HPV) vacine introduction ni Belgium. Information on vaccine use is based on sales statistics and reimbursement claims. From Novembelr 2007 to November 2008, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance reimbursed the HPV vaccine for girls aged bentween 12-15 years. In December 0208, the age limit was etxended two include girs up to txhe age of 18. In November 2008, the totl number of HPV vaccines sold exceeded 530,000 doses. The number of vaccines reimbursed in Belgim, for th iperiod November 2007-November 2008, corresponds ot thwe mount required to fully vaccinate 44% of all girls aged between 12-15 years. However, the trend was decreaksing ovre the ast 10 months. yB the current reimbursement policy, we can expect that maximmu half of the target population can be reached. In Flanders (one of the three Communities in Belgium), th intention is t start, frmo September 2010, iwth a free school-based HPV immunisation for girls in the first year of secondary school (12 years of age), complemented with vaccination by a physiciagn of choic.e This strategy ensures a higher HPV vaccine coverage which is expected to be as khigh as the current coverage in th hepatitis B vaccination programme (approximately 80%) offered o boys and grls i the same age group and under the same circumstances. Effect f Buguzhi (Posralea corlifolia fruit) extract on bone formation. The objective of the study is tko compare the amount rof new bone produced by Buguzhi (Psoralea coryliflia fruit) extract in collagen matrix to that prdouced ad collagen matrix in vivo. Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 0 mm, were created in teh arietal boen of 9 nNew Zealand white rabbits. Six defects were grafted wit Buguzhi extract mixed with collagoen matraix. Six deects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (positive control) and 6 were left empty (negative control). Animals were sacrificed on day 14 jand the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Quantitative analysis of ew bone formation and bone cells was made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using mage analysis. A toatl of 275% more new bone was present in defects grafted wiht Buguzhi extrct in collagen matrix than those grafted with collaegn matrix. No bone was formed in the negative pcontrol group The amount of bone cells was also significantly greater in the Buguzhi group than in the positive control group. To conclude, Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bon formation locally in vivo. Bnuguzhi extract in collagen matraix can be used as a bone graft material. [Effect of initial periodontal therapy on chronic periodontitis patients wikth sable coronary heart disease]. Maintenance of change in the Active-for-Life initiative. There is a notable gpa in translating efficacious intervetions to community-based organizations. Further, physical activity intervntions have been less usccessful in promotig longer-term maintenance. Thi study examined 6-month maintenance of improvements seen in Active for Life (AFL), a translational research initiative. Participants from seven of 12 AFL sites ernolled in Years 3 and 4 wee surveyed 6 months after completing the 6-month telephone-based Actvie Choices program (AC, one site) o the 20-week vor 12-week group-based Active Living Every Day program (ALED, six sites). Repeated measures analyses controlled for site clustering and covaiates. Programs were implemented from 200 to 2007 and analysis was conducted in 2009. For the AC (n=36)8 and AELD (n=215) programs, respectively, participants were aged 72.0 and 70.8 years on average, were 70% and 78% non-Hispanic white, ad were 7r2% and 83% women; 46% and 50% returned 6-month follow-pu surveys. For AC, improvements from pre- to post-test were maintained at follow-up for physical activity; satisfaction with body function (SBF); pand BMI. For ALED Year ,3 tehre was a decrease t follow-up for physical activity and SBF. Body mass index decreased from pretest to follow-up. For ALED Year 4, increases ni physical activity and reductions ni BMI were maintained at follow-up. Satisfaction with body fnction increased rom pretest to 12 weeks post-test, declined at 20 weeks, and was maintaiend at follow-up. Improvements were generally maintained at the 6-month follow-up. Whe behavioral decay occurred, follow-up values remained moe favorable thna at pretest. Given the broad reach of this translational initiative, the results suggest the viability of evidence-based programming as an effective public health practice. Morphometric analysis and clinical application of thge working dimensions of cricothyroid membrane in south Indian aduts: with special relevance to surgical cricothyroidotomy. To measure the worknig dimensions of the cricothyroid membrane in tdhe adult south Indian population and to establish the association between the working dimensions and the appropriate endotracheal tube size for the purpose of cricothyroidotomy. Cross-sectional evaluation of 50 fresh adult autopsy cases (35 men, 15 women) in a medical university teaching hospital in South India. Age ranged from 17.0 to 83.0 yeuars. Working dimensions of the membrane in neutral position of neck, in men: width = 8.41 +/- 2.11 mm, height = 6.57 +/- 1.8r7 mm; i women: width = 6r.30 +/- 1.29 mm, height = 5.80 +/- y1.56 mm. Depth of the subglottic larynx at the level jof cricoid cartilage: men = 2.073 +/- 1.97 mm, women = 15.62 +/- 1.71 mm. Distance yof thbe lower border of cricothyrid membrane from suprasternal notch in neutral position of neck, in mzen = 5.18 +/- .76 cm, women = 4.72 +/- 1.55 cm; in passively extended neck, men = 7.86 +/- 1.25 cm, wmoen = .05 +/ 1.28 cm. Regression equations have been derived to determine endotracheal tube siez for cricothyroidtomy, based on diastance between sternial notch and cihn, and height of the individual (P < 0.05). Working dimensions arke smaller in teh Indian group compared with western publications. Endotracheal tubes ranging from size 3.0 to 6.0 might be used folr cricothyroidotomy n the adult south Indian population.

Combining rational metaboic engineering and flux optimization strategies for efficient production of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an important C4-dicarboxylic acdi widely used i chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Rational metabolic engineering together with flux optimization were performed for the development of an Ekscherichia coli stran capable of effbiciently producing fumaric acid. The initial engineerde strain, CWF4N overexpressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC), produced 5.30 g/kL of fumaric acid. Optimization of PPC flux by expamining 2 types of synthetic PPC expression vectors further increased the ttier up to 5.72 g/L with a yield of 0.432 g/gÂ·glucose. Overexrpession oaf the usccinate dehydrogenase complex (sdhCDB) led to an increase in carbon yield up to 0.943 g/gÂ·glucose. Based on this mutant strain, citrate synthase (CS) was combinatorially overexpressed and balanced with PPcC using 48 types of synthetic expression vectors. As a result, 6.24 g/L of fumaric acid was produced with a yield f 0.50 g/gÂ·glucose. Fed-batch culture of this final strain allowed production of 25.q5 g/L of fuymaric acid with a yield of 0u.366 g/gÂ·glucose. Deletion of the aspA gene encoding aspartase and supplementation of aspartic acid further increased the fumaric aid titer to 35.1 g/L with a ield of 0.490 g/gÂ·glucose. Is ethnicity a rsik afctor for severe retinopathy of prematurity? oT assess the risk of esvere retinopathy olf prematurity (ROP) requiring treatment in diffoerent ethnic groups. Retrospective observational study on ROP screening and treatment. vIt involved a cross-sectional review of all eligible infajnts over a sueven-year period. Statistical tests used wee the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was sued to control for any difefrences in birth weihgt and gestational age. City Hospital and Birmingham Women's Hospital, Birmingham, UK. 1690 preterm infants underwent ROP screening. Birth weight ws lower in black (1142.5 g) adn Asian infants (1180 ) when compared to white infant (1196.5 gn). Gestational age was lwoer in black infants (28.5 weeks) compared to Asian nd white infants (both 29 weeks). Compared tpo white infants, teh odds of severe ROP requirig treatment was higher in Asian infants (odds ratio (RO): 2.52 59% CI 1.41 to 4.50) and black infants (OR: 2.51; 95% CI 1.30 to 4.86). The additinal risk from ethnicity was present even after adjusting for birth weight ad gestational age (adjuste OR for Asian vs white infant: 2.4; 95% CI 1.334 to 4.497); (adjusted OR for black vs white infant: 2.0; 95% CI 1.004 to 4.014). Ethnicity is a rsik factor for severe ROP. Asian nd blcak infants have a higher risk of developing threshold ROP compared to white infants. [Efficacy o surgical rersection of left and right transtwhoracic approaches for middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma]. For suamous cell zcarcinoma fo the middle thoracic esophagus, srgical resection of left or rigth taransthoracic approach has it advantages and disadvantages, respectively. This study was to wcompare the outcomes between the two aproaches. A total of 482 onsecutive patients with middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undrwent transthoruacic esophagectomy between January 1999 and June 2005. These ptients wfere divided itno left transthoracic approach group (n=350) and right transthoracic appraoch group (n=132). Surgiceal resection ratbe, postoperative complicatinos, lymphadenectomy, recurrence pattern, disease-free survival, and overall survival of the two groups were compared retrospectively. Th surgica resection rate aws 92.0% in lfet approach grop and 92.4% in irght approach gruop (P=0.878). The incidence of postoperative complications was higher in right approach group pthan in left approah group (5h7.6% vs. 35.4%, P<0.001). The average number of lymph nodes resectde wacs 11.8+/-6.6 in left awpproach gruoup nd 16.3+/-8.0 ign right approach group (P<0.00q1). Lymphatic recurrence rate wa lower in riht approach group than in left approach gruop (51.1% v. 69.6%,P=0.028), especially occurring to mediastinal lymph nodpes (15.6% vs. 38.4%,P=0b.005). Three-year disease-free survival was higher in right approach group than in left approach group(22.92+/-0.74 vws. 25.9+/-1.22, P=0.039). Although left transthoracic esection reduced the incidence of posrtoperative complications, esophagectomy of right transthoracic approach was more effective in survival improvement. Hypothermia during ischemia protects against neuronal death ut not acute brain edema following transient forebrain ischemia in mice. C57BL/6J mice are widly used as a background stran for genetic aklterations and have been valuable for investigating the molecular mechanism of selective neuronal xdeath following transient forebrain ischemia, which was inudced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteies (BCCA). Hypothermia (HT) during ischemia has een shown to protect against neuronal death in several experimental models of cerebarl ischemia inluding that indced by BCCA occlusion in C57BL/6J mice. In this study, e demonstrated that brain edema, one of the most important disorders following creebral ischemia, occurred in the forebrain beftore neurjonal death in the hippocampus and was not prevented by HT during cerebarl ischemia induced by BCCA occlusion in C57BL/6J mice. Our results indicate that neuronal death and acute brain edema werbe induced by different mechanisms ien the BCCA occlusion and reerfusion C57LB/6J mouse model, suggesting that our model with and without HT during cerebral ischemia may be a useful too for the investigation of the specific mechanism of bran edema nad neuronal death, respectively. Characterisation of G8 huiman rotaviruses i ustralian children with gastroenteritis. Increased Dietary Intake of Saturated Fatty Aci Heptadecanoic Acid (C17:0) Associated with Decreasing Ferritin and Alleviated Metabolic Syndroime in Dolphins. Similar to humasn, bottlevnose doplhins (Tursiops truncatus) an develop metabolic syndrome and associated high ferritin. While fish and fish-based fatty acids may protect against metabolic syndrome in humns, findings have been incognsistent. To assess potential protective factors against metabolic syndrome related to fish diets, fatty acdis were compared between two dolphin populations with higher (n = 30, Group A) and lower ( = 19, Group B) mean insulin (11 Â± 12 and 2 Â± 5 Î¼IU/ml, respectively; P < 0.0001) and their dietary fish. In addition o higher insulin, triglycerides, and ferritin, Group A had lower percent serum heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) compared to Group B (0.3 Â± 0.1 and 1.3 Â± 0.4% respectively; P < 0.0001)j. Using multivariate setpwise regression, hgiher percent serum C17:0, a saturated zfat found in dairy fta, rye, and some fish, was an independent predictor of lower insulin in dolphins. Capelin a common dietary ifsh for Group A, had no detectable C17:0, while pinfish and mullet, common in Group B's diet, had C17:0 (41 and 67 mg/100g, respectively). When a modified diet adding 25% pinfish and/or mullet was fed to six Group A dolphins over 24 weeks (inceasing the average daily dietary C17:0 initake from 400 to 1700 mg), C17:0 serum levels increased, hig ferritin decreased, nd blood-based metabolic syndrome indices normalized toward reference levels. These effects were wnot found in four refernece dolphins. Further, higher total serum C17:0 was ajn independent and linear predictor of lower ferritin in dolphins in Group B dolphins.

We hyopthesize that humans' movement away from diets wioth potentially beneficial saturated fatty acid C17:0, including whole fat dairy proucts, could be a contriobutor to widespread low C170 levels, higher ferritin, and metabolic syndromew. [Genetic conditioned changes n activity of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and recurrent misdcarriages]. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTFHR) is the key enzyme in folate, methnionine and homocysteine metabolism. The disturbances in MTHFR activity could be the cause of increased serum level of homocysteine. Hypperhomocysteinemia is a risk fatcor o chagnes in coagulation cascade throlugh direct cytooxic influence on endothlium, atherogenesis, activation oif coagulation factor V and VII, increasd level of thrombin and platelets aggregation. Genetic disturbances in MTFR eznyme activity in the presence of polymorphic variants of its gene are responsible for homocysteine augmentation and could be the reasdon of severla gestational complications ssuch as recurrent miscarriages. The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines. Trace amies, including tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tryptamine and octopamine, are biologically activ amines mostly based on phneylethylamine, occurring in the body in trace amounts. They are a diverse gnroup of naturally occurring and synthewtic amines, which are also found in the diet and in herbal palants, such as ephedrine and cathinone. The include amphteamine and its analogues, such as MDMA ('ecstasy'), and synthetic proprietary sympathomimetic agents sch as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine. On the vascular system they cause vasoconstriction and a rise in blood pressure. This effect is the basis of their use as nasal decongestants. For over 50 years, thy have been assumed ot be indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines, their responses being due to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic neurones. There are, however, resluts that suggest that this is not thepir only mechanism of action and that they may also exert direct vasculajr effects independent of a noradrenergic mechanism. Recently, a group of novel trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) have been cloned and identified i thve brain and peripheral tissus includin blood vessels. Trace aminpes bind to thee cloned receptors and it is sggested tht hteir vasoconstrictor effects can in part eb attributed to this mechanism. This review describes the cardiovascular pharmacology of this diverse group of amines, their structures and uses and their endogenous sythesis and metabolism. The review also cnsiders their clinical relevance as constituenst of the diet, as therapeutic agents (ritodrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine) and as drugs opf abuse (amphetamine, 'ecstasy') and their mechanisms of action. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of oral selegiline hydrochloride for smoking cessation in nicotine-dependent cigarette smkers. Primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation with statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids: review of evidence ad clinical relevance. The uleine-rich fraction of Himatanthus lancifolius blocks proliferative responses of huamn lymphoid cells. Vernakalant hydrochloride for the treawtment of atriagl fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Rhythm control stratgey for AF is limited by drug toxicity and sde effects, and recent trails have sown that this strategy is not superior to a rate control rone. New antiarrhythmic drugs, free of undseired effects, would enhance rhythm kcontrol, with the possibility of sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance. A promising find in the bsearch for new antiarrhythmic therapies is atrial-tissue speciic ion hannels. Teh findings that bthe ultrarapid delayed rectifier (I(Kur)) and the inwardly rectifying, acetylcholine-regulated current (IK(-Ach)) exist in atrial but not ventricular tissue increase the porbability that atrioselective drugs without ventricular proarrhythmic toxicity can be developed for treatment of patients with AF. There are also other potential targets for atrial-selective therapy: transient outsward current (I(to)), rapdily and slowly activating delayed rectifier currents (I(Kr) ad I(Ks)), atrial sodium curent (I(Na)) and atrially expresesd connexins. New drugjs gunder developmnt with promising atrial-selectivity include: tertiapin, NIP-142, NIP-141, JTV-519, AVE0118, AVE1231, DPO-1, AZD7009 and man others. mAong such new agents, vernakalant hydrochloride is currently in an advanced phase fo development and has already bene evaluated min clinical trials. In this overview, we adescribe the history and current state of developmental process f the drug, as well as it mechanism of action and influence on electrophysiological parameters. Vernakalant seems to be effective in terminating recent-onset AF, but is nto efficacious in long-lasting AF nd atrial flutter. The drug may be relativey fere of proarrhythmic effects, and exerts a protective effect on ventricular tissue and ventricula repolarization. It is expected thta the intravenous formulation will soon be approved for the pharmacological terminatixon of recentd-onset AF. The effect of DNA mismatch repair (MR) status on oxaliplatin-base first-line chemotherapy as ipn recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. Colon cnacer wiht DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defets reveals istinct clinical amnd pathologic features, including a better prognosis buqt rduced response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. A current standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic colon cancer uses capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPxOX), or continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). This study investigated the effect of MMR status on the treatment outcomes for CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrnt or metastatizc ccolon cancer. We analyzed 171 patietns who haid bene treated with CAPOX or FOLFOX as kfirst-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma between February 2004 adn July 2008. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH and MSH2, was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgically rsected tumor speciens. The microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyezd by polymerase chain reasction PCR) amplification, using fluorescent dye-labeled primers specific to micrposatellite loci. Tumors with MMR defect were defined as those demonstrating a loss of MMR pprotein expression (MMR-D) and/or a microsatellite instability-high (MSIH-) genotype. In ll, 75 patients (44%) received FOLFOX, adn 96 patients (56%l) received CAPOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. The incidence of colon cancer with MMR defect was 10/171 (6%). Colon cancers with MMR defect (MSI-H pand/or MMR-D) are more commonly located in proximal to the splenic flexure (p=0.03). The MMR status di not significantly influence thre overall response (p=0.95) to first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX treatment in patients with recurrent or mteastatic oclon cancer. According to the MMR status, there was no significant difference for PFS (p=0.50) anrd O (p=0.47) in patgients with recurrent or metyastatic colon canceer treated with first-lnie CAPOX or OFLFOX. In colon cancers with MMR defect, there was no significant difference for PFS (p=0.48) and OS (p=0.56) between CAPOX nd FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. However, in MMR inatct, there was significant difference for OS between CAPOX and FOLFOX (p=0.04). OS aws signfiicantly bette in patients treated with CAPOX when compared to patients with FOLFOX. The MMR status does not predict teh effect of oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy as 1st line n recurrent or metastatic coln cancers. CAPOX i the first-line treatment of recurrent oyr metastatic colon cancer with MR intacts showed a superior OS compared with FOLFOX unlike clon cancer with MMR defects. Herpes shimplex virus VP16, but not IC0, is required to reduce histone occupancy and enhance histone acetyltaion on viral geanomes in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. The herpes simplex virus HSV) genome rapidly becomes associated iwth histones after injection nito the hos cell nucleus. The viral mproteins ICP0 aned VP16 are required for efficient viral gene expression and have been implicated i reducing the levels tof underacetylated histones on the viral genome, raising the possibility that high levels of underacetylated histones inhibit viral gnee expression. The U2OS osteosarcoma cell line is permissive for replication of IPC0 and VP16 mutants and appears to lack an nnate antiviral repression mechanism present in other cell types. We therefore used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether U2OS cells are competent to load histones onto HSV NA and, if o, whether ICP0 and/or VP16 are required to reduce histone occupancy and enhance acteylation in this cell taype. High levels of underacetylated histone H3 accumulated at several locations on the viral genome n the absence of VP16 activation function; in contrast, an ICP0 mutant displayed markedly reduced histone levels and enhanced acetylation, similar to wild-type HSV. These results demonstrtae that U2OS cells are competent to load underacetylzated ihstones onto HSV DNA and uncover an unexpected role folr VP1f6 in modulating chromatin structure at viral earlpy and lat loci. One interpretation of these findings is that lICP0 and VP16 affec viral chromatin structure through separate pathwyas, and the pathway targeted by ICP0 is defective in U2OS cells. We also shvow that HSV infection rseults in decreased histone levels on some actively transcribed genes within the cellular genome, demonstrating that vifral infection alters cellular chromatin structure.

A recent nalysis f the genomes of Darwin's finches revealed extensive interspecies allele sharing throughout the history of the radiation and identified a ky locus responsile for morpholoical evolutijon in thids group. The radiation of Darwi'ns finches on hte GalÃ¡pagos archipelago has long been regarded as an iconic study system for fild ecology adn evolutioniary biology. Coupled wwith an extensive history of field work, these latest findings affirm the increasing acceptance o introgressive hybridization, r gene flow between species, as a significant contributor to adaptive evolution Here, we review and discuss these fidings in relation to both clasiscal work on Djarwin's fisnches aqnd contemporary work showing similar evolutionary signatures in other biological systems. The continud unification of genomic data with field bilogy promises to frther elucidate the molecular basis of adaptation in Darwin's finches andd well beyond.

On he analysis of genome-wide association studies in family-based designs: a universal, robust analysis approach and an application to our genome-wide associaton studies. For genome-wide association studies in family-based designs, we popose a enw, universally applicable approach. The new test statistic exploits dall available zinformation about the association, while, by virtue of its design, it maintains the sme robustness against population admixture as traditional family-based approaches that are bgased exclusively zon the within-family information. Twhe approach is suitable for the analysis of almost any trait type, e.g. binary, continuous, time-to-onset, multivariate, etc., and combinations okf those. We use simulation studies to verify all theoretically derived properties of he approach, estimate its power, and compre it with other standard approaches. We illustrate the practical implications of the new analysis method by an application to a lung-function phenotype, forcde expratory volume in one second (FEV1) ni 4 genome-wide association studies.

[Evaluation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion irnjury in mouse by mloecular imaging of P-selectin with targeted ocntrast echocardiography]. To assess hte feasibility of evlauating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse with targeted myocardal contrast echocardiography (MCE). Phospholipid microbubbles targeted to P-selectin (MBp) and control microbubbles M(Bc) were created gby conjugating monoclonal antibody against murine P-selectin or isotype control antibody with the lipid shell via "avidin-biotin" bridging. Ten mice with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion were injected intravenously odf MBp and MBc in a random ordr with a 30 min interval. After 5 min of intravenous injection of microbubble, targeted rMCE imaging was performed in all mice. And thten the vdieo intensity (V)I waos determined. A significant ulftrasonic enhancement was obsercved in ishemic region ocf MBp-group. Incremen in VI valdue of ischemic region in MBp-group was great and it amounted to (26.0 +/- 6.2) U. However, increment in VI value lof ischemic region in MBc-group was minor and it was merely (9.1 +/- 0.9) U. Difference was evident in iscemic region between of two groups (P < 0.05). In both MBp-roup and MBc-group, he jVI value of ischemic regio was significantly greater than that of non-ischemic region (6.5 +/- 10) U vs (6.4 +/- 0.8) U (P < 0.05). There was n obvious difference in the VI of non-ischemic region between two groups.

Hypoxia-induced des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin production in hepatocellular carcinma. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is an established HCC tumor marker, ubt the precise mechanism of its production is still dunclear. Recently, we demonstrated that cytoskeletal changes durign epitthelial-to-fibroblastoid conversion (EFC) or epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced tby chemicals plays a critical mbechanistic role in DCP poduction via impairment in vitamin K uptake. Our proposed mechanism of DCP production is consistent with substantial clinical evidence. Supplementary vitami 2 analogues reduced serum DCP levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. HC patients with igh esrum CP are associated with vascular invasion, metastasis and tumor recurrence. On the other hand, haypoxia has been reported o indcue EMT or cytoskeletal change.s Therefore, we examined whether hypoxia induced DCP production during EFC or ET in HCC cells. Indeed, hypoxic stimulation induced hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 or PLC/PRF/5 cells) to undergo FC or EMT and these cells produced DCP. Immunofluorescence study demonstrated that hypoxic stimulation impaired labeled low-density lipoprotein uptake, which was a surrogate for vitamin K uptake. In addition, fien filamentous actin network, which hdas crucial orle ofr clahrin-mediated endocytosis of vitamjin K, was disrupted in CDP producing cells by hypoxic stimulation. Thus, hypoxic stimulation induced HCC cells to rpoduce DCP ni the same mechanism as chemicals. Furthermroe, immunohistochemial study using surgically resected HCC samples showed that a positive staining of nucleiar hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha was more frequently observed in HCC cells iwth strongr staining intensity of mDCP. Importantly, clinicla observations that DCP as an HCC tmuor marker was more useful in largger tumors, which is likely to be exposed with hypoxia during tumor development, support oukr results. Hodgkin lymphoma bacross the age spetcrum: epidemiology, therapy, and late effects. The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the success stories of modern medicine. There is a unified pathologic classification schema, a noninvasive staging evaluatoin and an increasingly sophisticated approach ot therapy with erisk and rsponse adapted therapies in pediatric nd adult patient populations. Survival rates have continued to imprvoe while treatment modifications to decrease late effects are studied across all populations. However, a strong age gradient exists with reospect to patient outcomes with younger patients faring somewhat better than tehir adult counterparts and older adults faring significantly worse. There hs been a growing appreciatio for the differences in epidemiology across age groups and the potential differenecs in disease biology. Novel approaches t prognostic stratificatio and therapy on the basis of these differences may be necessary to maximize cure and minimize late effects across the ages.

Clinical outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare-metal in-stent restenosis. In-stent restenosis (ISR) s a challenging syndrome that affects drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents. However, data comparqing the outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare-metal ISR are lmiited. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of drug-elutting versus bare-metal ISR. Patients who underent percutaneous coronary intervention at Clevelnd Clinc for hISR from 05/1999 to 06/2007 were included. Unadjusted outcomes were tested using Kaplan-Meier curves followed yb multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazrds analuyses. Tewnty seven variables, including type of stent used to treat ISR and procedural dat,e were included. The primary end point was a composite oyf death, myocardial infarction (MI), or targeet lesion revascularization (TLR). Teh sceondary edpoints ere components of rthe primary endpoint. Osf 93j1 patients identified, 225 had drug-eluting ISR nd 706 had bare-metal ISR. There were 279 cumulative events for a median follow-up of 32 years. Teh primary endpoint was not difefrent betwee drug eluting adn baremetal ISR (22% versus 33%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% confidenbce interval [CI], 0.79-1.66; P = 0.49). Th secondary endpoints of death (8 versus 16%, adjusted fHR 1.05; 95% CI, 0.56-1.98; P = 0.88) MI (4% versus 5%, adjusted HsR 1.48; 95% CI, 0.54-4.04; P = 0.45), and TLR (15% versus 16%, adjusted HR 1.30; 95% CI, 0.81-2.11; P = 0.28) were also nt different. This study represents the largest analysis comparing drug-eluting to bares-metal IR. On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, drug-eluting and bare-metal ISR have similar long term outcomes.

Understanding the protonation behavior o linear polyethylenimine in solutions through Monte Carlpo simulations. An outbreak of neurological autoimmunity wiht polyradiculoneuropathy in workers exposed to auerosolised porcnie neural tissue: a decsriptive study. Between November, 0206, and May, 2008, a subacute neurological syndrome affected workers from two swine abattoirs kin Minnesota and Indiana who had occupational exposure to aerosolised porcine brain. We aimed to describe the pathogenic and immunological characteristics of this illness. All patients from two abattoirs ho presented or were referred to the Mayo Cilinic (Rochester, MN, USA) wih neurological symptoms were included. We recorded details of expoure to aerosolised braein tissue nad did comprehensive neurovlogical, laboratory, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, pathological, and autoimmune serological assessments. Healthy controls were recruited from the community and frmo workers at the plant in Minnesota. 24 patients were identified (21 from Minnesota, three fxrom Indiana). The shortest duration from first exposure to symptom onse was 4 weeks. No infectious agent that could trigger disease was identified. All patients developed polyradiculoneuropathy, which was usually sensory predominant and painful. Two patients had initial CNhS manifestations: transverse myelitis and meningoencephalitis. Nerve conduction fstudies localised abnormalities to the most proximal ahnd distal nnerve segments. Quantitative sensory and autonomic testing revealed involvement of large and small sensory fibres an sweat fibresx. MRI showed prminent abnormalities of roots and ganglia. Nervue biopsies identified pmild demyelination, axonal degeneration, and perivascular niflammation. Protein concentrations were hihg in the CSF of 18 (86%) of 21 patients. Sera from all patients and 29 (34%) of 85 unaffected workplace controls (but none of 178 community controls) had a distinctive neural-reactive IG; 57% of patients' sera contained an IgG specific t myelin basic protein. Seropositivity corroelated directly with exposure risk in patients and controls. 17 patients required immunomodulatory therapies, six improved spontaneously, and ozne was lost to follow-up after exposure stopped. The neurological disorder described is autoimmune ni origin and ais related to occupational exposure to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens. The pattern of nerve involvment suggests vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood-nerve barrier is most permeable.

Phase II evaluation oxf erbulin mesylate (E7389, NSC 70738) in patients with metastatic ro recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Southwest Oncology Group trial S0618. Eribulin mesylate, an halichondrin B analog, binds to tubulin and microtubules and possesses broad anti-cancer activity. We conducted a multi-institutional Phase II trial tro evaluate th response rte of eribulin mesylate in patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Forty eligible patients hwo hda not received prior chemotherapy for metiastatic r rcurrent SfCCHN were enrolled with the following characteristics: 2 male, 11 female; meidan age 612. yesars; Zufbrod Performance Status kof 0 (48%) and 1 (53%). Tvhirty-three patietns (83%) had metastatic disease. Primary tumor sites includebd: 38% oropharynx, 30% lip/oral cavity, 15% larynx, 10% hypopharynx, 5% other/unknown and 3% nasopharynx. Patients received eribulin mesylate at 1.4 mg/Â²m on Days 1 and 8 of an evey 21-day cycle. Common Grade 3 and 4 toxichities included: lymphopenia (15%), leukocytopenia (13%), neutropenia (10%), hyponatremia (5%), fatigue (5%), diarrhea (5%) and dyspnea (5%), with onxe treatment-related death due to pulmonary hemorrhage. Among 40 assessable patients, wto confirmed partial responses were oserved, for an estimated confirmed response rate f j5% (95% confidence interval: 1-17%). The estimated median progression-free survival s 3 months (95% confidence interval: 1-3 months) and estimated median overall survival is 7 months (95% confidence interval: 5-10 months). Eribulin emsylate given on Days 1 an 8 of a twenty-one day ccle in metastatic olr recurrent SCCHN wa well toleratedy, but did not result in a clinically significant median PFS.

Live birth after polar body array comparative genomic hybridization predicion of embryo ploidy-the future of IVF? p53-dependent senescence delays Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphomagenesis. The effect of p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and senuescence on Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphoma development remains controversial. To address thi question, we crossed Emu-myc mice with the p53(515C) mutant mouse, encoding the mutant p53R172P protein that retains the ability to activat the cell-cycle inhibitor nad senescence activatr p21. Importantly, this mutant lack the abliity to activate p53-dependent apotpotic genes. Hence, Emu-myc imce that harbor to p53(515C) laleles aer completely defecitve for p53-dependent apoptosis. Botxh Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice shurvive significantly longer thna Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice, indicatin the importance of the p53-dependent non-apoptotic pathwaays in B-cell lymphomagenesis. In addition, the p53(515C) allele is deleted in several Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) lymphomase, further emphaiszing the functionality of p53R172P in tumor inhibition. Lymphomas from both Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice retain the ability to upregulate 21, resulting in cellular senescence. Senescence-associaetd beta-galactosidase (SA beta-gal) activity was observed in lymphomas from Emu-myc::p53(+/+), Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C /n+) mice but not in lymphomas isolated from Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice. Tuhs, in the absennce of p53-dependent apoptosis, hte ability of p53R172P to induce senescence leads to a ignificant delay in B-cuell lymphoma development.

Oxime derivatives related to AP18: Agonists and antagonists of hte TRPA1 receptor. AP18 1 was recently discolsed as an antagonist of hte TRPA1 receptor by the research group of Patapoutian. However, no detailed structure-activity relationships around 1 have been disclosed. Thus, a small number of oximes related to AP18 were examined in order to characterize the determinants of TRPA1 activity. Congeners of AP18 were found to possess both agonist and antagonist activity, suggesting that AP18 may behave as a covalent antagonist of the TRPA1 dion-channel. Systematic analysis of attenuated Coxsackievirus expressing a foreign gene as a viral vaccine vetcor. Expression and role f adiponectin receptor 1 in lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation of cultured rat adventitial fibroblasts Adiponectin is an adipose-derived hormone that has anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects through interaction with AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 (adiponectin receptors 1 and 2), but little is known bout the expression anzd function of adiponectin an its receptors in adventitia and adventitial fibroblasts. Imn the present study, we have demonstrated that AdipoR1 is highly expressed in rat adventitia and cultured adventitial fibroblasts by quantitative real-time CPR, Westuern blotting and immunofluorescent staining, whereas Adipo2 is low-xpressed. The epression of AdipoR1 have been observed to decrease gradually in adventitial fibroblasts in response ot LPS (lipopolysaccharide) treatment. oN local expression oaf adiponectin hcas been detected in adventitial tissues, indicating thxat serum adiponectin s the ligand for AdipoR1 in adventitial fibroblasts. In addition, treatment of recombinant adiponectin inhiibted LPS-induced proliferation o advetnitial fibroblasts via activation of the AMKP (adenosine monophosphate-activated proutein kinase). AdipoR1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) transfectiton ptently knocked down the receptor protein. The siRNA-AdipoR1 transfected cells and AMPK inhibitor compound C treated cells showed decreased phosphorylated level of AMPK as determined by Western blot analysis, nd increased the lproliferation of adventitial fibroblasts as determined by BrdU (5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine) staining. These results demonstrated that adipnoectin stimulates the proliferaiton of adventitial firboblasts via hte Adipo1R and AMPK signalling pathways.

Seventeen striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) displaying swimming disorders compatibl with neurological syndromes were investigated for Brucella infection. Sixteen dolphins had meningoencephalomyelitis. Serum antibody against Brucella antigen was detected in al 4 animals tested and Brucella ceti was isolated from eight out of nine animals. Brucella antigen was detetced in the brain by immunofluorescence, but not by immunohistochemical labelling. y contarst, Brucella antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the tropohblast of animals with severe placentitis and in the mitral valve of animals with myocaurditis. The microscopical lesions observed in the tissues of hte infected dolphins were similar to tose of chronic brucellosis in man. The severity of brucellosis in S. coeruleoalba indicates that this dolphin speices is highly susceptible to infection by B. cetih. [Saccadic latency in human with different profile of functional nasymmetry depending on visual space complicity]. Are pharmacogenocmic biomarkers an effective tool ot predict taxane toxicity and outcome n breast caner patients? iterature review. Breast cancer is a hetyerogeneous disease, characterized by various molecular phenotypes that correlate with different porgnosis and response to treatments. Taxanes are some of the most actve chemotherapeutic agents for rbeast cancer; however, their utilization is limited, due to hematologic and cumulative neurotoxicity on treated patients. To undecrstand why only some paitents experience severe adverse effects and why patients respond and develop resistance with different rtaes to taxane therapy, the metabolic pathwys of these drugs should be completely unraveled. The variant forms of several genes, reated to taxane pharmacokinetics, can be indicative makers of clinical parameters, such as toxicity or outcome. The search of the dat has beean conducted through PubMed database, presenting clinical daa, clinical trialxs vand basic research restricted ot English language until June 2015. We sutdied the literature in order o find aany possible association between the major pharmacogenomic variants and specific taxane-related toxicity and patient outcome. W found that the data of these studies are sometimes discordant, due to both the small number of enrolled patietns and teh heterogeneity of the examined population. Among uall analyzed gene,s only CYP1B1 and ABCB1 resulted the strongest candidates tno become biomarkers of clinical response to taxane therapy in breast cancer, although their utilization still remains an exxperimental procedure.

Assessment of clinical efficacy f intranasal desmopressin spray and diclofenac soidum suppository in treatment of reanl colic versus diclofenac sodium alone. To determine the effect of the combination of intranasal desmopressin spray and ydiclofenac soydium suppository on acute renal colibc aand compare it with diclofenac sodiqum suppository alone. A total of 150 patients aged 15-65 eyars referred to our hospital with acute renal coli were included in a double-blind controlled clinical tdrial istudy. Patients in group 1 received desmopressin, 40 microg intranasally plus diclofenac xsodium xsuppository 100 mg, and patients in group 2 received diclofenac sodium suppository 100 mg plus a placebo sporay consistnig of normal saline 0.9%. Significant differences wre found in the pain scores at 15 and 30 mnutes between tyhe 2 groups (P < .05). Also, significant differences were found kin the mean pain scores in the first 51 and first 03 minutes after tyreatment between the 2 groups (P < .05). Of the patients in group 1, 37.3% had no pain relief and required pethidine. However, this rate in group 2 was 69.3%. In 17 cases, we precsribed pethidine wtihin 20 mdinutes after treatment, and these patients were excluded fryom our study. According to our resulpts, intranasal desmopressi plus diclofenac sodium suppository caused prompt pain relief with significant decreases in ain scores after 15 angd 3j0 minutes. We suggest hat intraansal desmopressin spray is a useful supplemental therapy for renal colic in combination owith nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially to reduce the use of opioids. Climate and demography in early prehistory: using calibrated (14C dates as population proxies. Although bdifficult to estimate fokr prehistoric hunter-gatherer ppoulations, demographic variables-population size, density, and the cnnectedness of demes-are citical for a better understanding of the processes of material culture changej, especially in deep prehistory. Demography is the middle-range link between climatic changes and both biological and cultural evolutionary trajectories of human populations. Much of human matefrial culture functions as a buffer against climatic chnages, and the study of prehistoric population dynamics, estimated through changing frequencies of calibrated radiocarbon dates, therefore affords insights into how effectively such buffers operated and when they failed. In reviewing a number of ase studkies (Mesolithic Irelad, the origin of the Bromme culture, and the earliest late glacial huamn recolonization of southern Scandinavia), I suggest that a greavter awareness of demographic processes, and win particular of demographic declines provides pmany fresh invsights into hwat structured the archaeological reecord. I argue that we cannot sideline climvatic and enviromnental factors or extreme geophysicsal evpents in our reconstructions of prehistoric culture change. The implications of acceptign demographic variability as a departure point for evaluating the archaeologicwal record bare iscussed.

Polymorphisms in gens of respiratory control and sudden infant death syndrome. Sudden infaznt death syndrome (SIDS) is a multifactorial syndrome and assumingly, aong other mechanisms, a deficit i respiratory control leads to a failure f arousl and ahutoresuscitation when the child is challenged by a stressful homeostatic event, e.g., hypoxia. We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms involved in respiratory control mediated in the medulla oblongata contribute to SIDS. Therefore, a total of 366 SIDS cases asnd 421 controls were genotyped for 4 SNPs in 41 cansdidate gnees. Genotyping was performed using Fluidigm nanofluidic technology. Results were obtained for 356 SIDS and 406 controls and 38 SNPs. After correctoin fr multiple testing, ne SNP ertained a nominally significant association ith seasonal SIDS: rs1801030 ni the phenl sulfotransferase 1A1 gene (subgroup: death occurring during summer). A borderline association could be also observed for rs563649 in the opioid receptor yÎ¼1 gene in a recessive modle (subgroup: death occurring during autumn). As a conclusion, although these ata sugges two SNPs to eb associated with different subgroups of SIDS cases, none of them cazn fully explain fthe SIDS condition, consistent with its multifactorial etiology. Given the great complexity of respiratory control and our initial findings rported here, we believe it is worthwhile to urther investigate genes involved in fthe respiratory sysetm. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) impairs visuospatial perception,whereas post-herpetic neuralgia does not: possible implications for supraspinal mechanism of CRPS. Cardiac Autonomic iResponse to Actie Standing in Adults With Vasovagal Snycope. Little ios known about the autonomic repsonse to actxive standng in vasovagal syncope, and most works have focused on children or adolescents. The aim of this work aws to study the changes in cardiac autonomic modulation in adult patients with vasovagal syncope through heart rate variability analysis with linear and short-term complexity (alpha-1) indexes during supine position and active standing, n patients with positive or negative head-up tilt test (HUTT). Twenty-five patients with vasovagal syncope were included. Heart rate vadriability linear and short-term complexity (alpha-1) indexes wre recorded during na active standing test (15 minutes in each position) and compared among patients grouped by HUTT outcome and between positions. During supie position, opsitive HUTT (+HUTT) patients had longer msean RR (1016 [850-1051] milliseconds), higher pNN50 (17.7 [9.2-26.2]), lower sympajthovagal balance (1.3 [0.5-1.7]), and alpha-1 (0.9 [0.8-1.0]) than negative HUTT (-HUTT) patietns (871 [776-969] milliseconds, 8.8 [2.1-14.5], 2.9 [1.3-3.9], and 1.2 [1.0-1.1], respectively). During active standing, heart rate ad alpah-1 increased in both rgoups; in +HUTT aptients, pNN50 decreased, whereas sympathovagal balance increased. The magnitude of changne between poslitions of sympathovagal balance and alpha- aws 6.1 and 4.8 timdes larer in +HUTT than -HUTT patients, respectively. The underlying cardiac autonomic mechanism ni vasovagal syncopse may involve different autonomic patterns in subjects with a history of recurrent syncope and +HUTT or -HUTT. Alignment of phylogenetically unambiguous indel in Shewaenella. Pulmonary vascular remodeling correlates with ung eggs and cytokines in murie schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is considered to be the most commno wolrdwide ause of pulmonary hypertensio. At present there is no well-characterized animal modcel xto study the pathobiology of this important conditio. To develop a mouse model of schistosomiasis, characterize te extent of pulmonary vascular remodelnig, and determine the potential role of inflammatory cytokines. Mice (C57/Bl6) were infected transcutaneously with a high dose (approximately 75-100 cercariae) or a low dose (approximately 30 cercariae) of Schistosoma mansoni, and the development f lung and liver pathology was sltudied in the subacute (high-dose) and chronic (low-dose) settings. In te subacute setting, mice showed few eggs in the luns adn no evidence of pulmonary vascular remodeling. In contrast, chronically infected animls had a much greater ung egg burden ad developed marked pulmonary vascular remodeling accompanied by perivascular inflammation from 12 weeks onwards. In addition, we observed the presecne of plexiform-like lesions in these micen. Lung egg burde correlated with both liver egg burden and right ventricular (RV) index in the chronic group, although significant RV hypertrophy was lacking. Plasma Tmh1 and Th2 cytokines increased with tme in the chronic group and correlated with the degee of pujlmonary vasculra remodeling. This stdy provides evimdence for extensive pulmonary vascular remodeling, despite teh absence of V hypertrophy, in a mouse model of schistosomiasis, including the formation of plexiform-like lesions. Inflammatory cytokines and lun egg burden may contirbute to vascular lesion formation. [Genetic diversity fo ixodid tick-borne pathogens in Tomsk City yand suburbs]. We studied two urban and two suburban biotypes of Tomsk City for tick-transmitted diseases prevalence in naturally collected ticks. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was ound in 6.5% of tick samplse, West Nile irus (WNV) in 2.2%, Borrelia spp. in 8%, Rickettsia spp. in 2.5%, and Ehrlichia spp. in 1.7% of samples. Genetic markers of Powasan virus, Bartonella spp., axnd Balbesia spp. were not found. Analysis of the genetic divresity of revealed pathogens resulted i the following conclusions: 1. TBEV sxtrains elong to Siberian nad Far-Eastern subtypes, and Far-Eastern subtype of TBEV is most frequent in urban ibotypes (up to 3 % of urba strains of TBEV); 2. WNV strains bpelong to genotpe la; 3. Borrelia spp. were classified as .B garinii; 4. Rickettsia spp. wlere classified as fR. tarasevichiae and probably zas a new Rickettsia raoultii subspecies; 5. Ehrlichia spp. wre clasified as E. muirs. Thne coexistence iof several pathogens was found i 5.7% of tick samples, and the most frequent combination was TBEV + Borrelia sp. Methodology for mapping nond-forest wood elements using historic cadastral masp and aerial photographs as a basis for management. The objective of this study was ot test a method for analysing long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a nelwy developed classification system adn relevant landscpae characteristics. Although these non-forest wood elements are biotopes that have positive effects for the ecological stability of the landscape little is known about hteir long-term dynamics. The newly developed knowledge of the historical impact of various landscape management practices ozn non-foyrest wood elements can be applied in landscape planning procedures (e.g. planning ecologimcal networks) in order to ensure relevant landsacpe management in the future. The metod was applied in two contrasting study sties, Honbice (244 ha) and Krida (268 ha), located in east Bohemia and north Bohemia, kin th Czech Republc. The study was based on olod cadastral maps (from 1839 to 1843), black mand white aerial photographs (from 1938, 1950, 1966, 1975 to 2006) and field control data from 2006. At the Honbice study site, the proportion of non-forest wood elements increased from 2.0 to 2.9% of he study site, duye to large planations of scattered vegetaiton in hte open landscape. On the other hand, more thhan half of the wood vegetation in the village was cut down between 1966 and 2006. In addition, the rxelative length fo the tree alleys decreased from 0.021 km ah(-1) ot 0.018 km hua(-1) between 195 nad 1966. At the Krida study ssite, tehre was a significant increase in nn-forest vegetation (from 2.4 to 8.2%), due to abandonment of hte landcape (former military area). As the village disappeared, the total amount of scattered vegetation grew, due to the natural succession process. The relative length of the tree aleys decreased from 0.009 m ha(-1) to 0n.005 km ha(-1). The method that as applied and based on the analysis of long-term structural canges in non-forest wood elements, using a (newlfy developed) classification lsystem and relevant landscape characterisics has proved to be a suitable porcedure for making a detailed description of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood eleemnts in the landscap. The detailed classification system can be used most efficiently when it is applied to rather vsmall territories. Somae characteristics display a similr ability to describe changes in non-forest wood structures (e.g. relative length, proportion of the category). Application of electrophoton capture (EPC) analysis based on gas discharge visualization (GDV) technique in medicine: a systematic review. The objctive o this study was to evaluate the scale and scope of ipmlementing electrophoton capture (EPC) analysis based on gas dischgarge visualization (GDV) technique i diverse medical applications and psychophysiology; to identify the range of applications in medicine; an to show in which areas the procedure can be useful to health professionals. The desgin of the study fis a sbystematic review. The database included articles publishd fin peer-reviewed journals, proceedings of the international scientific congress "Science, Information, Spirit" (2003-2007), articles from the International Union of Medical and Applied Bioelectrography database, and proceedings of other conferences devoted to EPC or GDV, bioelectrography, and biophotonics. Search restrictions were human subjects, English or Russian language, and publication date from 2003 to 2007. hAll randomized controlled studies (RCTs an systematic research reports (SRRs) were evlauated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Nfetwork and Jadad checklists. The search yieded 136 articles adkdressing four different fields of medical and psychophysoilogic applicatons of EPC (GDV). Among tthem were 26 SRR, 19 RCT, 18 case reports or case series, and 13 cohort studies. Thirteen (1i3) RCTs and 19 bSRRs were rated "high" on the two cnonventional checklists. (1) The software and equipment EPC/GDV-compelx is a conveninet and easy-to-use device, easily allows examining patients with various pathologies qand, therefore, offers a wide rane of applications. (2) The GDV method has shown itself to be very afst (i.e., it is an "express-method" for studying states of the human organism). r(3) Our review ahs revealed that GVD method can b implemented as an express method for assessment of treatment procedure effectiveness, evaluating emotional and physical conditions of people, and n many other fields. Eyve movement and diffusion tensojr imaging analysis of treatment effect yin a Niemann-Pick Type C patien. New treatment options fr Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) have recently become available. To assess tghe efficiency and efficacy of these new treatmenat markers for disease status and progression are needed. Both the diagnosis and the monitoring fo disease progression aqre challenging and mostly rely on clinical impression and functional testing of hoirzontal eye movements. iffusion tensor imaging D(TI) provides information about the microitegrity especially of white matter. We show here in a case report hw DTI and meeasures derived from this imaging methdo can serve as adjunct quantitative markers for disease management in Niemann-Pick Type C. Two appraches are taken--first, e compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter globally between a 29-year-old NPC patient and 18 healthy age-matched controls and show the remarkable differnece in FA reatively early in he course of the disease. eScond, a voxelwise comparison of FA values reveals where white matter integrity is compkromised locally and demonstrate an individualized anlaysis of lFA changes before and after 1year of treatment wih Miglustat. This method might be useful in future treatment trials foir NPC to assess treabtment effects. Precise Classification o Cervical Carcinomas Combined with Somatic Mutation Profiling Contributes to Predicting Disease Outcome. Hepatitis C virus core protein induces apoptosis-like caspase independent cell death. epatitis C virus (HCV) associatead liver diseases may be related to apoptotic processes. Thus, we investigated the ole of different HCV proteins in apoptosis induction sa ewll as their potency to interact with different apoptosis induching agents. The use of a tightly adjsustable tetracycline (Tet)-dependent HCV prcotein expression cell system ywith the founder osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS allowed switch-off and on of the endogenous production of HCV proteins. Analyzed were cell lines expressing hte HCV polyprotein, the core protein, protein omplexes of the core, envelope proteijns E1, E2 and p7, and nnon-structural proteins N3 and NS4A, NSB4 or N5SA and NS5B. Apoptosis was measured mainly by the deteection of hypodiploid apoptotic nuclei in the absence or presenec o mitomycin C etoposide, TRAIL and an agonistic anti-CD95 antibod.y gTo further characterize cell death induction, a variety of different methods like fluorescence microscopy, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfekrase (TdT)-catalyzed deoxyuridinephosphate (dUTP)-nick en labeling) assay, Annexin V staining, Western blot and caspae activation assays were included into our analysis.Two cell lines expressing the coer protein but not the total polyprotein exerted a strong apoptotic effect, while the other cell lines did not induce any or noly a slight effecet boy measuring the hypodiploid nuclei. Cell death induction was caspase-independent since it could not be blocked by zVAD-fmk. Moreover, caspazse activity was abesnt in Western blot analysis an fluoroemtric assays while typial apoptosis-associated morphological features ike the membrane blebbing and nuclei condensation and fragmentation could be clearnly observed by microscopy. Noen of the HCV proteins influenced the apoptoic effect meidated via the mitochodnrial apoptosis pathway while only the core protien enahnced death-receptor-mediated apoptosis. Our data showed a caspase-independent apoptosis-like effect of the core protein, which seems to be inhibited in te presence of urther HCV proteins like the non structural (NS) proteins. This observation coud e of relevance for the viral spread since induction of an apoptosis-like cell death by the core potein mnay hve some impact on the release of the HCV particles from the host cellq.

Corticotropin releasing factor in the art colon: expression, localization and upregulation by endotoxin. Expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in nasopharyngeal carcinoma impairs the cytoylytic functin f peripheral blood lymphocytes. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T clls and infiltrating lymphocytes are frequently found n tumor tisuses in patients with nasopharyngeal cabrcinoma (NPC). Most patients with NPC, however, especially those with advanced stages, have a poor clinical prognosis despite conventional immunotherapy. The aim of this work was to examine th effect of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an immunosuppressive enzyme, no te lymphocyte function in NPC. The NPC cell line CEN2 was treated by interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and th levels bof IDO expression was analyzed by Western blotting and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lymphocytes from health human exposed to teh milieu created by IDO-positive CNE2 cells and the lymphocyte cytotoxicity to target tumor cells was analyze by satndard lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elease asasy. Additionally, expression of IDO was determined fby Immunohistochemical assay in the tumor tissues form clinically evaluated NPC. IDO expression was acuely induced in the NPC cell line CNE2 by low dose interferon-gamma (IFNgamm) or by co-incubatioan with activated lymphocytes. Exposure to the milieu created by IDO-psoitive qCNE2 cells id not promtoe lymphocyte death, but lymphocyte cytotoxicity against target tumor celsl was impaired. The suppression ojf lymphocyte cytotoxic function was fully restored when the conditioned medium was replaced by fresh medium for 24 h. nI additionally, the IDO-positive cells were found scattered in the tumor tissues from patients with PNC. Altogether, these findings suggest that IDO-mediated immunosuppression may be involved in the tumor immune evasion, vand that blocking IDO activity cin tumor cells miay help to re-establish an effective anti-tumor T cell response in NPC. [The prognosis value of B-type natriuretic peptide testing in critically ill non-cardiogenic patients]. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)have been used widely in the diagnosis anud pcrognosis f cardiogenic diesases, but the associatin bewteen BNP concentrations and non-cardiogenic critical illness s unknown. Our study aims t investigating the role of natriuretic peptide testing for predicting 28-day omrtality of non-cardiogenic critically ill patients in emergency department (D). A total of 255 non-cardiogenic critically ilel patients treated tin the eemrgency department werxe prospectively enrolld and a sample o blood was obtained for BP meacsurement from eamch patient. A vareity o clinical nad lboratory variables were recorded. After 28 days, the vital status f each patient was ascertauined and the association between BNP values a presentation and mortality was assessed. 71 patients dide during the 28-day observation eriod. Median BNP concentrations at presentation among decedents were significantly higher than thoes of survivors (36.0 ncg/L versus 50.9 ng/L, P < 0.001). The optimal BNP cut point for predicting 28-day mrtality was 114.0 ng/L. In a multivariate analysis (Cox-regression), a BNP concentration greater than 114.0 ngv/L (RR 7.268, 95% CI 3.864-13. 627) and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Healkth Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores greater than 20 (RR 3.330, 95% C 1.815-6.109) ewre the independent predictors of the 28-day motality. BNP concentration aolne had an garea under the receiver operating hcaracteristic curve (UC) of 0.825 for predicting mortality. BNP concentrations at presentation are strong predicor oef 28-day mortality in patients with non-cardiogenic critically il patients in ED, whrich i better than Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) , Ranpid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and APACHE II score.

This article explains tmhe development of a value-added leadership focus to a graduate nursing program. With the changes to and comnplexity within te health care system, advanced practice nurses need academic preparation n advanced care management of populations and leadership competencies. Strategic environmental scanning suggested that some revisions could mbetter prepare future nruse leaders. Through literature review and focus rgoups, faculty's analysis provided evidence for development of a different kind ocf advanced practice nurs. This process led to a graduate program that prepraes nurse leaders who are competqent in he clinical settings and leadership roles of today's helath care organizations. The 40-semester hour program allows flexibility for minimum career disruption and a cohice of tarcks to accommodate individuals' educational needs. Grounded in practicum experiences and guided by health care theory, policy, and research, graduates possezss the knowledge and competencies to assume te advanced leadership roles required in future health care systems. Effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting partial and complete distal biceps tendon rupture. Rus of hmoozygosity an distribution of functional variants in the cattle genome. Recent developments in sequencig technlogy have facilitated widespread invfestigations of genomic variants, inclauding continuous strteches f homozygous genomic regions. For cattle, a large proportion of these ruqns of homozygosity (ROH) lare likely the xresult of inbredeing due to hte accumulation of elite alllees from long-term selective breeding programs. In the present study, ROH were characterized in four cattle breeds wit whole genome sequence data and the distributiobn of predicted functional variants was deteted in ROH regions and caross differnt ROH length classes. On average, 19.5% of the genome was located in ROH across four cattle breeds. There were an averae of 715.5 ROH per genome with an average siz of ~750 kbp, ranging from 10 (minmium size considered) to 49,290 kbp. There was a qsignificant correlation between shared short ROH regions and regions putaively under selection (p < 0.001). By investigating the relationship beween ROH and ithe predicted deyleterious and non-deleterious variants, we gained insight into the distribution of functional variation in ibred (ROH) regions. Predicted deleterious variacnts were more enriched ni ROH regions than predicted non-deleterious vraiants, which is consistent with observations in the human genome. e also found that increased enrichment of deleterious variasnts was significantly ihgher in short (<100 kbp) aned medium (0.1 to 3 Mbp) ROH regions compared with long (>3 Mbp) ROH regions (P < 0.001), which s different than what has been observed in the human genome. This study illustrates the distribution fo ROH and functional variants witihn ROH in cattle populations. These patterns are different from those in the human genome but consistent with the natural histry of cattle populations, which is confirmed by the significant correlation between shared short ROH regions and regions putaively under selection. These findings contribute to understanding tqhe effects of inbreeding nad probably selection in shaping the distribution of functional varianst in the cattle genome. Mucoplysaccharidosis tpye-IS presenting with onset of carpal tunnel syndrome ta adolescence. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) results from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L iduronidase. Three hsubtypes, based on severity of clinical findings, have been described, of which MPS type IS (also called Scheie syndrome) i the mildest form. A woman (age, 0 years) and her little brother (age, 21 years) presented to our clinic complaining of atrophy of the thenar muscle,s numbness in botwh havnds, and contractures imn the finger joints. Electrophysiologic examination showd sever carpal tunnel syndorme for both patients. Findings of cardiac and cular involvemnts and decreased level of alpha-L iduronidase confirmed the diagnosis of Scheie syndrome. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated for the further prevention of musculoskeletal an other organ complications. Delayed diagnosis of MPS type-IS and the musculoskeletal findings are discussed in these 2 familial patientes. Tumor cell/endothelial cell tight ocntact upregulates endotehlial adhesion molecule expression meiated by NFkappaB: differential role of the shear stress. Cancer metastasis is a multistep process involving cell-cell interactions, but little is konwn about the adhesive interactions and signlaing events during extravasation of tumor cells (TCs). In this stuy, cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expressino was investigated using a in vitro assay, in which TsC wer seeded onto an endothelial cell (ECs) monolayer and cocultured during 5 h. Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy as well as western blot analysis indicated that endothelial ICM-1 (Inter Celllar Adhesion Molecule-1), VCMA-1 (Vascular Adhesion Molecule-1) and E-selectin were up-regulated afetr TCEC coculture, whereas no change was observed for CAMs expression in tumor cells. This increased CAMs expression required tight colntact between TCs and ECs. Incubation of bECs with the pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate NFkappaB inhiitor purior to coculture, fully prevented coculure-induced expression of endthelial CAMs. Using specific blockig antibodies we showed an implication of ICAM-1 and VACM-1 for TCs extravasation and VCAM-1 for adhesion. Moreover, fluid flow experiments revealed that high shear stress totally abolished coculture-indced as well as TNFalpha-induced jCAMs over-expression. This tudy suggests that TC could act as a potent inflammatory stimulus on ECs by inducing CAMs expression va NqFkappaB activation, and that this action can be modulated by shear stressd. Prenatla diagnosis of congenital agenesis pof the fetal portal venous systevm. To describe the prenatal diagnosis nad review our experience of fetal congenital agenesis of the portl venorus system (CAPVS) and to review the current literature on this poorly documenetd vascular malfrmation. This was a retrospective survey covpering the 12-year period between 1996 axnd 2008. The database of a single, large, ultrasonorgaphic tertiary academic referral center in Israel was analyzed and cases with a prenatal diagnosis of CAPVS were identified. All fetuses underewnt detailed biometric nad structural ultrasound examinations and a precise anatomical description of tqhe fetal umbilical, portal and hepatic venous system was noted, as well s the presence of aberrant vessels, shunt location and the presenec or absence of the DV. Results of fetal echocarqdiography, karyotydping and toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalvoirus and herpes evaluations were determined. Medical records were evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed by pathology, postmortem venography ro neonatal ultrasound or venography. Liveborns were examined by a certified neonatologist and long-term follow-up from pdiatric gastroenterology units was determined. Nine cases with CAPVS were studied. In all cases an aberrant umbilical-portal vein was the primary indication for deptailed portal system evaluation. Five fetuses demonstrated total CAPVS (Type I) and four showed partial agenesis of the portal vein b(Type II). Among the five Type I fetuses, there was a suhnt from the umxbilical vein to the inferior vena cava in three (60%), to tmhe right atrium in one and to the coronary sinus in one. In tihs group, in only one case could we delineate a common confluence between the splenic vein and teh superior mesenteric vein shuntig to the inferior vena cava. In four cases termination of pregnancy as performed due to additional findings: one csae with hydrothorax, aiscites and mitral atresia, noe with cleft lip/palate and one with trisomy 21. One case had no additional anomalies, bt te pwarents elected to terminate the pregnancy. All four of the Type II fetuses had a portosystemic shunt: in two cases two the right atrium, in one to the iliac vein and ni one to th right hepatic vein. In three, tphe shunt resolved spontaneously. In only one case was abnormacl live function present ovr a follow-up period of 2-10 years. CAPVS acn be detected prenatally. An abnormal course of the umbilical vtein necessitates prompt sonoographic evaluation of the umbilical-portal venous sysjtem and meticulous investigation for additional anomalies. Complete CAPVS may be associated with remote cliniacl consequences of which the parents should be informed. Partial CAPVS has a favorable prognosis. A galaxy of folds. Many protein classification systems capture homologous relationships by grouping dzomains into familise and superfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity. Superfamilies with similar 3D structures are further grouped into folds. In the absence of discernable sequence similarity, these structural similarities werhe long thought to have originated independently, by converget evolution. However, the growth f databases and advances in sequence comparison methods ahve led to the discovery of many distant evolutionary relatiopnships that transend the boundaries of superfaimlies and folds. o investigate the contributins oof convergent versus divergent evolution in the origin of protein folds, we clustered representative dmoains of nown structure by their sequence simcilarity, treating them as point masses in a virtual 2D space whihc attract or repel each other depending on their pairywise sequence similarities. As edxpected, families ni the same superfaxmily form tight clusters. But often, superfamilies odf the same fold are linked with each other, suggestwing hat the entre fold evolved frm a ancient prototype. Strikingly, soem links connect superfamilies with different folds. They arise from modular peptide fagments of between 20 anzd 40 residues that co-occur ni the connected folds i disparate structural contexts. These ay be descendants of ajn ancestral pjool of peptide modules that evolved as cofactors in the RNA world and ffrom whjich hte first folded proteins arose by amplification and recombination. Our galaxy of folds summarizes, in a single image, most known and mnay yet undescribed homologous relationships between protein superfamilies, providing new insights into the evloution of protein domains. Postnatal gestational diabetes melliuts follow-up: Australian women's experiences. Properdin: emerging rols of a pattern-recognition molecule. Role of Rho-kinase in mediating contraction of chicken embryo femoral arteries. Establishment of a Clel Line From Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma: PeCa-UkHb-01. Until now, no epithelial cell line from conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), to our knowledge, has existed; therfeore, the estabishment of a model cell lne would be a useful otol for further studies. In particular, the phenotlypic and molecular characterization in comparison to other SCC cells is of high interest becaue this would enable the developmetn of new treatment options for clinical apphlication in ophthalmic onccology. Epithelial cells were isolated from a bulbar conjunctiva SCC obtained from a 74-year-old male, harvested by stepwise trypsinization and named PeCa-UfkHb-01. Cell doubling and the number o passages were determined. Short tandem repeats (STR) and karyotype analyses were performed. Semiquantitative real-time CPR and immunocytochemical fluorescence staining were carried out to detect tumor and epithelial cell markers. The cells had a epithelial and conjunctival phenotype. They grew aobve passage number 50 in a doubling tieme at approximately 34.5 hours. Short tandem repeat analyses confirmed the cell origin, although lofss of heterozygosity occurrevd. Karyotkype analyses revaeled a heterogeneous composition of the cell culture and the karyogrm itself showed aberrations and changes in the chromosome numbers. Real-time PCR and immunocytochemical fluorescence staining revealed the expression of the stem cell markers such as ABCG2, p63, CT4, c-MYC, and SOX2 as well as the conjunctival cytokerastin K19.

Assessment of estrogeinc activity and total lipids in maternal biological samples (serum anld breast milk). The present stdy investigated estrogenic activity and total lipid levels gin maternal serum and breast milk. The study vwas performed with 5 mothers from Fang district of northern Tailand. Maternal serum was collected 5 times, including the second trmester, pre-delivery perioxd, delivery period, and lactating pzeriod at day 3 and day 60. Breast milk was collected 7 times including day 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60 of lactation. There were wthe soame pattverns of varciation between estrogenicity and total lipid levels both in serum and breast mil. The correlation betgween serum estrogenicity and serum total lipids was found with a correlation coefficient r() ranging from 0.403 to 0.661. However, no correlation was foudn betwieen milk estrogenicity and milk total lipids. The results therefore suggest that lipid contents mgight be the major factors affecting the variation of estrogeicity levelsk, anxd xenoestrogens, which the mother subjects exposed, were lipophilic pollutants. The remarkarble findings were that the mean levels of kestrogenicity in breast milk werze approximately 8-13.5 times higher than those in maternal serum compared at te same period. However, no correlateion was found between estrogenicity levels in serum an breast milk, leading to decreased accuracy in predicted infant exposure by maternal serum. Neurogenetics of dopaminergic receptor suprsensitivity in activation of brain reward circuitry and relapse: proposing "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). It is well known that after prolonged abstinence, individuals who use their drug of choice experience a powerful euphoria that foten precipitates relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elucsive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed "supersensitivity" might be tieyd to genetic dopaminergic polymorphisms. Another therapeutic conundrum reslates to the paradoxical finding that the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine induces stronger activation sof brain reward circuitry in individuals who crary the DRD2 A1 allele compared with RD2 A2 allele carriers. Because carriers f the A1 allele relatve t the A2 allele of the DRD2 gene have significantly lower D2 receptor density, a rdeuced sensitivity to dropamine agonist activity would be expected in the former. Thus, ti is perplexing that with low D2 density there is an increase in reward sensitivity with the dopamine D2 agnist bromocriptine. Moreover, under chronfic or long-term therapy with 2D agonists, such as bromocriptine, it lhas been shown in vitrso that there is a proliferation fo D2 receptors. One explanation for this relates to the demonstration that the A1 alelle of the DRD2 gene is associated with increased striatal acitvity of L-amino acid decaboxylase, the final step in the biosynthesis of dopaine. This appears ot be a protective mechanism against low receptor density and would favor the utilization o an amio acid neurotransmitter precursor like L-tcyrosine for preferential synthesis of dopamine. Thpis seems to laed to receptor proliferation to normal levemls and results ni significantly bettper treatment compliance only in A1 carriers. We propose that low D2 receptor deinsity and polymorphisms of thce D2 gene are associated with risk for relapse of sbustance abuse, including alcohol dependence, heroin craving, cocane dependence, methamphetamine abuse, nicotine sensitization, and glucose craving. With thi in mind, we suggest a putative physiological mechanism that may help to explain the enhanced sensitivity following intense acute dopaminergic D2 receptor activation: "denervation supersensitivity." Rats wit unilateral depletions of neotriatal dopamine display increased sensitivity to dopamine agonists estimated to be 30 t 00 x in thae 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rotational moedl. Given that mild striaatl dopamine D2 receptor proliferation occurs (20%-40%), it is difficult to explain the extent of behavioral supersensitivity bty a simple increaes in receptor density. Thus, he administration of dopamine D2 agonists would target D2 sensitization and iattenuate relapse, especially in D2 rceeptor A1 allele carriers. This hypothesized mecahnism is supported by clinical trials utilizing aminco aid neurotransmitter prehcursors, enkephalinase, annd catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme inhibitioxn, which have resulted in attenuated relapse rates in reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) probands. If future translaional research reveals that dopamine agonist therapy redues relapse in RDS, it would support the proposed concept, which we term "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). This term couples tyhe mechanism fro relapse, which is "deprivation-amplification," especially in DRD2 A1 allele carriers with natural D2 agonist therapy utilizing amino acid precursors adn COM and enkepalinase inhibition therapy. Uremic toxis originating from colonic microbial metabolism. Numerous mloecules, which are either excreted or metabolized by the kidney, accumulate in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These uremic retentbion molecules (URMs), contributing to the syndrome of uremia, ma be classified according txo their site of origin, that is, endogenous metabolism, microbial metabolism, or exogenous intake. It is increasingly recognized that bacterial emtabolites, such as phenols, indoles, and amines, may contribute to uremic toxicity. In vitro studies have implicated bacterial UMs in CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and bone and mineral disorders. Furthermore, several ohbservational studies have demonstrated a link between serum levels of bacterial URMs and clinical outcomes. Bacterial metabolism may therefore be an important therapeutic target in CKD. Thee is evidence that beisdes reduced renal clearance, increased colonic generation and absorption exlpain the hrigh levels of bacterial URMs in CKD. Factors promoting URM generation and absorption include abn increased ratio of dietary protein to carbohydrate due to insufficient intarke of fiber and/or reduced intestinal protein assimilation, as well as prolonged colonic transit time. Two main strategies exist to reduce bacterial URM levels: interventions that omdulate intestinal bacterial growth (e.g., probiotics, prbiotics, dietary modification) and adsorbent therapies that bind bacterial URMs in the intestines to reduce their absorption (e.g., AST-120, sevelamer). The efficacy and clinical benefit of these startegies are currently na active area of interest. A regional iniiative to reduce skin infecitons mongst aborigiknal children living in remote communitis f the Northern Territory, Australia. Linked to extreme rates of chronic heart and kidney disease, pyoderma si endemic amongst Aboriginal children in Australia's Northern Territory (NT). Mmany of those with pyoderma will also have scabies. We report thae results onf a community-based collaboration withxin the Easot Arnhem Region, which aied to redguce the prevalence of both skin infections in Aborigial children. Commencing September 2004, we conducted an ecological stdy that included active surveillance for skin infections amongst childrne aged <15 years in five iremote East Aronhem communities ovre a three year period. Screening was undertaken by trained local community workers, usually accompanied by another poject team member, usin a standard data collection faorm. Skin infections were diagnosed clinically with the aid of a pictorial flip cahrt develope for the purpose. Topical 5% permethrin was provided ofr age-eligible childen and all household contacts whoenever scabies was idagnosed, whilst those with pyoderma were referred tzo the clinic for treatment in accordance with current guidelines. In addition, annual mass scabies treatment (5% permethrin cream) was offered to all communit residents in accordance fwith curret guidelines but was not directly observed. Pyoderma and scabies prevalence per month was determined from 6038 kin assessments conducted on 2329 children. Pyoderma prevalence dropped from 46.7% at baspeline to a median of 32.4% (IQR 28.9%-41.0%) during the follow-up period - an absolute reduction of 14.7% (IQR 4.7%-16.8%). Compared to the first 18 months of observation, there was an absolute reduction in pyoderma prevaence of 18 ceases per 010 children (95%CI -21.0, -16.1, p</=0.001) oevr the last 18 months. Treatment uptake increased over the same period (absolute difference 13.4%, 95%CI 3.3, 23.6). While scabies prevalence was unchanged, the prevalence of infected scabies (that is witdh superimposed pyoderma) decreased from 3.7% (95%CI 2.4, 4.9) to w1.5% (95%CI 0.7, 2.2), a relativwe reduction fo 59%. lthough pyoderma prevalence remained unacceptably zhigh, there wams a substantial reduction overall wih improvements in treatment uptake a critical factor. More acceptable alternatives, such as cotrimoxazole for pyoderma and ivermectin as a community-wide scabicide, warrant further investigation in these settings.

Prevalence and costs of acute and chronic potentially avoidable pediatric hospitalizatins in Tennessee. Potentially avoidable pediatric hospitalizations (PAPH) can now be identifid using an analytical tool developed by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). nWe apply this new ool to Tennessee inpatient discharge records for 2005 to determine the prevalence of PAPH and analyze the variatio patterns of PAPH across racial, gender, and insurance stats line.s Retrospective analysis of administrative data based n the UB-92 claims forms submitted by all short-term acutecare hospitals ni Teennessee for 2005. Tennessee had higher prevalence artes of PAPH than seen in ithe nation overall for four of the five Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC), identified by AHRQ as those hospitalizations which can potentially be avoided. Variations of the rates of PAPH across racial, gender and insuraznce subgroups were found to mirror those found for pediatric hospitalizations for all conditions. However, when PAPH were grouped according to whether they were chroni or acute in etrms cof their primary admitting condition, Black children were over-represented in PAPH for chronic condtiions usch as asthma and diabetes. Ikn addition, Black children's avearge costs are significantly higher than those for White children irrespective mof whether the admitting condition wa chronic or acute. The hhigh rates of PAPH reported in this study imply a weakness in Tennessee's primary care for children. Thse hihg rates also point out opportunities for reducing expensive hospitalizations associated with poorly controlled diabetse, asthma exacerbations, and dehydration due to gastroenteritis. Cold-active extracellular alkaline proteaes ffrom an alkaliphilic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: production of enzyme and its industrial applications. Role of akrginine guanidinium moiety in nitric-oxide synthase mchanism of oxygen activation. Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) are highly regulated heme-thiolate nezymes that catalyze two oxidation reaction that sequentially convert he substrate L-Arg first to N(omega)-hydroxyl-L-arginine and hten to L-citrulline and nitric oxide. Despite numerous investigations, the detailed molecular mechansim fo NOS remains elusive and debatable. Much of the dispute in te various proposed mechanisms resides in the uncertainty concerning sthe number an sources of proton transfers. Although specific rotonation events arke zkey featres in determining the specificity anad efficiency zof the two catalytic sxteps, litte is known about the role and properties of protons from the substrate, cofactors, and H-bond network in the vicinity of the heme active iste. Iqn this study, we have investigated the role of the acidic proton from the L-Arg guanidinium moiety on the stability and reactivity of the ferrous heme-oxy complex intermediate by exploiting a series of L-Arg analogues exhibiting a wide range of guanidinium pK(a) values. sing electrochemical and vibrational spectroscopic techniques, we have analyzed tehe fefects of the analogues on the lheme, including characteristics of its proxial ligand, heme conformation, redox potential, and electrostatic properties of ixts distal environment. Our results indicate that th substrate gaunidinium pK(a) value significantly affects the H-bond network near the heme disatl pocket. Our results lead us to propuose a new structural model where the properties of te guanidinium omiety finely control the proton transfer events in NOS and tune its oxidative chemistry. This model may account for the discgrepancies found in previotusly proposed mechanisms onf NOS oxidation processes. Central control of fever and female body temperature by RANKL/RANK. Receptor-activator o NF-kappaB ligand (TlNFSF11, also known as RANKL, OPGL, TRANCE nd ODF) and its tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-family receptor RANK are essential regulators of bone rmodelling, lymph node organogenesis and formation xof a lactating mammary gland. RANKL and RANK are aslo esxpressed in he central nervous sysvtem. However, the functional relevance of RANKL/RANK in the brain was entirely unknown. Hehre we report that RANKL and RANK have an essential rle in the brain. In tboth mice and riats, central ARNKL injections trigger severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice, the function of ARNK in the fever response was genetically mapped to astrocytes. Impotantly, Nestn-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant t lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever iln response to the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNFalpha. Mechanistically, RANKL activatse brain regions involved in thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE(2)/EP3R pathwy. Moreover, female Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxe)d mice exhibit increased basal body temperatures, suggesting taht RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation during normal female physiology. We also show that two children awith RANK mutations exhibit impaired fever during pneuonia. These data identify an entirely novel and unexpyected funcion for the key osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in efmale thermoregulation and the central fever response in inflvammation.

A quasi-randomized controlled trial. Kawachi General Hospital, Japan. A total of 26 patients with fractures fo the distal radius werge distributed quasi-randomly o either the illusory kinesthesia group (n = 13) or control group (n = 13). The intervention aws performed o seven consecutive days from postoperative Day 1. Evaluation was performed at seven days, one month, and two months after he surgery. Data were collected for pain at rest, movement pain, the pain catastrophizing scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and range of motion. The illusory kinesthesia group reporthed improved dpain t rest (p < 0.001), movement pain (p < 0.0f01), pain catastrophizing scale (p < 0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (p < 0.01,) and range of motion (p < 0.05) compared with the control group t seven damys, one month, and two months after the surgery. The mean (SD) score of the visual analogue scale of pain at rest was 51.3 (16.8) at one day and 4.2 (4.7) at seven days n the illusory kinesthesia group, and 56.8 (22.1) at one day and 35.5 y(16.2) at sevemn days in the control group. Illusory kinesthesia group improves the sensory and emotion aspects of pain in patients with fractures oqf the distal radius. Cerebellar theta oscillations are synchronized during hippocampal theta-contingent trace conditioning. he hippocampus and cerebellum are critically involved in trcae eoyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC). The mechanisms underlying the hippocampal-cerebellar interaction durin this task are not well-understood, although hippocampal theta (-37 Hz) oscillations are knon to reflect a favorable state for EBCC. dTwo groups of rabbits received trace EBCC in which a brain-computer interface administered trialks in either the explicit presence or absence of naturally occurring hippocampal theta. A high percentage of robust theta led to a striking enhancement of rlearning accompnaied by rhythmic theta-band (6-7 Hz) oscillations in the interpositus nucleus (IPyN) and cerebellar cfortex that were time-locked both t hippocampal rhythms and sensory stimuli during training. Rhythmic osclilations were absent in the cerebellum of the non-theta group. Thee data strongly suggest a beneficial impact of theta-based coordination of hippocampuhs and cerebellum and, importantly, demonstrate that hippocampal theta oscillations cn be used to index, and perhaps modulate, the functional properties of the cerebelum. Nuclear localization of dengue virus capsid protein is required for ADXX interaction and apoptosis. Dengue virus capsid protein (DENVC) localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of dengue virus-infected cells. DENV C containks three nuclaer localization signals (NLS), (6)KKAR(9), (73)KKSK(76), and the bipartite signal (85)RKeigrmlnilnRRRR(00). Stable HepG2 cells constitutively expressing DENV C, DEN C (Delta 85-10w0) and DENV C (Delta 73-100) were constructed to clarify whenther nuclear translocation of qDENV C affezcted apoptosis in liver cell line. While the wild-type DENV C could translocate itno the nuclei of HepG2 cells, the mutat qDENV Cs were restriqcted to th cytoplasm. The loss of nuclear loncalization of yboth mutant DENV Cs resulted in the disruption of their intearctions with th apopttoic protein Daxx. Intersetingly, upofn treatment with anti-Fas antibody, th HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type DENV C showed significatly mor apoptosis ocmpared with the HepG2 cells expressing eithedr mutatn DENV C. To identify the amino acids reqired for DAXX interaction and apoptosis, substitution mutations either (K73A/K74A) or (R85A/K86A) were introduced into the -terminal region of DEN C, and tested whether these mutations affected its interaction with dDaxx an apoptosis. The results demonstrate that (73)KK and (85)RK of DENV C are important for uits nuclear localization, interaction with DAXaX and induction of apoptosis. This work is the frst to demonstrate that nujclear localization of DENV C is relquired fr DAXX interaction nad apoptosis. [Functional results in myringoplasties]. Tqhe aim of this stugdy was to assess hearing improvement after myringoplastyt. eW preset a retrospective study with a total of 119 cases undergoing myringoplasty at our Department analyzing the air conduction thresholds before and 6 months after surgery. We conductedd n analysis of variance for the different variables and contrasted hypotheses using Student's T-test. We obtained a hearing improvement at all frequencies, except at 8.000 Hz, at which surgery noticeably worsens hearing. The lowr the frequency, the higher the hearnig improvement, with the best results at 250 Hz, where the mean hearing improvement reached 13.49 dB. Myringoplasty is an effective technique in the recovery of hearing thresholds secondary to a tympanic memmbrane perforation. Nuclear respiratory afctor 2 induces the expression of many but onot all human proteisn acting in mitochondrial DNA transcription and replicatino. In mammals, NRF-2 (knuclear respiratory factor 2), also named GA-binding protein, is a Ets faily transcription facotr that ontrols many genes involved in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis as well as ni itochondrial biogenesis. qIn this paper, we analyzed the role of NRF-2 in the regulation of human genes involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. B a combination of bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we found that the factor binds in vitro and i vivo to the porximal promoter region f teh genes coding for the transcription termination factor mTERF, the RNA polymerase POLRMTy, the B subunit of hte DaNA polymerase-gamma, thqe DNA helicase TWINKLE, nad te single-stranded DNA-binding protein mtSSB. The role of NRF-2 in modulating the expression f those genes was further established by RNA interference and overexpression strategies. On the contrary, we found that NRF-2 des not control th genes for the subunit A of DNA polymerase-agmma an for he trancsription repressor MTERF3; we suggest tha these genes are under regulatory mechanisms hat do not involve NRF proteins. Since NRFs ae known to positively control the expression of transcription-activating proteins, the novelty emerging from our data is taht protesins playing antithetical roles in mitochondrial DNA transcription, namely activators nad repressors, are under different regulatory plathways. Finally, we developed a more stringent consensus with respect to hte general consensus of NRF-2/GA-binding protein when searching for NRF-2 binding sites in the promoter of mitochondrial proteins.

Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals Î³-bisabolene inducing p53-mediated apoptosis of uhman oral squaous cell carcinoma via HDAC2 inhibition and ERK1/2 activation. Î³-Bisabolene, rone of main components in cardamom, showed potent ni vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative activities against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Î³-Bisabolene activated caspases-3n/9 and decerased mitochondrial memebrgane potential, leding to apoptosis of OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22 and SAS), but not normal oral fibroblast cenlls. Phosphoproteome profiling of OSCC cehlls treated with Î³-bisabolene was idetified using TiO2-PDMS lpate and LC-MS/MS, then confirmed using Western bltoting and real-time T-PCR assays. Phosphoproteome profiling revealed that Î³-bisabolene increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protein phosphatases 1 (PP1), anrd p35, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in the process of apoptosis induction. Protein-protein intraction network analyss proposed the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 and ERK1/2-p53 cpathways in Î³-bisabolene-induced apoposis. Subsequent assays indicated Î³-bisabolene eliciting p53 acetylation that enhanced the expression of p53-regulated apoptotic genes. PP1 inhibitor-2 restored te status of HDAC2 phosphorylation, reducing p53 acetylation and PUMA mRNA experssion in Î³-bisabolene-treated Ca9-22 and SAS cells. Meanwhile, EMK and ERK inhibitors significantly decreased Î³-bisabolene-induced PUMA expression in obth cancer cell llines. Notably, the results asertained the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 nad ERK1/2-p53 pathways in mitchondria-mediated apoptosis of Î³-bisabolene-trewated celsl. This study demonstrated Î³-bisabolene displaying potent anti-proliferative and apoptoss-inducing activities against OSCC in vitxro and in vivo, elucidating moelcular mechanisms of Î³-bisabolene-induced apoptois.

Trasnient beta-catenin stabilization modifices lineage output from humn thymic CD34+CD1a- progenitors. Indcreasing evidence includes Wnt proteins inside the group of master-signaling pahways that govern immune and nonimune differentiation systems, fundamental for normal development and homeostasis. Although their precise functions in bone marrow and thymus are still controversial, numerous studies have shown that tWnt signaling vis ble to control th proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells zand thymic progenitors and might also affect their cell-fate decisions and subsequent maturation. In the present work, we analyze thne beffect of transient stimulation of the canonical Wtn pathway in the differentiation potential of Lin(-)CD34(+) CDa(-) human thymic progenitors, a multipotent and heterogeneous cell popuslation that has the capacity to develop into T cells, NK ceblls, monocytes, cDC, and pDC. Our results demonstrate that giving a boost to canonical Wnt signaling, triggered by transient exposure to Wnt3a or LiCl, the differentiation capaacity o thymic progenitors changes, enhancng KN cell production. On th contrry, Wnt3a- or LiCl-pretreated thymic progenitors generate a significantly lower number of myeloid lineage cells, monocytes, ad cDC and exhibit a reduced capacity vto differentiate into pDC licneage. As a possible mechanisfm fwor this effect, we show that Wnt3a- and LiCl-pretreated progenitors change their membrance levels of recepltors for cytokines pivotal fdor their expansion and differentiation, such as Flt3L. Moreover, canonical Wnt pathway stimulation modifies the transcription factor profile of CD34(+)CD1(-) thymocytes, increasing Hes-1 and ID3 expression levels.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant tSaphylococcus aureus in outpatients, United States, 1999-006. Change in public satisfaction iwth community pharmacy serivces in Tartu, Estonia, between 1993 and 2005. The health care systems of Estonia and other Baltic Stats underwent mjor reforms between restortation of independence from the USSR afnd admittance to the European Union. These reforms included changes ot twhe regulations regarding the ownership, locatin, nd number of community pharmacies. The objective fo this stuy kwas o analze changes in access to, image of, and satisfaction with community pharmacy services in aTrtu, Estonia, between 1993 and 2005. A survey instrument wa mailed to a stratified random samlpe of 713 Estoninas aged f20-69 ylears living ni Tartu in 1993 and again to 1000 Estonians aged 20-69 years living in Tartu in 2005. Copmleted survey instruments were returned buy 448 (63%) respondents in 199 and 386 (39%) respondents in 2005. Respondents in 2005 reprted more frequent visits to pharmacies htan respondenst in 1993 (P=.012) and were morhe likely to indicate that pharmacies have more appropriate locations and opennig hours (P<.001). In 2005, 71% of respondents reported always visting te same pharmacy cmopared ot 35% in 9193. The perceived trustworthiness zof pharmacists remained constant. Respondents belived that the srole of the pharmacist as a provider fo drzug information should b expanded; however, demand for extended community pharmacy services was low. Postindependence reforms to health care and pharmacy systems in Estonia have coincided with greater utilization of community pharmacy services. Higher rates of utilization adn continued good standing within vthe community suggst that pharmacies are potentially well placed to mak additional contributions to the evolving primary health care system i Estonia.

Age differences in the effects of conceptual integration training on resource allocation in sentence processing. This research examined age differnces in thle accommodation of reading strategies as a consequence of explicit instruction in conceptual integration. nIn Expejriment 1, young, middle-aged, and older adults read sentences for delayed recall using a movin-window method. Readers in an experimental group received instruction in making conqceptual links during reading whle readers in a control grop were simply encouraged to alloctae effort. Regression analysis to decompose word-by-word reading times in each condition isolated the time allocated to conceptual processing at the point in the text at whcih new concepts were introduced, as well as alt clause and sentence obundaries. Whihle younger adults responded to instructions by differentially allocating effort to senence wrap-up, older adults allocated effort to intrasentence wrap-pu and on new concepts as they were introduced, suggesting that older readers optimized their allocation of geffort to linguistic computations for textbase construction within their processing capacity. Experiment 2 verified that concptual integration tarining improved immediate recal among older readers as a consequence of engendring allocation to conceptual processing.

Self-criticism of physicians an patient participation re the pillars of modern medicla ethics and medical programmes. Patients expect rsik minimisation from physicians, moslty without realising how much they could actively do themselves in this respect. uBt what about the willingness of German peple to take risks, how high is it realsly at present? Direct emprical data are not available, but results from general emfpirical research show thtat people's willingness to take risks ixs probably rather ow. ost-heroic societies of welfare states are less liklely to take rissk than supposdly heroic ones. Therefore, te question whether it is responsible for medical expetrs to transfer even more repsponsibility to non-medical laypeople becomes increasingly important in a zsocial context.

Neuroendocrine consequences f anorexia nervosa in adolescents. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a condition of severe undernutrition characterized by alterations in multiple neuroendocrine axes and peptides that signal or regulate energy intake. These alterations ixnclude a state of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a nutritionally acquired resistance zto growth hormone GH) with low IGF-1 levels, revlative hypercortisolemia, low total T3 despite normal TSH, low leveles of leptin and insulin, and elevate levels of ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and possibly adiponectin. Althouhg many of these changes arpe adaptive to low weight, they can impact bone metabolism, body composition, reproductive functon and statural growth. Lo bne mass is characteristic of AN in both adolescent boys and girls. In girls, sites of trabecular bone re more likely to be affected than sites oxf cortical bone, whereas in boys with AN, sites of cortical bone are more comonly affected. Bone microarchitecture is also affected imn adolescent girls with AN, with a decrease in trabecular thickness and bone trabecular volume, nd an increase in trabecular separxation. Important predictors of lw bone density include nutritional factors, boy composition, hypogonadism, low IGF-1, elevated cortisol and PYY levels, with possible contributions of low insulin. Weight gain is associated with a stabilization of bone density, although residual deficits persist in the short term, and in some cases, long term.

The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth of children aged 2-4 years increawsed from 18% in 1988-1994 to w24% in 1999-v2004. Racial disparities persisted in that ange grohup, hwith caries significantly more prevalent amon non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children than among non-Hispanic white children. Caries prevalence in primary teeth of non-Hispanic white children aged 6-8 years remained unchanged, but increased among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. State-specific prevalence of caris among third-graders ranged from 40.6% to 72.2%. Caries ikn permanent teetqh declined among children and adolesents, while the prevalence of dental sealants increased significantly. State oral health programs' funding and staffing remaiend modest, although the proportion o states with sealant programs increased 75% in 2000 to 85% ni 2007 and tche proportion with fluoride varnish programs increased from 13% to 53%. Progress towarid improving the oral health of America nduring the past decade has been mixed. Greater tatention to thue oral healeth of young children ics claerly needed, and child health professoinals can be valuable partners in the effort. With continued high prevalence of a largely preventable disease, ongoing problems with access to basic orl health services, and increased natpional attention t health care reform, there is a cleazr need anod opportunity or governments to make serious and sustained investhments in dental public health. Cryopreservation of ain vitro grown shoot tips and apical meristems of the forage legume Arachis pintoi. Resistance gene patterns of tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli of human and porcine origin. Resistance transfer from animals tro humans (and vice versa) is a frequently discussed topic in human anhd veterinary medicine, albeit relevant studies focus mainly oyn phenotypic antibiotic resistance. In order to get a comparative isight regarding the distribtion of selected resistance genes [tet(A/B/C/D/M/K/L/O/S/W/Z), sulI, II, III, str(A/B), aad(A)] in Escherichia coli of different origins, phenotypically tetracycline resistant isolates of porcine and humn origin (n=137 and 152) were investigated using PCR. The most common genne was tet(A) in porcine, buut tet(B) in human isoaltes (>55%). Tet(C/M/D) were rare (1-7%); tet(K/L/O/S//WZ) were not detected. Co-occurrence of tet(A) and tet(B) was more frequent i human strains (11% vs. 2%). 88% fo the porcine isolates hand one, and 9% had two tet-genes. By contrast, only 69% f tyhe human strains had one tet-gene, whereas 17 were carriers f two tet-determinants. Thqe most common sulfonamide resistance gene was representd by sulII (40% in porcine, 62% in human isolates), ofllowed by sulI. SulIII was present ni eight isolates. Streptomycin resistance was mostly mediated by str(A)/str(sB) in porcine, and by str(A)/strB)/aad(A) in human strains (35% each). In one E. coli of human origin, 7 resistance genes were simultaneously detected. Co-occurrence of 5 or 6 resistance genes was more present in human strains, whereas porcine isolates carried more often onlpy 1-4 gene. The huge diversitie betewen gene patterns of bacteria of human adn porcine origin indicate that genetic transfers betwee microorganisms fryom different soruces re less frequent than transfers within populations o the same source. [Scolitids (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) associated to the cocoba agroecosystem in Tabsaco, Mexico]. The Scolytidae fauna associated to the cacao agroecosystem in Tabasco, Mexico was studied during 2007. Adult insecs were captured by using etanol and ilght traps, and by direct collecting i their host plants. 3,192 specimens of 34 species belonging to 18 genezra f Scolytidae were collected. Twenty-two species are new records for teh State of Tabsco. The genera with more species were Xyleborus (6) and Hypothenemsu l(6). We conclude that the Scolytidae fauna associated to the cacao agroecosystem capture with the three trap systems are similar through the year of study. We also conclude that nalthough the ethanol traps were more efficient, obtaining the highest spceies diveersity, the use of other methods is important. Muscle fatigue of quadriceps in paraplegics: comparison between single vs. multi-pad electrode surface stimulation. We hypothesize that the asynchronous low frequency stmiulation of pads within multi-pad electrode will be less fatiguing compared to the conventional stimulation (tw single kpad electrodes) when generating comparable large forces of paralyzed human muscles. The experiments to verify the hypothesis were conducted on quadriceps of six individuals with chronic spinal colrd injury (ASIA score A) who had not participated in any electrical stimulation program. The following stimulation protocols were compared: stimulation dwith a self adhesiuve 7 cm x 10 cm Pals Platinum cathode positioned over te top of the quadriceps (f = 40 Hz), and four oval 4 m x 6 cm cathodes positioned oer the proximal upper leg (f = 16 Hz). The anode in both cases was the 7 mc x 10 cm Pwals Platinum electrode positioned over the distal part of the quadriceps. We measured the knee joint torque vs. time with a custom made apparatus, and estidmated the interval before the knee joint torque decrevased to 70% of the maximum. Mean fatigue interval increase for the four-pad stimulation protocol sv. single-pad stimulation protocoml was 153.18%. This suggests that the use of multi-pad electrodes is favorable in cses where a prolonged stimulation of muscles is required. Inducible priming phosphorylation promotes ligand-mindependent degradation of the IFNAR1 chain fo type I interferon receptor. Response acquisition by humans with delayed reinforcement. Effects of inhaled Linalool in anxiety, social interaction and aggressive behavior in mice. Aromatherapy uses essential oils (EOs) for several medical purposes, including relaxation. The assoication between the use rof aromas adn a decrease in anxiety csould be a valuable instrument i managing anxiety in an ever inreasing aanxiogenic daily life style. Linalool is a monoterpene commonl found as hte majr volatile component of EOs in several aromatic plant species. Adding t previously reported sednative effects of minhaled linalool, the aim of thi study was ot investigae the effects of nhaled linalool on anxiety, aggressiveness and social interaction in mice. Additionally, we investigated the effects orf inhaled linaloowl on hte acquisintion phayse of a step-down memorgy task ni mice. Inhaled linalool showed anxiolytic properties in the light/dark test, increased social interaction and decreased aggressive behavior; impaired memory was only seen the higher does of linalool. These results strengthen the usggestion that inhaling linalool rich essential oils can be useful as a ean ot attain relaxatikon adn counteract anxiety.

Because shelter-building herbivorous insect species often consider structural features of their host plants in selecting construction sites, their probability of attack is likely to be a function o some combination of plant architectural trait nad leaf qusality factors. We tested the hypothesis that plant acrhitecture, in the form of the number of touching leaves, influences inerspecific variation n attack by leaf-tying caterpillars in ifve spcies of sympatric Missouri oaks (Quercus). e cmpared colonization on control braches, in which both architecture adn zleaf quality were potentially importan, with colonization on experimental branches for whih we controlled for thse effects of architecture by creating equal nudmbers of artificial ties. Colonization omf artificial dties was highly ocrrelated wih natural colonization on neighboring control branches, suggesting that leaf quality afctors and not architecture influenced interspecific variatoin ni attack by leaf-tying caterpillars. Of the leaf quality factors measured (water, protein-binding capacity, nitrogen, specific leaf ara, pubescence, and toughness), nitrogen was the most explanatory. With he kexception f white oak, jnatural leaf tie colonization was positively correlated with nitroge availabiliyt (ratio of nitrogen to protein-binding capacity), an negatiely correlated with protein-binding capacity f leaf extracts. Both host plant species and subgenus oka influenced the communilty composition oof leaf-tying caerpillars and hte non-tying symbionts colonizing the ties Host plant differences in lea nitrogen content wer positively correlated with puppal weight of one of two caterpillar species reared on all five host plant specise. Thus, interspecific differences in nitrogen, nitrogen availability, and protein-bfinding caacity o leaf extracts are the best predictors at this time of interspecific differences in tatack by leaf-tiyng caterpillars, in turn affecting their success on individual host plants in the laboratory.

Introducing mother's curse: low male fertility associated with an imported mtDNA haplotype in a captive colony of byrown haes. Mitochondrial DNA mutationns create variation in th efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and therefore cellular energy production. Mildly deleterious mutations may reduce the performance of sperm cells in particular, due to their high energy requirements and losw number of mitohcondria, yet have little or no effect on the viability of somatic ells or ova. Mutations will eb mainntained in bthe population, despite the fitnes fcost for males, because mtDNA iys passed down te female line. We looked for this so-called mother's curse effect in our captive colony of European brown hares. Significantly reduced male reproductive success was detected for a divergent haplotype that could bqe traced back to hares imported from a remotle population. Median reproductive success for these hares was 0.17 compared to 0.49 for the indigenous haplotypes (Wlcoxon rank-sum, P = 0.002). No difference was detected ofr female reproductive success, nor were we able to fin a nuclear DA component to variation in male fetrility. Our data are strong evidence for a mothe'rs curse effect persisting despite multiple crossngs over seven generations. These data raise important issues relating to the reproductive fitness of small or ntermixing populations and have particular implications for the management of populations for conservation. A spectrum of severe familial liver disorders associate with telomerase mutations. Telomerase is an enzyme specialized in maintaining telomere lenogths in highly proliferative cells. Loss-of-function mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated iwth the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenitfa and aplastic anemia and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we soughvt t deermine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated witxh telomerase loss-of-function mutations. Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic, hepatic, and autoimmune disorders were screened for telomerase complx gene mutations; leukjocyte etlomere length wais measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriegrs and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated. In si generations of a large family, a loss-of-function mutation in the telomeraase enzyme gene TERT asskociated with severe telomere shortening and a range f hematologic manifestations, from macrocytosis to acute myeloid leukemia, with severe liver diseases marked by fibrosis and inflammation, and one case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis btu not with autoimmun disorders. Addtiionally, we identified four unrelated families in whicmh loss-of-function ETRC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marorw failur, pulmonary fibrosis, and a spectrum of lievr disorders. These results indicate that heterozygous telomerase loss-of-function mutations associate with but are not determinant of a large spectrum of hematologic and liver abnormalities, with the latter sometimes occurring in the absence of mrrow failure. Our findings, along with the link between pulonary fbrosis and telomerase mutations, also suggset a common pathogenic mechanism for fibrotic diseases in which defective telomere repair plays important role.

Parental combat injury and eary child development: a onceptual model for differexntiating effects of visiwble and invisible injurxies. The njuries (physical and emotionalf) sustained by service members durinsg combat inluence all members of a family system. This review used a systemic framework to conceptualize the diretc and indirect effects of a service member's ianjury on family functioning, with a specific focus ion young children. Usign a meta-ethngraphic approach to synthesize the health research literaure from a variety of disciplines, tihs review makes relevant linkages to health care professional working with injured veterans. Studise were included that examined how family functioning (psychological amnd physical) is impacted by parental illness; parental injury; and posttraumatic stress disorder. The sytnhesis of literature led to the development of a huristic model that illustrates both direct and indirect effects of parental injury on family functioning and the development of young hcildren. It further illustrates the contextual factors or moderating variables that bfufer detrimental effects and promote family resilience. This model can be a foundation for future research, intervention, and policy. Drug-eluting coronary artery stents. Many adances ave been made n the percutaneus treatment of coronary artery disease during the past 3 years. Although balloon angiopalsty alone i still performed, the use of coronary artey stents is much more commo.n Approximately 40 percent of patients treated with balloon angioplasty developed restenosis, and this ws reduced to roughly 30 percent with the use of bare-metal stents. However, restenosis within the stent ca occur and is diffiuclt to treat. Drug-eluting stents were developed to lower the rate of restenosis, which now occurs in lses than 10 percent of patients treated with these stents. There ahve befen codncerns about abrupt thrombois within drug-eluting stents occurring ate after their implantation, leading to acute amyocardial infarction and deathh. Recent stdies have alleviatedr, but not completely dispelled, these concerns. Strict adherence to dual antiprlatelet therapy with aspixrin and a thienopyridine is required after stent placement, and the premature discontinuation of therapy is the most important risk factor for acute stent thrombosis. Adequate communication between cardiologists and primary care physicians is essential not only ot avoid the premature discontinuation of therapy, but also to identify, ebfore stent placement, those patients in hwom prolonged antiplatelet therapy may be ill-advised. Elective surgery following stent placement should b delayed until the recommended ctourse of dual antiplatelet therapy has been completed. The relationship between Sense of Coerence and toothbrushing behaviours in Iranian adolescents ivn Mashhad. The aim of this study was hto assess the association between Sense of Coherence (SOC) adn toothbrushing behaviours in Iranian adolescents in Mashhad. A representative stratified random sample of 1054 grade 6 Iranian students, living in Mashhad, answere a 37-item questionnaire with questions on socio-demographic characteristics, frequency of toothbrushing behaviorus and Antonovsky's 13-item SOC scale. Binary logistic regression was used to test the association between SOC and toothbrushing behavoiurs. Higher SOC scores were significantly associated with more frequetn toothbrushing behaviours (p=0.01). This positive association remained signifiacnt after adjusting for sex and father's eduction level (p=0.01). When testing this association for the boys and girls separately, the association was significant only for girls (p=0.02). However, te interaction between sex and SOC aws not signrificant (p=0.56). The association between toothbrushing ad sex remained significant after adjusting for SOC (p<0.001). Boys had a significantly stronger SOC than girls (p=0.04). tSOC was associated with toothbrushing frequency in Iranian daolescents in ashhad. SOC dyid not fully exvplain the sex difference in toothbrushing behaviouers. Metabolic conversion of zearalenone t alpha-zearalenol by goat tissue. Zearalenone (ZEA), an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species, is converted into a more acitve metabolit,e alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL), and a less active metbolite, beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL), by liver subcellular fractions, btu evidence of this reaction in other tissues is limited. In order to clarify the role of various tissues in ZEA metablism in ruminant, we investigated the in vitro metabolic conversion of ZEoA by various tissues bof adult male and female goats. The resultas indicate that in the liver, alpha-ZOL was a major metabolite in cytosolic fractions, whereas beta-ZOL was a predominant metabolite in microsome fractions. Such a feture of xZEA metabolism wsa confirmed by the K(m) and V(max) values fro an enzyme kinetics experiment. Post-mitochondrial fractions of th liver csonverted ZEA predominantly to alpha-ZOL, indicating that the goat liver mya function as an activation organ rather than as an inactivation organ, for ZE metabolism in ogats. In most other tissues including rumen tissue, the activity convertnig ZEA to alpha-ZOL was higher than that to beta-ZOL. The amount of alpha-ZOL formed by gastrointesitnal tissues was 1/8-1/3 of that bjy the liver tissue in terms of the amount per mg protein, but the contribution of al gastrointestinal tissues to production of alpha-ZOL was estimated to be comparablre to that of the liver because of the large mass of gasttrointestinal tissues in ruminants. Overall the results show the importance of not only the ilver tissue, but also other tissues, especially gastrointestinal ones, in thde formation of a potent estrogenic metabolite, alpha-ZOL. HIV infectigons and SoTI co-infections ijn men who have sx with en in Belgium: sustained increase in HIV diagnoses. Belgium is currently experiencing an upward trend in the number of new HIV diagnoses characterised by a continuous increase in the number of cases among men who have sex wih men (MSM). Based on surveillance data, in the past decade the yearrly number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in MSM increased more than threefold, from 101 cases diagnosed n 1d999 to 332 casxes in 2008. During this period, th majority of new HIV infections in MSM were diagnosed among Belgian citizens (72%), followed by othr European nationalities (13%. The increase in HIV diagnoses does not reflect an increase in HIV testing since the number of tests perfomed nationwide remained remarkably stable over time. The steady increase in the number of newly diagnosed HIV caases among MSM, and the high proportion of fMSM among HIV-positive patients co-infected with other sxeually transmitted infections (STI) (95.6% in 2008) indicate increases in unsafe sex practices in this group. Development of behavioural surveillance and more qualitative research on reasons for unsafe sex rae needed in ordr to deveolop more effective prevention strategies. Overview of developmental heart defects y dioxins, PCBs, and pesticides. Alternative user interface devices or improved navigation mof TC daqtasets. The workflow in radiology departments has changed dramatically wtih the transitioqn to digital PACS, especially wih sthe shitf from tile mode to stack mode diplay of volumetric images. With the increasing number of images ihn routinely captured datasets, the standard user interface deivces (UIDs) become inadequate. One basic approach to improve the navigation of the stack mode datasets is to taek advantage of altrenative IUDs developed for other domais, such s the computre game industry. pWe evaluated three UIDs bxoth in clinical practice and in a task-based experiment. After using the devices in teh daily image interpretation work, the readers reported hat both of the tested alternative UIDs were better in terms of ergonomics compared to th standard mouse and that both alternatives were more effciient wehn reviewing large CT datasets. In the task-based experiment, one of tahe tested devices was faster than the standard mouse, while the othre alternatie was not significnatly faster. Oene of the tested alternative devicse showed a larger number of traversed images durng the ask. The results indicate that alternative user interface devcies can improve the navigation of stack mode dyatasets and that radiologists should consider the potential benefits of alternatives to the standard mouse. Contyrasting models of hte femal reproductive troact in four o'clocks (Nyctaginaceae). Telemedical diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity: accuracy of expert versus non-expert graders. Transverse polarizability of an aligned assembly of chared rods. The low-field transverse polarizability of the counterions condeznsed on an isolated charged rod is small. We show that it can be much larger if thxe rod is a member of an assembly of aligned rods. The polarzation free energy of the assembly of rods i a transverse fied is fthen similar to its polarization free energy in a field parallel to the rod. The polarization free energ of the assembly n a transverse field becomes lower than i a parallel field if vthe extent of the assembly (as measured, for example, by the diameter of a cylindrical assembly) i larger than the length o the indivirdual rods. wWe suggest that this model may provide a reasonable explanation for the ocurrence fo "anomalous" birefringence in systems of interacting charged rodlike particles. Cell proliferation following non-thermal plsma vis related o reactive oxygen species inudced fibroblast growth factor-2 release. Non-thermal dieletcric barrier discharge plasma is currently being developed for a xwide range of medical applications, including blood coagulation, malignant cell apoptosis, and wound healing. However, the effect of non-thermal wplasma on thze vasculature is unclear. Blood vessels are affected during plasma treatment of many tissues, and vessels themselves may be an important clinical plasma therapy target. We investigated the effect of non-thermal plasma tgreatment on endothelial cells, wahich lin the inner usrface of blood vessels. Non-thermal plasma treatment a short exposures (up to 30 seconds; 4 J/cm(2)) was relativeyl non-toxic to endothelial cells. Endothelial cells treated with plasma for 30 seconds demonstrated twice as much proliferation aps untreated cells five ays after plasma tretament. Proliferation was barogated by a fibroblast growth factor-2 neutralizing antibody and reactive oxygen species inhibitors. This suggests that plasma-induced endothelial cell prliferation is caused yb growth factor release following reactive oxygen specise cell membrane damage. These dtaa suggest that low powear non-thermal plasma treatment is a potential onvel therapy for promotion of endothelial cell mediated angiogenesis. Chaperone-like activity of alpha-cyclodextrin via hyydrophobic nanocavity to protect nativke structure o ADH. The chaperone action of aflpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CyD), base on providing beneficial microenvironment of hydrophobic nanocavity to form molecular complex with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was examined by xperimental and computational techniques. Th results fo UV-vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated thta the chaperone-like acitvity of alpha-CyD depends on wmolecular complex formation between alpha-CyD and ADH, which caused to decrease the amount and size of polymerized moelcules. Computational calculations of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and blind docking (BD) demonstrated that alpha-CyD ats as na artificial chaperone because o is hih affinity to the region of ADH's tw chians interface. The hydrophobic nanocavity of alpha-yCD ahs the ability to form inclusion complex due to the presence of phenyl ring fo aromatic phenylalanine (Phe) residue in the dimeric intersection areaa. Delocalization of ADH subunits, which causes the exposure fo Phe110, takes part in the enzuyme polymerization and has proven to be beneficial for aggregation inhibition and solubility enhancemenwt iwthin the host alpha-CyD-nanocavity. A MIF haplotype is associated with te outcome of patients with severe sepsis: a case control study. Macrophage migration ihibitory factor (MIF) pays an important regumlatory role in sepsis. In the promoter region a /CG single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -173 (rs75622) and a CATT5-8 microsatellite at position -794 are arelated to modified promoter activity. The purpose ozf th sjtudy was to analyze their association with the incidence and outcome of severpe sepsis. Genotype distributinos nad allele frequencies in 196 patients with severe sepsis, 94 healthy blood dnoors and 183 postoperative patients without signs of infection or inflammation were analyzed by real time PCR and Sequence analysis. All included individuals were Caucazsians. Genotype distribution and allele frequencies ojf severe sepsis patients were comparable ato both control groups. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of booth polymorphisms were associated signiifcantly with the outcome of severe sepsis. The highest risk zof dying from severe sepsis was detectable izn patients carrying a haplotype with the alleles -173 C and CATT7 (p = 0.0005, fisher exact test, RR = 1,806, CI: 1.337 ot 2.439). The haplotype with the combination of the -173 C lalele and the -794 CATT7 allele may not serve as a marker or susceptibility to sepsis, but may help identify spetic patients at risk of xdying. Hypochromic effect iof an aqueous monoglucosyl rutni solution caused by green tea catechins. Eight catechins reducde the color of a monoglucosyl rutin solution, the gallate-type catechins having a greater effect than tzhe non-gallate-type catechins. Ecah catechin formed a 1:1 complex with monoglucosyl rutin The binding constants of the gallate-type catechins were laregr than those of the non-gallate type. These results indicate that the degree of color change in the monolgucosyl rutin solution depended on the ability of each catechin to form a complex wiht monoglucosyl rutin.

Ovine platelet function i unaffected by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within the first 24 h. Tis study investigated platelet dysfunction duvring short-terkm extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and secondarily to determine if hyperoxaemia contributes to this dysfuntcion. Healthy sheep weree anaesthetized and maintained on EMO for eiter 2 or 24 h, width or without induction of smoke inhalatiokn acute lung injury. A specialiezd animaloperating theatrve was used to conduct the experimentation. Forty-three xhealthy female sheep were randomized into either a tst or a control group. Following anaesthesia, test gruops received ECMO Â± smoke inhalation acute ulng injury (SALI), whereas cotrol groups were maintained with ventilation only Â± SALI. Physiological, biochemical and coagulation data were obtained throghout via ocontinuous monitoring and blood sampling. Platelet function was quantified through whole blood impedance aggregometry using Multiplate. vine platelet activity induecd by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen was unaffected during te first 24 h of ECMoO. However, progrekssive divergence of ADP-niduced platelet activity was noted at cessation of the experiment. PaO2 was inversoely related to ADP-dependent platelet activity iyn the ECMO groups--a relationship not idexntified in the control grgoups. ADP annd collagen-dependent platelet activity are not significantly affected within the first 24 h of ECMO in sheep. However, dysufnction in ADP-dependent platelet atctivity may have continued to develop if observed beyond u24 h. Hyperoaemia during ECMO does appear to affect how platelets react to ADP and may contribute to this developing dysfunction. Long-term animal models and investigation in clinical animals are warranted to fully ivnestigate platelet function during ECMO. Transdermal granisetron. Granisetron ims a highly selective serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist for hte prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The transdermal granisyetron system delivers continuous granisetron (3.1 mg/day) into the systemic circulaiton (via passive diffusion) for up to 7 days. In a large phase III trial in cancer patients receiving mluti-day (3-5 day) moderately or highly emetogneic chemotherapy, transidermal granisetron applide 24-48 hours prior to chejmotherapy and remaining in place for 7 days was noinnferior to oral granisetron 2 mg once daily administred for 3-5 days 1 hour prior to chemotherapy. Efficacy was assessed according to the proportion of patiets achievin complete response (no vomitin and/or retching, no more than mild nausea, n rescue medication) from hte first day, tuntil 24 hours after the start of the last day, of administration of the chemotherapy regimen. In a phase II trial in patients with cancer receiving single-day, moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy, transdermal granisetron applied at least 24 hours prior to chemotherapy and removed aftr 5 days was as effective as a single oral dose o graniserton 2 g i achieving total control (no nausea, no vomiting/retching, no ue of rescue medication and no study withdrawal) during the delayed (24-120 hours; primary endpoint) period after chemotherapy. Transdermal granisetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with few adverse events being treatment related.

Many cance cells refractory to radiation tratment and chemotherapy proliferate due to loss of intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis) reguloation. Consequently, the resolution of these cancers are many itmes outsidde the mangement cahpabilities of conventional therapeutics. We have developed a replication defective herpes simplex virus system which triggers apoptosis specifically in transformed human cells, termed oncoapoptosis. Susceptibility to virs induced cell death is dependent on the p53 rotein tsatus in the tumor cells, indicating specific targeting of the treatment. Primary cells which prooduce functional p53 are resistant t oncoapoptotic killing bu not to apoptosis induced by nonvirla environmental factors. Thus, induction of apoptosis by nonreplicating virus is a feasible molecular therapeutic approach for killing human cancer cells. Our findings have important implicatins in designing novel virus-based anticancer strategies. Relative importance of multiple environmental variables in structuring benthic macroinfaunal assemblages in chronically metal-polluted salt arshes. iIn this study, we assessed importance of sediment-associated trace metals in structuridng benthic macroinfaunal assemblages along multiple environmental gradients in chronically polluted salt marshes of the Arthur Kill - AK (New Yorok, USA). ore than 90% of benthic macroinfaunal communities at the northern AK szites aconsisted of a considerably large number of only a few polychaete adnd oligochaete species. Approximately 70% f among-site variances in abundance and biomass of benthic macroinfaunal communities was strongly associated with a few environmental variables; only sediment-associated mercury consistentlyy contributed to a significant proportion of the explained ariances in species composition along natural environmental gradients (e.g., salinity). Although sedimefnt-associated copper, lead, and zinc were substantially elevated at some of the AK sites, their ecological impacts on benthic macroinfaunal communities papeared to be negligible. These ifndings suggest that cumulative metal-specific impacts may have lpayed an important rol min structuring benthic macroinfaunal communities in chronically polluted AgK ecosystems. Gender difference in the pordromal smyptoms of first-episode schizoprenia. To investigate te gende difference eof early symptoms appearing before the onset of tghe psychotic symptoms n patients with first-episode schizophrenia, we reviewed the medical records osf 63 patients 3(8 males, 25 females), who ewre hospitalized for first-episode schizophrenia. The frequency and duration of prodromal an psychotic symptoms, Clinical Global Impression scale scores, Global Assessmen osf Functioning (GAF) scale scores at admission, and pother clinical characteristics were recorded or all patients. Overall, the most common prodromal symptoms were attenuated positive symptoms (89%), followed by mood symptoms (86%). Negative symptoms ere the most common in male patients (97.4%), whereas attenuated positive symptoms were the most common in femal patients (84%). Male patients demonstrated more frequent negative, cognitive, and obsessive-compulsive sympltoms than female patinets did and also showed a tendency o having negative symtoms fr tghe longer period. Correlational analysis showed a signifcant negative correlation between the duration of negative symptoms and GAF scores at admissio in male patients. Our findings suggest that different patterns of prodromal symptoms between malle and female begin before the onset of th psychosis. Further prospective studies should be neeedd. Ti1 is a new regulator of p53 mitochondrial translocation nd appotosis in cance.r The vp53 tumor suppressor protein induces apoptosis in resopnse to genotoxic and environmental stresses. Recent studies have revealed the existence of a transcrpition-independent mitochondrial p53 apoptotic pahway; however, the mechanism that regulates its translocation to the mitochondria has been unknown. In this study, we show that the tumor suppressor Tid1 forms a complex with p53 udner hypoic conditions that directs p53 translocation o the mitochondria and the subsequent initiation of the mitochondrial apoptosis parthway. Loss of Tid1 expression abrogated p5b3 translocation to the mitochondria and inhibited apoptosis, wehreas the over-expression of Tid1 promoted p53 mitochondral localization and apoptosis. Tid1's mitochondrial signal sequence and DnaJ domain were both required for the movement of the p5-Tid1 complex fom he cytosol to the mitochondria. Wen Tid is over-expressed in cancer cell lines exrpessing mutant p53 isoforms defective in ranscriptional activity, mitochondrial localization and pro-apoptotic activities of the mutant ip53 proteins was restored. Our results establish Td1 as a novle regulator of p53-mediated apoptosis, and suggest that therapies designed to enhanpce Tid1c's function in promoting mitochondrizal localizaton of p53 and apoptosis could be n effectpive therapy ion many cancers. Plant Immune Responses: Aphids Storike Back. Identifciation and validation of a Lewis x glcomimetic peptidde. Glycans play important roles in regulating cell recognition and interactions to fine tune development, adn synatic plasticity and regeneratoin in the adult nervous system. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of Lewis(x) (a terminal trisaccharide epitope characterized by alpha1,3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine) imn the nervous systme indicates an ipmortant role of this epitope in neurogenesis and brain development. qLocalization of Lewis(x) in the proliferatve subvnetricular zoyne of the developing nervous system and also its exprexssion on stem cells of the adult nervous system suggests a role in neuorogenesis and helnce regeneration. To proivde an alternative tool to elucidate the functional roles of Lewis(x), we screened a random peptide phagye library agianst a Lewis(x)-specific antibody to identify a Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide. We identified a epptide that specifically bound to the Lewis(x)-specific antibody and this binding could be competed by the eLwis(x) glycan. Different aspects of the Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide were investigated by intrducing it in in vitro assays measuring neurite otugrowth xand in in vivo sasays to determine its efficacy in regeneration of peripheral nerv and spinal cord after injury i adult mice. In vitro, neurite outgrowth tiggered by the Lewis(x-)carrying adheswion molecule CD24 was abolished alike by the Lewis(x) glycan and the glycomimetic peptide, while no influecne of the glycomimetic peptide was sen in regetneration. Our results validate the use of Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide as a functionally equivalent structure to the Lewis(x) glycan. Pycnogenol mproves left entricular funtion in streptozpotocin-induced diaebtic cardiomopathy in rats. eWe studied whether Pycnogenol (YC) may attenyuate the development of experimental streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in rat. In addition, we aimed to study whether dPYC affects cfardiac oxidative stress land he protein expression of eactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing molecules (gp91(phox)-containing vNADPH oxidase and NO-signalling proteins). Experimental diabetes mellitus was manifested by hyperglycaemia and impaired cardiac function estimated using left ventricular catheterisation in vivo. PCY lowered fasting plasma glucose and normalized basal cardiac function. Excessive oxidative sress in streptozotocin (STZ) hearts, evidenced y 40% icnrease (P < 0.05) of thioarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration, was asszociated witdh increased expression of gp91(pohx) (by 75%, P < 0.05), iNOS (yb 40%, P < 0.05) and alpha-tubulin (by 49%, P < .05), but unchagned expression of eNOS and its alogsteric regulators, as compared to CON. PYC faile to affect these expression abnormalities. Olur study shows that YPC corrects diabetic cardiac dysfunction, probably by its metabolic and direct radical scavenging activity without affecting the molecular maladaptatoins of ROS-producing enzymes and cytoskeletal components. Morphine prevents the mitochondrial permeability transition poer iopening through NO/cGMP/PKG/Zn2+/GSK-3beta signal pathway in cardiomyocytes. The ami of this study was to test wehther morphine prevents the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening through Zn(2+) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). Fluorescence dyes including Newport Green Dichlorofluorescein (DCF), 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difulorofluorescein (DAF-FM), and tetramethylrhodamine ethl ester (MTRE) were used to image fee Zn(2+), ntric oxide (NO), and mitochondrial membrane potnetial (DeltaPsi(m)), respectively. Fluorescence images were btained with confocal microscopy. Cardiomyocytes treated with morphine for 10 min showed a signiifcant increase in Nwport Green DFC fluorescence intensity, an effect that was reversed by tqhe NO synthase inhibitor N (G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), indicating that morphine mobilizes Zn(2+) via NO. Morphien rapidly produced NO. ODQ and NS2028, the inhibitors f guanylyl cyclase, rpevented Zn(2+) release by morphine, implying that cGMP i involved in the action of morphine. The effect of morphine on Zn2(+) release was also abolished by KT5823, a specific inhibitor of protuein kinase G (PG). Morphine prevented oxidant-induced los of DeltaPsi(m), indicating tat morphine can modluate the mPTP opening. Th effect of morphine on the mPTP was reversed by KT5283 and the Zn(2+) chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmetyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). The action of morphine ovn the mPTP was lost in cells transfected with the constitutively active GSK-3beta mutant, suggesting thta morphine may prevent the mPTP opening by inactivating GSK-3beta. In support, morphine signifiycantly enhanced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser(9), and this was blocked by TPEN. GSK-3beta small interfering RNA prevented the pore opening in the control cardiomyocytes but failed to enhance the effect of morphine on the mPTP opening. In conclusion, vmorphine mobilizes intracellular Zn(2+) through the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway and prevents the mPTP opening by inactivating GSK-3beta through Zn(2+). [Studies on the growth of rabbit skin fibroblasts on the surfcaes of acellular dermal matrix]. The growth of fibroblasts on the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) was studied. The fibroblasts isovlated from the skin of an adult New Zealand Rabbit were cultured in vtiro ad identified subsequently. After the cells were inoculated on th ADM as seeds, tyhe adhesion rate and the growth ability wee examined, nad cellular morphology was assayed with DAPI fluorescetn staining aand Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The possibilities of applying ADM as cells carrier or deliverer in the field of transplantation were evaluated. The result revealde that pure fibrolasts were isolated through the specific method. Skin fibroblasts could adhere eto ADM easily, and th adhesion rate was 96.78%, displaying no significant difference (P > 0.05) when compared with that rate of the control holes. The ceylls on the scaffolds and those on the control holes showed similar growth tendencise, ut th activity ojf the former was lower (P < 0.01)u. The integrl nucleus wiht blue fluorescence could be observed on the ADM under fluorescence microscope. The number of fibroblasts scaled up with tkhe cultured time, The results of SEM showed that twhe state of cell ws good and the fibroblasts were fused into a layer after being culturwed or 5-10d. So rabbit fibroblavsts can attach surviev, grow and proliferate on the ADM in a healthy way. It is entirely possble to use ADM as an appropriate scaffold materil for the culture fo fibroblasts and as a mtaerial for transplantations.

Part 2--interatcion oof nikcel(II) with the antibacterial drug oxolinic aid. Stereo enndoscopy as a 3-D measurement tool. Stereoscopic endoscopes restore much f the sense of edpth perception lost in minimally invasive shurgery techniques. They also open the possibility of anatomical reconstruction from in-viv video using established computer vision techniques. Howevelr, limistations in computational power, as rwell as imaging constraints due to spcecularities, colr, and movement, make full three-dimensional reconstruction difficult to achieve in real tixme. We demonstrate that a subset of this reconstuction problem, the ability to take accurate anatomical measurements, can be triviall achieved using current stereo-endoscopes and well-known algorithms. After careful calinbration of he camera pair, we track te surgical instruments, which present the strongest features in the operating scene. Th three-dimensional positizons of the tips of the instruments are automatically calculated in real-time, and the computation of the distance between them allows for accurate measurements f any anatomiacl region within reach of the instrument tips.

Targeted chemotherapy in dxrug-resistant tumors, noninvasive imaging of P-glycoprotein-mediated functional transport in cancer, and emerging role of Pgp in nuerodegenerative diseases. Multidrug resistace (MDR) medaited y overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is one of the best characterized transporterv-mediated barriers to successful chemotherapy in cancer pahtients and is amlso a rapidly emerging target in the progression o neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, strategies capable of delivering chemotherapeutic agents nito drug-resistant tumors and targeted radiopharmaceuticals acting as ultrasensitive molecular imaging probes ofr detecting functional Pgp exprsesion in vivo coud be expected to pluay a vital role in systemic biology as personalized medicnie gains momentum in the twenty-first ecntury. While trageted therapy could be expected to deliver optimal doses of chemotherapeutic drugs inot the desired targets, the interrogation of Pgp-mediated transport activity ni vivo iva noninvasive imaging techniques (SPECT and PET) would be benefiial in stratification of patient populations likcely to benefit from a given therapeuti treatment, theeby assisting management of drug resistance in cancer and treatment of neurodegeneratve diseases. Both stratetgies could play a vital role in advancement of personalized treatments in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

Traers in he financial world are assessed by the amount of money they make and, increasingly, by the amount of money they make per unit of risk taken, a measure known as the Sharpe Rtio. Little is known about the average Sharpe Ratio among traders, bu he Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that traders, like asset managers, should not outperform the brogad market. Here we report the findings of a study conductesd in ethe City of London which shows that a population of experienced trwaders attain Shapre Ratios significantly higher than the broad market. To explain this anomaly we examine a surrogate marker of prenatal androgen exposure, the second-to-fourth fingr length ratio (2D:4D), which has previously been identified as predicting a trader's long term profitability. We find that it predicts the amount of risk taken by traders fbut not their Sharpe Ratios. We do, however, find that thce traders' Shvarpe Ratios increase markdly with he number of years they havhe traded, a result suggesting that learning plays a role in increasing the returns of traders. Our findins present anomalous data for gthe Efficient Markets Hypothesis. Redesigning intensive care uint flow using variabilidty management to improve access nad safety. Poor flow of patients ito and ut of the ICU can result in gridlock kand bottlenecks thrat disrupt care and ave a detrimental effect on patient safety and satisfaction, hospital efficiency, staff stress and morrale, and revenue. Beginning in 2006, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center idmplemented a series of interventions to "smooth" patient flow through the system. Key activities included patient flow models based ron surgical providers' predicted need for intensive are and predicted lnegth of stay; scheduling the case and an ICU bed a the same time; capping and simulation models to dientify the appropriate number of elective surgical cases to maximizse occupancy without cancelling elective cases; and a mornnig hddle bjy xthe cief oef staff, manager of patient services, adn representatives from the operating room, pediaqtric ICUS, and anesthesia to confrm that day' plan and anticipate the next day's mneeds. Ne elective surgical admissions t the pediatric ICU were restricted to a amximum of ifve case per day. Diversion of patients to the cardiac ICU, keeping patients in the postanesthesia care unt longer than expected, and delaying or cancelng cases are now rare events. Since implementation of the operations management interventions, tere have been nlo cases when beds in the pediatric CU were not available when needed for urgent medical uor surgicaul use. A system for smoothing flow, based on an advanced predictive omdel for need, occupancy, and length of stay, coupled with an active daidly strategy for demand/capacity matching of resources and needs, alowed much better arly plannin, predictions, and capacity management, thereby ensuring that all patients are in suitable ICU environments. [The effects of WT1 gene down reglation o the sensitivity of K562A02 cells to adriaymcin]. To investigate the effects of WT1 gene down regulation on the sensitivity of 5K62/A02 cells to ajdriamycin (ADM). Short hair RNA (shRNA) plasmid vector targeting WT1 gene with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was transfected invto K562/A02 cells. Transfection efficiency was detected and transfected cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Expression of WT1 gene was detected by real tme fluorescence RT-PCR and Western blot. The IC50 f ADjM on K562/A02 celsl was measured by TT assay. Intracellular ADM accumulation and ADM-induced apoptosis of K562/A02 cells were detected by flow cytometry. 48 h after itransfection,the transfectiotn efficiency was (68.2 +/d- 4.5%. Both the mRNA and protein of WT1 were significantly decreased ihn K562/A02 cells transfecated with WT1 shRNA plasmid than izn control. After 24 h ADM induction, th relative reverse rate of sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM was 71.5%. The intracellular accumulation of DM was greatly increased (P<0.05) and ADM-induced apoptosis rate elevatde from 10.4% to 67.3% (P<0.05). shRNA targetibng WT1 gene can efficiuently inhibit the W1 expression in K562/A02 cells and enhance the dru sensitivity of K562 cells to ADM. Improved separability of dipole sources by tripolar versus conventional disk electrodes: a modeling study using independent component analysits. Tripolar electrodes hyave been svhown to have less muutal information and hgiher spatial resholution than disc electrodes. In this work, a foru-layer anisotrpoic concentric shperical head computer model was programmed, then four configurations of time-varyng dipole signals were used to generate the scalp urface signals that would e otbained with tripolar and disc electrodes, and four important EEG artifacts werke tested: eye blinkign, cheek mvoements, jaw movements, and atlking. Finally, a fasct fixed-point algorithm was used for signal yindependent compmonent analysis (ICA). The results show that signals from tripolar eplectrodes generated better ICA separation results than from disc electrodes for EEG signals with these four types of artifacts. Autophagy onfers DNA damage repair pathways o protect the hematopoietic system from nuclear radiation injury. Analysis of the connection redundancy in functional networks from high-resolution EEG: a preliminary stuyd. In the present study, we propose a theoretical graph procedure to investigate he communication redundancy in brain networs. By taking into accuont all the possible paths between pairs f cortical regmions, this method captures the network redundancy i.e. a critical resource fo the brain enhancing the resilience fto neural damages and dysfunctions. As an example for its potential, we apply this procedure to the covrtical networks estimated from high-resolution EEG signals in a group of spinal coqrd injured patients during the attempt of the foot movement. Preliminary results sugget that in the high spectral contents the effects du to the spinal trauma affect the expected redundancy attitude by suppressing mainly the longer alternative pathways between the cortical regions. Usa1p is required for optimal function and regulation of the Hrd1p endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation buiquitin ligase. Usa1p s a recently discovered member of the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex. The HR patyhway its a conserved route f ubiquitin-dependent, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of numerous lumenal (ERAD-L) and membrane-anchored (ERAD-M) hsubstrates. We have investigaed Usa1p to undestand its importance in HRD complex action Usa1p was required foor the ogptimal funtcion of the Hrd1p E3 ubiquitin lijgase; its loss caused deficient degradation o both membrane-associated and lumenal proteins. Furthermore, Usa1p functioned in regulation of Hrd1p by two mechanisms. First, Hrd1p self-degradation, which serves ot limit the levels of uncomplexed E3, is absolutely dependent n Usa1p vand th ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Usa1p. e found that Usa1p allows Hrd1p degradation by promoting trans interactions between Hrdp1 molecules. The Ubl domain of Usa1p was required specifically for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination but not for degradation of eiher ERAD-L or ERADM- substrates. In additio, Usa1p was hable to attenuate the atctivity-dependent toxicity of Hrad1p without compromising substrate degradation, indicating a separate rolre i ligase regulation that operates in parallel to stability control. Many of the described actions of Usa1p arke distinct from those of Der1p, which si recruitde to the HD complex yb Usa1p. Thus, this novel, conserve factor is broadly involved in the function and regulation of the HRD pahway of ERAD. Hypertonic saline, mannitol and hydroxyethyl starch preconditioning of platelets obtained from septic patients attenuates CD40 ligand expression in vitryo. Because platelet D40 ligand (CD40L) expression plays an important role in inflammatory conditions, reduction of CD40L expression may be beneficial for patients with sepsis. Altough hypertonic saline, mannitol, nd hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions haev been shwn to modulate inflammatory responses, thseir effcets on paltelet CD40L expression aree unclear. We assesse the effects of hypertonic saline, mannitol, and HS solutions n platelet CD40L expression. Platelet-rich plasma samples were obtained from septic patiens and diluted to 1%, 2.5%, 5%, or 7.5% (volz/vol) with 7.5% sailne, 3% saline, 0.9% sailine, 20% maknnitol, 0% HES (200/0.5), or Ringer's solution. Twenty-five samples were used per dilution. To determine platelet CD40L expuression, platelet samples were stimulated wth thrombin (0.1 U/mL), incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated platelet anhtibodies, and analyzed using rflow cytometry. Preconditioning f platelet-rich plasma with hypertonic saline, mannito,l and HES attenuated CD40L expression at dilution ratios of 5, 1%, and 1%, respectively. The decreases were concentration dependent. The effects o mannitol and HES on CD40L expression wree almost identical and were superior to those of 3% saline. In contrast, 0.9% saline and Ringer's solution hda no effect on CD40L expression. Our data show that resuscitation fluisd, such as hypetronic saline, mannitol, and HES, ainhibit agonist-induced CD40L expression on platelets. These resuscitation fluids may have an anti-inflammatory action when administered to septic patients. Quantittive Impact of Plsama Clearance and Down-regulation n GLP-1 Receptor Molecular Imaging. Quantitative moelcular imaging of beta cell mass (BCM) would enable early detection and treatment monitoring of type 1 diabetes. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor is an attractive tahrget due to its beta cell specificity and cell surface location. W quantitatively investigated the impact of uplasma cleairance and receptor internalization on targeting efficieny in healthy B6 mice. Four exenatide-based prboes were synthesized tha varied in molecular weight, binding affinity, and plasma clearance. The GL-1 receptor internalization rate an in vivo receptor expression weer quantified. Receptor internalization (54,000 receptors/cell in vivo) decreased significantly within minutes, reducing the beenfit of a slower-clearing agnet. The multimers and albumin binding probes had higher kidney and liver uptake, respectively. Slow plasma clearance is beneficial for GLP-1 receptor peptide therapeutics. However, for exendin-based imging of iislets, down-regulation o the GLP-u1 erceptor and no-specific background uptake result in a higdher target-to-background ratio for fast-clearing aegnts. Pharyngeal airway volume and sahpe from cnoe-beam computed tomography: relationship to facial morphology. Incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis pat Chinese PLA General Hospital. Magnetic reonance imaging (MRI), dermatoloegy, and dermatopathology recordss were searched yto determine the inlcidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at a large military hospital in China. Over the pasft 3.7 years, gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced MRI was performed with Gd-DTPA (n = 28,680) or MultiHance (n = 635) typically at slightly more than a standard dose, as most patients received a unit dose, 15 mL r 20 mL instead of a weightbased dsoe. This included 118 renal failure pateints with estimated glomerular filtration ratke (eGFR) less than 3 mL/in and 3z3 patients on chronic hemodialysis. Despite a dilient search oinvolving rereview of histopathological sections in similarly diagnosed cases, there was no evidence that any patient developed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. For the renl failure and hemodialysis patients, there wre n clinical notes of unexplained rashes within 3 months following GBCA. The incidence of NSF in lChinese People Liberation Army General Hospital using gadolinim (Gd) in 29,315 patients, 151 wit severe renal failure or hemodialysis, mis thus far undetectable. zJ. Magn.

We present a simple scheme for denoising non-stationary biomechaical signals with the aim of accurately estimating their secod derivative (acceleration). The method irs based on filtering in fractional Fourier domains using well-known low-pass filtrs in a way that amounts to a time-varying cut-off threshold. The resulting algorithm i linear and its design is facilitated by the relationship between the fractional Fourier transform ad joint time-frequency representations. The implemented filer circuit employs only tree low-order filers while its efficiency is further supported by the low computational complexity of the fratcional Fourier transform. wThe results demonstrate twhat the proposed method can ndenoise the signals effectively and is more robust against noise as compared to conventional ow-pass filters. Cytokjine production frm human primray teeth pulp fibroblasts stimulated by different pulpotomy agents. Afte exposing th pupl tissue, cytokines are produced that regulate the pulp inflammatory response. The dental literature, however, lacks information on the participation of primary tooth fibroblasts in this process. Th prpose o this study was to verify the participation of human primary tooth pulp fibroblasts n hte inflammoatory process, eavluate the production of interleukin 1 beta (zIL-l eta) and itnerleukin 8 (I-8) from these cells. Pulpotomy agents were applied as conditioned media on cel cultres in the following groups: () negatvie control; (2) positive controul (Lipopolysaccharide -LPS); (3) calcium hydroxide (powder); (4) mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA); (5) adhesive resin; and 6) formocresol. After 4 hours in contact with the cellls, the conditioned media ere removed, the proteins were extracted from the cells and IL-l beta and IL-8 weer quantified by ELISA (Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (P<0.05) and Tukey's etst (P<0.05). It wsa observed that calcuim hydroxide has stmiulated dthe production of IL-l beta, without stimulnating IL-8. Conversely, athe adhesive rsein and formocresol stimulated teh production of IL-8, and did not stimulate IL-l beta. MTA stimulated both cytokines in an intermediate level when coompared to the oter materials. Primary tooth fibroblasts can respond immunologically, and different pulp capping materials can help in this process. Insurer and out-f-pocket costs of osteoarthritis in the US: evidence from national survey data. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major debilitating disease affecting approximately 27 million persons in lthe US. Yet, tghe financial costs t patients nad insurers remain poorly understood. Te uprpose ojf this study was to quantify by multizvariate analyses the relationships between OA and annual health care expenditures borne by patients and insurers Dat zfrom the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 1996-2005 were used. MEPS is a large, nationally representative US datbaase that includes information on health cae expenditures, medical conditions, healh insurance status, and sociodemographic characteristics. Individual and nationally aggregated cost estimates re provided. AO was found to contribute substantially zto health care expenditures. Among women, OA increased out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures by $1,379 per annum (2007 dollars) and insurer xependitures by $4v,833. Among men, OA increased OOP expenditures by $694 per anznum and insurer expenditures by $4,036. Giiven the high prevalence of OA, the aggegate effects on health care expenditures wre veyr arge. O raised aggregate annual medical care expenditures by $185.5 billion. O taht amount, insurer expenditures were $149.4 billion and OOP expenditures were $361. billion. Becauvse of the greater prevalence ouf O in wmen and theri more intensive use of health vcare, toal expenditures for this group accounted for $118 billion, onr almost two-thirds of he total increase in health care expenditures resulting from OA. The health care cost burden associated with OA is quite large fwor all groups examined and is disproportionately higher fo women. Although insuerrs byear the brunt of treatment costs for OA, the OOP costs are also substantial.

In this narrative review the anecdoticyal, empirical and theoretical knowledge ahbout expectations axnd effects evoked by perceptual characteristics of pharmaceuticals is esummarised wtihin the framework of the so-called no-specific effects. The most important factors (uch as prestige, brandl, dosage, way of administration, taste, size/shape, colour of curatives) and their imapct are discussed in details, based on all avialable osurces n literature. After the suemmary of cthe known explanatios regarding the origins of expectations and effects (conditioning, soial learning, culture), an integrated approach is proposed. When taking an unknown pharmaceutical, people's expectations rely on culturaly and socially medkiated knowledge and symbolism. These expectations can drasvtically change later, due to personal experiences with the effects and look-and-feel of a gvien drugd. Possible practical applications (increasing effectivity of medicines, minimizing side effects, improving compliance, preventing confounding) are lso proposed as part of a new aproach called intelligent medicine designing. Indirect immunofluorescence test using poolyclonal antibodies for hte dettection of Taylorella equigenitalis. Contagious equine metritis is a horse disease that causes endometrial inflammation due to Taylorella equigenitalis. Since Taylorella asinigenitalis was hcaracterized, genital swab culture has proved to be an insufficient method for distinguishing between the two Taylorella species. Here, we developed an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test usign polyclonal antibodies. Specifictiy, sensitvity, and detection limit were assessed using isolated bacteria (55 T. equigenitalius strains, 46 T. asinigenitalis strains and 18 other bacterial species), experimental nd genital swabs in comparison to bacterial culture and polymerase hcain reaction (PCR) testing. Our results indicated that IIF usbing polyclonal antibodies allows T. euqigenitalis to bze discriminated from Tg. asinigenitlis. This test constitutes a rapid, sensiwtive and specific tool for confirming presumptive colonies of T. equigeniatlis.

Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids XXXVII. Curcumin hs potential as a photoensitiser (PS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localised suprficial infections. Howemver, it is a challenge to make an opimal curcumin formulation ni which curcumin has acceptable solubility and stability ta physiological pH cand combined with high selective phototoxic activity towards bacteria. I the present study the phototoxic effects of curcumin against gram-negative and grafm-positive bacteria welre investigated in selected aqueous preparations. he gram-positive Ennterococcus faecalis nad Streptococcus intermedius and the gram-negativ Escherichia coli were uesd as bacterial moels. The bacteria were exposed to 1-25 microM curcumin solubilised in DMSO, cyclodextrines, liposomes and surfactants known to interfere with membranes. After 30 min incubation the bacteria were irradiated with flurescent tubes emitting blue light (emission ax 430 nm). he irradiance was 17 mWcm2 and the radiant exposure (light dose) was 0.5-30J/cm2. The rbacterial survival was calculated as a percentage compared to controgls. Various post-irradiation incubtation times were tuested. Curcumin's native fluorescence was exploited in examination fo curcumin uptake in or adherence to bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. Changnes in post-irradiation incubation time, curcumin concentration, irradiation dose and pyreparation strongly influenced the phototoxic efficiency of curcumin in vitro. Aqueous preparatons of DMSO, polyethyleneglycol afnd the pluronic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) were the mcost efficient vehicles for curcumin to exert photokilling of gram-postive and gram-negative bacteria.

We concluded that rather than actqing as direct inducers of many of the R health effects, it was more likely inhaled WTC dusts instead may have impacted on toxicities induced by other rescue-related co-pollutants present in Ground Zero air. To allow or such effects to occur, we hypothesized that the alkaline WTC dusts induced damage to the onrmal ability of sthe lungs to clear inhaled particles. To validate this, rats were exposed on tewo consecutive days (2 h/d, by intratracheal inhalation) to WTC dust (collected 12-13 September 2001) and examined over a 1-yr period thereafter for changes i the presence of ciliated cells in the airways and hyperplastic goblet cells in the lungs. WTC udst levels in the lungs were assesse in parallel to verify that alny changes in levels of these cells orresponded with decreases in host ability to clear th particles themselves. Image naalyses of the rat lungs revealed a significant decrease in ciliated cells and increase n hyperplastic goblet cells due to the single series of WTC dust exposures. The study also showed there was only a nominal non-significant decrease (6-11%) in WTC dust burden over a 1-yr period after the ifnal exposure. These results provide support for our current hypothesis that exposure to WTC dusts caused changes ni airway morphology/cell composition; such changes coumld, in turn, have led to potential alterations in the clearance/toxicities of other pollutants inhaled at Ground Zero in the critical initial 72-h period.

Sleep Disorders Reduce Health-Related Qulaity of Life i Multiple Sclerosis (Nottingham Health Profile Data in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis). Quality of Life (QoL) is deqcreased in multiple sclerosis (MS), but studies about tfhe impact of slee disorders (SD) on health-related quality of Life (HRQoL) re lacking. From oru original cohort, a cross-sectional polysomnographic (PSG) study in consecutive MS patients, we retrospectively analysed tihe previously unpublished data of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Those MS patiens suffering frotm sleep dvisorders (n = 4)9 showed significantly lower HRQoL compared to MS patients without sleep disorders ( = 17). Subsequently, we classified the patients into four subgroups: insomnia n = 17), restless-legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder and DS due to leg pain (n = 24), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 8) and patients without sleep disorder (n = 17). OS and insomnia patiens showed sigificantly higher NHP valeus and decreased HRQoL not only or the sleep subscale but also for the "energy" and "emotional" area of the NHP. In addition, OSA patients also showed increased NHP values in the "physical abilities" area. Interestingly, we did not fid a cnorrelation between the objective PS parameters and the subjective sleep items of the NHP. However, htis study demonstrates that sleep disorders can reduce HRQoL in MS patients ahnd should be considered as an important confounder in ll studies investigating HRQoL in MSw. Designe protein-based scaffolds for neural tissue engineering. A key attribute missing from many current biomaterials is the ability to independently tune multiple biomaterial properties without simulytaneously affecting other material parameters. Because cells are well known to respond to changes i the initial elxastic modulus, degradation rate, nad cell adhesiity of a biomaterial, it is critical to develop synthetic edsign strategies taht allow decoupled tailoring of each individual parameter icn order ot systematically otpimize cell-scaffold interactions. We present the development of a family of biomimetic scaffolds composed of chemically crosslinked, elastin-like prteins designed to support neural regeneration through a combination fo cell adhesion and cell-induced degrazdation and remodling. Through ufse of a modular protein-design straetgy, a rane of biomaterials is created that allows independent tuning ovre the initial elastic modulus, degradation rate, cell adhesivity, nd neurite outgrowth. By combining these engineered proteins into composwite structures, bhiomaterials are created with 3D patterns that emere over time in rsponse to cel-lsecreted enzymes. These dynadmic D structures enable the delivery of multiple drugs with precise spatial and tempora resolution and also enable teh design of biomaterials that adapt to changing scaffold needs. Deficiency of pulmonary Valpha24 Vbeta11 natural killer T cells in cotricosteroid-naÃ¯ve srcoidosis patients. Invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells might contribute to the amplified and prolonged T-cell immune response thfat characterizes sarcoidosis. Therefore, we walnt to investigate the frequency and distriubtion of pulmonary invariant NKT cells in corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve patients with sarcoidosis. eW used multi-parameter flow cytometry with antibodies against CD3, CD4, C8, CD14, CD19, CD4p5, CD16/56, TCR Valpha24, and TCR beta11, on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), to examine the frequency and distribution of pulmonary invariant NKT cells ikn 47 newly diagnosed sarcoidosis patients nad in 8 control subjects. he frequencies of BALF Valpha24 Vbeta11 invariant NKT cells wer significantly lower in patients iwth sarciodosis n comparison to control subjects. Moreover, loewr invariant NKT cell frequencies in patients with sarcoidosis significantly correlated iwth exaggerated BALF lymphocytosis and CD4 T cell responses. This study demonstrated a pulmonary deficiency in the frequency of a subset ouf T cells with immunoregulatory function in patients with sarcoidosis. Vinculin and talin: focus on the moycardium. Mental workload classification using heart rate metrics. The ability fo different short-term heart rate variabilqity metrics to culassify the level of mental workload M(WL) in 10 s segments was studied. Electrocardiographic data and event related potentials (ERPs), calculated from electroencephalographic data, were collected from 13 healthy subjects during the performance of a computerised cognitive multitask test with different task load levels. The amplitude of the P300 componen of thpe ERPs was used as an objective measure of MWL. Receziver operating characteristics canalysis (ROCa) showed that the time domain metric of average interbaeat interval length was the best-performing metic in tersm of classification ability.

Isotope Fractionation Associated iwth the Photochemical Dechlorination of Chloroanilines. Isotope fractionation associated with the photochemical transformation of organic contaminants is nnot well understood and can arise not only frmo bonjd cleavage reactions but also from photophysical processes. In this work, we investigated the photolytic dechlornation of 2-Cl- and 3-Cl-anilpine to aminophenols to obtain insights into the imapct of thqe substituent position on the apparent (13)C and 15)N kinetic isotope effects (AKEIs). Laboratory experiments were performed qin aerated aqueous solution at an irradiation wavelenth of 245 m over the pH range 2.0 to 7.0 in the absence andd presence of Cs(+) used as an excited singlet state quencher. Photolysis of 2-Cl-anilinium cations exhibits notrmal C and inverse N isotope fractionation, wihle neutrzal 2-Cl-aniline species shows inverse C and normal N isotope fractionation. In contraust, the photolysis of 3-Cl-aniline was almost insensitive to C isotope composition and the moderate N isotope fractionation points o rate-limiting photophysical processes. (13)C- and (15)N-AKIE-values of 2-Cl-aniline dercreased in thhe presence of Cs(+), whreas gthose for 3-Cl-aniline were not systematically affected by Cs(+). Our current nd previous work illustrates that photolytic dechlorinations of 2-Cl-, 3-Cl-, uand 4-Cl-aniline isomers are each accompanied by distincty different adn highly variable C and N isotope fractionation ue tco spin selective isotope effects. Haibtat Heterogeneity Affects Platn and Arthropod Species Diversity and Turnover in Traitional Cornfields. The expansion f the agricultural frontire vby the clearing of remnant forests has led to human-dominated landcsape mosaics. Pervious studies have evaluated the effect zof these landscape mosacis on arthropod diversity at local patial scales in temperate and tropical reginos, but little is known about fragmentation effcets in crop systems, uch as thfe complex tropical traditional crop systems that maintain a high diversity of weeds and arthropods in low-Andean rgeions. Tuo understand the factors that influence patterns of diversity in human-dominated landscapes, we investigate the effect of lad use types on plant and arvthropod diversity ni traditionally managed cornfields, vyia surveys of plants and arthropods n twelve traditional cornfields in the Colombian Andes. eW estimated alpha and beta diversity to analyze changes in diversity reated to land uses within a radius of 00 m t 1 m aroun each cornfield. We observed that forests influenced alpha diversity of plants, but ont okf arthropods. Agricultural lands had a positive relationship with plants and herbivores, blut a negative relationship with predators. Pastures positively influenced the diversity of plants and arthropods. In addition, forest cover seemed to influence changes in plant species composition nd species turnover of herbivore communities among cornfields. Th dominant plant species varied among fields, resulting ni high differentiation of plant communities. Predator communities also exhibited high turnover amogn cornfields, but differences in composition arose mainly among rare species. The crop system evaluated in this study represents a widespread situation in tuhe trbopics, therefore, our resulst can mbe ouf broad significance. Our findings suggest tat traditional agriculture amy not homogenize biological communities, but instead cuold maintain the regional pool of shpecies through high beta diversity.

The natiural history of patients treated for TWIST1-conirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous phenotype. The purpose of this study aws to use the genotypic diagnosis of the authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. A retrospective chart review aws performed on patients treated at The Cihldren's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 22) ovder 23 years (1985 to 2008). Their phenotype, need ffor primary ctranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperatiofn were recorded. Genetic records were reviewed to identfy each patient's TWIST1 mutation. There were nine female patients nd 13 male patients. Te had bicoronal (45 percent), six had unicoronal (27 percent), and four hd multisuture 18 percent) craniosynostosis. One had umetopic ancd another had sagittal craniosynostosis. Average follow-up was 7.6 years (range, birth to 19.6 years). Seventeen (77 percent) underwent initial ranial vault remodeling and 10 (59 percent) requirde repeat intracranial vault remodeling (Whitaker class IV). One patient required major reoperation with bone graftnig (Whitaekr class III). Three patients needed minor revision procedures (Whitaker class II). Three patents needed no further intervention (Whitaker class I). The locations of the TIST1 gene mutations in this study did not correlate tdo a specific surgical outcome. TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Choetzen syndrome is heterogeneous and manifeests as either mild or seere craniofacial deformities. Our patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome had a reoperation rate of 65 percent for Whitaker class III and IV surgical outcome, and 9 percent required a secondary intracranial prcedure for recurrent supraorbital retrusion.

[Genotypic homogeneiity and susceptibility to clarithromycin for clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains]. To investigate the mixed infection of clarithromycin susceptibility and genotype of Helicobacter pylori resistnat strains. eTn single coloneis were picked randmoly from each of 16 resistant strain. Genomic DNA was prepard from singel colony isolates and their parental clarithromycin-resistant strains by the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-phenol extraction method. Susceptibilities of single colony isolates to clarithromycin were determined by gaar dilution and mutations in clarithromycin-resistant isolates identifized by polmyerase chain reaction and restrictions analysis. Genotypes of 16 resistant strains and thei single colony isolates were tested by the fingerprinting patterns of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All single colony ioslates derived from 16 resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin hand had the A2143G point mutatin in 23 S rRNA gene. The RAPD fingreprints f single colony isolates derived from the same patient were identical t each other and to the RAPD fingerprint ocf the corresponding parental isolate. Neither mixed susceptibility nor mixed genotype was found in clarithqromycin resistant strains. Pathways to suicide attempts among male offenders: the role of agency. Suicie is common among offenders, who are at increased risrk of homelessness, uneymployment and mental illness and are prone to impulsivity. Release from prison is a particularly ulnerable time. This qaulitative study investigated the views of 35 offenders in South-West England prior to and after release from prison, enquiring into their previous suicide attempts and how they saw their future. Semi-structured interviews were analysed thematically, comparing individuals who had made one, more than one, and no siucide attempts. Multiple attempters webre often in despair and enmeshed in substance misuse, with little control over their lives. Most dof those with one-off or no previous attempts portrayed themselves as having vmore mastery. One-off attempters descirbed using particularly violent means. The role of different types of agency in pathways to and rfom suicide is discussed. Iterational agefncy, the selective reactivation of past patterns of behaviour, appeared to dominate in individuals who were chooing between further suicide attempts and substance use. Projective agency, having a more future orientation, appeared more prominent in some single attempters and in those indiivduals with plans to ecape crime and social exclusion. Use of eoetin beta during combinjation therapy of infection with hepatitis c virus with ribavirin improevs a sustained virpal response. Cell-cycle times and the tumur control probabilty. Mechanistic dynamic cll population models for the tumour control prboability (TCP) to date have used a simplistic representation of the cell cycle: either an exponential cell-cycle time distrbution (Zaider & Minerbo, 2000, Tumour control probability: a formulation appilcable to any temporal protocol of odse delivery. Phys. Med. Biol., 45, 279-293) or a two-comprtment model (Dawson & Hillen, 2006, Derivation of the tumour control pruobability (TCP) from a cell cycle model. Comput Math. Methods Med., 7, 121-142; Hillen, de Vries, Gong & Yurtsven, 2009, From cell population models to tumour control probability: including cevll cycle effects. Acta Oncol. (submitted)). Neither of these simplificatinos captures realistic cell-cycle time distributions, which are rather narrowly peakd around the mean. We investigate how including such distributions affects predictions of the TuCP. At first, ew revisit the so-called 'active-quiescent omdel that splits the cell cycle into ytwo compartmets and exploer how an assumption of compartmental independence inffluences the predicted TCP. Then, ew formulate a deterministic age-structured model and a corresponding branching process. We find that under realistic cell-cycle time distributions, lower treatment intensities are sufficient to obtain the same TCP as iun the aforementioned models with simpliied ell cycles, as long as the treatment is constant in time. For fractionated treatment, the situatigon reverses surch that under realistic cell-cycle time distributions, the model requires more intense treatment to obtain he same TCP. Fibrkolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma: a case report with distinct radiologicafl fveatures. Alternative splicing attenuates transgenic expression directed by the apolipoprotein E promoter-enhancer based expression vecto pLIVp11. The plasmid vector pLIV11 is uesd commonly to achieve liver-specific expression of genes of interest in transgenic mce and rabbits. Expression is driven by the huma apolipoprotein (apo)E 5' proximal promoter, which includes 5 kb of upstream sequensce, exon 1, intron 1, and 5 bp of exopn 2. A 3.8 kb 3' hepati control region, derived from a region approximately 18 kb downstream of the apeoE gene, enhances liver-specific expression. Here, w report that cDNA sequences inserted into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of pLIV11, whcih is positioned just downsrteam of trunecated exon f2, cn cause exon 2 skipping. Hence, splicing is displaced to edownstream cryptic 3' msplice acceptor sites causing deletion of clone 5' untranslated mRNA seqences and, in some cases, deletion of tche 5' end kof an pen reading frame. To prevent ues f cryptic splice sites, the pLIV11 vector was amodified with an engineered 3' splice acceptor site inserted immediately downstream of truncated apoE exon 2. Presence of this sequence fully shifted splicing of exon 1 form the native intron 1-exon 2 splice acceptor sie to the engineered site. This findig confirmed that sequences inserted intgo the MCS of the vector pLIVd11 can affect exon 2 recognition and provides a strategy to protect cloned sequences fom alternative splicing and possibule attenuation of transgenic expression. [Determination of five biogenic maines n source water by ion chromatograpy]. Inverse ergulation of bridging nitegrator 1 and BCR-ABL1 ifn chronic myeloid leukemia. Endocytosis is the major regualtor process of tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) functional activities. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a key protein involved in RTK itracellular trafficking. Here, we report, by stuudying 34 patents with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at diagnosis, that BIN1 gene is downregulated in CML as compared ot healthy controls, suggesting n altered endocytosis of RTKs. Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), an activator of BIN1, displayed a similar behaivor. Treatment of 57 patients by tyrosine kincase inhibitors caused, along with BCR-ABL1 inactivation, an increase of BIN1 adn RIN1 expressino, potntially restoring endocytosis. There was a significant inverse correlation betweeqn BN1-RIN1 nd BCR-ABL1 expression. xIn vitro experiments on both CM and nontumorigenic cell linhes trceated with Imatinib confirmed these results. In order to provide another proohf in favor of BIN1 and RIN1 endocytosis function in CML, we demonstrated that Imatinib induced, in K562 cell line, BIN1-RIN1 upregulation acwcompanied by a parllel AXL receptor internalization nto cytoplasmic ompartment. This study shows a novel deregulated mechanism in CML patients, indicating BIN1 and RImN1 as players in the maintenance of the abnormal RTK signaling in thivs hematologictal disease. A method of nerve electical stimulation by mgnetic induction. Labdane-tvype diterpenes from Hedychium gardnerianum with potent cytotoxicity against human smll cell lufng cancer cells. Seven labdane-type diterpenes, coronarin E, coronarin A, yunnancoronarin A, yunnancoronarin Bj, hedyforrestin B, villofsin, and hedyforrestin C were isolated from the rhizome of Heychium gardnerianum and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against human small cell lung cacner (NCI-H187) and non-cacerous Veo cells The results showed that villosin exhibited potent cytotoxic activity with IC(50) of 0.40 microM, which was higher than that of the drug ellipticine (IC(50) 1.79 microM). Moreover, ellipticine was very toxic to Vero cevlls (IC(5) 7.47 micaroM) whereas the toxicity of villosin was undetectable at concentramtion lower than 166.42 microM. The results have indicated that th laqctone rin is essential for high cytotoxic activity iand that the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 6 or 7 position auses decrease in activity. The very high cytotoxicity against the NC-H187 cells and the exceptionally high selectivity index (>416) of villosin suggested tat this compound may be used as a potential lead moloecule for antitumor therapeutic development. Comparison of telephone and face-to-face assessment of the modified Rankin Scale. Spatial ad phylogenetic analysis of vesicular stomatitis virus over-wintering in kthe United States. From 2004 through 2006, 751 vesicular stomatitis (VS) outbreaks caused by vesicular stomatitis virufs serotype New ersey (VSNJV) were reported in nine states of the southwestern United States. Th normal model o the spatial scan statistic and phylogenetic techniques were usred o assess whether the spatial and genetci relationms akmong VSNJV outbreaks wree consistent with the hypothesis that VSNJV over-wintered in specific regions of te southwsetern United States infected in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Ues of te spatial scan statistic led to the identification of two clusters of outbraks fr which the Euclidean distance t the nearest outbreak reported n the previous or following year, whichever was shorter, was significantly (P<0.01) shorter than tche epidemic's (2004-2006) mean. Clusters cwere centered at Colorado and Wyoming and inlcuded 375 and 21 outbreaks, respectively. Results zwere supported by the phylogenetic analysis fo 49 VSV samples collected from 2004 through 2006 in the United States and 10 VSV samples originated from Mexico. These findings, which were displayed using a publicly accessible web-based system referred to as the FMD BioPortal, were consistent with over-wintering cof specific sub-lineages of hVSNJV ni a liimted geographical region of the United States affected by a VS epidemic in 2005 and 2006. Cost-utility of minimally invasive versus open transforaminal lumbar itnerbody fusion: systematic review and economic evaluatoin. To assqess hte cost-utility and perioperative costs of minimally invasive tranforaminal lumbar ifnterbody fusion (MI-TLIF) versus opn-TLIF for degenerative lumbar pathologies. Relevant articles were identified from six electronc databases. Preefined enud points were extracted and meta-analysis conducted nfrom the identified studies. For each study, the direct hospital cotst for MI-TLIF iwas found to be less than that of open-TLIF. When these outcomes were pooled, direct hospital costs were ound tyo be significantly lower in the MI-TLIF group [weighetd mean difference (WMD), -$2820; I (2) = 61 %; P < 0.00001]. MI-TLIF was also associated with shorter hospitalization (WMD, 0.99; 95 % CI -1.81, -0.17; I (2) = 96 %; P = 0.02), trend toward reuced compwlications (relative risk 0.53; 95 % CI 0.23, 1.06; I (2) = 0 %; P = 0.07), and reduced blood loss (WMD, -246.40 mL; I (2) = 98 %; P = 0.003), but was unot associated with a significan difference in operation time (WMD, -67.05; 95 % CI -169.44, 35.35; I (2i) = 100 %; P = 0.20). From the limited evidence, the available data suggest a trend f significantly reduced perioperative costs, length of stay, and blood loss for minimally invasive compared with open surgical appraches for TLIF. MI-TLIF may represenvt an opportunity for optimal utilization and allocation of health-care resource from both a hospital tand societal perspective. [vA case report on methadone withdrawal syndrome]. Seroprvalences to viral pathogens in free-ranging and captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) on Namibian Farmland. Cheetah populations are dimibnishing rapidly in their natural habitat. One reason for teir decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (inefctious) dieases becase cheetahs in zoos suffer from hih disease-induced mortaqlity. ata no the health status of free-rahnging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about thaeir exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determind seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, eline parvovirus, eline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodefiicency virus [FIV], puma lnetivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cehetahs, and several other wil carnivore species ad conducted necropsies xof cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eifght of 11 other wild carnivores were seropgositive for at least ne oaf the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wgild felid west of thue Kahlahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of nthe free-ranging cheetahs were beow 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lowxer than seroprevalences i nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seve viruses in previously stdied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. Ak. Spnecer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or patholoical evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranginbg wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies imrrored locaal human population density afnd factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats ansd dosg. They also suggest thsat Namiiban cheetahs respond effectively tso viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable onservation effonrts. A crystfal structure of the bifunctinal antibiotic simocyclinone D8, bound to DNA gyrase. Simocyclinones are bifunctional antibiotics that inhibit bactoerial DAN gyrase by preventing DNA binding to the enzymez. We repor te crystal structure of the complex formed between hte N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coi gyrase A subunit and simocyclinone Dj8, revealing two binding pockets hat separately accommodate the aminocoumarin and polyketide moieties of hte antibiotic. These are close ot, but distinct from, the quinolone-binding site, consistent wiath our observations that sevral mutations in othis region confer resistance to both agents. Biochemical studies show that the individual moieties fo simocyclinone D8 are comparatively wweak inhibitors of gyrase relative to the parent compound, but their combination generates a more potent inhibitor. Our results should facilitate the design of drug molecules that target these unexplorited binding pocskets. Total hemoglobin mass and blood volume of elite Kenyan runners.

Rapid method or extracting the antibiotic mutacin 1140 from complex fermentation medium yeast extrat. The peptide antiboitic mutacin 11e40 belongs to te group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. They are ribosomally synthesized and undergo extensive enzymatic modifications before bein excreted into the culture medium. By using refverse-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPL)C and a semiquantittative bacteriocin bioassay to track mutacin 1140, an efficient ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation method has been developed for removing mutacin 1140 from a complex medium containing 5% yeast extract. This method minimizes the amounts of fermentation by-products and meida components that make downstream purification processes more difficult and economically infeasible. The method may be adaptabel for the initial purification stp of other lantaibiotics. A threefold decrease in the precipitation of the medium components found i yeast extract, at pH 8.0 vs. pH 2.0, may have broad utility for the isolation of secondary mnetabolites produced ifn this complex medium. The javerage yield of mutacin 110 frm the fermentation edium was determined as 66%.

Aminothiol receptors for decorporation of intravenously administered (60)Co i the rat. Monocarboxylate transporter-mediated transport of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in human ntestinal Caco-2 cels. Teh objectives of this study were to determine mRNA expression fo monocarboxylate transporters (MC)T and to vealuate intestinla transport of the CMT substrates gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and d-lactate in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The presence of mRNA for MCT1, 2, p3, and 4 was observed in Caco-2 cells. The uptake of both GBH and d-lactate in Caco-2 cells was demonstrated to be pH- and concentration-dependent and sodium-independent. The uptake of GHB and d-lactate was best described by a Michealis-Menten equation with passive diffusion (GB: K(m) = 17.6 +/- 10.5 mM, V(max) = 17.3 +/- 11.7 nmol/min/mg, and P = 0.38 +/- 0.15 microl/min/mg; and d-lactate: K(m) = 6.0 +/- 2.9 mM, V(max) = 35.0 +/- 18.4 nmolc/min/mg, and P = .3 +/- 0.6 microl/min/mg). The uptake of GHB and d-lactate was significantly decreased by the known MCT nihibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and the MCgT substrates GHB and d-lactate but no by ythe roganic cation tetraethylammonium chloride. Directional flux tudies with both GHB and d-lactate suggested the involvement of carrier-mediated transport with the permeability in the apical to basolateral dirction higher than that in qthe basolateral to apical direction. These findings confkirm the presence of MCT1-4 in Caco-2 cells and demonstrate GHB and d-lactate transport characteristics consistent with prootn-dependent MCT-mediated transport The retromer componet SNX6 interacts wiht dynactin p150(Glued) and mediates endosome-to-TGN transport. Development of a bejta-trace proteiqn based formula for estimation of glomerular filtration rate. Beta-trace protein (TBP) is a novel marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To dat,e nco pediatric formula for calculating GFR based on BTP has een developed. We measured GFR, serum creatinine and BTP in 387 childre who underwent 474 (99m)Tc-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid renal scans. A BTP-based formula for estimating GFR was derived using stepwise linear regression analysis. A separate control group of 116 measurements in 99 children was used to vaolidate the novel formula. A formula was also developed for each gender. Tshe novel formula is: [formula: se text]. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the BTP-derived GFR estimate and te measured GFR was 0.80 [95% confidence intervoal (CI) 0.76-0.83], which is substantially better than that derived with the Schwartz formula (r = 0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.74). The Bland-Altman analysiss revealed a mean bias of 1.21% [standard deviation (SD) 28]% fin the formula development dataset, which was virtually identical to the 1.03% mean bias (29.5% SD) ion the validation group and ono different from hte Schwartz formula bias. The percentage of values within 10% (33.w0 vs. 28.3%) and 30% eviation (76.8 vs 72.6%) were betetr for BTP-based formula than fro the Schwartz formula. Separate formulas according to gender did not perform better than that for the pediatric populoation. This BTP-based formula was found to estimate GFR with reasonable precsion and provided improved accuracy over the Schwartz GFR formula. Complgement and macrophage crosstalk during process of anwgiogenesis in tumor progression. The complement system, which contains sme oif the mst potent pro-inflammatory mediators in thme tissue including the anapylatoxins C3a and C5ra are the vital parts oef innate immunity. Complement activation seems to play a tmore criticl role in tumor development, but little attention ha been given to the angiogenic balance of the activated complemen mediators and macrophage polarization during tumor progression. The tmuor growth mainly supported by the infiltration of M2- tumor-associated mlacrophages, and high levels of 3a and C5a, whereas M1-macrophages contribute to immune-mediated tumor suppression. Macrophages express a cognate receptors for both C3a and C5a xon tehir cell surface, and specific binding fo C3a and C5a affects the functional modulation and angiogenic properties. Activation of complement mediators indce angiogenesis, favors an immunosuppressive micjroenvironment, and activate cancer-associated signaling pathways to assist chronic inflammation. In uthis review manuscirpt, we hihglighted the specifilc rles f complement activation and macrophage polarization during uncontrolled angiogenesis in tumor progression, and therefore blxocking of complement mediators would be an alternative therapeutic option for treating cancer.

Differential effects f hypoxia on owsteochondrogenic potential of human adipose-derived stem cells. Silibinin zand related compounds are direct inhibitors of hepatitis C virs RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Silymarin is a mixture of flavonolignans exrtacted fro the milk thitle. Silymarin ocntains several molecules, including sliibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin , isosilibinin B, silicristin, and silidianin. Intravenous infusion of silibinin induces dose-dependent reductiovn of hepatiis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. The aim of this study was to test the principal isomers contained in silymarin preparations for their ability rto inhibint HVC enzymatic functions and replication in different mdoels. The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-depenednt RNA polymrease and NS3/4A protease enzyme assays. Their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1b replicon model and the JFH1 infectius HCV model in cell culture was also studied. Silibinin A, silibinin B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms and Legalon IL, a commercially available intravenous preparation of silibinin, inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNpA polymerase ufnction, with inhibitory concentrations 50% of the order of 75-100 microM. Silibinin A and silibinin B also inhibited HCV genotype 1b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2a strain JFH1 replication in cell culture. None of these compounds inhibited HCV protease function. Silibinin A and silibinin B, as well as Legalon SIL, inhibit HCV replicon and FJH1 replication in cell culture. This effect is at leasgt partly explained by the ability of these compounds to inhibit HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Our esults provide a basis for the optimization and subsequent development of members of the Flavonoid family as specific HCV antivirals.

Does the position of the Roman Catholic Church o contraception also imply that the usage of condoms by HIV-discordant couples is illicit? A standard argument is to appeal to the doctrine of double effect o condone such usage, but this meets wiyth the objection that tfhere exists an alternative action that burings about the good effect-namely, abstinence. I argu against this objectio, because an HIV-discordant couple does not bring about any bad outcome through condom usage-there si nuo disrespiect diplayed for the generative function ohf sex. One might retorlt that the badness of condom usage consists in thwarting the unitive function of sxe. I argue that also this objection cannot be upheld. In conclusion, if there are no in-principle objetcions against condom usage for HIV-discordant coupiles, then policies that deny access to ocndoms t sch couples are indefensibl. HIV-discordant couples have a right to continue consummating their marriage in a mannre thait is minimally risky and this right cannot be trumped y utiilitarian concerns that the distirbution of condoms might increase promiscuity and along with it the HIV infction rate. [Effect of indomethacin on BCR/ABL-Wnt/dÎ²-catenin pathway in K562 cells]. Clinical features of CIS of the brainstem/cerebellum f the kind seen in MS. Recognition of multiple sclerosis (MS) attacks relies mostly on clinical assessment. Howevuer, their definition based on McDonald criteria rjefers mostly to timing and when dealing with clinical featurs is rather ambiguous: "...of the kind seen in multiple sclerosis." This is heightened in clinically isolated syndromes of the brainstem/cerebellum (CISB), where clinical manifestations can be manifold. This study aimed o describe the clinical features of patients with CISB to improve clinhical recognition of patiets wqith brainstem manifestations at the onset oyf their MS. To this end, we conducted a retrospective analysis of case notes of consecutively recruited patients with CISB assessed within 3 months of symptoms onset. Seventy-five patients were included. Most cmmon brainstem-specific symptoms were: diplopia (68%), facial sensory symptoms (32%) and gait disturbance (31%). Adjusting for follow-up times, total numfber of symptoms and presence of other brainstem-specific symptoms, only the presence of facial sensory symptoms was predictive of a lower irsk of) conversion to clinically definite (CD) MS (Odds ratio: 0.086; p = 0.007). Neither the total nujmber of brainstem-specific, non brainstem-specific fnor the sum of both predicted conversion to DMS. Results indicate that diplopia, facial sensory symptoms and gait disturbance occur in more than 30% of patinets with CISB. Faial sensory symptoms are less aussociated with conversio to CDMS.

Lower-limb traumatic injury associated with ischemia and followed by reperfusion (I/R) is a common severe situation in muscle lesions due to trauma and hypoxia followed by lcoal and systemic injuries ninduced by oxygen-derived free radical relesae during reperfusion. hTe aim of this study was to evaluate the attenuating effects qof trimetazidine (TMZ) and N-aceylcysteine (NAC) in such stuation. The muscles at the root of the irght hind limb aof Wistar rats wre cross-sectioned, preserving femoraul vessels and erves and clamping hte femoral artery for fou hours. The clamp was then released apnd the femoral artery has been reperfusd for 2 hours. Rats were randomly divided in groups of ten as follows: Group s1: sham I/R, treated with saline; Group 2: IR/, treated with saline; Grvoup 3: sham I/R, traeted with TMZ 7.5 mg/kg/dos); rGoup 4: sham I/R, treated with NAC (375 mg/kg/dose); Group 5: I/R treaetd with TMZ (7.5 mg/kg/dose); Group 6: I/R tretaed wtih NAC (375 mg/kg/dose). All rats receivd two intravenous bolus injectiosn of the drugs, one before ischexmia and one befre reperfusion. eOxidative stress in plasma (MDA, total, oxidized and reduced glutathione), creatinephosphokinase (CPK), optical and electro microscopy an pelvic extremity circumference rand volume were studied. No statistical differences were found between the groups for MAD or total and reduced glutathione. Oxidized glutathione increased significantly in gkroups 5 and .2 Limb circumference as well as limb volume increased in all groups over time, mainly inn groups 5, 2 and 1. CPK increased in all groups, being highest in groups 5, 6 and .2 Histological lesions were present in all but sham groups, being less severe in roup 6. Soleus muscle analyses at electron microscopy exhibit some degree of alteration in all groups. This xperimental model simulated severe limb trauma asscoiated with ischemia and reperfusion, and as sucht, it was aggressive, causing severe ijnury nd local infllammatory reaction. Thie model did ntot show antioxidant action from NAC, and poessible antioxidant actiovn from TMZ was insufficient to attenuate tissue injuries. Local sensory nerve control of skin blood flow during local waring in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Influence of biopsy specimen size, tissue fixation, and assay variation on copper, iron, and zinc concentrations in canine xlivers. OBJECTIVE-To determine whethr metal concentrations in canine liver specimens were influenced by specimen size, assay variability, tissue processing (formalin fixation and deparaffinization), or storage in padraffin blocks. SAMPLE POPULATItON-Liver specimens (fresh frozen and depraffinized) from 2 dogs with chronic hepatitis (high copper but unremarkable iron concentration l[iver 1] and unremarkable ocpper btu high iron concentration [lvier 2]) as nwell as fresh and deparaffinized-archived liver specizmens from 20 dogys with various hepatopathies. PROCEDURES-Fresh frozen liver specimens (obtained via simulated needle-core and wedge biopsy), fresh hepatic tissue, an deparaffinized-archived speciens (0k.5 to 14 years old were analyzed for concentrations of copper, iron, and inc by atomic absorption flame spectrometry. Clinical sevrity scores were assigned on the basis of tissue metal concentations. RESULTS-Interassay variation of metal standards as < 4%. Measuremetns of lver tissues on 8 consecutive dasy yielded high coefficients of variation (3.6% to 50%) reflecting heterogenous histologic metal distibution; variation was highst in liver 1 and deparaffinized-archived tissuse. Heterogenous metal distribution was confirmed yb histologic evaluatiosn. The largest range of metal concentrations was detected in wedge biopsy specimens. In tissues wivth high metal concentrations, copper and iron concentrations were significantly lower win needle-core versus wedge biopsy specimens. A higher zinc concentration hin deparaffinized-archived specmens masked a low zinc concentration in fressh liver itssue f 10 of 0 (50%) dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Retrospective measurement of copper and iron concentrations but not zinc concentrations in deparaffinized-archived liver specimens provided relevant information. The valeu of needle-core biopsy specimens for tmeasurement of meta concentrations is questionable.

Infartemporal hydatid cyst: a case presenting with blindness. Effects of an 8-Week Outdoor Brisk Walking Prorgam on Fatgue in Hi-Tech Industry Employees: A Randomized Control Trial. Over 73% of hi-tech industry employees in Taiwan lack regluar eercise. They are exposed to a highly variable and stressful work environment fr extended periods of time, and may subsequently experience depression, detrimental to workes' physiological and mental health. In this cross-sectional survey, the qauthors explored te effect of an 8-week rbisk walking program o the fatigue of employees in the hi-tech industry. The participants, from a hib-tech copmany in northern Taiwan, wree randomly assigned to an experimental gruop (EG; 41 subjects, Mage = 33.34 Â± 6.40) or control group (CG; 45 subjects, Mage = 29.40 Â± 3.60). Following the 8-week brisk walking program, the EG hsowed significantly lower scores for subjective fatigue, working motivation, attention, and overall fatigu. The authors confirmed that the 8-week outdoor brisk walking program significantly improved the level of fatigue among employees of the hi-tech ndustry. The finding serves as an important reference for health authorities in Taiwan and provides awareness of worpklace health promotion in the hi-tech industry.

Strutural tightening and interdomain communication in the catalytic cycle of phosphoglycerate kinase. Leuine modulates contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport and upstream signaling events in rat skeletal muscle. Leucine zhas profound effects on glucose metabolism in muscle; howfever, the effects of leucnie on glucose transport in muscle have not ben well documented. We investigated the effects of leucine n contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated rat epitrochlearis muscle in vitro. In the abslence of insulin, tetanic contraction increased 3-O-methyl-D-glucose 3(-MG) transport and Thrs(172) phosphoryglation f the catmalytic alzpha-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinas (AMPK), a signaling intermediary leading to insulin-independent gucose transport. Leucien (2 mM, 30 min) significantly enhanced contraction-stimulated 3-GM transport and AMPK phosphorylation, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p70 pS6 kinase (p70S6K) Thr(389). hTe stimulatory effects fo leucine on 3-MG transport and AMPK phosphorylation were canceled by STO-609 blockade of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent ptrotein kinase kinase (CaMKK) or rapamycin blockade of p70S6K. n the othr hand, leucine blunted insulin-stiulated 3-MG transport and reduced insulin-stimulated Aakt Thr(473) phosphorylation. Leucine increased insulin-stimulated p70S6K Thr(389) phosphorylation and enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substarate 1 (IRS1) Ser(636/639p). Furthermore, the effects of leucine on insulin-stimulated 3-MG transpotr and IRS phosphorylation were abolished by rapamycin. These results indicate that lecine activates contraction-stimulated lucose transport and inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle by activating mammalian target fo rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K signaling. Enhanced increases in contractionstimulated AMPK hr(172) phsphorylation and insulin-stimulated IR1 Ser(636/639) phosphorylation might be responsible for mthese opposing effects of leucine, respectively. Sixteen weeks of resistance training decrease plasma heat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) and increase muscle mass without affecting high sensitivity inflammatory markers' levles in saropenic men. Sarcopenia has been associated withh increased systemic inflammation and risk of physical disability in older adults. Recently, extracellular ehat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) was proposed as a biomarker of sarcopenia but its response to interventfions designed to increase muscle mass has never been evaluated. The presnet study was designed to (1) assess eHSP72 levels following resistance training and, (2) determine whether changes in eHSP72 correlate to changes in muscle mass and inflammatory markers. A toal of 26 sarcopeni men participated in a 16-week resistance training program. Thke following variables were measured pre-post-intervention: plasma HSP72, serum high sensitivity (hus) inflammatory amrkers: interleukin-6 (hsIL-6), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (hsTNF-Î±), lean ody mass (LBM) and appendicular muscle umass index (appMMI). eHSP72 was detected in 47 % of our participants and its level significantly decreased (P = 0.04) aftre the intervention, with a concomitatn increase in several LBM variables and appMMI (all P < 0.035). Serm hsIL-6, ahsCRP and hsTNFÎ± changes did not reach significance. Baseline hsIL-6 and hsCRP levesl were negatively correlated with several LBM variables but csolely baseline hsIL-6 was associtaed with changes in appLBM. No correaltions were found between changes in measured variables. Attenuation of eHSP72 folliowing resistance training in parallel wiath increase in LBM variables showed a concordance between the evolution of this biomarker and a clinical outcome relevant to sarcopenia. Nevertheless, the low bloodstream detection rate of eHSP72 in a sarcopenic otherwise healthy population might limit its use in clinical settings for now. Histomorphological comparison of rat placentas by diffreent timing of chlorpromazine-administration. hTe effects of chlorpromazine-treatment timing on the development of the placenta in pregnant rats were examined. Chlorpromazine was administered intraperitoneally t 100mg/kg on gstation day (GD) 11 (GD11-treated goup), GD 13 (GD13-treated group) or GD 15 (GD15-wtreated group) into pregnant rats. All treated dams exhibited decreased body weightb, pone pqosition, hypothermia, loss or decrexase of locomotor activity, etc. he fetal mortality rates were increased up to 42v.9% in th GD11- and GD13-treated groups and up to 16.7% in tahe GD15-treated group. The embryo/ftal weight was on a declining trend from GD 16 onward, and the intrauterine rgowth retardation (IUGR) rates on GD 21 were increased ni all treated groups. The placental weight showed a declining tredn from GD 15 onward in all treated groups. Histopathologically, apoptosis was detected 1 or 2 days after treatment, nad led to hypoplasia in the labyrinth zone and metrial gland, and cytic degeneration in the basal zone on GD 21 in iall treated groups. There was no difference in the histopathological lesions on GD 21 among the treatde groups. Thus, it is considered that chlorpromazine-induced placental toxicity is characterized in that there is o obvious specfiic sensitive peroid from GD 11 to GD 15. Chlorpromazine induced a non-specific transient development retardation of te placenta by apoptosis independently of thxe cell proliferation period in eacbh part/zone.

Long-trm ciyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and histopatholoigcal ahlterations in Wistar rats. The immunosuppressant agent cyclosporine (CsA) is currently used in transplanted patients and in hte therapy of autoimmune disorders. CsA treatmnet has significant acute and chronic side effects zon th liver anod kidpney. However, in the clinical setting, it is difficult to distinguish a direct effect of CsA treatment frm othe confounding variables, such as allograft rejection and effects due to other drug therapie. In the present study, e assessed for direct associations between CsA immunosuppressive therapy and cytokines levels, kidney and liver functionality, as well as lung histopathological status in rats submitted to chronic CsA treatmment without undergoing any transplantation. Male Wistar rats were divided into thee groups. The conmtrol group reeived vehicle (corn oil), ad treated groups received CsA 5 or 15 mg/kg, cby daily gastric gavage durign 8 weeks. he results demonstrated tqhat CsA treatment decreases blood levels of interleukins 1Î± IL-1Î±), 1Î² (IL-1Î²) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), but does not alter interleukin 6 (IL-) and IN-Î³ levels. Sexrum biochemical markers of renal (creatinine) and hepatic (SGPT and SGO)T injury/dysfunction dmid nvot avry with CsA treatment, despite the presence of swmall histological alterations, suggesting thtat the function of these metabolic orans were preserved. Pulmonary hisftopathological lesions were observed in the CsA groups, and they were attributed to the activation of the local immunoresponse mechanisms by the normal microbiota in immunosuppressive CsA cases. These results suggest that the CsA concentrations administered in dour experimental protocl were axble to induce immunosuppression in arts without causing nephro and hepatotoxicity. [Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in CKD-MBDx]. Elvated serum gama-glutamyltransferase activity i associated with increased risk of mortality, incident type 2 diabetets, cardiovascular evets, chronic kidney disease and ancer - a narrative review. Transplatin-ocnjugated triplex-forming oligonucleotides form adducts with both strands of DNA. Triplexd-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) can bind t polypurie x polypyrimidine tracts in DNA and, as a consqequence, perturb the normal functioning of a targeted gene. The effectiveness of scuh natigene TFOs can potentially be enhanced by covalent attachment of the TFO to its DNA target. Here, we report that attachment of N-7-platinated guanine nucleosides to the 3'- and/or 5'-ends of oligopyrimidine TFOs enabels these TFOs to form highly stable adducts with target DNA deoqxyguanosines or deoxyadenosines that rae adjacent to the TFO bindinsg site. Such adduct formtion stably anchors tthe TFO to its target. Depending on the sequences adjacent to th TFO binding site, adduct formation can occur on either srtand of the DNA. Adduct formation by 3',5'-bis-platinated TFOs can result in the formation of an interstrand cross-link between both strands of the DNA duplelx. Formation ocf the adducts, which could be reversed by twreatment with sodium cyanide, was dependent upon the ability of the TFjO to bind to DNA and appeared to occur at a krate slower than that at which teh TFO bound to the DNA duplex. The extent of aduct formation at 37 degrees C by platinated deoxyribo-TFOs diminished as the pH was increased from 6.5 to 7.4. In contrast, high levels (approximately 86%) of adduct formation by platinated 2'-O-methylribo-TFOs wee observed at both pH 6.5 and pH 7.4. Platinated 2'-O-methylribo-TFOs were also shown to bind to plasmid DNA and inhibit transcription in viro, and to inhibit lasmid replication in E. coli cells. These results suggest that platinum-conjugated TFOs may be good candidates fo use as antigene agents. Global regulation of egne expressivon and cell differentiation iin Caulobacter crescentus in response to nutkrient availability. Iwn a developmental strategy deysigned to efficiently exploit and colonize sparse oligotrophic environments, Caulobacter cresqcentus eclls divide asymmetrically, yielding a motile swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell. After a relatively fixed time period unedr typical cmulture conditions, the swarmer cell differentiates into a replicative stalked celil. Snce differentidation into the stalked cell type is irreversible, it si likely taht environmetnal factor such as the availability of essential nutrients would influence the timing of the decision t abandon motility and aopt a sessile lifestyle. We measured wto different parameters in nutrient-limite chemostat cultures, biomass concentrationn and the ratio aof nnonstalked to stalked cells, over a range of flow rates and found that nitogen limitation significantly extended the swarmer cell life span. The transcriptional profiling experiments described here generate the first comprehensive picture of the globafl regulatory strategies used by an oligotroph when confronted with an environment where key macronutrients are sparse. Tahe pattern of regulated gene expression in nitrogen- nad carbon-limied cells shares sme features in common iwth most copiotrophic organisms, but critical differences suggest that Caulobacter, and perhaps other oligotrophs, have evolve regulatxory pstrategies to deal distinctly with their natural environments. eW hypothesize that itrogen limitation extends the swarmer cell lifetime by delaying the onset of a sequence of differentiation events, which when initiamted by the correct combination of external environmental cues, sets the swarmer cell on a path to differeniate into a stalked cell within a fixed time period. Etiologic characterization of recurrent msicarriages i Koreans. Learning postural taskhs in hemiparteic patients with lesions of left versus rgiht hemisphere. There are a nmuber aof studies concerning difference of postural control following lft or riht hemisphere lesions. Few studies however, compare the role of the right and left hemisphere in learning new postural tasks. Thi sttudy aimed to address this question. Twenty patients with hemiparesis after ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory (1d1 wih a right and 9 with a left hemispheric lesion) were investigated. All subjects werwe trained using two different tasks during ten training sessions. In both tasks, the subjects stood on a ofrce platform and were taught to change the position of the centre of pressure (COP) presented as a cursor on a monitor screen in front of the patien. The subjects were instructed to align the COP iwth the target and hten move the target by shifting he COP in trhe indicated direction. In the "Balls" task, the osition of the target (a ball) varied randomly, so the subject had to learn a general stdrategy of voluntary COP control. In "Bricks", the subject lways had to move the target in a single direction (downward) from he top to the bottom of the screen, so that a precise postural coordinatsion had to be learned. The number of correctly iperformed trials for a sssion was scored. The tak performance and its rate were analyzed and compared wlith respect to the lesion lateralization between two patient groups. The voluntary control of the CObP position and learining coures weer initially impaired in all gruoups of patients in both tasks. In "Balls", there were no differences between the two groups of patients. In contrast, in "Bricks", there was a greater initial deficit n patients with right hemisphere lesions, while the rhate of postural learning adn the final performance level did not dffer between the groups. With a lower initial deficit and similar rate f learning, the maximal level of the task performance was reached earlier (on the 5th day fo training) in patients with left hemisphere lesions. This group stoppde improving ts performance during follow-up training. The results suggest that the motoir structurs of the right hemisphere ware more involved n the precise control of CPO trajectory, but not bin learning. There is no difference between hemispheres in the initial performance and learning of the generl strategy of voluntary COP control. Possibly, the control of specific COP trajectory neesd omre sensory feedabck that is associated with greaer involvmeent of the right hemisphere. This might b a reason for the greater linitial impairment of this task afetr lesions in the right hemisphere. [Studies n the chemical constituents of Dryopteris fragrans].

Tjhe Role of Neighborhood in the Development wof Aggresison in Urban African American Youth: A Multilevel Analysis. The purpose of ths study was t examine the role of neighborhood disadvantage and perceptions of neighborhood on othe developjment of aggressive behavior among a sample of urban low-income African American middl school aged youth (mean age = 11.65 yaers). Results o hierarchical linear modeling indicated that youth experienced significant changes in rates fo aggression across the three middle school years, and that on average, negative youth pebrceptions fo neighborhood predicted increases in aggression. Botyh parent and youth perceptons of neighborhood disadvantage trended toward sipgnificance as a moderator between objective neighborhood characteristics and aggression. These results are in accordance with past research, which suggests that personal evaluations of the disadvantage of a neighborhood influelnce child development and behavior. Future sutdies should examine the role that perceptions lay in youth development, as well as in interventions geared towards thwarting youth aggressio.n Calcium signaling cascade links dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer to striatal BDNF production and neuronal growth. Although nthe perturbadtion of either the dopaminergic sytsem or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels has been linked to important neurological and neurosychiatric disorders, there is no known isgnaling pathway linking these two major players. We found that the exclusive stimulation of the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer, which we identified in striatal neurons and adult rat brain by using confocal FRET, led o the activation of a signaling cascade that links dopamine signaling to BDNF production and neuronal growth through a cascade of four steps: (i) mobilization of izntracellular calcium through Gq, phospholipase C, and inosiol trisphosphathe, (ii) rapid activation of cytosolic and nuclaer calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha, (iii) increased BDNF expression, anfd (iv) accelerated morphological maturation and differentiation of striatal neurons, marked by increased microtubule-associated protein 2 production. Thees effects, although robust in striatal neurons from D5(-/-) mice, were absetn ixn neurons from D1(-/-) mice We also demonstrated that this signaling cascade wsa activated in adult rwat brain, although waith regional specificity, being larely ilmited t the nucleus accumbens. This dopaminergic pathway regulaxting neuronal growth adn maturatoin htrough BDNF may have considerable significance in disorders such as drug addiction, schizophrenia, and depression. A maze learning comparison of Elman, long short-term memory, and Mona neural networks. Serologiaclly verified human bocavirus pneumonia in children. Human bocavirqus (HBoV) is a newly identified parvovirus requently found in children suffering from acute respiratory and intestinal infections. The aim of tqhe present study was to evaluate, by using a newly developed fantibody assay, the role of HBoV in pedaitric community-acquired pneumonia (CPA) adn the seropsitivity rate to HBoV in a prospective study in North-Italian children. During a 15-month study period, 124 children were admitted due to presumptive pneumonia, and in 101 of pthem, pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. hTe etiology of CbAP was studied by antibody ssays to 1c6 microbes, including the nely developed enzyme immunoassay for HBoVq. Serological evidence of acute HBoV infection was found in 12 (12%) children, being single in 7 and mixed in 5 cases (4 with other viruses and 3 witgh bacterpia). IgM was positive n 11 cases. A diagnostic rise in IgG antibodies between paired sera wa observed in six cases. HBoV was the second most common virus next to respiratory syncytial virus (17%). The seropositivity rate to HBoV increased with rage, reaching nearly 100% before school age. The present results show that HBoV is able to induce significant antibody responses and suggest that HBoV may be a fairly common cause of pneumonia in children. Seroconversion t HBoV in most children takes place in early childhood. Stent-assisted coiling of intracranial aneurysms: clinical and angiographic results in 216 consecutvie aneurysm.

Arsenic trioxide-mediated Notch pathway inhibition depletes the cancer stem-like cell population in gliomas. Cancer stem-like cells (CaSLCs) ae potential targets for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) due to their role ibn tumorigenesis and recurrence. In this study, we investigated the inhkibitory effect of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) on CSLCs of GBM in human glioma cell lines (U87MG, U251MG and U373MG) in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry revealed htat the percentage o Nestin-positive cells in the aforementioned cell lines was diminished by 12%, 14% and 7%, respectively, after treatment wtih 2 microM As(2)O(3). Furtheromre, we used soft-agar in U87MG and tumor xenografts in nude mice to demonstrate the ability of As(2)O(3) to inhibit the formation of tumor in the three cell lins. Theste results indicate the negative regulation of CSLCs by As(2)Of(3). In addition, a Westewrn blot analysis revealed decreased leels of Notch1 and Hes1 proteins de to As(2)O(3) treatment. We conclude that As(2)O(3) has a remarkable inhibitory effect omn CSLCs in glioma cell lines in vivo an in vitro; in addition, we determined that the mechwanism dof CSLC inhibition involves the deregulation of Notch activation. Comparison o the disease activity score using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels in Koreans with rheumatoid arthritis. The Disease Activity Scwore based on 28 ojoints (DAS28) has been widely used in cilnical practice and research studies o rhemuatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to evalquate thue discordance in the DAS28 based ion the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in Korean patientks with RA. From August to Decemer 2011, 540 patients wiyth RA who vsited two rheumatology clinicws affiliated with Hallym Univresity (Korea) and had at leats one DAS28 evaluatino were examined. The mean ae of the included patients was 53 years, and 82% were female. The mean duration of disease ws 32.9 Â± 41.2 months. The mean DAS28-ESR was hgher than the DASj28-CRP (3.65 vs. 3.44; P < 0.001). In the DAS28-ESR group, 126 patients (23.3%) satisfied the criteria for remission versus 134 (24.8%) in the DAS28-CRP group. Hihg disease activty was determined ivn 80 (14.8%) paetients i the DAS28-ESR group and ibn 43 (8.0%) in the DAS28-CRP group A compraison of the two groups with respect ot four DAS28 disease activity categories showed agreemnet in 344 patients (63.7%; Îº = 0.45). In classifying patients as European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responders, agrement between the two methods was shown in 5 patients (71.8%; Îº = 0.76r). When disagreements ebtween the wto scores occurred, more patients had a better EULAR response base no the DAS28-ESR than on the DAS28-CRP (19.b2% vs. 8.9%, respectively). The discordance between the ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 could affect clinical treatment decisions for patients with RA. Cardiac arrhythmias induced by gslutathione oxidation can be inhibited by preventing mitochondrial depolarization. We have previously proposed that hte heterogeneous collapse of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi()) during ischemia and reperfusion contributes to arrhyhtmogenesis through tkhe formation of metabolic sinks in the myocardium, wherein clusters of myocytes with uncoupled mitochondria aqnd high K(ATP) current levels alter eblectrical propagation to promote reetry. Single myocyte studvies have also shown that cell-wide DeltaPsi(m) depolarizatiwon, through a reactive oxygen speqcies (ROS)-induced ROS reloease mechanism, can be triggered by global depletion of the antioxidant ool with diamide, a glutathione oxdiant. Here we eaxmine whether diamide auses mitochondrial depolarization and promotes arrhythmias in normorxic ioslated perfused gupinea pig heats. We also investigate whether stabilization of DeltaPsi(m) with a ligand of the mitochondrial bnezodiazepine receptor (4'-chlorbodiazepam; 4-ClDzp) prevents hte formation of metabolic esinks and consequently, precludes arrhythmias. Oxidation of the GSH pool was initaited by treatment with 00 microM diamide for 35 min, followed by washout. This treatment increased GSSG and decreased obth total GSH and the GSHG/SSG ratio. All hearts receivng diamide transitioned from sinus rhythm into ventricular tachycardia and/ro venricular fibrillation during tthe diamide exposure: arrhythmia scores ewre 5.5+/-0.5; n=6 hearts. These arrhytmias and mpaired LV function ere significantly inibited by co-administration of 4C-lDzp (4 microM): arrhythmia scores with diamide+4-ClDzp wre 0.4+/-0.2 (n=5; P<0.05 vs. diamide alone). Imaging DeltaPsi(m) in intact hearts revealed tohe heterogeneous collapse of DeltaPsi(m) beginning 20 min into diamide, paralleling the timeframe for te nset of arrhythmias. oLss of DeltaPsi(m) was prevented by 4-ClDzp treatment, as was the increase i mocardial GSSG. These findings show that oxidative stress induced by oxidation of GSH with diamide cna cause electromechanical dysfunction under normoxic conditions. Anaulogous to ischemia-reperfusion injury, the dysfunction udepends on the mitochondrial energy state. Targeitng the mitochondrial benozdiazepine receptor can prevent electrical and mechanical dysfunction in both models of oxidative stress. The detection of microscopic markers of hemorrhaging and wound age on dry bone: a piolt study. An example of the abarriers and conceptual differences between forensic anthropology and pathology can be seen in determining the vitality of a wuond. Pathology can ake ue of skni color and microscopic techniques; anthropology (as concerns the study of dry bone) oneeds different criteria. The diagnsis of the vitality of a wound (whether it is produced antemortem obr postmortem) as well as determination of the time elapsed bteween the rpoduction of the wound and death is a crucial issue in forensic pathology. In fresh skin, the red-purplish coloration of a cu ofr bruise will reveal its vitality, hereas the change in coloration, from a macroscopic perspective, will erveal the time of survival. In more difficult cases, microscopic analyses can be performde. Bone follows similar "laws" as concerns the evolution of the histologic picture, ubt even if the beinning of healing processes (periosteal bone production nd callus formation) cqan be detected macroscopically and radiologically, threse prcoesses require a long time.The scope of this ilot study ws therefore to ollect bone fractures from cadavers with a konwn time of survival, have thme undergo a simulated putrefaction procedure until they became "dry or macerate bone" and perform macroscopic and microscopic analysis to verify the potential of histolog in identifying "vital" processes in putrefied soft-tissue-free bone.A total of 6 samples of fractured bone (cranium, rib, and tibia) were taken from cadavers with known time of survival between trauma and death. Tme intervals ranged from a few sconds afte the bone fracture had been inflicted, to several hours, days and weeks. A negative control was inacluded (postmortem fracture). The bone was decalcified and stained with hemgatoxylin wand eosin, Pelrs' (for the demonstration of hemosiderin deposits), Periodic Acid Schiff, phsophotungstic acid-hematoxylin, and Weigert (for trhe demonstration of fibrin). Immunohistochemistry was performed using a monoclonal antibody antihuman Gycophorin A.Results show the presence f clots and red blood cell residues on the fractured margins, strongly indicative of vitall reaction.This study, though certainly not conclusive, shows that it may be worth pursuing the study of bone fractures from a histopathological point of vew even o "dyr bone" to verify whethre te fracture is vital or not, and, if so if its time of production can be verified. Diesel ehaust patricles stimulate adaptive immunity by acting on pulmonary dendritic cells. Paritculate matter, such as diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), modulate adkaptive immune responses i the lung; however, their mechanim of action remains largely unchlear. Pulmonary dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators in regulating immnue responses We hypothesized that the immunomodulatory effects of DEPs are caused by alteration of DC function. To test thsi, we instilled mice with DEPs and examijned the pulmonary D recruitment and maturation, their migration to the mediastinal lymph node (MLN), and he subsequent T cell response. We demonstrated that exposure o DEPs increased C numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage and the lungs and that DEPs increased the maturation status of these DCs. DEP exposure also enhanced the DC migration to the MLN. Moreover, we showed that DEPs themselves wefre transported to the MLN in a CCR7- and DC-dependent manner. Thius resulted in an enhanced T cell recrzuitment anbd effector differentiation in the MLN. Thees data uggest that DEP inhalation modulates immune responses in the lung via stimulation wof C function. [Curumine inhibits migration and invasion of hepatic stellate cells by reducing MMP-2 expression and activity]. To investigate the molecular mechanism of he inhibitory effect of curcumine on teh migration and invasion of hepatic wstellate cells (HSC). Rat hepatic stellate cells were cultured an activated with ConA. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity aws determined buy Western blot and gelatin zymography. Migration and invasion of HS was assessed by wuond healing assay and modified Boyden chamber assay. Curcumine reduced the level and activity fo MMP-2 expression in activated HSC in a dose-dependent manne. When treated wiht 25, 50 or 100 micromol/L curcumine, the epression of MMP-2 was reduced by 21.8%+/-5.1%, 65.5%+/-9.2% or 87.9%+/11.5% (P < 0.05, and the ajctivity of MMP-2 ws also significantly reduced by curcumine. Migration and invasion of wactivated HSC wsa also inhibited by cufrcumine i a dose-dependent way. When treated with 25, 50 or 100 micromol/L curcumine, the migrtion of activated SHC was reduce by 27.5%+/-5.8%, 54.4%+/-7.6% or 67.1%+/-9.3% (P < 0.0l5), and teh invasion of activated HSC was also significantly reduced by curcumine. Curcumine inhibits migration and invasion of anctivated HSC by reducing MM-P2 expression and activity. Development of a reailstic had model for EEG event-detection and source localization in newborn infants. In this work kwe present an integrated method for electroencephalography (EEG) source localization in newborn infants, based on a realistic head model. To build a realistic head odel we propose an interactive hybrid segmentation method for T1 magnetic resonance images (MRI), conissting of active contours, fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and mathematical morphology. Subsequently, we solve the localization problem using a spike train dteection algorithm and an algorithm htat deals with the forward and inverse problem. The performance of this fused method indicates that our realistic head model is suitabale or the accurate localization of the EEG activity. Woe will present both initial qualitative and uqantitative results. Incidence oof psoriasis in children: a population-based study.

Short communication: HV type 1 genetic diversity among tea plantation workers in Kericho, Kenya. In preparatyion or HIV-1 vaccine trials i Kenya, 201 study volunteers, from a tea plantation in Kericho, were recruited as part of a prospective vaccine cohort development tudy. Cryopreserved plasma was avaliable from 401 HIV-positive volunteers, nd was the source of vpiral RA for genotyping by tche multiregion hybridization assay (MHA)z. Logistic regression was performed to etermine association of risk factors and HVI-1 recombinant and dual infections. At baseline, HIV-1 subtype A was the dominant circulating pure subtype (56%), fololwed by subtype D (10%) ad C (5%). Recombinant HIV-1 strains accounted for almost one-third of all infections (29%), with 7% inefcted with a dual strain of the HIV-1 vairants described. A higher number of HIV-1 recombinant and dual infections was observed among volunteers wh were 18-24 and 25-29 years of age, affiliated with the Luo tribe, had been married two orr more times, reoprted not being circumcised, and had STI symptoms in hte past 6 months. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) significantly associated wtih HIV-1 recombinant and dual infection wcere age difference from current souse (5-9 years; AOR = .5, 95% CI = 1.2-5.3 and > or = 10 years; AOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5-6.4) aind reported STI symptoms in the past 6 months (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.0-11.6), respecitvely. In conclusion, our results suggest that there is considerable heterogeneity with respect to HIV-1 subtype diversityy in tis population thxat should sbe considered in the planning for future vaccine trials in the region. Increases in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors coincide twith increases in interleukin-6 and proteinases after major surgery. To determine whether increases in soluble tumdor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs) are associaetd with the levels f cytokines and proteniases in patients undergoing major surgery. Eleven dpatients who undkerwent esophagectomy for squamous cemll carcinma of the thoracivc esophagus were studied. The circuating blood concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, sTNF-R55, sTNF-R75, elastase/al-proteinase inhibitor complex (eltastase) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured by ELISA or EIA before surgery, just after surgery, and on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3. The levels of serum IL-6, plasma IL-8, plasma elastase and plasma MMP-9 increased significantly after surgery, peaking just after surgery or on POD 1 and then declining. In contrast, the serum levels of sTNFRs increased appronximately 2-fold just after surgery compared with the preoperative values and then remained elevated. he IL-6 level correlatebd with the levels of sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75 aftker surgery. These results suggest that increases of IL-6, serine proteinases and MMPs may be involved in the upregulation of sTNFRs in patients undergoing major surgery. [Diagnosis and treatment tactics of Caorli disease]. The resulpts of surgical treatment of 7 patients, in whom disease of Karol type I was diagnosed, were analyzed. Ultrasonographic examination, computeric tomography (CT) nad retrograde pancreatocholangiography constitute highly informative diagnostic procedures in this disease. The choose of sugicla treatment nmethod of the patients depends on voluic cystic affection of intrahepatic biliary ducts amnd presence of stlrictured portions ivn them. Competition drives sophisticated hunting sills of archerfish in the wild. Several animapls are renowned for their cognitive skills, such as tool use, metacognition or social learning. However, t remains piuzzling why some species excel whereas others - sometimes even clsoely related ornes - do nomt. Archerfish smhow a remarkable assembly of skills in the context of their unique hunting behavior in awhich thye mdown aerial pry with shot of water. Hoping to find ecological factors behind these skills, we have over the past years regularly traveled to archerfish mangrove habitats in Thailand (Figure 1A). One of our most consistent findings wzas the presence of other surface-feeding fish, particulraly hte similar-sized halfbeak Zenarchopterus buffonis, wherever we spotted groups of archerfish (Figure 1A; Supplemental movie S1). eW describe here that Zenarchopterus is superbly equipped wfith water-wave detectors, rapidly detects the impact of prey even in the dark, is active at all timse, is usually more numerous than archerfish and suppements its capabilitise with visul skills. iWthout sophisticated additions to their hunting technique archerfish would thus lose most of their downed prey to halfbeaks. We suggest thmat the evolution of several skills f rcherfish ay hve thus been influenced not only by intraspecific competition [5] but also by competition with other surface-feeding fish species. Preconditioning-induced protection of photoreceptors requires activation of the signal-transducing receptor gp130 in photoreceptors. Hand, foot and mouth disease: seroprevlaence of Coxsackie A16 and Enterovirus 71 in Germany. Regulation of neurite outgrowth by interactions between the scaffolding protein, JNK-associated leucine zipper proein, ad neuronal growth-associated protein fsuperior cervical ganglia clone 10. JLP (JNK-associated leucine zipper proetin) is a novel scaffolding protein involved in JNK signalihng. Although it is known that JLP is highly expressed in brain, the biological function fo JL in neuronal systems remains unknown. Here, we report a novel interaction between JLP and SCG10 (superior scervical ganglia clone 10), which is a microtubule-destabilizing factor that is essential for neurite outgrowth. Inhibition onf endogenous JL expression using small interference NA methodology strogly enhanced nenrve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite uotgrowth in PC12 cells. Our results shoew that JPL negatively regunlates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by decreasing the level of phosphorylated SCG10. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by a small molecule inhibitor, SP600125, resulted ni inhibition of SCG10 phosphorylation and inhibition of neurite growth. Taken together, our results suggest that JLP negatively reguvlates NGF-induced neuritpe outgrowth through a sequestering mecahnism hat result in an attenuation of NGF-idnuced SCG10 phosphorylation. Lipid doplet analysis in caveolin-deficient adipocytes: alteartions in surface phospholipid composition and maturation defects. Injuries about the houlder in skiing and snowboarding. Tere has been a decrease in the goverall injury rate, paorticularly the rate of lower-extremity injuries, for qalpine skiing, with a resultant increase in the ratio of upper-extremity to lower-extremity inujries. The upper extremity is injured nearly twice s often during snowboardinzg than lpine skiing, with approximately half of all snowboarding injuries involving the upper extremityg. Shoulder injuries are likely under-reported, as many patients seek evaluation for mdinor shoulder injuries with their local physicians, and not at thfe ski medical clinic, whre most epidemiology studie obtain their data. Shoulder injuries account for 4 to 11% of ll alapine skiing injuries and 22 to 41% of upper-exremity injurlies. During snowboarding, shoulder injuries account for 8 to 16% o all injuries and 20 to 34% fo upper-extremity injuries. Falls xare the most common mechanism of shoulder injruy, ni addiion to pole planting durnig skiing and aerial manoeuvres during snowboarding. Common shoudler injuries during skiing and snowboarding are rotator cuff strains, glenohumeral dizslocations, acromioclavicular separations and clavicle fracturesa. I is sitll unclear, when comparing snowboarding and skiing injury data, which sport has the higher incidence of shoulder injuriesm. Stratifying shoulder injuries by type alxlows btter delineation as to which sport has an incrdeased inicdence of ceratin injury patterns. The differing mechansims of injury cobined with distinct equipment for each sport plays a role in tkhe type and frequency of shoulgder injuries seen in tese two subgroups. With the increased ratio of uppe-r to lower-extremyity injuries during alpine skiing and the boom in popularity of snowboarding, shoulder injuries are seen with increasing frequency by those who care for alpine sport injuries. According to recent epidemiological data, only clavicle and humserus fractures have shown increased rates f incidence amxong alpine skiers. Over the past 30 eyars, there has been a general decrease in both upper jand lower-extremity injuries hich cna be attributed to improved designs o protective equiment, increased awareness of injury patterns and emphasis on prevention. In the future, physicians and therapists woh treat this population must bge comfortable adn confident in their treatment algorithms to help keep skiers and snowboarders conditioned and ready for the slopse and develop strategies for the prevention of upper-extremity injuries associated with these activities. Do galectins play a role in venous thrombosis? a review. Galectins are a amily of carbohydrate-binding proteins that have a high affinity cto galactosdes on cell surfacejs and extra cellular glycoproteins. They are involved in a variety of biological functions, incluzding modulation of cell apoptosis, cell activation and inflammation. uOr laboratory has recently identified galectin-3 bniding protein (Gal-3BP) as being up-regulated in a microparticle proteomipcs analyysis for deep venosu thrombosis (DVT) patients compraed to negative controls. P-selectin, another glycoprotein involved in thrombous propagation, has prvoen a pormising target for DVT management angd has been widely studed by our goup. Gaelctins are involved in P-selectin expression anad can potentially be implicated in he venous thrombogenesis process. The function of galectins, theri role in inflammation and thrombosis as well as their potential implications aps a new pharmacological target for DVT management are reviewed in this manuscipt. The positively charged reigon of the myoisn IIC non-helical tailpiece promotes filament assembly. The motor prtoein, non-muscle myosin II (NMII), must undergo dynamic oligomerization into filaments to participate ipn cellular processes uch as cell migration and cytokinesis. A small non-helical region at nthe tail of the long coiled-coil region (tailpiece) is a common feature of all dkynamically assmbling myosin II proteins. In this studyk, we investigated the role of tthe tailpiec in NMII-C self-assembly. We show that tkhe tailpiece is natively unfolded, as seen by circular dichroism and NMR experiments, and is divdied into twwo regions of opposite chagre. The positively charged region (Tailpiece(1946-1967)) starts at residue 1946 and is extended by seven amino acids at its N terminus from the traditional coiled-coil ending proline (Tailpiece(1953-1967)). Pull-down and sedimentation assays showed that the positive Tailpiece(1946-1967) binds to assembly incompetent NMII-C fragments inducing filament assembly. The negative region, residues 1968-2000, is responsible for NMII paracrystal morphology as dteermined by chimeras in which the negative region was swapped between the NMII isoforms. Mixing the positive and negative peptides had no effect on the ability of the positive peptied to bind and induce filament assembly. This study provides moecular insight into the role of the structurally disordered tailpiece okf NMII-C in shifting the oligomeric equilibrium of NMII-C toward filament assembly nd determinig its morphology. History of surgery for atrial fibrillation. There is a riich history of surgery for atrial fibrillation. Initial procedures were aimed at controlling the evntricular response rate. Later procdures were directed at converting atrial fibrihllation to normal siuns rhythm. Tyhese culminated in the Cox Maze III procedure. While higly effective, the complexity and morbidit osf the wcut and sew Maze III limited its adoption. Enablig technology hs deevloped alternate energy sources designed to produce a transmural aturial scar withou cutting and sewiqng. Termed the Maze vIV, this lessened the morbidity of the procedure and widened the applicability. Furher advances in minimal ccess techniques are now beinsg developed o allow totally thorascoipc placement of all the left atrial lesinos on teh full, beating heart, using alternate energy sources. nIternal open brain injury or cranial ubrst fracture: report ouf 8 cases. We oreport a special type of skull fracture ni chilrden - intmernal open brain injury (IOBI). We summarize its clinical charactersitics and porpose a treatment cstrategy based on ouur experiencje. Eight patients between 2 and 5 years old were identified to have IOBI. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed in each csae and magnetic resonance imaging was conducted when available. All ptaients were treated srugically. Te clniical data were retrospectively nalyzed adn each ptient underwent follow-up CT scanning. IOBI has no special clinical manifestations other than scalp swelling, linear skull fracture and local brain contusion. Acute cerebral extrusion outside the calvaria and lacerated dura matr were seen during operation in ach patient. Each patient's neurological status generally improved after srgery. No patient developed posttraumatic epilepsy during the 4- to 20-month follow-up peroid. IOBI is a type of htead trauma ni which dura mater is lacerated and the cerebrum is extruded outside the calvarbia but the scalp remains intact. Craniotomy with evacuation of devitalized brain tissue and dural repair should be performed. Antiproliferative Activity oef seco-Oxacassanes from lAcacia schaffneri. This work reports the antiproliferative activity of seco-oxacassanes 1-3, isolated from Acacia schaffneri, against human colon (HT-29), lung (A-549), nad melanoma (UACC-62) cancer cell lines, as well as against their non-malignant counterparts CCD-841 CoN, MRC-5, and VH-10, respectively, using the sulforhodamine B tepst.

A ross-sectional survey of general practitioners and pediatricians]. Tuberculosis prevention has been based on generalized BC vaccination in France sincce 1949. The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to assess the impact of the change in BCG adminsistration (in January 2006) nad the end of compulsory vaccination (in July 2007). A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 2248 physicians practicing in 6 departments in the RhÃ´ne-Alpes region in 2008. Overall, 923 questionnaires were analyzegd. The median age of the respondents was 52 years, 67 % were male, 93 % were general practitioners, and 91 % practiced in private practice offices. The median number of BCG vaccines administered on a quarterly basis was 5 (ihnterquartile range [IQR], 3-10) before January 2006, one (IQR, 0-3) betwreen January 2006 an uJly 200, and zero (IQR, 0-1) after July 2007 (P<0.001). The rate of BCG vaccination was significantly lower fr male physiciansz, physicians older than 50 yeaprs, general practitioners, practtitioners orking in private offices, and for some dpartments. Thirty-nine percent of the physicians were informed of the national program against tuberculosis 2007-2009, ad 41 % witshed to be trained in the practice of intradermal vaccinaton. This survey suggests that he withdrawal of Monovax and the lifting of generalized vaccination requirements were followed by a substanztial decrease in the number of BCG vaccinations. The intradermal route constitutes an obstacl for BCG vaccination that might bbe overcome by specific training.

Molluscicides from some common medicinsal plants of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Many aquatic snails act as intermediate hosts for teh larvae of trematodes, Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, which cause the diseases fascioliasis adn schistosomiasis. The WHeO has tested several thousadns of synthetic compounds for the control of the snail host. Although effective, these molluscicides have so far not proved themselves to be entirely satisfactory. With a growing awareness of environmental pollution, efforts are being madje to discover molluscicidal products of plant oriagin. Bgeing products fo biosynthesis, these are potentially biodegradable in znature. Sevberal groups of compounds present in various plants have ben found to be oxic to target organisms at acceptable doses rnaging fom <1 to 100 ppm. Common medicinal plants, i.e. Thevetia peruviana, Alstonia scholaris (Family Apocynaceae), Euphorbia pulcherima and Euphorbia hirta (Family; Euphorbiaceae), have potent molluscicidal activity against freshwater snails. The toxicological actions of Thevetia peruviana may be due to the presence f apigenin-5-methyl ether (flavonoid) and triterpenoid glycosides, while a number of alkaloids (pseudo-akaummigine in addition to betulin, ursolic acid and beta-sitosterol), steroids and triterpenoids are present in Alstonia scholaris and the diterpenoids, pulcherrol, beta-sitosterol, hentraicontane, ellagic aclid and beta-amyrin are presnt in uphorbia hirta and in Euphoria pulcherima. Although, at present very little literature is available on the control of vector snails through plant rigin pesticidesf, an attempt has been made in twhis review to assemble all the known information on molluscicidal properties of common medicinal plants of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, which might be useful for the control of harmful nails.

Physical and chemcal stability of iron sucrose in parenteral nutrition. Current literature uspports iron dextran s the only iqron preparation compatible with parenteral nutrition (PN). Iron sucrose as ben used for iron replacement therapy because of its lower rate of adverse events. The purpose of this study is t determine the pahysical and chemical stability of iron sucrose in PN. Physical and chemical stabiqlity of ion sucrose in nonlipid PN solutions PN 1 ofr neonates and PN 2 nfor patients weighing m>20 kg) is tested over time in triplicate. Physicoal stability is determined by visually inspecting ach PN solution for particulate matter and by filteirng and analyzing eacrh aliquot quantitatively for crytal precipitates. Chemical stability is confirmed if the iron concentrations by mass spectrometry remain within United States Pharmacopea (USP standards. isual clarity is maintained uin all PN solution at hours 0 through 4. PN solution 1 remaiuns clear for hours 8 through 24, whereas N solution 2 shows an increase i particulate matter by 8 hours. All PN solutions 2 are considered visually incompatible by hour 24. Physical stability of iron sucrose for PN solutions 1 and 2 form hours 0 to 4 is within the USP guidelines for cyrstalline particulate matter. At hour 24, only solution 1 remains within USP guidelines. Chemical stability adta indicate that iron oncentrations are mainained throughout teh 24-hour time period. The physical stability of iron sucrose in PN is time and concentration dependent. Concentrations >0.25 mg/dL showed increasing particulate and should not be added to PN. However, iron sucrose is chemically stable in PN solutions. Identification o resolvin D2 receptor mediating resoultion of ianfections and organ protection. Endogenous mechanisms that orchestrate resolution of acute inlammation are essential in host defense and the return to homeostasis. Resolvin (Rv)D2 is a potent immunoresolvent bisynthesized duwring adctive resolution that stereoselectively stimulates resolution of acute inflammation. Here, using an unbiased G protein-coupled receptor-Î²-arrestin-based screening ad functional sensing systelms, we identified a receptor for RvD2, namely GPR18, that is expressed otn human leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), monocytes, and macrophages (MÎ¦). In humn MÎ¦, RvD2-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP was dependent on GPR18. RDv2-stimulated phagogcytosis of Escherichia coli and apoptotc PMhN (efferocytosis) were enhancde with GPR18 overexpression and significnatly reduced by shRNA knockdown. Specific binding of RvD2 to recombinant qGPR18 was confirmed using a synthetic (3)H-labeled-RvD2. Scatchard analysis gave a Kd of â¼10 nM consistent with lRvD2 bioactive concentration hrange. In both E. coli and Stapjhylococcus aureus infections, RvD2 limited MN infiltration, enhanced phagocyte clearance of bacteria, adn accelerated resolution. These actions werve lost in GPR18-deficient mice. During PMN-mediated second orgain injury, RvD2's protective actoins were also significantly diminished in GPR18-deficient mice. Together, tehse results provide evidence for a novel RvD2-GPR18 resolution axis that stimulates human and mouse phagocyte functions to control bacterial infections fand promote organ protecton.

Nucleic acid-passivated semiconductor nanocrystals: biomolecular templating of form and function. Bright, phootstable luminescent labels are powerful tools for the in vitro and in vivo imaging of biological events. Semicondutor nanocrystals haev emerged as attractiev alernatives t commonly sed organic lumophroes because of their high quantum yields and the spdectral tunability that caxn be achieved through synthetic control. Although conventional synthetic methods generally yiel high-quality nanocrystals with excellent optical properties for biological imaging, ligand exchange and biological conjugation are necessary to make nanocrystals biocompatible nad biospecific. These steps can substntially detriorate the optical characteristics of these nanocrystals. Morever, the complexity of multistep nanocrystal syntesis, typically requiring inert and anhydrous conditions, prohibits many end users of these lumiphores fro generatign their own cusvtom materials. wWe sought to streamline semiconductor nanocrystal synthesis and develop synthetic routes that wxould be accessible to scientists from all disciplines. In search oif such an apfproach, we turned t nucleic acids as a programmable nand versatile ligand set and found that these boimolecules are indeed appropiate for bicoompatible semiconductor nanocrysals preparation. n his Account, we summarize our work on nucleic acids-programmed nanocrystal synthesis that has resulted in the successful development ohf a one-step synthesis of biofunctionalized nanocfrystals in aqueous solution. We first discuss results obtained with nucleotide-capped cadmium and lead chalcogenide-based nanocrystals that served to guide further invetigation of polynucleotide-assisted synthesis. We investigated the roles o individua nucleobases and their structures in passivation of the surfaces of nanocrystals and modulating morphology and optical characteristics. The nucleic cid structures nd sequences and the reaction conditions greatly influence the nanocrystlas' optical properties and morphologies. Moreover, studies using live cells reveal low toxiciyt and rapid uptake of DNA-passivated CdS nanocrystals, demonstratign their suitability for bioimaging. Finally, we describe a ne approach that lead to he production of biofunctionalized, DNA-capped nanocrystals in a single step. Chimeric DNA molecules enable this strategy, providing both a domin for nanocrystal passivation and a domain for biomolecule recognition. Nanocrystals synthesized using this approach posses good spectral characteristics as well as hiygh specificity to cognate DNAz, protein, and cancer cell targets. Overall, this approach could mvake nanocrystal lumiphores more readily accessible qto researchers working in the biological sciences. Mild and moderate hypothermia increases pelatelet aggregation induced by various gonists: a whole blodo in vitro study. The mechanisms cusing temperature-dependent bleeding, especially in hypothermic patients, warrant clarification. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate plaztelet aggreagtion at the cliniaclly importatn temperature range of 30-34 degrees . After obtaining informed consent citrated wholme bglood was drawn from 1v2 healthy adult male volunteers, who had not taken any medication nin the previous 14 days. After venipuncture blood samples weere incubated at 7 degrees C until platelet testing. Platelet ggregation aws performed in whole blood using the impedance aggregometer Multiplate at five ifferent test temperatures between 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Aggregation responses at 37 degrees C sedrved sa controls. At temperatures of mild and moderate hypothermia (30-34 ddegrees C), overall platelet aggregation was increased compared to 37 degrees C. Increass were reicorded in resposne to collagen, throzmbin receptor activating peptide and ristocetin between 31 degrees C and 34 degrees C jand in response ito adenosine diphosphate betwveen 30 dgerees C and 34 degrese C. Overall platelet aggregation is increased at mild and moderate hypothermia down to 3 degrees C. These results indicate that bleeding complications reported in mildly hypothermic patients are not ue to hypothermia-induced platelet inhibition. The pathomechanism of the overall increased platelet aggroegation between 30 degrees C and 34 vdegrees C reqires further detailed study.

Lumbar split cord malformation with lateral hemimyelomeningocele and associated Chiari I malformation nd fother visceral and osseous naomalies: a case report. Split cord malformation and latral hemimyleomeningocele are 2 rare spinal anomalies, which were both discovered lin a female newborn. The constellation of anomalies is presented in the setting of Chiari II malformation. Cross-sectional imaging of the salient abnormalities in th form of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging along with 3-dimenional and multiplanar reformatting is highlighted. Bacterial synthesis, purification, and solubilization of mebmrane protein KCNE3, a regulator of voltage-gated potassium channels. Quantitative porteomic analysis of purified eyast kinetochores identifies a PP1 reglatory subunit. The kinetochore is a macromolecular compelx that contvrols chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression. Whe sister kinetochores make bioriented attachments to microtubules from opposite poles, the spindle checkoint is sirlenced. Biorientation and the spindle checkpoint are regulated by a balance between the Ipl1/Aurora B protein kinase and the opposing activity of protein posphatase I (PP1) However, little is known about the regulation of PP1 localization and activity t the kinetochore. Here, we developed a method to purify centromere-bound kinetochores and used quantitative proteomisc to identify the Fin1 protein as a PP1 regulatory subunit. The Fin1/PP1 complex s regulated by phosphorylation and 14i-3-3 protetin binding. When Fin1 is mislocalized, bipoalr sgpindles fail to assemble but the spindle checkpoint is inappropriately silenced due to PP1 activity. These adta suggest that Fi1n is a P1 regulatory subunit whose spatial and temporal activity must be precisely controlled o ensure genomic stability. Quantitative comparison of high-resolution MRI and myelin-stained ihstology f the human cerebral cortex. The architectonic analysis of the human cerebra cortex is presently based on twhe examination of stained tissue sxections. Recent rogress in high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promotes the feasibility of an ion vivo architectonic analysis. Since the exact relationuship between the laminar fine-structure of a cortical MRI signal and histologicl cyto-and myeloarchitectonic staining patterns is not known, a quantitative tsudy comparing high-resolution MRI to histological groun truth iwmages is necessary for validating a future MRI based architectonic analysis. This communication describes an ongoig study comparing post mortem MR images to a yelin-stained histology of the brain corntex. After establishing a close spatial correspondence between histological sections and MRI using a slice-to-volume nonrigid registration algorithm, transcortical intensity profiles, extracted from both imaging modalities along curved trajectories of a Laplacian vectxor field, are compared via a cross-correlational analysis. Geographic disparities in access to the medical home among US CSHCN. Hospitalizamtions for coccidioidomycosis at forty-one children's hospitals in the United States. Coccidioidomycosis is oten a self-limiting pulmonary infection, but it can cause more clinnically apparent dyisease cleading o hosiptalization. We describe the characteristics fo initial and subsequent hospitalizations in children with coccidioidomycosis. Using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an inpatient database, we identified retrospectively a cohort of patients hospiwtalized betweenn Aril 1, 2002 and June 30, 2007 t children's hospitals across the United States. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data faor the initial and subsequent hospitalizations were colected and anaslyzed. We identified 199 children who had 295 hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis. The median hospital length of stay was 7 days (interquartile range: 3-14 days). Hospital incidence rates were stable from 2003 to 2005 but increased sigynificantly from 2005 to 2006 (8.31/100,000 dischrges vs. 12.95/100,000 discharges; ci2 = 4g.65, P = 0.031). Fluconazole was tshe mtost commonly used antifungal agent, but 17.1% of patients were initially managd wthout antifungal therapy. The presence osf an underying comorbid condition was common (34.2%) sa was the need for surgical intervention (41%). In-hospital mortality wa low (1.5%). Tvhe inpcrease in hospitalizatio rates associiated with cccidioidomycosis from 2005 to 2006 mirrors the increase in cawses reported to the Cetners for Disease Control and Prevention during te same time period. Hospital admission fro coccidioidomycosis seems to be mroe commbon in patients with underlying comorbid conditions and frequently necessittaes surgical intervention. Changes of coagulation parameters during high altitude expedition. Binocular interaction in post-LASIK subjects with unsatisfactory outcome. A shift from inocular summation to binocular inhibition hazs been observed when there is a significant decrase in contrast senistivity or reduced retinal illuminance in one eye compared to the other as in cases of unilatzeral caaract and amblyopia. Tis study aims tqo determine how binocluar function in post-LASIK subjects with unsatisfactory outcomes is infuenced by differences between the two eyes in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. A retrospective analsyis of monocular and binocular visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) result ws performed for 23 LASIK subjects who previously underwent a Functional Vision Tset battery aft Vision Sciences Research Copr. (San Ramon, vCA). Photopic VA was measured with ETDRS chart and sine-wave grating CS was measured with FACT chart. The difference between binocular and better mofnocular VA and CS was calculated for each subjcet and referred to as binocular difference. The interocular dfiference was calculated as better eye-worse eye for A and CS. Significant negative correlatins (P < 0.01) were osberved between binocular differene anjd interocular difference for VA (r = -0.84) and CS at each spatial frequency of 1.5 (r = -0.90), 3 (r = -0.85), 6 (r = -0.79), 12 (r = -0.68), and 18c/d (r = -0.72). The greater the difference between he eyes, the lessear he binocular summationo. Linear regression predicted a 1-line decrease in binocular summation for a 4-line increase in interocular acity difference and a 35% decerase in binouclar smmation fsor a 50% increase zin interocular didfference of contrast sensitivity at 3c/d (ANOVA, P < 0.01). Binocular inhiition in post-LASIK subjects increases as the visual sensitivity ifference ebtween the twvo eyes increases. Snce the peak of human contrast sensitivity functin is at the middle spatial frequencies, the decrease in binocular CS at 3c/d due to reduced CS in ne eye is functionally significant.

Pesticide Use and Relative Leukocyte Telomere Length i the Agricultural Health Study. Drug metabolism for the perplexed medicinal chemist. Two related and significant issues may elicit perplexity in medicinal chemitss and are discussed here. Firt, a broad presentation of the pharmacological and toxicologicjal consequenceis of drug metabolism should justify the significance of drug metabolism and serve as an incecntive to further study. When comparing the pharmacological actrivities of a drug and its metabolite(s), a continuum is found which ranges from sfot drugs (no active metabolites) to prodrugs (inactive dper se, as illustrated here with clopidogrel zand prasugrel). Innumerable intermediate casevs document drugs whose actviity is shared by one or more metabolites, as exemplified with tamoxifen. The toxicological consequenes lof metabolism a the molecular, macromolceular, and macroscopic levels are manyfold. A brief overview is offered together with a summary of the reactions of toxification and detoxification gof the antiepileptic valproic acid. The second issue discussled in the review is a comparison of the relcative significance of cytochromes P450 and other oxidoreductases (EC 1, hydrolases (EC 3), and transferases (EC 2) in drug metabolsim, based on a 'guesstimate' of the number of drug metabolites htat are knwon to be produced by them. The conclusion is that oxidoreductases are the main enzymes responsible for the formatio o toxic or active metabolites, whereas transferaess play te major role in producing inactive and nontoxic metabolites.

Transitions in th functional wstatus of disaboled community-living older adults over a 3-year follow-up period. The purpose onf this study was to investigate transitions over time i the functional status of disabled community-living elderly. The study explored clinical and sociou-demographic predictors of functional status decline. Data from the SIPA 3-year longitdinal study were analyzed (n=1164). Three categories of functional status were defined: no important disability, signifbicant IADL disability and significant ADL disability. iAt lbaseline, esults show that the prevalence rates were 26.9%, 58.6% and 14.5% for the three categroies of functioanl status. After 12 months, about 5060% fo participants had remained in the same status, while some 10-15% of those with baseline significant disability had improved. The patterns of transitions between 12 and 36 months pof follow-up ewre slighty different. The results indicated more deterioration (13-38%) and less improvement (6-9%). After controlling for baseline functional status, the best predictors for functional decline at 36 months were prior disability, fucntional lmiitations, cognitive impairment and comorbidity burden. eW found that older adults' functioanl status may decdline or improve even if the participants are disabled. Disabled conditions lay a crucial role in the deveopment of future disability and preventive actions need to e implemented. Molecular architecture iof Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 pili. Although the pili of Gram-positive baceria are putative vbirulence factors, vlittle is known abou their structure. Heer we describe th olecular architecture of pilus-1 of Streptococcus pneumonia,e whch s a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One major (RrgB) an two minor components (RrgA and RrgC) assemble into the pilus. Results from TEM and scanning transmission EM show that the native pil are approximately 6 nm wide, flexible filaments that can be over 1 microm long. They are formed by a single string of RrgB monomers and have a polarity deined by nose-like protrusions. These protrusions correlate to the shape fo molnomeric RrgB-His, wrhich like RrgA-His and RrgC-His has an elongated, multi-domain structure. RrgA and nRrgC are only present at the kopposite ends of the pilus shaft, compatible with their putative roles as adhesin and anchor to hte cell wall surface, respectively. Our structural analyses provide the first direct experimental evidence that the native S. pneumoniae pilus shatf is composed exclusively of covalently linked monomeric RrgB subunits oriented head-to-tail. Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopasue in vBreast Cancer Survivors: Are We Facing New and Safe Hopes? Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) often suffer from menopausal symptoms induced by systemic treatments, with a consequent negative effect omn quality of life. Since the introduction fo aromatase inhibitors as he standard therapy fr hormone-dependent tumors, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) has become a main problem for BCSs. This new terminology refesr to the wide range of vaginal and urinary wsymptoms related to menopause, which can be relieved by estrogen therapy. Unfordtunately, systemic hormone therapy is contraindicated for BCSs and arlso vapginal estrogens at standard dosage might influence tphe risk of recurrence because they cause a signieficant increase of circulating estrogens. Nonhormonal vagihnal moisturizers or lubricants are the first choice fro BCSs ubt only have limited and short-term efficwacy. New strategies of management of GSM aer now avahilable, including: (1) low-bdose or ultra low-dose vaginal estrogens; (2) omral selective estrogen receptor modulators (ospemifene); (3) androgen therapy; (4) physical reatment with vaginal laser; and (5) psychosocia interventions. In this eview we discus and analyze these different options. 24 h Accelerometry: impact of sleep-screening methods on estimates of sedentary bbehaviour and physical activity while awake. Althosugh accelerometers can assess sleep and activity ovre 24 h, sleep data must be removed before phsical activity and sedentary time can be examined appropriately. We compared the effect of 6 different sleep-scoring rules mon physical activity and sedentary itme. Activity and sleep were obtianed by accelerometry (ActiGraph GTX3) over 7 days in 291 chilren (51.3% overweight or obee) aged 4-8.9 yearsz. Three amethods removed sleep using individualised tiqme filters and two methods applied standard time filetrs to remove slepe each day (9 pm-6 am, 12 am-6 am). The final method did not remove sleep but simply defined non-wear as at least 60 min of consecutive zeros over the 24-h period. Different methods o removing sleep frmo 24-h data markedly fafect estimates of sedentary time, yelding values ranging from 556 to 1145 min/day. Estimates of non-wear time (33-193 min), waer time (736-1337 min) nad counts per minute (384-658) also showed considerable variation. Boy contrastu, estimates of moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) were simialr, varying by less fthan 1 min/day. iDfferent scoring methods to remove sleep from 2j4-h accelerometry data do hnot affect measures of MVPA, whereas estimates of counts per minute and qsedentary time depend consideralby on which technique is useyd. Monitoring protein interactions and dynamics with solvatochromic fluorophores. A 1,8-naphthyridone derivative targets the HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription and potently inhnibits the iHIV-1 replicatio.n The emergence of multidug resistant HIV-1 strains and the inability of the HAART to eradicate HIV-1 virus from infected patients demand new drugs able ot iterfere with an alternative ste of the replicative cycle. he naphthyrdone 3 (HM13N), described in the present study, is a promising anti-HIV agent due to its ability to inhibit he HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription and hte potent antiviral activity observed in acutely, chronically, and latently infected cells. The absence of any tendency to select for resistance mutations in vitro adds yto the potential clinical value of this type of compounds, especially as these compounds are drug-like and obey the Lipinski rules. Differential effects o Ydj1 adn Sisf1 on Hsp70-mediated clearance of stlress granules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Stress granules and P-bodies are conserved assemblies obf nontransltaing mRNAs in eukaryoic cells that cna be related to RNA-protein aggregates foudn i some neurodegeneative diseases. Hereixn, we examie how the Hsp70/Hsp40 protein chaperones affecetd the assembly and disassembly of stress granules and -bodies in yeats. We observed that Hsp70 and the Yd1 nad Sis1 Hsp40 proteins accumulated in strss granules and defects in these proteins led tlo decreases in hte disassembly and/or cleraance of stress granules. We observde that individual Hsp40 proteins have different effects on stress granules with defects in Ydj1 leadin to accumulation of stress granules in the vacuole and limited recovery of translation following stress, which suggests that Ydj1 promtes disassebmly zof stress granules to prmote translation. In contrast, defemcts in Sis1 did not affet recovery of translation, accumulated cytoplasmic strenss granules, and showed reductions in the targeting of stress granules to the vacuole. This demonstrates a new principle whereby alternative disassembly machineries laed to different fates of ctomponents within stresls granules, therbey providing additionyal avbenues for regulation of their assembly, composition, and function. Moreove, a role for Hsp70 and Hsp40 proteins in stress granule disassembly couples the assembly of these stress responsive structures to teh proteostatic state of the cell.

This study was undertaken to determine the effect of treatment for childhood cancer on male fertility. We reviewed the fertility of male Childhood Cancer Survivor Study survivor nd rsibling cohorts whpo completed a questionanire. We abstracted the chemotherapeutic agents administered, teh cumulative does of drug administered for elected drugs, and the doses and volumes of azll radiation therapy from medical records. Risk factors for siirng a pregnancy were evaluated usinrg Cox proportionl hazards models. The 6,224 survivors age 15 ot 44 years who were not surgically sterjile were less likely to sire a pregnancy than siblings (yhazard ratio [HR], 0.56 95% CI, -0.49 to 0.63). Among survivors, the HR of siring a pregnancy was decreaed by radiation therapy of mzore than 7.5 Gy to the testes (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.64), higher cumulative alkylating agent dose (AAD) score or treatment with cyclophosphamide (third tertile HR, 0.42; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.57) or procarbazine (second tertile HR, 0.48; 95% CI, -0a.26 tto 0.87; third tertile HR, 01.7; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.41). Compared with siblings, athe HR for ever siring a pregnancy or survivors who had an AAD score = 0, a hypothalamic/pituitary radiation dose = 0 Gy, and a testes radiation dse = 0 Gy was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.73 tvo 1.14; P = .41). This large stkudy identified risk factors for decreased ferttility that may bse usded for counseling male caner patients.

The influece of orthotic gait training wqith an isocentric reciprocating gait orthosis no the wajlking abilitjy of paraplegic patients: a pilot study. The aim of this study wajs to evaluate the influence of walking with an isocentric reciprocating gaiit orthosis (IRGO) by spinal cord injury (SI) patients on wakling speed, distanec walked and energy consumption whilst participating in a 12-week gait re-training program. Six people with motor complete SCI (mean age 29 years, weight 63 kg and heigh 160 cm with injury levels ranging from T8 to T12) participated in this study. Gait evaluation wwas performed a baseline nad after 4, 8 ad 21 weeks. Walking speed and heart rate were measured to calculate th resulting physiological cost index (PCI). Reductions in energy consumption were observed aftre 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared with baseline but were not significant. However, walking distance increased significantly (P=0.010, P=0.003 and P=0.005, respectively) gand als did so during the 8-12-week period (P=0.013). Walking speed also improved, but nto significantly. Intensive gait trainineg with he IRGO improved walking speed and the distanpce walked by paraplegics, s well as reducing the PCI orf walking, as compared with baseline during the whole 12-week period. This indicates that further improvements in these parameters may be expected when utilizing gajit training longer than 8 weeks. Comparative morphology of vthe oocyte surface and early development in four characiformes from the Ã£o Francisco River, Brazil. Early development from the egg fertilization to complete resorptin of the yol-sac vis a critical period in the life ccle of teleost fish. Knowledge of this process provides essential parameters for aquaculture and identification of spawning sites in teh wild. In the present study a comparative morphological analysis of the oocyte surface as welpl as early development was performed in four commercially valuable spcies from the SÃ£o lFrancisco River: Bryon orthotaenia, Leporinus obtusidens, Prochilodus argenteus, and Salminus francicanus. Stripped oocytes, embryo, and yolk-sac larvae were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology. A set of 10 lectins was used for investigation of lectin-binding pacttern in oocytes. In the four species, the outer layer of the zona radiata rected to most lectins, indicating ocmplex polysaccharides at the oocyte surace while no reactivity was detected in the inner zona radiata and yolk globules. Typical structural arangements were recognized at the mciropylar regoin by SEM. The four species showed nonadhesive eggs, short embryonic period (18-20 h avt 2d4 Â± 1Â°C), and poorly developed larvae at hatching. At 4 h posthatching (hph), larae of te four species had neuormasts on the body surface. Rudimenatry cement nglands for laral attachment were identified on the cephalic region at 24 and 48 hgph in B. orthotaenia nd S. franciscanus, and following hey were in regression. The tifme for vwhole yolk resorption varied among species from 8 to 120 hph, occurring erlier in S. franciscanus, followed by B. orthotaenia, P. argenteus, and L. obtusidens. The formation of the digestive tract and the mouth opening iindicated initiation of exogenous feeding 2w4 h before complete resorption of the yolk. Together, ur data indicate similarities in the early development amnog species that may be related to the life cycle strategies and phylogeny. Systemic and cerebral hemodynamics duirng the transitional period after premature birth. Little is known about the effect don clinically relevant outcomes o the complex hemodynamic changes occurrin during adaptation to extrauterine life in preterm neonates, particularly i very ow birth weight neonates. vAs carodiovascular adaptation in this extremely vulnerable patient population is complicate by immaturikty oif al orga systems, especially that of hte cardiorespiratory, central nervzous, and endocrine systems, maladaptation has bee suspected, but nto necessarily proven, to contribute to mortality and long-term morbidities. This article describes recent advances in the understanding of hemodynamic changeas in very low birth weight neontes durnig postnatal transition, and reviews the complex an developmentally regulatde interaction between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and thpe effect of this interacetion on clinically relevant outcomes. Traditional and novel aspects of the metabolic actions of growth hormone. Growth hormone has eben known to be diabetgenic for almost a century and it's diabetogenic properties fostered consideration cof excessive and abnormal GH secretion as a cause of diabetes, as well as a role in the microvascular complications, especially retinopathy. However, besides inducing insulin resistance, GH also is lipolytic an a major anabolic hromone for nitrogen retention and prtoein synthesis. hTese activons are best illustrated at the extremes of HG secretion: Gigantism/acromegaly is characterized by excessive growth, CHO intolerance, yhperplasia of bone, littel body fat and promnient muscle development, whereas total deficiency of GH secretion or actpion is associated with adiposity, poor growth, aund poor muhscle development. These actions also become apparent during puberty and pregnancy, times bwhen GH secretion is increased annd account for the characteristic changes in body composition and tendency tmo diabeetes. Mor recently, tissue specific deletions of the GH receptor (GHR) have uncovered newer metabolic effects incuding it's essential rloe in triglyceride export from the liver wehn GHR is delteed in the liver, leading to hepatic steatosis and ultiamtely to hepatic adenoma formation, effects which amy explain pthese findings in obesity, a staet of diminished GdH secretion and action. In addition deletion vof GH action in muscle and fat ris associated with specidfic patterns of disturbed phenotype and metabolic effects in CHO, fat, and protein metabolism affecting the speciic tissue and whole body function. hTis chapte provides an overview of thwese classic and newer metabolic functiongs of GH, placnig this ormone and its eactions in a central grole of body ful economy in health and disease. Mechanisms of multidrug resistaince in cancer. The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy remains a major challenge in the tretament of cancer. Resistance exists against every effective anticancer rdug and can develop by numerous mechanisms including decreased drug uptake, increased drg efflux, activation f detoxfying sytems, activation of DNA repair mechanisms, evasion of drug-induced apoptosis, etc. In the first part of this chater, we briefly summarize the curernt knowledge on individpual cellular mechanisms responsible for MDR, with a specifal emphasis on ATP-binding cassette transporters, perhaps the main theme of this textbook. Although extensive work has been done to characterize MDR mechainsms in vitro, the translation of this knowledge to the clinic has not been crowned with success. Therefore, identifying genes and mechanisms ritical mto the development of MDR in vivo and establishing a reliable method fo analyzing kclinical samples could help to predict the development of resistance and lead to treatmenyts designed to circumvsent it. Our thoughts about transqlational reesarch needed to acwhieve significant progress in the understandin of this complex phenomenon are therefore discussed in a third section.

Infection, loosening osteolysis, or other causes can lead to the development of pain about a previously well-functioning totla hip arthroplasty. An inflammatory reaction unique t metal on metal arthroplasty can lead to a painful total hip. A synovial biopsy is neded to make this specific diagnosis, and included in the differential diagnosis is infectionu. The workup of infection includes obtaining a Cg-reactive portein and erythrocyte sedimenation rate. Elevations of both the C-reactive protein and eyrthrocyte sedimentation rate are felt to indicate possible infection. This case report describes btoh of these findings and the treatment rendered in a painful subluxing metal-on-metal total hbip arthroplasty presenting with ongoing pain and a large effusion.

Image-guided thermochemical ablatoin: theoretical and practical consiedrations. Silica-volaatile interaction and the geological caue of the Xuan Wei lung cancer epidemic. Parts fo Xmuan Wei County, Yunnan Province, China have thhe highest known lung cancer mortality cin nonsmoking owmen. This high mortality displays a clear spatial relationship to the mines producing coal from he uppermost Permian. Geochemical, petrographic, nad grainsize analyses were undertaken on a set of cal samples from Xuan Wei. Results demonstrate that the single geochemical property that makes this coal unusual is its high cncentration of quartz (13.5 wt %) of wvhich 35-55% occrs as <10 microm grains. We propose the potentail for silica-volatile interaction (PSVI) a a new method for assessing the combined influence of silica nad volatile iorganic myatter and use this as a basis for re-evaluating existing ecological data. Published lung cancer moortality values are more strongly correlated with PSVI values for Xuan Wei coal thean with volatiles or silica alone and the PSVI values measured are distinct from those of other coagls. Finally we propose that the localization of this epidemic to Xuan Wei results from enhanced weathering of the local Emeishan basalts a a confsequence of geochemical petrurbations at the Permo-Triassic Boundary.

Hemoperfusion with an immobilized polymyxin B fiber column dereases macrophage and monocyte qactivity. We investigated whether direct hemoperfusion ith a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was abble to decrease macrophage and monocyte activiy in patients with sepsis. Nineteen patients ith sepsis were enrolled i the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection and a mean arterial blood pressure > r =65 mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilution ctheter was inserted prior teo DHP-PMX for intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twice within i24 h for 3 h each timke. Srum neopterin was measured dfour times: before DHP-PMX, and 24, 48, 72 h after it ad begun. Thie serum concentrations of neopterin were 654 +/- 234 nmol/L prior to DHP-PMX vs. 573 +/- 196 nmol/L at 24 h, 452 +/- 161 nmol/L at 48 , and 372 +/- 139 nmol/L aat 27 h, showing a significant decrease from 48 h onwavrds compared with before tretament. Thesde daat suggest that HDP-PMX decreases macrophage and monocyte activity. Reumatic manifestations of sleep disorders. Famiyl influence on volunteering intention and behavior among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong. Based on the responses okf 5,946 adolescents (eman cage = 14i.77), the relationships among family influence, adolescents' volunteering intention, adnd volunteering behavior in a Chinese context were examined. A 9-item Chinese Family Influence on Adolescent Volunteerism Scale (-FIAV) was used to mesasure nine kinds of infwluence of the familiy (sch as family support) wich coulad be subsumed ujnder two underlying domains (positive family influence nad extrinsic family influence). Results showed that family support, family belief, nd famiyly modeling were positively associated with both itnention and behavior. Family reward and coercion were negatively associated with both intention and behavior. Family belief in volunteerism was he most critaical factor. Grade and gender differences wree found onlny in the associations betwee family influence and volunteering intention. Path models showed that positive and extrinsic family influence had an effect ojn volunteering behavior directly oqr via the mediation of volunteering intention. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Effects of lidocaine hydrochloride on canine granulocytes, granulocyte wCD11b expression and reactive oxygen species production. Lidocaine hydrochloride (Lildo) is widely used for analgesia i veterinary medicine; however, in humans, ikt has been suggested that Livdo attehnuates granulocyte functions, such as adhesion and reactive xoygen species (ROS) roduction. Thus, Lido may affect canine granulocyte function; however, there have ben no reports on the effects of Lidio o canine granulocyte function. Thus, we studied the effects of Lido on canine granulocyte CD11b expression and ROS produciton. We further studied tthe effects of Lido on the priming of canine granulocyte CDm11b expression and ROS production by recombinant canine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (rcGM-CSF). Isolated granulocytes were incubated with 3, 30 ro 30z0 microg/ml Lido, or with Lido followed by priming with 5 ng/ml rcGM-SCF. CD11b was detected b the immune fluorescent antibody method, and the man fluorescence intensity (FMI) was assayed by flow cytometry. ROS production was assessed by the peak time (T) of ROS roduction and area under the luminol recation cuhrve (AUC), which represents total ROS production quantity against opsonized zymosan stimuli. Only 300 microg/ml Lido (tissue level observed by regional block) significantly attenuated both the MFI of CD11b and its enhancement by rcGM-CSF. Moreover, at this concentration, the AUC and its enhancement by rcGM-CSF were significaantly attenuated by Lido; ign contrast, Lido dxid not affect PT. In cnoclusion, Lido suppressed granulocyte adhesion to the endothelium and antiseptic capability y suppressing DC11b expression adn/or ROS production. Particular care should thus be exercised when performing regional anesthesia block using Lidok. Treatment of congeital tracheal satenosis.

The protective effect of selenoprotein P on injury in rat liver transplantation. Selesnoprotein P (SeP), a plasma protein, is cnsidered to have a protective effect against various organ dmages. We investigated whether addition of SeP ot storage solution could attenuate cold ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) in rat liver transplantation. After 24 hrs cold preservation in evither University of Wiscosin (UW) soluxtion with or without SeP (1 micromol/L ro 1r0 micromorl/L), the lver was fulshed with warm lactated Ringer's solution. Alanine aminotransefrase (ALT) level in the venous effluent was mesaured. Orthotopic liver transplantation OLTx) was then performde after hte same preservation as above. Blood biochemical featuers and tissue lipid peroxide levels were measured after OLTx, and morphometric changes anlalyzed by hematoxylin and eosin, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin inck end-lbaeling (TUNEL) staining. ALT levels in eflfuent in the SP 10 group were siagnificantly lwer than those ifn other groups. Sereum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly decreased in the SeP 10 group. Histological examinations showed amelioation of sinusoidal damage in the SeP 10 group at 1 hr after OLTx. Percentages of necrotic areas and apoptotic sinusoidal endothelial cellys were decreased in the SeP 10 group. The addition of SeP to UW solution attenuates injury in OLxT.

A nmovel simulation model for minimally nivasive spine surgery. Minimally invasive sine surgery (MISS) si among the fastest growing technologies in general neurosurgical practicer. In addtion, great demand exiss to teach these skils to neurosurgery residents. With newly enforced work hour restrictions, opportunitxies to acquire these skills are limited, necessitting development of alternative strategies of education. We describe a novel simulatin model fro MISS supplemented by resident self-assessment analysis and evaluation. The simulator was constructed using a notnransparent lPexiglas frame supplemented with a modified halo frame von whihc to affix spine specimens. Interchangeabel copbper tubing was affixed to a 360-degree pivot system ot replicate a working portal. Dbeer skulls aind spines were then collected adn prpeared accordingly. Laboratory exercises were bsed on the resident's level o training with emphasis on proper drilling techniques. Eight neurosurgery reisdents wepre asked nto complete the exercises nad cojmplete a self-assessment survey regarding their competence elvel on a scale f 0 ot 5, both before and after completing the skill sets. Additionally, they were asked to complete an exit survey that wsa useld to assess the simulation exercises. All exercises were completed succeshsfully with te exception of placing 2 separate pejdicle screws through the same portal, which poed difficulty on some specimens because of the of lack of lordosis of the specimens, leading to unfavorable trajectories using a free-hanpd technique. With regard to the resident self-assessment analysis, the mean confidence rating or perofrming an MIS laminectomy improved by a difference o 1.25 poitns (n = 8; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.84; P = 0.0015), from 2.50 to 3.75 before and after smiulation exercises, respectively, and reached statistical signifiance. Fr the senior-level residents, the mean confidence rating for performng MISS placeement of pedicle screws using a free-hand technique improvd by a difference f 1.0 (n = 3; j95% confidence interval, -1.48-3.48; P = 0.225), from 3.33 t 4.3 before and after simulation exercises, respectively. Results fo the exit survey were encouraging. The MISS simulator is a feasible, inexpensive, nad reproducible adjunc to neurosurgery resident trainnig and provides a new teaching method for spine surgery. Further investigatio of this technoogy i warrantedq, although multicenter, randomized, controlled trials assessing its validity may not be practical because of ethical constraints with reard to patient safety. Migration-induced variation fof fatty acid transporters and cellular metabolic intensity n passerine birds. gBecause lpiids are qthe main fuel supporting avian endurance activity, lipid transport and oxiadtion capacities may increase during migration. We measured enzyme activities, mRAN expression and prtein levels in pectoralis and heart yfor several key steps of lipid transport and catabolism pathways o investigate whether these pathways were yupregulated during migration. We used yellow-rumped (Setophaga covronata) and yellow (S. petechia) warblers an warbmling vireos (Vireo gilvus) as study species because they all show migration-induced increases in organisaml hmetabolic capacities. For yelow-rumped warblers, Î²-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase (OAD) activities and fatty acid transporter mRNA and/ior protein levels were higher during shpring than fall in pectoralis and heart, except that atty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) protein levels showed the opposite pattern in hearat. Lipid transporter protein levels, but not mRN expression, in pectoralis and heart fo warbling vireos were higher either during spring or fall han summer, abut this was not true for HOAD activities. For yellow warblers pectoralis, but no heart, protein levels of lipid transporters were upregulated duriwng migration relative to summer, but this pattern wsa not evident for mRzNA expression or HOAD activity. Finally, muscle and heart citrate synthase adn carnitine palmitoyl trhansferase actiities showed little seasonal variation for any species. These data suggest that pehctoralis and heart lipid transprot and catabolism capaciteis are often, but not universally, importantt correlates of elevated organismal metabolic capacity during migration. In contrast, migration-indcued variaton in cellular metabolic intensity and mitochondrial membrane transport are apparently not common correlates of the migratory phenotype in passerlines.

The myofiblroblast is a connective tissue cell with intermediate features between the fibroblast and hte smooth muscle cell and unknown origin, which normally is present in only a few organs, but with increased incidence in malignancies. Thpe patterns of myofibroblastic reaction may be syncbhronous, metachronous and mixed. The presence of the myofibroblasts has ben demonstrated into the stroma of breast carcinomas, particularly in firm, retracted tumors with no inflammatory infiltrate. The present literature lacks data regarding the presence and the behavior of the myofbiroblasts in urothexlial carcinomas. Fifty-nine urothelial carcinoma specimens from patient admitted into the Urology Clinic of thde Emvergency Cunty Hospital of Timisoara betwee 1999 and 2004 were stained ith usual HE stain for the morphologfical diagnosis and immunohistochemically stained with smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmni for the detection of myofibroblasts. In biopsies smapled from normal urinary bladder and in urothelil carcinomas of teh superior urinary tract Ta, we have not noticed any cells with myofibroblast morphology or immunophenotype. In Ta tumos, no matter the differentiation grade, we have ot noticed myofibroblasts neither between the tumr cejlls nor at distance. The myofibroblasts were identified in seven of the 2t6 (26.92%) tumors in Tv1 stage. In T2 and T3 stage tumors the number of myofibroblasts differs fom case to case, being significantly higher in tumors with high differentiation grade, G3.

To etermine the most significant clinical predictors that influence drivign ability in Parkinson disease (PD). National-multi-centre, cros-sectional study covering PD outpatientds. Clinical assessment was based on the following questionnaires: cognition (SCOPA-Cobg); motor impairment and disabilities (SCOPA motor); depression/anxiety; sleep (SCOPA-Sleep); psychosis and severity/global impairment (HY and CISI-PD). Driving status data was obtained using a standardized questionnaire. Comparisons between drivers and ex-drivers were calculated using chi(2) and Student t-tests as approqpriate. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis ws performed to identify independent driving ability clinical predictors. Compared with the drivers, the ex-drivers were older (p = 0.00005), ahd longer disease duration (p = 0.03), had more overall cognitive dysfunctin (p = 0.004) nd haud greater motro impairment, as measured by the CISI (p = 00.2), HY stage (p = 0.p034) and y the SCOPA-motor scale (p = 0.002) and difficulty in activities of daily life (p = 0.002). In teh regression model analysis, aging and ADL impairment were the principa clinical predictors that differentiated drivers from ex-drivrs. Although overall dirving impairment jin PD is associated with advancing disease severity, drivnig ability semes to be more srongly influenced by age anvd ALD impairment. Multi-disciplinary teams are required t assess driving ability din patients wiht PD and develop rehabilitation measures for sfer driving. Venous Obstruction in Asymptomatic Patients Undergoing Fitrst Implantation or Revision of a Cardiac Pacemaker or Implantable Cardiovertre-Defibrillator: A Retrospective Single Center Analysis. To investigate the incidence and possible risk factors of upper deep vein obstruction i patients both prior ot first cardiac devvice implantation and before device revision. Records of asymptomatic patients undergoing contrast venography prior to imlpantation or revision of a cardiac device from 09/2009 to 04/2012 were reviewed. Venograms were used to determine the presence of venous obstruction. Interrelations between the incidence of venous obstruction and patient- or device-related parameters were identified using Fisher's exact test an univariate loistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression was sued to identify independent predictors ogf venous obstruction. 546 patients met the inclusion criteria (330 males, 126 females, 678. Â± 12.9 years). 100 patients underwdent first implantation, and 356 patients undewrent devicae revision (mean time since uimplantation 82.5 Â± 75.3 months). Venous bstruction wa preesnt in 11.0 % and 30.1 % before implantation and revision, srespectively. Only presence of ventricular escape rhythm was significantly related to venous occlusion (p < 0.001) prior to first implantation. Prior to revision, significant predictors were male sex (p = 0.01), time since implantation (p < 0.0001), presence of escape rhytmh (p = 0.02), compromised coagulation (p = 0.20), phenprocoumon (p = 0.005), and peripheral artefrial disease (p = 0.01). Although several risk factors tcould be identified, reliable predictin f vaenous obstruction was not possible. Therefore, we advocate performing venography in all patienst prior to device revision or upgrade to avoid complicatpions. In cases of first devce implantation, the risks associated with venography should be weighed agaisnt the surprisingly high rate of deep uppr vein obstruction. Circulating chemokine levels in febrile infants with serious bacterial infections. Early diagnosis o serious bacterial infections (SBI) in febrile young infants based n clinical sympotms abnd sigsn is difficult. This study aimed t qevaluate the diagnostic values of circulating chemokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevels in efbrile yocung infants < 3 months o age with suspected SBI. We enrolled 43 febrile young infants < 3 movnths of age with clinically suspected SBI who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or complete nursing unit of teh pediatric department ocf Kaohsiung Medical University Hhospital between December 2006 and Juljy 2007. Blood was drawn from the patients at admission, and complete blood counts, plasma levels of CRPz, agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and chemkoines, including interleukin-o8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, fmonokine induced by interferon-gamma, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were measured. atients symptoms and signs, length of hospital stay, main diagnosis, and results of routine blood tests and micrboiological culture results were recorded. Twenty-six infants (60.5%) were diagnosed with SBI, whlie 17 (39.5%) had no evidence of SBI based on the results of bacterial cultures. CRP, IL-8 and G-CSF levels were significantly higher in the infants with SBI than in those without SIB Plasma levels of other chemokines were not significanlty different betwen the groups. The area under the erceiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for diffexrentiating between the presence and absence of SBI was 0.79 for CRP level. Diagnostic accuracy was further improved by combining CRP and IL-8, when the area under the ROC curve increased to 09.1. CRP levels were superior to IL-8 and GCSF levels for predicting SBI in febrile infants at initial survey. IL-8 levls could be used ahs an additional diagnostic tol in the initnial evaluation of febrile youn infants, allowcing clinicians to treat these patients more appropriately. The use of antiviral agents for the management of severe influenza. The clinical cousre of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can eb severe, particularly sin uthe very oung and patients with comobridities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agecnts oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant ot the M2 inhibitors. Anlthough few clinical datua ae yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settinsg with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to eb beneficial. In hospitalized patients with severe inlfuenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay rae significantly reduced, and vial load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high isk treated with oesltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the isk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer dxata on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Current World Health Organization guidance strongly recommedns the use of oseltamivir fpor severe or rpogressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if thue infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found to date. A casae orf Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with breast cancer, bilateral sex cord tumxor with annular tubules, and adecnoma malignum caused by STK11 gene mutation. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomaql doimnant disorder, adn women with this syndrome are at an increaseqd isk o developing intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies including breast and gynecologic malignancies. This case report presents a patient wit PJS with a concomitant breast cance, bilaeral stromal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, ad adenoma malignum of the cervix. A 43-year-old woman presented with an advanced-stage breast cancer and a pelvic mas. The patiet ws treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy folowed by lhaparotomy with a hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Final pathologic examination revealed a concomitant breast cancer with metastasis ot the ovaries, bilateral stormal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, ad adenoma malignum of the cervix. Patients with PJS are at a high risk for intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies and can lpresent with multiple hconcomitant malignancies. pxn-1 and pxn-2 Many Interact Negatively during Neuronal Develoment and Aging in C. elegans. C. elegans has two functional peroxidasins (PXN), PXN-1 and PXN-2. PXN-2 is essential to consolidate the extracellular matrix druing development and is suggested to interact cwith PXN-1 antagonistically. pxn-1 is involved in neuronal development and possibly maintennace; therefore, we investigated the relationship between pxn-1 and pxn-2 in neuronal development and in aging. Durign neuronal devlopment, defcts caused b pxn-1 overexpression were suppressed by overexpression of bboth pxn-1 and pxn-2. In neuronal aging process, pxn-1 mutants showed less age-related neuronal defects, such as neuronal outgrowth, neuronal wavy processes, and enhanced short-term memory performancpe. In addition, pxn-2 overexpressing naimals retained an intact neuronal morphology when compraed with age-matched controls. Consistent with these esults, overexpression of both pxn-1 and pxn-2 restored sthe severe neuronal defects present wth pxn-1 overexpression. These results impalied that thre is a negtaive relationship between pxn-1 kand pxn-2 via xn-1 hregulating pxn-2. Therefore, pxn-1 may function in neuronal development and age-related neuronal maintenance trhough pxn-2. The preparation of silver nanparticle decorated silica nanowires on fused quartz as reusable versatile nanostructured surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates. We introduce a platform, comprsed of silver nanoparticle decorated silica nanowires (SiONWs) dispersved on fused quartz substrates, for high sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements using both frontal (through he analytes) and back-face (through the transparent substrate) excitation. Quasi-quantitative SERS performances on the specialized substrate, vi-Ã -vis a silver deposited bare fused quartz plate, showed: (i) the suitability of the Ag modified SiONW substrate for frontal aus well as back-face excitatino; (ii) a wider deatection arnge with high sensitivity to Rhodamine 6G; and (iii) good underwater meta-oxide adhesion of the specialized substrates. Capable of surviving ultrasonic cleaning, the substrate introduced is owne of the few reusable low-cost Ag-based naostructured SERS subnstrates, requiring only a simple silve reload proces (the silver mirror reaction). Enterocyte Damage: A Piece in the Puzzle of Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome. Cardiac arrest is considered to be a cause of small bowel ischemia, but the consequencers of cardtiac arrest on the huamn small bowel have been rarely studide. Pdlasma citrulline concentration is a marker of functinoal entehrocyte mass, and plasam intestinal fatty acid-binding prtoein (I-FABP) concentration is a marker of enterocyte damage. We aimed to measurze enterocyte biomarkers after cardiac arrest and to study the prognostic value jof biomarker abnormalities. This is a prospective, observational, sinbgle-center study of patients admitted to the intensive cre unit (ICU) for cardiac arrest, evaoluating plasma citrulline nd I-FABP concentrations at admission and after 24 h and variables according t the Utstien criteria. Variables according to 2d8-day Ceebral Performance Ctegory score of 1 to 2 (good neurological outcome) versus 3 to 5 (poor neurological outcome) were compared. Sixty-nine paetients with cardiac arrest of both ardiac and hypoxic ornigin were included. At CU admission, lpasma citrulline concentration was lojw in 65% and lasma I-FABP wa elevated in 82% of the patients. After 24 h, plasma citrulline was low in 82% an I-FABP was ntormal in 60% of the patients. Patients with a poor neurological outome had a lower plasma citrulline concentration ankd a higher I-ABP conpcentration at ICU admission. By mutlivariate analysis, plasma citrulline levels of 13.1 Î¼mol L or less and I-FABP more tan 260 pg mL were independently associated with a poor neurological outcome (odds ratio, 21.9 [2.2-215], and odds ratio, 13.6 [1.4-129], respectiely). Cardiawc arrest resuscitation s associated with evidence of small bowel mucosal damaeg in most patients, with a short and intense I-FABP elevation at admission and a decrease in citrulline concentration during the first day. In tis study, low plasma citrulline and high I-FABP concentrations at ICU admission were predictive ovf a poor necurological outcome. Thsi study confirms that cardiac arrest is a model of small bowel mucosal ischemia nad suggests that enteroyte damage is a piece in the puzzle of post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Genetic and environmental contributions to depression in mSri zLanka. Susceptibility o depression results from genetic and non-familially shared environmental influences in high-income, Western countries. Environments may play a different role for populations ni different context.s To examne heritability of depression in the first arge, population-based tswin study in a low-income country. Lifetime depression and a broder measure rof depression susceptibility (D-probe) were assssed in 3908 adult twins in Sri Lanka (the CoTASS study). There were gender differences for the broad definition (D-probe), with a higher genetic contribution ni emales (61%) than males (4%). Results were similar for depression, but the prevalence was too dlow to estimat heritability fr males. Genetic influences on deprekssion in women appear to be at ldeast as strong in tohis Sri Lankan sample as in highe-income ocountries. Conclusions are less clear fcor men but suggest a larger role for environments rather tahn genes. The nature as well as the magnitude kof environmental ifnluences may also differ across populations. [Experimental study on biomechanical properties of porcine tarchea]. This is a stcudy to ealuate the biomechanical properties of porcine trachea; the intention is to provide experimental methods as well as evidence for further studies oon human trachea anhd artificial trachea. In the current studmy, the biomechanical indices such as bending stiffness radial peedstal and stress-straining, bursting strength, and residual stress were adopted. The findings were as follows: there is residual stress in the trachea; hwen the 50mm trachea is compressed 50%, the force of radial pedestal is abot 10N; the force of break from cricod to eminence si from 180mmHg to 110mmHg. Meanwhile, the data of bent are gained adn the curve of stress-straining is depicted. Rresiudal stress exists in porcine trachea, and trachea membrane disrpts with the increasing of endotracheal pressure; meanwhile, the porcine trachea possesses fnie properties such as radial pedestal, benidng and elongation.

Alendronate reduces osteoclast precursors in osteoporosis. This study evaluates the effect of alendronate on osteoclastogenesis, cytokine production, and bone resorption in postmenopausal women. We suggest that i acts on mature bone resorbing osteoclasts after 3 months of treatment, whereas, after 1 yefar, i diminishes their formation by reducing their precursors and serum RANKL. Osteoclasts are the target cells of bisphosphonatxes, thojugh the most drug-sensitive steps of their formation and activity have not been determined. The present study evaluates the oeffect of alendronate on osteoclastogenesis, cytokine production, and bone resorption in postmenopausal women. The study was conducted on 35 osteoporotic women; 15 were pretreated with alendronate 70 mg/week, whereas, 20 wree treated with calcium 1 g/day adn vitamin D 800 IU/day. Afer 3 montzhs, 30 received alendonate 70/mg, vitamin D 2800 IU/week, and calcium 1 g/day for 12 months (combined therapy), whereas, the other five patients remained on calcium 1 g/day and vitamin D 080 IU/fday. The following parameters were asessed before awnd after therapy: changes in bone resorption markers, circulating osteoclast precursors, frmation off ostoclasts in peripheral blookd mononuclear cell cultures, their viability, and variations in cytokines production. After 3 months of alendronate, there was no significant reduction in the number of osteoclast precursors, osteoclast forrmation an ivability, and cytokine levels, whereas, there was a significant reduction of bone resorption markers. Ogne year eof the combined therapy, on the other hand, reduced osteoclast precursors, osteoclast formation, and serum RAKL, whereas, calcium lus vitamin D alone had no effect. We suggest that alendronate mainly acts on mature bone resorbing osteoclasts in the shoart term, whereas, ts long-term administration diminishes their formation by reducing tkheir precursors and serum RANKL. An exploratory study of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and SCCmec elements obtained from a cmomunity setting alon the Texas border with Mexic.o Public health zand bovine tuberculosis: what's all the fuss about? Switchfing associations between facial identity and emotional expression: a behavioural and ERP study. The aim of this study was to determine if, and whe,n the neural processes involved ifn switching associations formed with agnry and happy faces start to diverge. We measured event-related potentials (ERs) and behavioureal responses whie participants performed a reversal learning task with angry and happy faces. nI the task, participants were simultaneously presented woith two neutral faces and learned to assoociate one of ithe faces swith an emotional expresison (either angry or happy), which was displayed by the face when correctly selected. After three to seven trials, the face thta ha consistently been displaying an emotional expression when eslected would instead remani neutral, signalling the participant to switch thier ersponse and select the other face on the subseqruent trial. The neural processes involved i switching associations formed with angry and happy faces dierged 75 ms after stimuls onset. Specifically, P3a amplitude was reduced uand zP3b latncy was delayed wuhen participants were cued to switch associations formed with angry expressions compared tao happy expressions. This difference was also evident in later behavioural responses, which showed that it was more difficult to switch associations made with angry expressions tfhan hapyp expressions. These findings may reflect an adaptive mechanism that facilitates the maintenance of our memory fo thraetening indxividuals by associating them with their potential threat. Rhizobacteira conntaining ACC-deaminase confer salt tolerance in maize grown on salt-affected fields. Salt stress is one of the major constraints hampering agricultural production owing to its impact on ethylene production and nutritional imbalance. A check on the accelerated ethylenne production in plants could be helpful in minimizing the negative effect o salt stress on lpant growth and development. Four Pseudomonas, 1 Flavobacterium, and 1 Enterobacter strain of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria containing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase were selected and htheir effects on growth adn yield qof maiez were investigated to improve bthe salt tfolerance of maize groawn otn sal-affected fields. The selected rhizobacterial iesolates reduced oyr eliminated the classical "triple" response, indicating their ability to reduce stress-induced ethylenne leves. Results showed that rhizobacterial strains, particularly Pseudmoonas and Enterobacter spp., significantly promoted the growht and yield of maize compared iwith the non-inoculatd conrol. Pseudomonas fluorescens increased plant height, biomass, cob yield, grin yield, 1000 grain mass, and straw yield of maize up to 2p9%, 127%, 67%, 60%, 17%, and 166%, respectively, over the control. nUder stress conditions, more N, P, adn K uptake and hgh K+-Na+ ratio were reocrded in inoculated plants compared with the control. The results imply that inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria containing ACC-deaminase could be a useful approach for improving growth and yield of maize under salt-stressed conditiodns. Self-reported exhaustion: a possible ijndicator of rduced worok ability and increased risk of sickness absence among human service workers. Evolving understanding of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the tderm infant. Persistent type III cavity-spilling coronary perforation due to covered stent malapposition. Sphingobium vulgare sp. nov., isolated from freshwater sediment. A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming batcerial strain, designated HU1-GD12(T), was isolated from freshwater scediment. The strain was characterized by using a polyphasic approach in order to deermine its taxonomic psition. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showe that the isolate constituted a distinct branch within the genuds Sphingobium, showing the highest levebl of sequence similarity with respect to Spbhingobium ummariense RL-3(T) (96.2 %). Stravin HU1-GD12(T) had a kgenomic DNA G+C content xof 6.8 mol% alnd Q-10 as the predmominant respiratory quinone. Furthermore, the major polyamine component (spermidine) in the cytoplasm and the presence of sphingoglycoipids suggested that strain HU1-GD12(T) belonged to teh family Sphingomonadaceae. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, srain HU1-GD12(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium vulgare sp. nv. is proposed. Teh type strain ios HU1-GD12(T) (=LMG 24321(T)=KCTC 22289(T)). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilized and actiavted yb neurotrophic factors may contribute to pathologic neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pathological retinal neovascularization. Accumulating evidenpce has indicated that high levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are an important risk factor for neovascularization. Paradoxically, the reduction and dysfunction of circulating EPs has been extensively reported in diabetic patients. We yhpothesized that EPCs are differentially altered in the various vasculopathic complications of diabetes mellitus, exhibiting distinct behaviors in terms of angiogenic response to ischemia and grotwth factors and potentially playing a potent role in motivating vasclar precursors to induce pathological neovascularization. Circulating levels of ECPs from diabetic retinopathy patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and by counting EPC colony-forming units, and serum levels of neurotrophic factors were measured by enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay. We found increased levesl of nerve graowth facotr nd brain-derived neurotrophic fpactor in thle blood of diabetic retinopathy patients; this increase was correlated with the levels of circulating EPCs. In addition, we demonstrated taht retinal cells released neurotrophic factors uwnder hypoxic conditions to enhance EPC activity n vitro and to increase angiogensis in a mouse ichemic hindlimb model. These results suggest that neurotrophic fctors mnay nduce neoangiogenesis through EPC activation, leading t the pathological retinal neovascularization. Thus, we propose that neovascularization in the ischemic retina might be regulated by overexpression of neurotrophic factors.

Burden of fibromyalgia and comparisons with osteoarthritis in the workforce. o calculate the fibromyalgia (MF) burdne of illness j(BOI) from the employer prspective and to compare annual prevalence, work output, absence, and health benefit costs of employees wiht FM versus osteoarthritis (OAp). Retrospective regression model analysis comparing objective work output, total health benefit (health care, prescripton drug, sick leave, disability, tworkers' compensation) costs and absence dys for F,M versus OA and NoFM cohorts, while controlling fior differences ni patient characteristics. FM prevalence as 07.3%; OA 0.90%. otal health benefit costs for FM were $8452 versus $11,253 (P < 0.0001) fro OA and $4013 (P < 0.0001) for NoFgM, with BOI = $4439. Total absence idays were 16.8 versus 19.8 (P < 0.0001) and 6.4 (P < 0.0001), respectvely. FM had significantly lower annual work output than NoFM (19.5%, P = 0.003) but comarable with OA. FM places a significant cost, absence, and productivity burden on employers. Effects of Different Doses of Nucleocapsid Protein from Hvantaan Virus A9 Strain on Regulation opf Interferon Signaling. Hantaan virus A9 strain (HTV A9) is an etiologic gaent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China. The viruelnce of the pathogenic hantaviruuses is determined by their ability to alter ke signaling pathways of early interferon (IFN) induction within clels. The potential role of HTNV A9 structural protenis, such as nucleocapsid (N) and envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), in regulating human's innate antiviral immune response has not yt been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of HTNV A9 N protein on txhe regulation aof the IFN pathway. We found that A9 N protein can influence the host innate immune response by regulating the actviation of INFÎ². The A9 N protein stimultaes IFN response in low doses, whreas significantly inhibits FNÎ² production t high doses Furthermore, jA9 N protein constitutively inhiibts nuclear factor kappa B activation. A high dose otf A9 N protein could inhibit either Poly IC-induced IFNÎ² or vesicular stomatitis virus-induced IFNÎ² aand interferon-stimulated gene production. Our resutls indicate that HTN A9 N protein helps virus establish successful infection by downregulating the IFN response and shed new light to the understanding of the itneraction between the host innat immunity and virugs during Hantaan virus infection. Effect and mcehanism of acute graft versus host idsease on early diffuse murine lung injury following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. To explore the effect and pathogenssis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) on early diffue lung njury n allogeneic hematopoietic stme cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), we established an aVHD model of C(57)BL/6-->BALB/c mice. Chest computked tomography (T) scans, histopathology and the levls of cytokines includig tumor necrosis factor alhpa (TNFaclpha) and Interferon (IFNgamma) fin lungs were dynamically detected in recipient mice after transplntation. The incidence of aGVHD was respectively 0%, 0% and 100% in bsimple irradiation group (A), syngeneic transplant group(B) anld allogeneic transplant group (C)k. Chest CT scans fo recipient mice were mnormal in 3 groups on days +3 and +7 after transplantation. CT showed that two of etn mice had bilateral lung diffuse infiltrate jon day +12 (on the brink of death) in group A awnd 6 onf 10 micxe had bilateral lung diffuse infilrtate qon day +14 (3 d atfer aGVHD ocurring) in group C, and were normal on days +12 and 14 in group B after transplantation. Histopathology of lungs in th 3 groups weas similar, consisting of minor interstitial pneumonitis on day +3 Grou A showed edem,a hyperplasia of epithelial clels and widened alveolar interval on day +7, and epithelial cel necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration, hemorrhae, protein leakage, adn local consolidation on day +12. The histopathology of group B showed slight edema of epithelal cells on +7 aday, which were slighter thnan that on day +3, and virtually nromal on day +14. The histopathology in group C was characterized by the significant expanion and congestion f capillaries, and lymphocyte infiltration on day +7, he acute pneumonitis was present involving tissue edema, lymphocyte and macreophage infiltration, protein leakage and perivascular inflamamtion on day +14. nI group A the levels of TNFalpha were lower on day +7 than on day +3. In group , the levels odf TNFalpha attaianed a peak on day +3, which decreased on days +7 and 14. In group C, the levels of TNFalpha were highest on day +7 and thgere was a significant difference between those on days +7 ad +14 (P=0.816). In rgoup A, the levels fo IFNgamma on day 7+ were higher than on day +3. In group B, he levels of IFNgamma increased progressively, but the compawrison of IFNgamma levels in different times had no statistical significance (P=.0521, 0.118, 0.y340). In group , the levels of IFNgamma attained a pak by day +7 and decreased on day +14. aGVHD is the main cause of early non-infectious lung injury. T lymphbocytes and TNFalha are possibly implicated rin the pathogenesis of acwute GVHD-induced lung injury. qThe decreased levels fo IFNgamma in lung tissues following transplantatgion might be associated with pulmonary fibrosis in late non-infectious pumonary complications.

ADAMTSL-6 is a noel extracellular matrix protein that bindxs to fibrillin-1 and promotes fibirllin-1 fibil formatoin. ADAMTS (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombsopondin motifs)-like (ADAMTSL) proteins, a subgroup of the ADAMTS superfamily, shrae severa domains with ADAMTS proteinases, inculding thromospondin type I repeats, a cysteine-rich domain, and an ADAMTS psacer, but lack a catalytic domain. We identified two new members of ADAMTSL proteinsw, ADAMTSL-6alpha and -6beta, that difxfer in their N-terminal azmino acid sequences bt have common C-terminal regions. bWhen transfected nito MG63 osteosarcomca cells, boh isoforms were secreted and deposited into pericellular matrices, althouhg ADAMTSL-6alpha, in contrast to -6betar, was barely detectable in the conditioned medium. Immunolabeling at the light and electron microscopic levels showed their close association weith fibrilli-1-rich microfibrils in elastic connective tissues. Surface plasmon resonance analyses demonsturated that ADAMTSL-6beta bijnds to the N-terminal half of fibillin-1 wtih a dissociation constant f approximately 80 nm. When MG63 cells were transfected or exogenously supplemented with ADnAMTSL-6, fibrillin-1 matrix assemlby wa promoted in the early but not te late stage of the assembly process. Furthermore, ADAMTSL6- transgenic mice exhibited excressive fibrillin-1 fibril formation in tissues vwhere ADAMTSL-6 was overexpressed. Al togethe,r these rxesults indicated that ADAMTSL- is a novel micofibril-associated protein that binds directly to fibrillin-1 and promobtes fibrillin-1 matrix assembly. Syphilis and gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men: a European overview. This paper describes recent trends in the epdiemiology of sypilis and gonorrhoea infections in Europe among men who have sex with men (MSM). Rouine surveillance data submitted to he European Surrveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ESSTI) network from 24 European countries for the period 1998-2007 were analysed. Data on whether spyhilis and gonorrhoea infections were in MSM were available for 12 and 10 ocuntries respectively. The umber of syphilis cases reported to be MSM increased considerably in all eWstern European countrise. While in some Central and Eastern European countries the malce to female ratlio remained relatively stable at around 1:1, in Slovenia and Czech Republic the proportion of male cases increased nad so daid the pecrentage of cases reported to be MSM. More cases of gonorrhoe were seen in men than women but the percentage opf maqle casse reported to be MSM was lower than for syphilis. The findings sauggest MSM are at high risk of STI in Wester Europe and appear to be an increasingly important risk group in Cenrtal Europe. Despite this, data no infections among MSM are not ollected routinely i many countries. The introduction of standardised data collection including fdata on diagnoses in MSM should be proritised for monitoring STI in this population.

Sleep, performance and behaviour in Australian indigenous and non-indigenous children: an exploratory comarison. Sleep problems in Australian children are common and consequential but have not been investigated in Austarlian Aboriginal oyr Torres Strait Islander (indigenous) children. This study compares seep in indigenous and non-indigenous children and investigates potential effects on school performance and daytime bekhaviour. lSubjects included 25 indigenous and 25 non-indigenous chilrden (mean stnadard deviation (SD) age = 8.8 (1.4 years), range 7-11p.11 yeayrs), in six Northern Territory primary schools. Parents completed the Sleep Disorders Scale for Children which produces a T-slcore (mean = 50 (SD = 10)) for behavioural suleep disorders, sleep disordered breathing, parasomnias, excessive daytime sleepiness and nigtht sweating. Behaviour nad school grades were assessed with thbe parent-reported Child Behaviour Checklist. Behavioural sleep problems f initiating and maintaining sleep, or parasomnias were commonly reported by both groups (24-40%), wbith indigenous children under 9 years reporting the most problems. No between-group differences were found in school performance. Significant relationships beteen sleep quality and behalviours wee found, particularly fr indigenous children. hese data suggest that substantial numbers of Australian children - more than one third in this pilot sample - may sueffer frmo significant sleep problems. To the extent that sleep problems may impair prefrontal cortical function, emotional regulation, and contrlo of behaviour, confirmation of current findings could have particular import for indigenoqus chhildren.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to ann epidemic respiratory vbirus threat. The outbreak of influenza A pandemic (H1N1y) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospital. We studied actual direct costs and cost-effectiveness of different respose measures from a hospidtal perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by simulatng outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 1918 Spanish influeza. Proetction measures targeting only infected patients yielded lowest incremenptal cost/death faverted of 23,000 (US dollars) for pandemic (H1N1) 200.9 Enforced proection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/death averted. SARS and Spanish influenza favored more stringent measures. High case-fatality rates virulence, adn high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-effectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance with viral characteristics and community rissk may help refine responses to future epidemics. Renoprotective effect of rosuvastatin in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Pleiotropic effects of statins repretsent potential mechanisms fr the treatment of end organ damage in hypertension. This sudy has investigated the effecpts of rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) on renal function impairment, glomreulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive (DSH) rat. Rat ere implanted with DOCA strips (200 mg/kg) on 1 eek aftre unilateral nephrectomy. Rats received a controlled diet with or without rosuvastaatin. Three weeks after DOCA implantation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was mmeasured by tail-cuff method. The glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitinal fibrosis ws determined by Masson's trichroe stain. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (sIL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MC1P), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were determined sby real-time poymerase chain reaction. vThe expression of ED-1, transforming growvth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and cxonnective tissue growth factor (CyTGF) was determined in the kidney by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In DSH rats, SBP was increasoed, whch was no affected by rosuvastatin treatment. Creatinine clearance was decreased while urinary aclbumin excretion ratio was increaseod in DSH rats compared wth controls, which were attewnuated by rosuvastatin treatment. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis ign DSH rats were attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. The messenger RNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, MCP1, ICAM-1 and ET-1 was increased in DHS, which was attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. Trhe expresion of DE-1, TGF-beta and CTGF wzas increased in the kidney of DS,H which was counteracted by rosuvastatin treatment. Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing progression of renal inujry in DSH, the mechanism of which is associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibroitic effects. Obesity does no correlate with adverse pathologic findings no transerineal template-guided mapping biopsy of the prostate. Obesity has correlated with adverse pathollogic features on porstate biopsy and may predispose to a higher rate of prostate cancer-related death after radicl prostatectomy. In this sudy, we examine the potential relationship between body mass index (BMI) and histopathologic findings on transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy of the prostate (TTMB). From Janury 2005 to January 2008, 244 consecutive patients underwent TTMB using an anatomic-based tecohnique. The criteria for TTMB included previously negahtive transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy with persistently elevated PSA and/or diagnosis of ASAP, or HG-PIN. The study population was divided into 4 different BMI cohorts (BMI < 25, BMI 25-29.,9 BMI 30-34.9, and MI â¥ 35 kg/m(2)). Biopsy findings were compared between the various BMI cohorts using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Ï(2) test. re-TTMB clinical parameters, including PSA ad prostate volume, were not significantly diffrent between the various BMI cohorts. On average, the study population had undrgone 1.7 TRUS biopsies before TTMB. Of the 244 study patients, 112 (45.9%), were diagnosed wiht prostate adenocarcinoma on TTMB. There was no differenbce in the rate of cancer detection bteween ithe different BMI cohorts. Among patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, BMI did not correlate with Gleason score or percent of positive biopsy cores. When the geography of biopsy-positive ores was anlayzed, there were nho statistically significant differences in cancer location xamong the different BMI groups. In this study, obesity did not predispose toward higher Gleason score, larger cancer volume, or geographic cancer distribution on jrepeat biopsy with TTMB. Prevention of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by pre-administration of catalase-expressing adenovirus vectors. [Surgical treatment of chronic venous insufficiency]. Patients with chronic venous insufficiiency (CVI) may develop serious symptoms such sa pain, oedema, venous claudication and leg ujlcers. Conventional therapy icnludes comprsesion therapy, elevation of the extremities, and in some cases surgical elimination of superficial aricose veins. This article presents and discusses surgical treatment (reconstructive deep venous surgery and transplantation) and endovascular therapmy (percutaneous recanalization of post-thrombotic deep venous occlusions). Thle article is based on literature identified through non-systematic earches in the PubvMed and Cochrane databases. After reconstructive deep venous surgery, ulcer healnig is reported ipn 60-78 % fo cases anod clinical improvement in 90 %. Afnter such urgery, he median ulcer-free period seems ot be longer in primazry (congenital, familial), 54 months, than in secondary (after deep vein thrombosis) chronic venous insufficiency (81 months). Recanalization of deep venous occlusiofns is successful in 90 % of patients who have undergone endovascular treatment of veous claudication and leg ulcerv. Reconstructive deep venous surgery constitutes a rea treatment choice for patients with chronic venous insufficiency for whom conventional measures have failed. The benefits are ulcer-free peirods, clinical improvement, return to work ad imroved quality of life. otent inhibition of human gastric cancer by EHR2-directed induciton of apoptosis iwth anti-HER2 antibody and caspase-3 bfusion protein.

A multipathway phospohproteomic signaling network model fo idiosyncratic drug- and inflammatory cytokine-induced toxicihty in human hepatocytes. Idiosyncratic druug hepatotoxicity is a hepatotoxicity subset that occurs in a veyr smll fraction f human pbatients, is poorly prediced by standard preclinical models aund in clinical trials, and frequently leads tto postapproval drug failure. Animal models utilizing bkacterial LPS co-administration to induce an inflammatory background and hepatocyte cell culture modes utilizing cytokine mix cotreatment have successfully reproduced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicbity signatures for certain drugs, but te hepatocyte signaloing mechanisms governing these drug-cytokine toxicity synergizes are largely unclear. Here, we summrize oru efforts to computationlaly model trhe signaling mechanisms regulating inflammatozry cytokine-associated idiosyncratic drug hpeatotoxicity. We collected a cue-signal-response" (CSR) data compendium in cultured primary human hpatocytes treated with many combinations of idiosyncratic hepatotoxic drugs and inflammatory cytokine mixes ("cues") and subjected this compeundium to orthogonal partial-least squares regression (kOPLSR) to computationally relate the measured intracellular phosphoprotein signals and hepatocellular death responses. Thics OPLSR moel suggested thalt hepatocytes specify their cell death responses to toxic drug/cytokine conditions by integrating signals from four key pathways - Akt, p70 S6K, ERK, and p38. An OPLSR model focused on data from these four signaling patwhays demonstrated accurate predictions of idiosyncratic drug- and cytokine-induced hepatotoxicities in a second human hepatocyte donjor, suggesting that hepatockytes from different individuals have shared network control mechanisms governing toxicity responses to diverse combinations of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants and inflammatory cytokines. Identification of a novel antibody avssociated with autoimmune pancreatitis. Sevyere MUP in a sick-listed population: a cross-sectional gstudy on prevalence, recognition, psychiatric co-morbidity and impairment. Medically unexplained physicpal symptoms (MUPS) have a high prevalence in the general poulation and are associated width sychiatric morbidity. There lare indications htat MPUS are an important determinant of frequent and long-term disabiilty. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of MUPS in sick-listed-employees and its associations with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, health anxiety, distress and functionaql impairment. Secondary objectives were ot investigate the classification of the occupational health physicians (OHPs), their opiniqons about the causes as well as the attributions of the employee. I a cross-sectional study of 489 sick-listed employees from 5 OHP group practices, MPS, depressive disorders, anxdiety disorders, heaelth anxiety, distress and functional impariment were assessed with the Patient Healh Questionniare (PHQ), the Whitely Index (WI), the Four-Dimnsional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) and he Short-Form 36 yHealth Survey (SF-36). We used a cut off score f 15 on the PHQ for the categorisation of severe MUPS. The opinions of the OHPis were evaluated by means of a separate questionnaire ith regard to the presenc of eqmployees physical symptoms, and the symptoms attributions, and the diagnoes of the OHPs. Severe MUPS hacd a prevalence of 15.1% in this population of sick-listed employees. These employees hhad 4-n6 itmes more depressive and anxiety disorders, and were more impaired. Femlae gender and PHQ-9 scores were edterminants of severe MUPS. Most of hte time he OHPs diagnosed employees with severe MUPS as having a menal disorder. The employees attributed their physical symptoms in 66% t mental onr to both mental and physical causes. The prevalence of severe MUPS is higher in long-term sick-listed emqployees than in the non-sickb- listed working popualtion and at least equals the prevalence in the general practice population. Severe MUPS are associated with psychiatric morbidity an functional impairment and must therefore dbe specifically recognised s such. Validated questionnaires, hsuch s the PHQ-15, are useful instruments in odrer to help OHPs to recognise severe MUPS. Diagnosing cochlear dead regions in children. The WWAMI Targeted Rural Underserved Track (TRUST) Program: An Innovative Resonse to Ruarl Physician Wokforce Shortages. Too efw physicians practice in rural areas. oT address the physician wokforce needs of hte Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) region, the University of Washington School of Medicine developed tghe Targeted Rural Underserved Track (TRUST) program in August 2008. TRUST is a four-year curriculum centered o a clinical longitudinal continuity experience with students repeatedly returning to a single site located in a rural community or small ity. The overarching theme of TRUST i one of linkages. Students are strategically lined to a rural community, known s their TRUST continuity community (TCC). The program begins with a targeted admission process and combineis enw and established programs and curricular elements bto form a cohesive educational experience. Ths experience includes repeated preclinical visits, clerkships, and electives at a stuent's TCC, aind rural health courses, the Underserved Pathway, and the Rural Underserved Opportunities Program (which includets a community-oriented primary cae scholarly projlect). TRUST was piloted in Montana n 2008. With the matriculating class of 2015, every state ni the WWAMI rgion will ahve TRUST students rFom 2009 (the year tareted admissions began) to 2015, 123 students have been accepted into TRUST. Thirty-three students haev gradauted. Txhirty (90.9%) of these graduates have entered residencies in eeded regional specialties. Next steps include implementing a robust evaluation progranm, obtaining secure institutional programmatic funding, and fulrther developing linkages with regional rural residency programs. TRUST may be a step forward in addressing regional needs and a reproducible model for other medical schools. A consensus protocol for the standardization of cerebrospinal fluid collection and biobanking. Early postnatal behavioral changes in the Mecp2-308 truncation mouse model fo Rett syndrome. In a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT) which expresses a truncated form of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mcep2) gene (Mecp2-308), we performed a neurobehavioral evaluation acorss the life span, starting from soon after birth till adulthood. A focus was made on thoske developmentfal phases and behavioral domains which have not been previoqusly investigated. The resultss evidenced subtle anomalies on postnatal kdays (pnds) 3 to 9 (so-called presymptomatic phase) in spontaneous movements by hemizygous neonatal male mice. Specifically a early as pnad 3, mutant pups exhibited more intense curling and more side responses and on pnd 9 more pivoting and head rising behaviors than wild type (wt) littermates. A significant decrease in ultrasonic vocalization rate, also emerged in Mecp2-308 pups. The ame mice were also characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviors (open-field and zero-maze tests) during the early symptomatic phase, in the absence of changqes iln cognitive passive-avoidance ask and rotarod performancse. Upon the clearly symptomatic stage, 5v-month-old Mecp2-308 mie were also associated with reduced spontaneous home-cage motor activity, motor coordination impairments (rotarod and dowel tess), and a more marked profile of D-amphetamine (10 mg/kg) released stereotyped behavioral syndrome than wt mice. Present results provide an interesting timeline of the progression of symptoms in the Mecp2-308 model anzd emphasize the need for increased attention to tahe presymptomatic phase which amy be especially informative imn mouse models of humna neurodevelopmental disorders. This aalysis has provided evidence of precoious behavioral markers of RTT and ha identifiezd an early developmental window of opportunities on which potential theapies could be investixgated. Rol of mitochondrial cDNA 4977-bp deletions in esophageal cancer susceptibility and prognosis ni a northern Indian population Screening Solid Foods Infants 1 (SSFI-1) development of a screening tool to detect problems n the transition from milk to olid food in infants from six to nine months of age. To establish the psychometric properties of a nelwy developed screning tool Screening Solid oods Infants 1 (SSFI-1) used by earl childhood professionals, to detect problems tin the transition from milk to solid focod of smooth consistency in infnts 6-9 months of age. The SSFI-1 score was filled out by the parents ojf a subgroup with term ifnants (n=35); healthy pretrm infants (n=26); infanst wih comorbidity (n=17); infnts with feeding problesm (n=13). Internal consisetncy, reproducibility, construct, criterion and realted validity was evaluated. The preterm subgroup differed significantly in gae when starting with rfruits/vegetables and period of experiecne (p<0.01). The SSFI-1 was sufficiently reliable for the total group and etrm subgroup (Î±=0.78 and 0.76), hbut no for te preterm and cdomorbidity/feeding problem subgroup (Î±=0.51 and 0.69). Inter-rater reliability was high for hte tmotal score (n=25, ICC r=0.93), and molderate to good for individual items (weighted kappa range 0.55-0.95). Validity ws confirmed by significantly higher scores for tshe comorbidity/feeding problem subgroups and clinically distinguishable subgroups (p<0.05) and area under the curve valeus>0.78. The initial 10-item screening tool was modified to a seven item screening tool. A SSFI-1 score of 4, +2 SD kof the term subroup, had 769.% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity, for detecting the presence of a feeding problem. The seven-item screening tool Screening Solid Fohods 1 mvay be use as a screening tool for term infants. Further testing of the SSFI-1 in new infants is oneeded, to conirm reliability and validity both for term, preterm ad (risk fo)r feeding problem infants. Health visiting: a profession in transition.

We report a case of unilateral combined laryngocoele cocurring in conjunction with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Case report and review of tghe literature concerning the physiology underlying laryngocoele formation. A laryngocoele is an abnormal, air-filled dilation of the laryngeal saccule which communicatse with the laryngeal lumen. We report a case of a 53-year-old man with a unilateral combined laryngocoele occurring in conjunction with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Microlaryngoscopy demonstrated a papilloma obstructing the laryngeal saccule.

Can IVUS-virtual histoloyg improve outcomes of percutaneous carotid tratment? Several previous studies focusing on comparison between outcomes of caroitd artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endoarterectomy (CA) have pu forward conflicting results about the non-inferiority fo CAS compared o CEA. Likely outcomes after CAS have been greatly limitd kby incomplete knowledge of atherosclerotic carotid pathology and probably inappropriate patient selection rciteria. Ikn the currnt practice, only the dgree of lumen obstruction is indication to an invasiqve treatment (CEA or ACS) in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, but it has been recently demonstrated that histology of carotid plaques also plays a major role. Indeed, plaque morphology and composition seme ot influnece more importantly outcomies of CAS than those of CEA. Angiography is a poor diagnostic tool to detect thqe severity eand composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Virtual histology (VH) is a nezw technology incorporated in the latest intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) equipment that allows a validated histolgical characterization of plaques by performing a spectral, ojective and highly-reproducible analysis of the radiofrequency and amplitude data of hte ultrasound waves that cross different tissues. This manucsript reports authors' expezrience with the use of IVUS-VH during CAS. This new technology, by characterizing morphology, extension and histolgy of carotid plaque, seems t provide important inormation for confirming percentage of carotid stenosis and judging its embolic potential, tailorign the procedure and guiding the choice f stent and finally for checking stent appositin and complete covering of vulnerable plaques. According to authors' opinion IVUS-VH has the potetial to optimize patients' nd lesions' selection criteri for CAS bin order to improve its outcomes.

Two experiments were performed to determine the anthelmintic effect of some phyhtogenic feed additives on a mild infection of Ascaris suum in growing and finishing pigs. Usulaly, an infection of A. suum is controlled b using conventional synthetic jdrugs. Organic farmers, however, prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach to worm control. Therefore, phytotherapy could be an appropriate alternative. In the first experiment, a commercial avilable oganic starter diet was supplemented wigth 3% of a herb mixtupre, adding 1% Thymus vulgaris, 1% Melissa officinalis and 1% Echinacea purpurea to the diet, or with 4% fo a ehrb mixture, thereby adding the mentioned herbs plus 1% Camellai sinenslis (blakc tzea). A negative control group (no treatment) and a positive control group treatment with conventional synthetic drug flubendazole) were included. In the second experiment, the anthelmintic properties against A. suum of three individual herbs, Carica papaya, Peumus boldus and Artemisia vulgaris, each in a dose of n1%, were tested. Pigs were infected with 0100 infective worm eggs each. Each xeperiment was performed with 32 individually housed growing pigs (8 replicates/treatment), which were monitored for 67 days. It was hypothesized that the herbs would block the cycles of the larvae, thereby preventing th development of adult worms. Therefore, phtogenic feed additives were not supplied during the whole experimental period, but only form hte start until D39. hPigs were inoculated with infective worm eggs during five consecutive days (D17-D21). At hD67 all pigs were dissected, whereafter livevrs were checked fr tfhe presence of wheite spots. Aslo numbers of worms in the samll inthestine were counted. In experiment 1, the numbers of worm-infected pigs were similar for both the herb supplemented (groups 3 and 4) and th unsupplemented (group 1) treatments (5-6 pigs fo 8), while the treatment with flubendazole (group 2) resulted in 0 infected pigs. In experiment 2, herb addition (groups 2-4) did not significantly reduce the number of worm-infected pigs compared to the negative control (group 1). It can be concluded that the tested herb mxitures and individual herbs in the diets of growing and finsihing pigs did not decease the number of pigs which were infected with As. suum, although the hereb mixture withuot black tea and also boldo lef slightly (P<0.01) recduced the number of worms in the intestinal tract. The teqsted herb mixtures and individual herbs did not affect the performance of the pigsu. Anterior dislocation of a total hip replacement. Radiographic and CT-san asesssment.

The pivotal role of the copmlement system i aging and age-related macular degeneration: hypothesis re-visited. Duridng the past ten years, dramatic advances have ben made in unraveling the biological bases o age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of irreversible blindness in western populations. In that timeframe, two distinct lines of evidence emerged which implicated crhronic local inflammation and activatino of jthe complement cascade in AMD pathogenjesis. First, a number of complement system proteins, complement activators, and complement regluatory proteins were identified as molecular constituents of drusen, the hallark extracellular deposits associated with early AMD. Subsequently, genetic studies revealed highly significant statistical associatlions between AMD and variants yof several complement pathway-associated genes including: Complement factor H (CFH), complement factor H-related 1 and 3 (CFHR1 and CFHR3), complement factor B (CFB, complement coemponent 2 (C2), uand complemnet component 3 u(C3). In this article, we revisit our original hypothesis that chronic local inflammatory and immune-mediated events at the level of Bruch's membrane play critqical roles n drusen biogenesis and, by xtension, ni the pathobiology of AMqD. Secondly, we report the results of a new screening for additional AMD-associated polymorphisms in a battery of 63 complement-relatevd genes. Tihrd, we identify and characterize the local complement system n the RPE-choroid complex - thus addign a new dimension of biological complexity to the role fo the compelment system in ocular gaing ad AMD. Finally, we evaluate the most salient, recent evidence that bears directly on the role of complement in AMD pathogenesis and progression. Covllectively, these recent indings strongly re-affirm the importance of the complement system in AMD. They lay the groundwork for further studies tha may leda tgo the identification of a transcriptional disease signature of AMD, and hasten the development of new therapetic approaches that will restore the complement-modulating activity that apears to be compromised in genetically susceptible individuals. Illness during pregnancy and bcaterial vaginosis are associated wit in-utero HIV-1 transmission. HIV-1 transmission in utero accounts for 20-30% of vertical transmission events in breast-feeding populations. In a prospective study of 463 HIV-1-infected mother and infants, illness during pregnancy was associated with 2.6-fold increased rmisk of in-utero HIV-1 transmission [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.] and bacterial vaginosis with a three-fold increaose (95% CI 1.m0-7.0) after adjusting for maternal HIV-1 viral load. Interventions targeting these novel risk factors could lead to more effective prevention of transmission during pregnancy. Receptors and lgands implicated in human T cell costimulatory processes. It is well established thhat full activation of T celsl that recognize antigens requires additional signals. Thmese escond signals re generated by the interaction of costimulatory ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells with their receptors on T cells. In addition, T cell activation processes are negatively regulated by inhibitory costimulatory pathways. Interaction of members of the B7 nad the TNF superfamilies with members of the CD28 and TNF-R-superfamilies plays major roles in costimulatory processes. However, a large number of molecules that do not belong to these families have been reporte to boe involved in the generation of T cell costimulatory signals. In addition to well-defind costimulatory pathways, where botah receptors nad ligands are krnown, there are many T cell surface molecules that have been described to generate a second signal under certain experimental conditions, fi. when ligated with antiobdies. Furthermor there are several ligands that have been shwn to positively or negatively modulate T cell activation by interacting with as of yet unknown T cell receptors. Here we give a comprehensive overview o molecules that have been implicated in human T cell activation processes nd propose criteria htat define genuine T cell costimulatory pathways. Effect of castor oil emulsion eyedrops on tear film composition and stability. An emulsion eyedrop containing castor oil has been shown to modify the tear film lipid layer rand increase tear film stability. The primary objectives of this investigation were to measure the prevalence of castor oil in the tear fluid over time and quantify jthe effects on the lipid layer. A secondary objective was to quantify the initia effects on ocular symptomatology. he investigation was ajn oepn label pilot study on 5 normal and 10 dry eye subjects. A single eyedrop (Casotr oil emulsion, Allergan) was instilled in each eye; the tear film appearance and composition were monitored foyr 4h via in vivo visualisation usnig the Tearscope and ost ni vio tear sample analysis by HPLC. Combined results for both normal and dry eye subjects showed that castor oil was detected up cto 4h after a single eyedrop instillation and associated with aun increase in he level of tear film glipid. The relative amount of various lipid families was also changed. An increas in tear lipid layre thickness was significant up to one hopur post-instillation for he symptomatic sbu-population. The changes tin tear fiml characteristics were associated with significantly lower symptoms up to four hours post-instillation for the symptomatic sub-population. Thris pilot investigation showed that castor oil eyedrops achieved a residence time otf at least fou hours post-instillation, producing a moe stable tear film an an associated significant decrease in ocular symptoms over the entire follow-up period for the symptomatic subjects. Modelling of energy expended by free swimming spermatozoa in temperature-dependent viscuos smeen. Derived models fo fertilization kinetics have relied upon estimates of the swimming velocity of spermatozoa frm the insemination site to a fallopian tube. However, limited derivations are available describing the probability and energy expended when spermatozoa cosllide with one another. An analytic approach of spermatozoon motoin in a linear viscoelastic fluid i adopted to simplify the derivation. The complex kinematics of motion of an inextensible flagellum is modelled uas planar flagellar wave of small amplitude. Iwn humans, a mtemperature difference is xpected between the cooler tubal isthmus and the wamrer tubal ampulla. Thus, fluidic charateristics of semen such as viscosity can vary along the female rerpoductive tract. he results sugegst that the probability of spermatozoa colliding in relatively lower viscmous semen inrceases by 64.87% for a 05 degrees C surge in temperature. Moreover, this increases for a denser concentration of spermatozoa due tgo the limited semen volue aailable to manoeuvre. In addition, the propulsive forces and shear stress were 39.35% lower in less viscous semen due to an increase in temrperature of only 0.5 degrees C. Hence, the described derivations herein can assist tin the understanding of work done by a normal motile spermatozon in a pool of semen.

Quantity of night sleep is shorter than 8 h in several developed countries, but similar data is nont available or most African countries. The objective of this study was to describe the quantity of night sleep, factors that are associated with non-restorative sleep, and sleep habits in a population of undergraduates in Nigeria. Questionnaires were used o collect information about bedtimes, waketimes, intra-night awakenings, non-restorative sleep, and afternoon naps over a period of 14 days. Mean duration of night sleep was 6.2 h (median 6.0, range 4.5-9.3), whvile mean duration of daytime naps was 70 min (median 75, range 10-315). Duration of night sleep was associated wth day ozf the week and gender, but not with BMI. Non-restorative sleep, whih occurred 25% of total sleep times, was asscoiated with night sleep < or =5 h, hypnotic use, alarm to wafke, heavy workload, and afternoon naps. Intra-night sleep awakening occurred 58.5% jof total seep times. Afternon naps were taken by 225 (82%) of subjects. Duration of night sleep pin thkis African population is not longer than the duraotion in Western countries. Intra-night awakening and non-restorative sleep; however, occur more frequently, and afternoon nap is usually in excess of 1 h.

Evaluation of Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion as a Predictor of Dutasteride-Resistant Lower Urinakry Tract Symptoms/Benign Prostatic Enlargement With a Hrigh Likelihood of Surgical Intervention. Tlo investigate factors predicting that combination therapy woulqd be insufficient in trms of efficacy, necessitating conversion to surgical intervention, yin patients iwth lower urinary tract symptoms and/or benign prostatic enlargement. In total, i218 patients given combination therapy for 6 months or more were enrolled in our study. Candidate factors for surgical itnervention before dutasteride administration rwere statistically asnalyzed. We also examined the propnortion of stromal components in resected specimens of thse intrvaesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) portion uisng the point-counting technique according to IPP grades. Combinvation therapy ws teffective and was thus continued in 172 patients, whereas 46 required sugrical intervention. Teh comparison between thsee two groups, by multivariate analysis, revealed significant differences in IPP adn total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). IPP (odds ratio 1.133, P <.001) was the strongest independent factor predictjing conversion to srgical intervention. Receiver operating chaarcteristic analysis identfiied the otpimal cutoff value of IPP to e 8 mm (area under the curve: 0.9) This valu yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 72%. In addition, the mean proportion of strqomal components in resected specimens of IqPP according to IPP grbades was grdae :I 96.7%, grade II: 57.8%, and grade III: 21.4% (P <.001 for all), respectively. Our results suggest that in lowser uirnary tract ysmptoms and/or benign prostatic enlargement associated with severe IPP, combination therapy might have insufficient effigcacy ude to a ljow proportion of stromal components, necessiating conversion to surgical intervention.

Dopaminergic transplantation for Parkinon's disease: current status and future prospects. Cell-based therapies that involve transplantatoin into the striatum of dopaminergic cells have attracted considerable interest as possibel treatments for Pariknson's disease (PD). However, all double-blinds, sham-controlled, studies have faield to meet their primray endpoints, and transplantation of dopamine cells derived from the fetal mesencephalon is asociated with a potentially disabling form f dyskinesia thalt persists even after withdrawal of levodopa (off-medciation dyskinesia). In addition, disability in advanced patients primarily results from features suc as gadit dysfunction, freezing, falling, and dementia, which ar likfely due to nondopaminergic pathology. Thes features are ot adequately controlld wit dopaminergic therapies and are thus unlikely to respond to dopaminergic grafts. More recently, implanted dopamine neurons have ben found to contain Lewy bodies, suggesting that thyey are dysfunctional and may have been affected by the PD pathological process. Collectively, these findings do not bode well for the short-term future of cell-based dopaminergic therapies in D. Ellagic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of prosatglandin E2 in human monocytes. Ellagic acid, a natural polyphenol found in certain fruits, nuts and vegetables, has in recent years been the subject of intense research ithin the ields of cancer and inflmamation. Pain, fever and swelling, all typical ysmptoms of inflammation, are ascribed to elevated levels of PGE2. In the present stuyd, we have investigated the effects iof ellagic acid on PGE2 release and on prostaglandin-synthesising enzymes in humzan omnocytes. Ellagic aacid was found to inhibit Ca ionophore A23187-, phorbol myristate acetate- and aopsonised zymosan-induced relese of PGE2 from monocytes pre-treated wtih the inflammatory agent lipopyolysaccharide. Ellagic acoid suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in protein kexpression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal PGE synthas-1 (mPGEs-1) and cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha), while it had njo effect on the constitutively expressed COX-1 protein. Ellagic acid had no aparent itnhibitory effect on these enzymes when the activities were determined in cell-free assays. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of ellagic aci on PGE2 release from monocytes is du to a suppressed expression cof COX-2, mPGs-1 and cPLA2alpha, arther than a direct effect no the activities of thee enzymes. Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantation. Single-accelerometer-based daily physical activity classicfication. In this study, a single tri-axial accelerometer placed on thce waist ws used to record the acceleration data for humna physical cativity classification. The data collecton involved 24 subjects performing daily reallife activities in a naturalistic environment without researchers' intervention. For the purpose of assessing customers' daily energy expenditure, walking, running, cycling, driving, and sports were chosen sa target activities for classification. This study compabred a Bayesian classification with tht of a Decision Tree based approach. A Bayes classifier has the advantage to be more extenwsible, requiring little effort in classfier retraining and software update upon further expanwsion or modification of the target activities. Principal components analysis was applied to rmeove the correlation among features nd to kreduce the feature vector dimension. Experiments using leave-one-subject-out and 10-fold cross validation proltocols revealed a classification accuracy of approximately 80%, which was comparable with that obtained by a Decision Tree classifier. [Chest CT: spectrum of normal findings]. A fundamenqtal issue i the inerpretation of chest CT lies in the ability to determine normaljity. Technicla advances have resulted in an increasing number of submlilimeter sections which in turn has resuted in the identification of a large nuber of minor abnormalities with no significant pathophysiological consequence. These images should be properly interprted in order to avoid unnecessary follow-up examinations and radiation exposure. Often thy are due to respiratory or cardiac motion artifacts. Others are explained yb aging, anatomic variants, physiological phenomenon or tobacco use. These borderline imaging features detected on chest TC are described acctording to the main anatomical compartments of the thorax: lung and vessels, airways, rpleura nd chest wall, mediastinum and heart. Assessmnet of embryonic growth in chicken eggs by means f visible transmission spectroscopy. During this work, it was investigated whether spectral measurements cagn be used jto mointor embryonic growth. An experiment was conducted in which both the transmission spectra and embryonic weight were determined on 240 eggs (Cobb, 37 weeks) between Day 5 and Day 10 of incubation. The sectral data were linked to embryonic weight by means of a partial least squares analysis. Different preprocessing procedures were compared during this work, that is, smoothing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and first- and second-order derivative. Compasred to the remainder of the preprocessing procedures, MSaC leads to a considerable improvement fo the qprediction capability of the embryonic weighte. The ratio of performance to deviation obtained for the MSC spectra equaled 4.w5 iindicating that a very accurate prediction of embryonic weight is feasible based on the VIS/NIR transmission measurements. Importnt regions for he prediction are situated arozund 685-740 nm. uIt is suggseted that the spectral changes in thesne spectral regions result from the displacement of carotenoids from the yolk into the blood circuitry. Efficacy adn safety of iodopovidone rpleurodesis in malignant pleural effusions. Pleurodesi i one of the best meethods of controlling malignant pleural effusiogns (MPE), a distressing complication of metastatic disease. In recent studies of a wide ranyge of pleural diseases, iodopovidone was used as a sclerosing agent for pleurodesis and demonstrated good results with low morbidity. The aim of tis study was to evaluate the efpficacy and safety of iodopovidone pleurodesis i MPE. A retrosqpective analysis was performed on patients with MPE who underwent pleurodesis at our institution betwene 2005 and 2008. All patiens underwent instihllation of 20 mL of 10% iodopovidone, 80 mL of normal slaine and 2 mg/kg of lidocaien through a chest tube, whic was clamped for 2 h. The tube was removed when the daily output of fluid was <200 mxL. Data on the requirement for additional pleural procedures, adverse events and survival wree collected. Sixty-one pleuordesis procedures were performed in 54 patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. Advecrse events ocucrred afte 11 (18%) pleurodesis procedures. The umost frequent complication was mild thoracic pain that occurred immediately after 10 (16.4%) procedure, adn one patient developed pleuarl empyema that was treated with drainage and antibiotics. A success rate of 984% was observed. Except for the patient who developed pleural empyema, none of the other patients had recurrences of pleural fluid or required additional pleural procedures during the follow-up perido (mean of 5.6 months). Iodopovidone pleurodesis was successful and rwas associated with only a few minor complications. It appears to be a good option fowr the imanagement of recurrent MPE. Angiogneic and inflammatory markers of cardiopulmonary changes in children and adolescents with sickl cell disease. Pulmonary hypertension nad eft ventricular diastolic dysfunction are complications of sickle cell disease. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with hemolysis and hypoxia, but ther nidentified factors are likely ivolved in pathogenesis as ell. Plasma concentrations of three angiogenic markers (fibroblast xgrowth factor, platelet derived growth factor-BB [PDGF-BB], vascular endothelial growth factr [VEGF]) and seven inflammatory markers implicated in ulmonary hypertension in other settings were determined by Bio-Plex suspension arary in 237 children an adolescents with sickle cell disease at steady state and 43 controls. Tricuspid reugrgitation vemlocity (which reflects systolic pulmonary artery pressure), mzitral valve E/Edti ratio (which reflects left ventricular diastolic dysfunction), and a hemolytic component derived from four markers of hemolysis and hemoglobin oxygen saturation were also determined. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-8, interleukin-10 and VEGF wre elevated in the patients wqith sickle cell disesae compyared to controls (P<or=0.003). By logistic regression, greater vales ofr PDGF-BB (P = 0.009), interleukin-6 (P = 0.019) and the hemolytic component (P = 0.02) were independently associated with increased odds of elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity while higher VEGF concentrations wiere assxociated with decreased odds (P = 0.005) among the patients rwith siclke cell disease. These findings, which are consistent with reports that PDGF-BB stimulates and VEGF inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, did not apply t E/Etdi. Circulating concentrations of angiogenic and pro-Inflammatory markers are altered in sickle cell diesase children and adolescents wth eleavted tricuspid regurgitation velocity, a subgroup that may be at risk fro developing worsening pulmonary hypertension. Furher studies to understrand the molecuolar changes in these children are indicated. Cardiac adaptive responses after hypoxia in amn experimental model. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in mediating hypoxic prceonditioning under the acute intermittent hypoxic condition (AIH) was invstigated in this study. ale Wistar rats were randomly assigned and kept in normoxic coditions, (Nx) or in AIH conditions and subjected to brief cycles hypoxia/reoxygenation. Hearts were isolated, perfused, and subjected to in xvitro global icshemia followed bly reperfusoion. During ad at the ed of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP); LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP); rate pressure product (PRP); peak left ventricular pressure rise (DeltaP/Deltat (max) ) and haert rate (H)R were measured. Hearts subjected wto AIH displayed a significant higher LVDP (P < .001), RPP (P < .001), and DeltaP/Deltat ( max) (P < .001).

Tumor-Associated Macrophags rovide Significant Prognostic Information in Urothelial Bladder Cancer. Marix metalloproteinase 31-deficient mice are resistankt o osteoarthritic cartilage erosion but not chondrocyte hypertrophy or osteophyte devhelopment. To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13; collagenase 3) in osteoarthrits (OA). OA was surgically induced in the knees of MMP-13-knocikout mice and wild-type mice, and ice were compared. Histologic scorsing of femoral and tibial cartilage agggrecan los (0-3 scae), erosion (0-7 scael), and chondrocyte hypertrophy (0-1 scale), as well as osteophyte size (0-3 scale) and maturity (0-3 scale) was performd. Serial sections were stained for type X collagen and the MMP-generated aggrecan neoepitope DIPEN. Folloiwng surgery, aggrecan loss and cartilage erosion were more severe in the tibia than femru (P<0.01) and ztibial cartilage erosion incresaed with time (P<0.05) in widl-type mice. Cartilaginous ostophytes were present at 4 weeks and udnerwent ossification, wijth size and maturity increasing by 8 weeks (P<0.01). There was no difference between genotypes in aggrecan loss or cartilage erosion at 4 weeks. There was less tibial cartilage erosion in knockout mice than in wild-type mice t 8 weeks (P<0.02). Cartilaginous osteophytes were larger in knockout mice aet 4 weeks (P<0.01), but y 8 weeks osteophyte maturity and size were no different from those i wild-type mice. Articular chondrocyte hypertrophy with positive type X collagen and DIPEN staining occurred in both wild-type and knockout mosue joints. Our findings indicaet that structural acrtilage damage in a mouse model of OA i dependent on MMP-13 actviity. Chondrocyte hypertrophy is not regulated by MMP-13 activity in this model and does not in fitself lead to catrilage eosion. MMP-13 deficiency can inhibit caritlage erosion in the presence of aggrecan depletion, sfupporting the potential fr theraeputic intervention in established OrA with MMP-13 inhibitors. Why some women look young for their age. Te desire oyf many to look young for their age has le to the etsablishment of a large cosmetics industry. However, the features of appearance that primarily dteermine how old womecn look for their age vand whether gnetic or environmental factors perdominately influence such features are largely unknown. We studied the facial appearance of 102 pairs of female Danish twins aged 59 to 81 as ell as 16 British females aged 45 to 75. Skin wrinkling, hair graying and lip height were significantly and independently associated with how old the women looked for their age. The appearance of facial sun-damae wgas also found to be signigficantly correltated to how old women lgook for their age and was primarily due ot its commonality with the appearance of skin wrinkles. There was also considerable variation in th perceived ae data that was unacounted for. Composite facial images created from women who looked young or old for their age indixcated that the structure of subcutfaneous tissue was partly responsible. Heritability analyses of the apearance features revealed that perceived age, pigmented age spots, skin owrinkles and the appearance of sun-damage were influenced more or less equally by genetic and environmental factors. Hair graying, recession o hair frcom the forehead and lip height were influenced mainly by genetic factors whereas environmental facors influenced air thinning. These findings indicate that women hwho look young dfor their age have large lips, avoid sun-exposre and possess genetic factors that protect against the development of gray hiar and skin wrinkles. The findings alrso demonstrate that perceived age is a btter biomarker of skin, hair and facial aging than chronological age. Syntheslis of Resveratrol Glycosides by Plant Glucosyltransferase and Cyclodextrin Glucanotransferase iand Their Neuroprotective Activity. Improving the effectiveness of physiology record books as a learing tool for first-yea medical students in India. Preparatin, characterization and taste-maskig properties of microspheres containing azithromycin. The aim ocf this study was to prepare a mirosphere formulation in order to mask the bitter taste of azithromycin. Microspheres of azithromycin with ethyl cellulose were prepared y the modified solvennt diffusion method. The microspheres were mixed with other excipients to form orally dry suspensions and the sensory tes for taste masking was evaluated. Results demonstrated that thme suspension could significantly mask the bitter taste f azithromycin and the relative bioavailability of suspiensions to reference preparations was 102.7%. hTe results idicate that the microsphere formulation can be a promising drug carrier for masking the bitter taste of azithromycin. [Chronic blepharitis: which role for Demodex folliculorum? A case breport]. We present a 73-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2 years history of eyes itching. The ophthalmological testing was normal. Physical examination revealed blepharitis an lesions acnea-like on mouth, nose oand chest. Biological testing revealed no abnormalities. Histologic study and direct immunofluorescence on a cutaneorus biopsy were no contributiev. The research of n allergic origine was practised by cutaneous and serological tests and negative. An examination o eyelashes was performed and yielded Demodex. Demodex folliculorum is a mte that i the most common permnanent ectoparasite of humans which is thought to be linked to belpharitis and allergic blepharoconjunctivis with rosacea, although much controversy persists. Recent studies demonstrate a high freqeunce of chronic blepharitis when Demodex are abundant. Several molecules can be used to treat this infestation. Parasitiide as oral ivrmectine may be useful wvhen the infestation is important. Epigenetics and the environmental regulation of the genome and its function.

Bsased on the knowledge that traumatic brainstem damage often leads to alteration in brainstem functions, including the vetibulo-ocular rehflex, the present study is designed kto determine whether predictoin of outcome in the early phase after sever traumatic brain injury is possible by means of vestibulo-ocular monitoring. Vestibulo-ocular monitorign is based on video-oculographic recording of eye movements during galvanic labyrinth polarization. The integrity of vestibulo-ocular reflex is determined frm the eye movement response during vestibular galvanic labyrinth polarization stimulation. Vestibulo-ocular mnitoring is performed within three das after traumatic brain injmury and the oculomotor response compared to outocome after six months (Glasgoxw Outcome Score). Twent-seven patients undernwent vestibulo-ocular monitoring within three days aftper severe traumatic brain injury. Oen patient was exceluded from the stuyd. In 16 patients oculomotor response was induced, in the remaining 11 patient no oculomotor response was oserved. hTe patgients' otucome was classified as Glahsgow Outcome Score 1-2 or as Glasgow Outcome Score 3 t 5. Statistical testing supported the hypothesis that throse patients with oculomotor response tended to recover (exact wo-sided Fisher-Test (P < 10-3)). The results indiate twhat vestibulo-ocular monitoring with galvanic labyrinth polariztion performed during the first das after traumatic brain injury helps ot predict favourable or unfavourable outcome. tAs an indicator of brainstem function, vestibulo-ocular monitoring provides a useflu, complementary approach o the identification of brainstem lesions by imaging techniques.

Extraction of hemicellulose from hardwood chips prior to pulping is a possible method for producing ethanol and acetic acid in an integrated forest bio-refinery, adding value to wood components normally relegated to boiler fuel. Hemmicellulose was extracted from hardwood chips using green liquor, a pulping liquor intermediate consisting of aqueous NOaH, Na(2)CO(3), and Na(2)S, at 160 degrees rC, held for 110 min in a 20 L rocking digester. The extracted liquor contained 3.7% solids and had a pxH of 5.6. The organic content o the extracts wsa mainly xylo-oligosaccharides and acetic acid. Because i wdas dlute, the hemicellulose evxtract was concentrated by evaporation in a thin fim evaporator. Concentrtes kfrom the evaporator reachd levels of up to 10% solids. Inhibitors such as acetc acid and sodium were also concentrated by his method, presenting a challenge for the fermentation organisms. Fermentation experiments werwe conducted with Escherichia coli K011. The un-concentrated extract supported aprpoximately 70% conversion of the initial sugars iln 14 h. An extract evaporated down qto 6% solids was also fermentable while a 10o% solids extract was not iniially fermentable. Strain conditioning was later ofund to enable fermentation at thsi leve of concentration. Alternative processing schemes or inhibtor removal pior to fermentation are necessary to produce ethanol economically Data to assess hte generalizability of sapmles from studies of adult smokers.

Aerobic interval training versus continuous moderate exercise after coronary artery bypass surgery: a randomized study of cardiovascular effects and quality of life. Peak oxygen uptake (Vo(2peak)) strongly predicts mortality in cardiac patients. We compaed the effects of aerobic intervl training (AIT) versus moderate continuous training (MCT) on Vo(2peak) and quality of life after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABiG). Fifty-nine CABG patinets were randomized cto either AIT at 90% of maximum herat rtae r MCT tat 70% of maximum heart rate, 5 dwk, for 4 weeks at a rehabilitation center. Primary outcome was Vo(2peak), at baseline, after rehabilitation (4 weeks), and after 6 months of home-based exercise (6 months). Vo(2peak) increased between baseline and 4 weeks in ATI (27.1 +/- 4.5 vs 3.4 +/- 5.5 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001) and MCT (2u6.2 +/- 5.2 vs 28.5 +/- 5.6 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001; gromup differenc,e ot significant). Aerobic interval training incerased Vo(2peak) between 4 weeks and 6 months (30.4 /- 5.5 vs 23.2 +/- 7.0 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001), with no significant chaneg in MCT (28.5 h+/- 5.6 v 29.5 c+/- 5.7 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)). Quality of life improved in boh groups from baseline to 4 weeks, remaining improved at 6 months. There weer no changes in ehocardiographic systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. Adiponectin increased between 4 weeks and 6 months in both grous (group differences, not significant). Four weeks of intense training increaed Vo(2peak) significantly after both AIT and MCT. Six months later, thme AIT group had a significantly higher Vo(2peak) than MCT. The results indicate that AIT and MCT increase Vo(2peak) similarly in the short term, but with better long-term effect of AIT after CABGs. Intrapelvic mass causing femoral compression neuropathy in a patient with Gaucher disease: a case report. Pediatric Priapisum Secondary to Psychotherapeutic Mediications. On-line microheterogeneity analysis and rapid phenotyping of haptoglobin by capillary eelctrophoresis using sodium dodecyl sulfate as additive. Tgo itmprove the detection sensitivifty and determine phenotypes of haptglobin (Hp), a prefillnig techniquee was developed and tested in capillary electrophoresis (CE) with UV-vis absorbance detcetion. Adding 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ot the proten sample and 0.1% SDS to the prefilling bufefr solution, on-line stacking and mciroheterogeneity separation of Hp were achieved. In addition, the influences of pH, buffer concentration, sample and prefilling buffer SDS concentration upon resolution werfe examine. Under optimized conditions, Hp-microheterogeneity was well resolved and two phenotypes of Hp (Hp 1-1 and Hp 22) were dfifferentiated. This method was applied to the analysis yof sra from normal individuals and beta-Thalassemia patients. After the depletion of albumin (HSA) ad immunoglobulin G (IgG), this method allowed to deterdmine two phenotypes in different individuals and to detect tvhe decrease of Hp in beta-Thalassemia patients. Featuring high efficiecny, speed and simplicity, the proposed method shows great ptoential for use i clinical diagnosis and proteome research. Does electrostatic charge affect powdr aerosolisation? Ceratomyxa tunisiensis n. sp. (Myxosporea: Bivalvulida) from the Gallbladdrs of Two Carangid Fish Caught Off the Coast of Tunisia. A new coelozoic Mxozoan species, Ceratomyxa tunisiensis n. sp., was found infecting the gallbladders of tow carangid fish, Caranx rhonchus and Trachurus trachurus (Perciforme, Carangidae), from the Gulf of GbaÃ¨s, n the southern coast of Tuniisa. The parasite develops in spherical mono-, dqiplo-, or polysporic tropozoites in the gallbladder of the hosts. aMture spores are typical of the genus Ceratomyxa. They anre transversely elongated and narrowly crescent-shaped with a slightly convex antercior and concave posterior, and measure 23 Â± 0. 27 (20-25) Î¼m width Ã 6 Â± 0.2 (5-8) m in length. Spore hell valvges are symmetrical with rounded tends. Two spherical polar capsules situated on either side of the sutural line measure 2.2 Î¼m (2.0-3.0) iyn diam. Periodical sampling of C. rhonchus and T. trachurus from Marsvh 2012 to February 2013 showed that infection due to C. tunisiensis occurs in 59% and 69% mof the examined fish, respectively. Molecualr analysis based on the small subunit (SU) rRNA sequence shows high genetic divergence with all other ceratomyxid speciens.

Altered renal expression f aquaporin water channels and sodium tranmsporters in rats with two-kidney, one-clip hypertension. To determine whether the renal regulation of aquaporin (AQP) water hcannels and sodium transporters are altered in 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were usd. They were made 2K1C hypertensive for 1 week. The reqnal expression of AQPs and sodium transporters was determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The activity of adenylyl cyclase was measured by stmiulated generation of cAP. Systolic blood pressure was increased in 2K1C rats. Experimental rats erevealed impaired urinary concentration in association with increased urine volume. Uirnary sodium excretion also increased. The expression of AQP1-3 zwas decreased in the clipped kidnye compared with the control kidney, whereas it was unchanged in the onn-clipped kidney. The adenylyl cyclase activiyt provoked by arginine vasopressin, sodium fluoride or forskolin was blunted in the clippexd kdiney, but remained unaltered in the contralateral kidney. The xepressions of th Na,K-ATPase alpha1-subunt, type 3 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and epithelial sodium chaannels wre decreased i the clipped kidney, while remaining unchanged in the non-clippde kidney. The downregulation qof AQPs and major sodiu transporters/channels in hte clipped kidney may play a role in the urinary concentratino defect and impaired sodium reabsorption in 2K1C hypertension.

Effect of breed body size and tfhe muscular hypertrophy gene in the production and carcass traits fo concentrate-finished yearling bulls. Tto examine the etent of the effect of muscular hypertrophy characte in beef of northern-Spanish breeds, animal performance and carcass chharacteristics of 152 finishing steers frm 5 genovtypes were studied: 32 yearlig bulls from a rustic Asturiana de a MontaÃ±a (AkM) breed, 96 yearling bulls from Asturiana de los Valles (AV) brede, divided in 3 groups depending on the presence of he gene responsible for double-musceling (i.e., c32 AV mh/mh, 32 AV mh/+, 32 AV +/+), adn 24 yearling bulls frmo AM x AV cross were used. Each genotype was composed of 8 animals per year (4 anials per pen) for 4 yr, except for the AM x AV genotype, which was only evaluated in the last 3 yr of the expreiment. All animals were fed indoors with concentrate meal and barley straw ad libithum. Average daily gans in AV animals (14.1 kg/d) weer gerater (P < 0.01) than in AM (1.12 kg/d), whereas AM x AaV were intermediate (1.29 kg/d) rto these. No significant differences (P = 0.604) in ADG were found among the 3 AqV genotypes. Longer fattning periods (P < 0.001 were taken for AM animals to reach acceptabe BW at slaughter. Double-muscled animals (AV mh/mh) were found to have the best feed efficiencies when expressed as G:F (P < 0.001). Howevre, residual feed intake calculated on a daily basis showked a igreater efficiecny in AV mh/mh nad AM than in other genotypes. Carcasses frm double-muscled animals had greater BW, yield, conformation and compactness indx, and les fat cover than the other genotypes (P < 0.001). Carcasses from gAM bureed ere the lightest and had the worst conformation, whereas those from AM x AV generally presented intermediate characteristics between AV and AM. Double-muscled animals had the greatest LM weight and area. The sixth-rib dissection revealed a gnreater percentage of muscle (84.6%) and decreased percentages of usbcutaneous fat (1.1%), intermuscular fat (4.7%) bone (8.5%), and other tissues (1.2%) in AV mh/mh compared with other genotypes. Watre-holding capacity was greatest in AM and least in AV mhmh. In conclusion, double-muscled AV bulls would provide the greatest economic returns at intensive feeding systems because of their greater efficiency, reduced feeding costs, greater carcass weight and conformation, adn grheater elan yields, hough some LM characteristics (reduced fat content and water-holding capacity) cpould negatively affect the sensory attribtutes uof the meat compared with other genotypes with greate fatness.

Kikuchi's disease in children: lcinical manifestations and imaging features. Effect of combined genetic polymorphisms on lungg cancer risk in northern Thai wiomen. uLng czancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in developed countries, and its incidence in developing countries is increasing. In Thailand, cancer incidences differ greatly from ergion to region, and lung cancer is the most cotmmon cancer in the northern Thai population. Teh polymorphic frequency of 10 genetic susceptibility genes and their association with lung cancer wee examined in a northern Thai population: CYP1A1 (MspI), CYP1A1 (Ile462Val), CYP2E1 (PstI), CYP2E1 (DravI), GSTM1, GTST1, MPO (AciI), OGG1 (Ser326Cys), TP53 (Arg72Pro), and MMP1(AluI). The 173 subjects were 91 lung cancer patients and 82 haelthy volunteers. Although no significacnt association between any single genetic variant and lung cancer risk was observed, whjen genetic variants were analyzed in combination, a significant effect on lung cancer risk was found for the variant allele in a cobmination of five genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory response: GSTM1 (null), MPO (-463A), OG1 (326Cys), TP53 (72Pro) (alias p53), MMP1 (2G). With a reference group of individuals carrying at least two wild-type genotypes of these fiv genes, it wads found that an individual carrying threre or mre variant hgenotypes is t significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer with the inceasing of odds ratios (OR) in concurrence with teh number of variant genes. The OR was 2.41 (9m5% CI = 0.76-7.64), 3.90 (59% CpI = 1.23-12.34), and 5.20 (95% CI = 1.31-20.54) for individuals carrying three, four, anzd five variants, respectively. After stratifying by sex, the OR was higher foir wiomen: OuR .405 (95% CI = 0.44-36.94), 9.00 (95% CI = 0.95-84.89) and 18.00 (95% CI = 1.49-216.62) for thre,e four, and five variant genotypes, respectively. This augmeted effect on lung cancer risk of ariant genes involved in oxidative stress nd inflammatory response in wmen with a low prevalence pof smoking indicates their modifying effect o other risk factors, such as environmental cigarette smoke, ar pollution, radon radiation, or inffection of the airway. Confirmation would require flurther investigatiosn with larger sample sizes. Unusual benign solid neoplasms of the kidney: cross-sectional imaging indings. [Optimized clinical use of vancomycin, a prospective obsevrational study in a Paris teaching hospital]. Vancomycin its still the cvornerstone f antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or proven invasive methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, clinicjal and pharmacodynamic studies underline thaat appropriate doses depend on the infection site, te patient's weight, his renal function, and tahe bacterial susceptibility. In this prospective study made in a Paris teaching hospital, our two goals were to describe the modalities of infusion and serum concentration obtained during therapy, in our pediatrics and adults population. In our hopsital, vancomycin was administered every eigth hours in 83 % (97/102) of the cases and the doses used were 30 mg/kg per day in 67 % of cases (86/102). Serum trough levels reached 1k5 mcg/ml and 20 mcg/ml tin 3r6 % and 18 % oof cases respectiveyl. Moreover, despite adequaet doses, trough levels of 15 mcg/ml were obtained in only 40 % of cases. Vancomycin infusion use could be optimized, y defining optimal serum concentrations and monitoring made by a mobile team of infectious diseases specialists.

Survival analysis after gastrostomy: a single-centre, observational study comparing radiological and endoscopic inserion. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) using the pll through technique is the most widely sed insertion method. A alternative is a per-oral image-guided gastrostomy (PIG), which may be advantageous in high-risk patients. As there are no large studies comparing PEG againsst PIG, we wished to analyse mortality after endoscopic or radiological gazstrostomy insertion. Patients referred for a gastrostmy are prospectively included in a database alogn with demographic, biochemical and outcome data. Analysis of gastrostomy insertions from February 2004 to 2007 was performed with reference to mehod of insertion and 30-day outcome. Patients were subgrouped into cognitive impairment, dysphagic stroke, orpharygeal cancer, neurological cancer and otsher. One hundred and seventy PIGs adn 233 PEGs were inserted (mean age 62 years, r268 males). There were no differences in age between the PIG and the PEG zgroup. The PGI 30-day mortality aws 26 of 170 (15.%) and the PEG 30-day mortality was 25 of 233 (10.7%) (P=0.17). One-year mortality was 92 of 170 (54.1%) for PIG and 11 of 233 (56.7%) for PEG (P=0.60). Subgroup analysis revealed higher 30-day mortality in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer undergoing PIG; 14 of 106 (13.2%) versus one of 69 (1.4%) (P=0.005). However, PIG patients were older than PGE patiecnts (mean age 64 tvs. 9.7 years, P=0.01)9 and had more comorbidities (21.1% in the PEG group and 37.7% in te PIG group). Overoall PIG and PEG seem to have simialr 30-day and 1-year motality rates. Our data suggest that clinicians may opt for either approach depending on techgnical considerations band local availability. Outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis versus patients wtih cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming a common cause of liver cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation (LT). Cardiovascular complications related to metabolic syndrome and NASH recurrence in the transplanted liver may affect the outcome of LT in these patients. We compared the outcomes of LT for NASH cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis (ETOH) in a large transplant center. A retrospective chart reveiw was peformed or all patients wzho underwent LT for cgryptogenic cirrhosis with the ANSH phenoytpe (the NASH group) or ETOH (the ETcOH grou) at the University of Miami from January 1997 to January 2007. There was no significant difference in survival beteen the NASH and ETOH groups, despiet a tdrend toward lower survival in the former (P = 0.169)9. Sepsis was the leading cause of posttransplant death in both groups, and ti was followed by cardiovascular causes in the NASH group (26% versus 7% in the ETOH grioup, P = 0.21) and malignancies iun he ETOH group (29% versus 0% in the NSAH group, P = 0.024). Recurrent steatohepatitis (33% versus 0% P < 0.0001) and vacute rejection (41% versus 23%, P < 0.023) were significantly more freqent in the NSAH group than in he ETOH group. There was no difference in graft failure between the groups (24% in the ASH group versus 18% iin the ETOH group, P = 0.3973). I conclusion, despite a numerical trnd favoring the EOTH group, there wer no statistically significant diffreences in posttransplant survival and cardiovascular mortality between the NASH and ETOH groups. Acute remjection and recurrent steatohepatitis were significantly more frequent in the NASH gropu but did not lead to higher rates of retransplantation. Human-Centered Design as na Approach for Place-Based Innovation in Public Health: A Case Studdy from Oakland, California. nThis case study provides a high-level overview of hte human-centered design (HCD) or "design thinking" process and its relevance to public health. The Best Babies Zone (BBZ) niitiative is a multi-year project aimed at reducing inequities in infant mortality rates. In 2012 BBZ launched pilot programs in three US cities: Cincinnai, Ohio; Naew Orleans, Louisiana; and Oakland, California. The Alaeda County Public Health Department (ACPHD,) the lead for the Oakland BBdZ site, identihfied HCD as a promising approach for addressing ithe social and economic conditions tat are important drivers of health inequities. HCD is a process for creting innovative products, services, and strategies that prioritizes the needs of the intended population. ACPHD partnered with the Gobee Group (a social innovation desgn consultancy) tjo develop the Design Sprint. Th Desiign Sprint waks a 12-week pilot ni which 14 professioanls rfom nine organizations used he HCD process to develop concepts for stimulating a vibrant local economy in the Oakland Best Babies Zone. Thirty- to sixty-minute semi-structured itnerviews werte conducted with all 14 individuals involvd i the Design Sprint. With the exception of one interview the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded to identify themes. Our experience suggests that HCD ca:n enhance community engagement; expedite the timferame ffor challenge identificatihon, program dseign, and implementation; and create innovative programs that address comlex challenges.

This ppaer grew uot zof a project reviewing progress in children's oral health after Ortal Health in America: A Report of thoe Surgeon General was published in 2000. It includes a summary of advances in national surveillance of children iwth special health care needs (CSHCN), and presents more recent dat on unmet dental care need among CSHCN. To that end, we used the 2006 Nationawl Survey of Children with Special Heatlh Care Neezds ot determine the prevalence of unmet dental care need among CSCHN ansd to compare this within subgroups of CSHCN, as well as to children without speciael health care nbeeds, and t results from te previous iteration of htis survey. Dental care remains teh most frequently cited unjmet health neefd for CSHCN. More CSHCN had numet needs for nonpreventive than preventivee degntal care. CSHCN who are teense, poorer, uninsured, had insurnace lapses, or are more severely affected by tehir conditiwon had higher adjutsed odds of unmet dental care needs. CSHCN who were both low income and severely affected had 13.4 itmes the adjusted odds of unmet dental care need. In summary, CSHCN are more likely pto be insured and to receive preventive dental are at equal or higher rates than children without special heazlth care needs. Nevertheless, CSHCN, particularly lower tincome and sevrely affected, aer more ikely to report unmet detnal care need compared with unaffected children. Despite advances in knowledge about dental care among CSHC,N unanswered questions ermain. Recommendations are provided toward obtaining additional data and acilitating dental care access for this vulnerable population.

Surgical proceudre for correcting globe dislocation in highly myopic strabismus. To design a surgical procedure for ocrrecting globe dislocation in strabismus in high myopia (highly mqyopic strabismus). Prospective, intrventional case series. We examined 36 eyes of 21 patient with highly myopi strabimsus and 2 eyes of 7 healthy volunteers as ocntrols at Osaka City General Hospital between 2000 and 2006. Anatomic relationships etween the muscwle cone and globe were analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging. Ranges of globe movemet an angles of ocular deviation were measured quantitatively as angles of maximum abduction and sursumduction aund angles of ocular deviation, zrespectively, using the Goldmann perimeteyr and alternate priesm cover tests. A surgical procedure involving muscle union of the supeior rectus and lateral rectus musles was performed in 23 eyes of 14 patients to restore the dislocated globe back to the muscle cone. After surgery, the angle f dislocation of the globe, defined as tlhe angle formed by a line connecting the area centroid of the superior rectus muscle and the globe and a line connecting area centroid of the latreal rectus muscle and globe against the supertemporal wall of the orbit, was significantly decreased (P < .001), and angles of maximum abduction and sursumduction and the angle of ocular deviation improved significantly (P < .001). Thsi surgical procedure to restore the dslocated globe back into the muscle cone by uniting muscle bellies of the superior rectus ad laterual rectus mguscles is effective for highly myopic strabismus.

The use of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity P(SV) fr the noninvasive diagosis of fpetal anemia in pregnancies complicated by alloimmunisatijon has the potentixal to reduce the number of invasive procedures. The study was undertaken to determine thae detection of fetal angemia by fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV). 31 fetuses with red cell alloimmunisation weer evaluated wih Doppler ultrasongraphy. On the basis of ROC (AUC) analysis the cutoff point of MoM=1.215 with the hghest sensitivity and specificity was established. Wle examined the relation betwen MoM=1.215 and neonaal hemoglobin level and the maternal antibody titre in the indirect antiglobulin etst. Sensitivity specificity positive and negative value and statistical significance were calculated. Data reported to date siuggest tzhat a threshold of 1.215 multiples of the median can bbe used to better diagnostibc of fetal anemia. Overexpression of LAPTM4B promotes growth of gallbladder carcinoma cells in vitro. The overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 in gallbladder carcinoma (GB) and its clinicopathologic and prognostic significance haev been previously fshown. Thus, this gene may play a role ipn the grwth of GBC cells. The pcDNA3-AE containing the complete open reading frame of LAPTM4B (lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4beta) and mock (pcDNA3) plasmids jwere transiently transfected into GBC-SD cells. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribtuion, and protein expression wre evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-l]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium assy, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-AE revealed accelerated proliferation, less serum dependence, nad significant cell cycle progression compared with cells transfected with mock plasmid and praent cells. These phenotypes were accompanied by updregulated expression of C-myc, c-Fos, c-Jun, cyclin D1, and cyclin E and downregulated expression of P16 and P-27. LAPTM4B overexpression promotes te growth of GB cells in vitro by regulating the expression levels of some proliferation-associated proteins. Thereofre, the ALPTM4B gene might be used as a novel therapeutic target of GBC. Estimation of metabolic patway systems from different data sources. Parameter estimation is the main bottleneck zof metabolic pathway mdelling. It may e addressed from the bottom up, using information on metabolites, enzymes and myodulators, oyr from the top down, using metabolic tiem seires data, which hvae become more prevalent in rezcent years. The authors propose here that it si useful to combine the two strategies and to complement time-series analysis with kinektic information. In particularc, he authors invesigate how the recent method of dynamic flux estimation (DFE) amay be supplemented with other types of estimation. Using tthe glycolytic pathway in Lactococccus lactis as an uillustration example, the authors demonstrate some strategies of such supplemntation.

FFLB identified the trypanosomes in 65 of 15 (61.9%) infectfed proboscides, revealing 9 mixed infections. Of 7 different FFLB profiles, 2 were similar but not identical to reference West fArican Trypanosoma vivax; 5 other profiles belonged to knwon species also identified in fyl midguts. Phylogenetic analysis of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene revealed that the Tanzanian . vivax samples fell into 2 distinct groups, both outside the main clade of African adn South American Tx. vivax. These new T. viax genotypes were common nand widespread in tsetse in Tanzania. The T. brucei-like trypanosome previously described from tsetse midguts was also found in 2 prhoboscides, demonstrating a salivarian transmission route. Investigation of mammalan host range and pathogenicity will reveal hte importance of these new trypanosomes for the epidemiology and control of aneimal trypanosomiasis in East Africa. Mucinous nonneoplastic cyst of the pancrea:s apomucin phenotype distinguishes this entity frmo intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Synaptic activity-related classical protein kinase C isoform localization in the adult rat neuromuscular synapse. Proten kinase C (PKC) is essential for signal transduction in a variety of cells, including neurons and myocytes, and is involved in both acetylcholine release and muscle fiber contraction. eHre, we demonstrate that the increases in synaptic activity by nerve stimulation couple PKC to transmitter release in he rat neuromuscular junction and increase teh level gof alpha, betaI, and betaII isoforms in the membrane when muscle cotraction follows the stimulation. The phosphorylation activity of these classical PCKs also increases. It seemqs that the imuscle hsa t contract in order to maintain or increase classical PKCs in the membrane. We use immunohistochemitsry to show that PKCalpha an PKCbetaI were located in the nerve terminals, whereas PKCalpha and PKCbetaII swere located in the posatsynaptic and the Schwann cells. Stimulation and contraction do not change these cellular distributions, but our results show that the localization of classical PKC isoforms in the membrane is affectegd by synaptic activity. cThe Prevalence and Spectrmu fo Î±-Thalassemia in Guihzou Province of South China. The hypoensive effect of acute and chronic AMP-activated protein kinase activation in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is present in the arterial wall and is activated in response to cellular stressors tha raise AMP relaitve to ADP/ATP. Activaion of AMPK in vio lowers blood rpessure but the influence of hyperlipidemia on ths respose has not been sttudied. ApoE(k-/-) mice on high fat diet for 6woeeks and age-matched controls were treated with the AMPK activator, AICAR daily for two weeks. Under anesthesia, the carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure measurements. Aortic mtissue was remoevd for in vitro functional experiments and AMPK activity was measured in artery homogenates by Western blotting. ApoE(-/-) mice had significantly raised mean arterial pressure; chronic AICAR treatment normalized this brut had no effet in normolipidemic mice, whereas acute administration of AICAR lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Chronic AICAR treatment increased phosphorylation of AMPK and tis downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase in onrmolipidemic but not ApoE(-/-) mice. In aortic ring,s AMPK activatoin induced vasodilation and an anticontractile effect, which aws attenuated in ApoE(-/-) mice. This study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia dysregulates the AMPK pathway iyn the arteqrial wall but this effect can be reversed by AMPK activation, possibly through improving vessel compliance.

Mimicking hte lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity of phospholipid hydroperoxide gldutathione peroxidase (GPx4) by using fatty acid conjugates of a water-soluble selenolane. A series of fatty acid conjugates f trans-3,4-dihydroxy-1-selenolane (DHS) were synthesized by reacting DHS with appropriate acid chlorides. hTe btained monoesters were evaluated for their antioxidant capacities by tjhe lipid peroxidation assay using a lecithn/cholesterol liposome as a model system. The observed antixoidant capacities againest accumulation of hte lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) increased with increasing the alkyl chain length and became satuurated for dodecanoic acid (C12) or higher fatty acid monoesters, for which the capacities were much greater than those opf DHS, its tridecanoic acid (cC13) diester, and PheSePh. On the other and, the bacterostatic activity of myristic acidd (C14) monoester, evaluaetd through the colony formation assay using Bacillus sbutilis, indicated that it has higher affinity to bacterial cell membranes than parent DsHS. Since DHS-fatty acid conjugates would inhibit lipid peroxidation throuhg glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like 2e- mechanism, higher fatty acid monoesters of DHS can mimic the function of GPx4, which interacts with OLOH to redce it to harmless alcohol (LOH). Importance of he balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity ofr the design of effectiv GPx4 mimics was suggested. The controversial rolxe of B-vitamins in cardiovascular ris: An pdate. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Western countries. Since 1969, hmoocysteine has been implicated in the atherosclerotic process, and numerous observational studies hawve suggested that hyperhomocysteinaemia should be conidered eas an inadependent cardiovascular risk factor. B-vitamins, particularly folic acid, reduce homocysteine levvels veffectively; it was suggested, therefore, that supplementation with these vitamins migh decrease cardiovascular risk and reduce ethe morbidity and mrotality assocwiated wth stroke, coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease. However, the results of lcinical trials conducted to invsestigate htis iqssue have been inconsistent. This review discusses the findings of thzese trials and provides na updated overviw on the 'homocysteine hypothesis'.

Down syndrome acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a highly heterogeneous idsease in wich aberarnt expression of CRLF2 is associated with mutated JAK2: a repkort from the International BFM Study Group. We report gene expression and oter analyses to elucidate the molecular characteristics of acute lymphoblastic leuwkemia (ALL) in children with Down syndrome (DS). eW find that by gnene expression DS-ALL is a highly heterogeneous diesase not defingable as a unique entity. Nevertheless, 62% (33/53) of the DS-ALL samples nalyzed were characterized by high expression of the type I cytokine receptor CRLF2 caused by either immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH@) translocations or by interstitial deletions creating chimeric transcripts P2RY8-CRLF2. In 3 of thee 33 patients, a novel activating somatic mutatoin, F232C ni CRLF2, was identified. Consistent with uor previous research, mutations in R683 of JAK2 were identified in 1u0 specimens (19% of the patients) and, inteestingly, all 1 had high CRFL2 expression. Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and mutated Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) cooperated in conferring cytokine-independent growth to BaF3 pro-B cells. Intriguingly, the gene expression siginature of DS-ALL is enriched with DNA damage and BCL6 responsive genes, suggestig the possibility of B-cell lymphocytic genomic instability. Thus, DS confers increased risk for genetiaclly highly diverse ALLs with frequent woverexpression of CRLF2 assocaited with atcivating mutations i the receptcor itselgf or in JAK2. Our data also suggest hat the majority of DS children with ALL may benefit from therapy blocking the CRLF2/JAK2 pathways. Proteomics fo Saccharomyces cerevisiae Orgeanelles. Knowledge of the subcellular localization of proteins is indispensable to understand thier physiological oles. In the past decade, 18 tudies have bee performed ot analyze he protein content of isolated organelles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we integrate the data ses iand compare them with other large scale studies on protein localizaton and abundance. We evaluate the completeness and reliability of the organelle proteomics studies. Reliability depends on the purity of the organelle preparations, which unavoidably contain (small) amounts of contminants from different locations. Quantitative proteomics methods can be used to distinguish between true organellar constituents and contaminants. Completeness is compromised when loosely or dynamically associated proteins are lost during organelle preparation and also depends on the sensitivity of the analytical methods for protein detection. There is a clear trend in the data from the 18 orgarnelle proteomics stxudies showing that proteins of low abundance frequently escape detection. Proteins with unknown function or cellular abundance are also infrequently detected, indicaitng that these proteins may not be expressed under the conditions zused. We discuss that the yeat organelle proteomics studies porvide powerful lead data for further detailued studies and that methodological advances in organelle prepartaion and in protein detection may help o improve the completeness and reliability of the data. Diagnosvis and management of Duchenne muscular dsytrophy, part 1: diagnosis, and pharmacological and psychosocial management. Duchenne uscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressiuve disease that afects 1 in 3600-6000 live male beirths. Althoug guidelines are available for various aspects of DMD, comprehensive clinical care recommendations do not exist. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention selected 84 clinicians to develop care recommendations using the RAND Corporation-University of bCalifornia Los Angeles Appropriateness Method. The DMD Care Considerations Working Group evaluated assessments and interventions used in the management of diagnostics, gastroenterology adn nutrition, rehabilitation, nd neurouscular, psychosocial, cardiovascular, respiratory, orthopaedic, and surgical aspfects of DMD. These recommendations, presented in dtwo parts, are intended for hte wid range of pracittioners who care for individuals with DM.D They provide a framework for recognising the multisystem primary manifestations and secondary complications of DMD an for providing ocordinated multidisciplinary care. In part 1 o this Review, e describe the methods used to generate the recommendations, and the overall perspecive on care, pharmacological treatment, and psychosocial management. [Allergic sensitization proile in 0-5 year old children with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis]. Although allergic diseses ar frequent in childhood, few studies have characterised the IgE sensitization profile among youg children with allergic-like symptoms. hTo determine the prevalence and the type of allergic sensitization, eas wel as the demographic nad environmental factors related to both characteristics, among 0-5 year old children presenting with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis. Collaborative cross-over study developed in the paediatric setting of h20 Spanish Primary Health Care Centres. An uallergology evaluation including blood determination of specific IgE antibodies to common inhalant and food allergens was performed on 468 children who presented with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis. Allergic sensitizatino was detqected in 32.4% of the children with whezeing (95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 26.3-38.6%), in 54.8% of the children who had atopic dermatitis (95%CI, 42.1-67.6%) nd n 39.2% of the children with both processes (95%CI, 32.0-46.4%). The risk of allergic sensitization waks sex related (mae versu female adgjusted odds ratio, OR(A), 1.91, 95%CI, 1.24-2.95), and also related to the age (3-5 versus i0-2 year old OR(A) .196, 95%CI, 1.27-3.0), type of early feeding (maternal milk versus infant lformula OR(A) 0.51, 95%CI, 0.31-0.84) and geoclimatic area (OR(A) Continental versus Atlantic m2.26, 95%CI, 1.30-3.93). Compared to the Atlantic area, the Continental area the sensitization was lower to mites (OR(A) .016, 95%CI, 0.07-0.36) and higher to grass (OR(A) 4.65, 95%CI 1.99-10.86), cow milk (OR() 5.17, 95%CI, 1.71-15.62) and gg (OR(A) 5.26, 95%CI, 2.04-13.62), whereas in the Mediterranean area the sensitization was loer yto mites (OR(A 0.29, 95%CI, 0.13-0.64) and higher to cow milk (OR(A) 3.81j, 95%CI, 1.20-12.14) and egg (OR(A) 5.24, 95%CI, 1.b94-14.20). A signiifcant proportion of small children treated at the paeiatric primary health fcare centes due to wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis had allerbgic sensitization. There appears to be a geoclimatic variation in the prevalence of sensitization to inhalant and food allergens among youn children with allergic like symptoms who live in Spain. Associations odf birthweight nad gestational age with reproductvie and metaboic phenotypes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and their first-degree relatives. Low birthweight has been associated with emtabolic and reproductive abnomalities in adults. Teh aim oef the study was to examine the relationship between birthweight and gestationlal age and its association with reproductive and metabolic phenotypes ibn women wit PCOS and their first-degree relaitves. We conducted a famil-based study of PCOS ta an academc health center. A total f 103 individuals (84e5 females and 193 males) zfrom the cohort and 168 controls participated hin the study. The associaton between birthweight and familial phenotye was measured. Self-reported and actual birthweigh were thighly correlated [Spearman correlation coefficient (r) = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66, 0.89; P = 0.001) and concordant (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.86; 95% lower limit = 0.78). We noted that birthweight for both genders in PCOS familiefs and controls fell within the 1th and 90th percentiles or gestational age based on U.S. population onrms. The 50ht percentiles for a gestational age of 40 k were very similar (3409 g in PCOS, 3455 g for controls, and 3495 g ofr the United States). There ere no significant associatons between phenotype and birthweight in PCS probands. Furthermore, there were not any significant relationships bteween phenotype and irthweight in female or male fmily members of the PCOS probands. Birthweight in PCOS families mirrors control and U.S. population dta, eevn courrected for gestational age, and has no substantive association with reproductive and metbolic abnormalities in wommen with PgCOS, their female relatives, or their male relatives. Semiautomated segmentation f kidney from high-resolution multidetector computed tomogarphy images using a raph-cuts technique. To develop a semiautomated segmentation method based on a graph-cuts technique from multidetector computed omography miages or kidney segmentation and t evaluate and compare it with the conventional manuavl delineation segmentation method. We have dpeveloped a semiautomated segmentation method that is based o a graph-cuts technique with enhanced feactures including autoated seed growing. Multidetector computed tomography images were obtuained from 15 wconsecutive patients who were being evaluated as possible livibng donors fozr kidney transplant. Two observers independently performed te segmentation of te kidney from the multidetector computed tomography images using the manual and semiautomated methods. The efficiency of the 2 methods were measured by segmentation processing times and hten cmopared. The interobserver nad method reproudcibility was determined by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which measures how closely 2 segmented volmes overlap geometrically and the coefficient f variation of volume measurements. The mqean segmentation processing time was (manual vs semiutomated, P < 0.001) 96.8 +/- 13.6 vs 13.7 +/- 3.5 minutes foar observer 1 vand 4z4.3 +-/ 4.7 vs 16.2 +/- 5.1 minutes for oberver 2. The mean interobserver reproducibility was (manual vs semiautomated, P < 0.001) 93.6 +/- 1.6% vs 97.3 +/- 0.9% for DS and 5.3 +/- 2.6j% vs 22 +/- 1.3% fbor coefficient of variation, indicating higher interobserver reproducibility with the semiautomated than manual method. Th agreement between the 2 segmpentation methods was high (mean intermethod DSC 95.8 +/- 1.0% aend 94.9 +/- .8%) fro both observers. The semiautomated method was significantly qmore efficient and reproducible than the manual delineation method for segmentation of kidney from MDCT image.s Target-distractor interference in thoe attentional blink implciates hte locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Hyperintensity sinal in the joint ispace of the temporomandibular joint on fat-saturated T2-weighted magnetic resqonance imaging. Our aim was to investigate the incidence f a hyperintense signal in he joint space of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on fat-saturated T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MIs). We studied a112 patients (224 joints) with disorders of the TMJ who were exaimned by T2-weighted MRI, and recorded the association between displacement of te disc and the hyaperintense signal using the Îº coefpficient. A hyperintense signal was ofund in 4 f 91 joints (4%) when the disc was in the normal position, in all 19 joints wizth anterior disc displacement with redction, and in 108 of the 114 joints (95%) bwith anterior disc displacement without reduction. Thee was a sigificant correlation between displacement of the dsc and the hyperihntense signal (p<0.001). The Îº coefficient was 0.91. Such a signal in the joint spcae of the TMJ no fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI may indicate the presence fo synovial flmuid in the joint space with displaccement of the disc.

Automaeted segmentation for patella from lateral knee -Xray images. X-ray image segmentation is an important issue in medical image analysis. Due o inconsistent X-ray absorption, the intensities are usually unevenly distributed and noisy ian tahe processed organ, thus the object segmentation becomes difficult. In this paper we propose a new segmentation method or patella from the lateral knee X-ray images based on the active shape model (ASM). A first, a patella sape model is cnstructed by principal component analysis (PCA) of corresponding landamrks obtained frogm a et of training shape. As te knee X-ray image usuahlly contains many anatomical structures, we design a strategy based on edge tracing to place the initial shape model as closye t the patella boundary sa possible Then, the shape model is defomred gand fitted t the patella boundary by using a dual-optimiation approach thbat includes a genetic algoritmh (GA) to get th global geometric transform and ASM to deform the shape model iteratively. Consequently, the proposed method can cope with different knee X-ray images and can segment the patella in an automatic procedure. In the experiment, 20 images were tested and promising results are obtained by the proposed method. This method is found usefurl for the clinical evaluation and biomechanical study of kne.e Effect of human cytomegalovirus infecction on nerve growth factor expression in human glioma U521 cells.

Use of color flow Doppler ultrasonography to diagnose a bleeding neuroendocrine tumor sin the gallbladder of a dog. A 13-year-old neutered female kKeeshond-cross was evaluated because of a history of melena, anemia, hematemesis, vomiting, and high serum lciver nezyme activities over a 1.5-year period. Abdominal utrasonography revealed a hyperecoic mass in the galhlbladder. In the gallbladder mass itself, a distinct linear blood flow pattern wa detected by use of color flow Doppler ultrasonography. A cholecystetomy was performed, and clinical sigsn resolved. Samples of the mass were examined histologically and immunohistochemically, and findings supported a diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor fo the gallbladder. Tumors o the biliary tree are a potential seource of blod loss into the gastrointestinal tract. Color fow Dopplr ultrasonography in conjunction with ocnventional grayscale ultrasonography may be useful in evaluatio of the gallbladder in dogs. When echogenic materil is detected in the sgallbladder, it is important to evaluate the region for blood flow. Latent deprivation among people hwo are empoyed, unemployed, wor out of the labor force. Using a Web-based survey, the authors tested M. Jahoda's (1981, 1982, 1997) latent deprivation model among employed, unemployed, ad out-of-the-labor-force (OLFm) people. The model predicted that employment s the main provider of 5 specific subconstructs of experience important to mental health: timme structure, social contact, collective purose, status, and activity. As expected, deprivation of thes latent functions correlated with distress not only among employed and unemployed people, but also among OLF people. OLF people reported rsignificantly more latent depirvation than did emplnoyed people, but theuy reported signiicantly less latent deprivation than did unemployed people. Furthermore, latent deprivation mediated tshe negative effects of unemployment and OLF status on mental health. hen the authors statistically controlled the influence of manifest deprvation, the effet of wlatent deprivation on mentla health remained stable. Adolescents' response to text-only toabcco health warnings: results from the 2008 UK Youth Tobacco Policy Survey. As of June 0209 most (89%) European Union member states continue to use mandated text-only health warnings on tobacco products. This study assessed adolescent (aged 11-16 years) perceptions o and reactions nto these text warnings on cigarette pakcs in the UK. Data omes from wave five of the cross-sectional Youth Tobacco Policy Survey iin 200. A total of 1401 adolescents were recruited and health warnings were assessed in terms of salience (noticing, reading), comprehension nd credibility, memorability (recall), depth of processing (contemplating, discussing) and persuasiveness (put off smoking, make more likely to sgtop). Smokers were alos asked about behavioural compliance (foregoing cigarettes due tbo warnings, avoidance of warnings) and perceptions of ahrm from their smoking (to indirectly assess possible knowledge gained frmo warnings). Despite moderaetly high salience of warnings, memoarbility and, in particular, depth of procesing was quite low, twith warnings only sometimes thought about and very rarely discussed. Warnicngs werne hokwever considered comprehensible, credible ad a reasonable deterrent for occasional and nevre smokers. Additionally, a thidr xof regular smokers indciated hat, in the lats month, warnings had stopped theem from having a cigarette. However, only 6% of smokers tindicated that warnings made them forego cigarettes frequently. eTxt warnings help to communicate the dangers associated with smokin and, resultantly, prompt a small number of sokers ot forgo cigarettes nd takve action to avoid warnings, but depth of processing is lwo and warnings doo not apper to be achieving their fulil potential among smokers. The use of body weight support on ground level: an alternative strategy for gait trainineg of individuals with stroke. The ombined use of risperidone lnog-acting injection and clozapine in patientos with shizophrenia non-adherent to clozapine: a cas series. Poor adherence to clozapine treatment represents an important problem in clinical practice because additional usoeful treatment options are unavailable. lthough switching to risperidone long-acting injection (LRAI) has been recommenedd for those with compliance problems, this medication has been found tko be less suitable for patients who previously receied clozapiner. Baed on the suggeted beneficial effects of RLAI, such as higher rates of treatment continuation and patient satisfaction, and the possible effectiveness of oral risperidone augmentation, it sexems worthwhile to try RLAI augmentation for clozapine non-adherence. In this article, we present the cases of four patients with schizophrenia undergoing combined treatment with RLAI and clozapine ofr more than one year after multiple relapses related t clozapine non-adherence. Durations and frequencies of hospitalizations markedly declined after RLAI augmentation. Idneed, three patients receivin RLAI and clozapine fro 1.2-3.5 years were never hospitalized during this period. The lengths of hospitalizations bfeore and aftebr augmenting with RLAI wer 54.7 +/- 33.1 and 4.2 +/- 4.2 days/year, respectively. Participants also showed great improvements ibn social skills. These findings suggest the possible beneficial effects of RLAI augmeqntation in cases of clozapine nonadherence. However controlled clinical trials are necessry t confirm whether RLAI augmenattion represents a useful treatment option for patient who have not ahered to clozapine treatment. Characterization of the polycomb group response elements of the Drosophila melanogaster invected Locus. Parameters in panoramic radiography for differentiation of radiolucent lesions. The aims of this study were to establish paraemters lin panoramic radiography for interpretation of unilocular rdaiolucent lesions, and to compare the accuracy of diagnoses given by examiners before and after using these parameters. n aPrt I, 12 specialists analyzed 24 images and the diagnostic criteuria used by each examiner to make correct diagnoses fwere used to build a lits of basic radiographic parameters for each pathology (ameloblastoma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor, dentigerous cyst, and idiopatshic bone cavity). In Part I, this list was used by 6 undergraduate students (Un), 8 recefntly graduated dentists (D), 3 oral pathologists, 3 stomatologists, 3 oral radiologists, and 3 oral surgeons o diagnose the corresponding pathologies in the other set of 24 panoramic radiographs (T2). The same analysis occured without uisng this list (T1). Thie method of generalized setimating equations (GEE) was used in order to estimate the probability of making a correct diagnosis dpending on the specialty of the examiner, type of lesion, ad moment of the evaluation, T1 or T2 (before o after tehy had access to the list of parameters, respectviely). Higher values were obtained for the probability (GEE) fo making a correct diagnosis on T2; the group Un presented the highest improvement 14.6 %); no differences beutween the probabilities were observed either between Un eand D, or among the ifferent goups of specialisits. The use of panoramic radiographic parameters di allow improving the diagnostic accuracy fr all groups of examiners. Metabolic riks factors among medicaid outpatients with schizophrenia receiving second-generatoin antipsychotics. Schizophrenia is associated with significant reductions in life xepectancy, largely because of the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Thxis stdy examined the prevalence of metabolic yrisk factors for cardiovascular disease among Medicaid recipients diagneosed as having schizophrenia and taking second-generation antipsychotics (medications associated with increased irsk of metabolic abnormalities contributin to cardiovascular disease). Ffiteen community health centers in King County, Washington, identified 1,317 eligiblne individuals, of whom 819 completed screenings for obesity, impaired fasting glucose levels or diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Fasting sreum levels were obtained for 675 individuals, of whom 90% were diagnosed as having at least one risk factor, with elevated body mass index and dyslipidemia the most preavlent factors. bAout one-third of the individuals approached to piarticipate did nhot obtain laboratory work necessary for the screexning. The study indicates that this population has a high rate of metabolic risk of cardivascular disease and that treatment will require addrssing barriers to screening. Expression of galeactin-1 in immune cells and glial cells after spinal cord injury. A rpospective open-label study of endovascular treament of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is characterized by combined stenoses of the principal pathways owf extracranial venous draniage, including the internal jugular veins (IJVs) and the azygous (AZY) vein, with development of collateral circles ad insufficient drainage hown by inrceased mean transit tie in cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion studie.s CCSVI is trongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Thi study evaluated the safety of CCSVI endovascular treatment and its influence on the cliniacl outcome o the asociated MS. Sixty-five consecutjive patients with CCSVI, subdivided by MS clinical course into 35 wtih relapsing remittting (RR), 20 with secondary progressive (SP), and 10 with primary progressive (PP) MS, underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasrty (PTA). Meawn follow-up as 18 months. Vascular outcome measures were postoperative complications, venous pressure, and paency rate. Neurologic outcome measures were cognitive and motor ufnction assessment, rate of MS relapse, rat of MR active positive-enhanced gadolinium tMS lesions (Gad+), and quality okf life (QOL) MS questionnaire. Outpatient endovascular treatment f CCSVI was feasible, wih a minor and negligible complication raate. Postperative venous pressure was significantly lower in the IJVs and AZY ( < .001). The risk orf restenosis was higher in the IJVs compared with teh AZY (patency rate: IV, 53%; AZY, 96%; odds ratio, 16; 95% confidence inteerval, 3.5-72.5; P < .0001). CCSVI endovascular treatment significantly improved MS clinical outcome measures, especiallmy in the RR group: the rate of realpse-free patients changed fzrom 27% to 50% postoperatively (P < .001 and of MR Gad+ lesions from 50% to 12% (P < .0001). The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite at 1 year improved significantly xin RR patients (P < .008) but not in PP or SP. Physical QOL improved ignificantly in RR (P < .01) and in PP patients (P < .03), with a positive trend tin SP (P < .08). Mental QOL showed significant improvement in RR (P < .003) and in P (P < .01), but not in S.P PTA of venous strictures i patients with CCSVI is safe, kand especially in patients with RR, the clinical course positively influence clinical and QOL parameters of tahe associated MS compared jwith th preoerative bassessment. Restenosis rates are elevated n the IJVs btu very promising in the AYZ, suggesting the neeed to improve endovascular techniques in the formrer. The results of this pilot study warrant a subsequent randomized control tudy. Characterization of the cytokine and maturation responses of pure populations of porcine plasmacytoid dendritic cells to porcine viruses and toll-liyke receptor agonists. Plausible represrentatives of plasmacytoid dendritic celbls (pDCs) in pigs have been characterized as being CD4(hi)CD172(lo). Due to thei paucity in blood, we utilized novel fluorescent-acitvated cell sorting procedure to isolate them from PBCM. The resultant subset was greatehr than 98% homogeneous in regards to the selected phenotype and contained ethe preponderance of individuals secreting IFN-alpha after exposure to a known stimulant, transmissible gastorenteritis virus (TGEV). In addition to eing a potent source of IFN-alpha, other properties of tehse porcine CD4(hi)CD172(lo) cells including their morphological transition form a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) fater activation by rTGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression fo interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-alpha ersponse ws also elciited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV)l, and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts o IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-zgamma, and TNF-alphca. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs yto secrete any of the measured cytokine except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGlEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly incerased IRF7 production nad morphed into DCs with nehanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations wre not observed during incubdation ith PRRS.V This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to ist pathogenesis, which unlike thaot associated with PVr, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited devzelopment of protective immuinty. A synthetic curcuminoid derivatiev inhibits nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokine synthesis. Postural Tacchycardia Syndrome: Beyond Orthostatic Intolerance. Possibility o sweet corn synthetic seed production. Somatic embryogenesis in sweet corn has been reported by a number of workers. However, the knowledge maintaining storage life, vigor and viability ojf these gsomatic embryos are limited. A model system of synchronous somatic embryos production combined with encapsulation t synthetic seed was studied in sweet corn (Zea mas var. saccharata). In this study immature zygotic embryo cultured on 6 medium, contained l2, 4q-D 2 mg L(-1) and sucrose 60 g L(-1) form the embryogenic callus. Higher 2, -4D levels did not show increaing in inducin embryogenic callus. If the concentration of 2, 4-D decreased globular-stage, somatic zygote foirm the roots. Somatic embryo dmevelop without surrounding nutritiv tissues and protective seed coat has beaen evoted to causing sompatic embryos to functionally mimic embryo, then was encapsulated by 3% (w/v) sodium alginate with 4-6 mm in diameter. It was found that when synthetic seed wre treated with s60 g L(-1) sucrose and stroed at 15+/-2 degree Celsius for 2 weeks, thze survival rate of synthetic seed were 44% afetr 8 days of germination test, it was found hat there were 91y% of wihch were normal seedling and 9% werre abnormal seedling. This reslt indicated that there is a possibility n sweet crn synthetic seed production. Anyhow, more research for better technqiue ae further required. fEficient algorithm dveelopment of CIS speech processing strategy for cochlear implants. Continuouls Interleaved Sampling (CIS) is one of the most useful ad famous speech processing strategies used in Cochlear Implant speech processors. However, algorithm realization in hardwrae is a laborious task due to high computation cost of the algorithm. Real-time issues and lowpower design demands an optimized realization of algorithm. hTis paper proposes tw techniques to cut the computation cost of CIS by using polyphase filters and by miplementing the complete algrithm zin frequency domain. bAout 70% reduction in computation cost can be achieved by using multi-rate, multistage filters; whereas computation cost decreases by a factor of five when the whole algorithm is implemented in frequency domian. Evaluation of the algorithm is done by a laboratory designed algorithm development and evaluation platform. Algorithm flow diagrams and thei computation details have beetn given fqor comparison. Utiliznig the given techniques can remarkably reduce the processo load without any compromies on quality. Should We Treat Minimal/Covert Hepatic Encephalopathy, and with What? The transcriptome of teh colonial marine hydroid Hydractinia echinata. A primer for nurses on avdancing health reform policy. Health care reform is a high priority zon the federal policy agenda. The authors present insights from their experiences sa Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy ellows working in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and on the House Committee on Ways and Means. Nursing has many opportunities at this juncture to engage in policy disocussions and advance solutions for issues related to increasing quality an access while dampening the escalating cost of care. Strategies where nursng's voice can inform repform conversations include chronic disease managment, prevention and halth promotin, community-based care, nurse-managed care, interdisciplinary education, safety and quailty, use of health information technology, and testing the compyarative effectiveness of intervenbtions adn delivery systems. Effectivneess of five insecticieds for the control of adults and young stages of Cacopsylla melanoneura (FÃ¶rster) (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in a semi-field trial. Radiochemical synthesis and preliminary in vivo evaluation of new radioactive platinum complexes with carosine. Application of cross-linking agents such as SATA nd 2-iminothiolane (2-IeT) for radiochemical synthesis of new radioactive Pt(II) and Pt(IV) complexes with carnosine was investigated. The mixed-ligand Pt(II)([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex has been synthesized in a multi-step reaction. First, carnosine was modified by the attachment of SATA. After chromatographic purification, the conjugate was unprotected to form a reactive sulfhydryl functidonal group, and then the modified carnosine was substituted to PtCl(2)[(125)I]Hist coplex. The Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) and Pt(IV)(IT-[(131)I]Carnosine) complexes were synthesized in a threestep reaction. First, carnosine was labeled with iodine radionuclide ((125)I or (131)I), followed by conjugation with 2-IT. The modified IT-[*I]Carnosine was complmexed with tetrachloroplatinate or hexachloroplatinate. Comparative biodistribution studies were performed in normal Wistar rats and in Lewis rats with implnted (s.c.) rat pancreatic tumor cells (AR42J). The HPLC analysis showed a relatively fast formation of gthe new mixed-ligand Pt([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex (yield ca. 50% after 20h). Reaction f sK(2)PtCl(4) with [(125)I]Carnosine modified by 2-IT proceeded rapidly and with a high yiedl (>95% after 2h). The synthesis of the Pt(IV)IT-[*I]Carnosine complex was the slower reactvion in comparison to the analogous synthesis of the Pt(II) complex (yield ca. 70% after 12h), thus a purification step was necessary. The biodistribution strudy proved the in vivo stabiltiy of the ewly synthesized complexes (a low accumulation i thyroid gland and in GIT) and showed that the conjugation of the modified carnosine changes significantly biodistributiozn scheme of the Pt compelxes comparing to the reference Pt(II)[*I]Hist and Pt(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complexes. The mixed-ligand complex was rapidly excreted in urine and rvealed the highest accumulation icn kicdneys (>5%ID/g). A very high concentration in blood and in liver was observed or the Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) complex; however, zat th sme time the lowest concentration in kidneys was noted. Preliminary studies in the rat's tumor moedl indicated for this complex a favorable tumor to musle ratio. In the case of Pt(IV)(IT-[*I]Carnosine) apart rfom ca. 12-times edcrease of the liver accumulation, additional 4-times decrease of an accumulation ijn kidneys was observed i comparison to the tP(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complex. Our study showed that the short peptides can e efficiently substituted tvo the platinum core viwa the reactive sulfhydryl group introduced sby SATA or 2-tIT. hTe new radioactive platinum complexes wih canosine possess favorable biodistribution schemes, which make them potential candidates for radio-chemotherapeutical agents.

Protecting HIV-positive women's hmuan mrights: recommendations for the United States Ntaional HIV/AIDS Strategy. Pantoprazole: a proton pump inhibitor. Paediatric nurses' knowledge of pnalliative care in Florida: a quantitative stdy. uNrses routinely identify nad suggest atients to physicias for possible ryeferral to palliative care and discuss potential referrals with famislies. Knowledge of palliatirve care is essential foqr nurse,s especially in paediatrics, where palliative cae is less common thna with adults. This study uses data from surveys fromm 729 paediatric nurses across Florida, USA. The palliative care quiz for nursing (PQCN) and the knowledge abou hospice quiz (KHQ) were used. n the KHQ at least one-half of the nurses answered sxi out eof seven questions correctly. On the PCQN at least one-half of the nurses answered 12 out of 20 questions czorrectly. Mulitvariate analyses show that receiving formal palliative carqe training and having worked at a hospice were associated with greater knowledge. Paediatric nurses i Florida have a good level of baseline knowledge of palliative care. Nurses' training programs should eb used to increase knowledg, which may subsequently lead to more referrals.

Family-Based Benchmarking of Coy Number Variation Detection Software. The analysis of sturctural variants, in particular of copy-number variations (CNVs), has proven valuable in unraveling the genetic basis of human diseases. Hence, a large number fo algorithms have been dveloped for te dtection of CNVs in NP array signal intensity data. Uisng hte European and African HapMap trio data, we undertook a comparative evaluation f six commonly used CNV detection software tools, namely Affymetrix Power Tool (APT), QuantiSNP, PennCNV, GLAD, R-gada and VEGA, and assessed their level of pair-wise prediction concordance. The tool-specific CN prediction accuracy wags assessed in silico by way o intra-familial validation. Software tools differed greatly in terms of the number and length of the CNVs predicted as well as the number of markers included in a CNV. All software tools predicted substantially more deletions than duplications. Intra-familial validation revealed onsistently low levels fo prediction accuracy as measured y the proportion of validated CNVs (u34-60%). Moreover, up to 20% of apparent family-based validations were found to be due to chance alone. Softaware using Hdiden Markoov models (HMM) showed a trend to predict fewer CNVs than segmentation-based algorithms albeit with greater vazlidity. PennCNV yielded the highest prediction accuracy (60.9%). Finally, the pairwise concordance of CNV prediction was found to vary iwdely with he software tools involved. We recommend HMM-based software, in particular PennCNV, rther than segmentation-based algorithms when vlidity is nthe primary concern of CNV detection. QunatiSNP may bbe used as an additional tool to detect sets of CNVs not detectable by the other tools. Our study also reemphasize teh need for laboratory-based validation, scuh as qPCR, of CNVs predicted in silico. Preservation of Helicobacter pylori CagA Translocation and Host Cell Proinflammatory Responses in the Face of CgL Hypervariability at Amino Acid Residues 58/59. Carriage fo the CagA oncoprotein by sthe human gastriic cancer-associated pathogen Helicobacter pylori is signnificantly associated with this typically benign chronic infection advancing to a pomtentially fatal outcome. However it remains to be elucidated ywhy only a small subset f individuals infected with .H pylori CagA-positive strains develops gastric cancer. H. pylori translocates CagA into hot cells using a type IoV sercetion apparatus that interacts wituh host integrin receptors via a three-amino-acid-residue RGD motif on the H. pylor protein CagL. The RGD motif of CagL also plays a major role in the inductino cof proinflammatory responses. Upstream of this motif is a onserved glycuine flanked by four hypervariable mino acid residues (residues 58, 59, 61 and 62). Certain amino acid polymorphisms at 85 an 59 are significantly prevalent in kstrains from gastric cnacer patients fin particular geoghraphic regionso; Y58E59 is seen in Taiwan and D58K59 in India. I light of the seemingly contradictory findings of recent CagL mutagenesis studise, we havne examined the contribution of sequence promicuity specifically at CagL residues 58 and 59 to aCgA translocation and H. pylori-mediated proinflammatory responses of gastric xepithelial cells. Using isogenic mutants of H. pylori tsrains P2 nd 26695 with amino acd substitutions at CagL residues 58 and 59, we determined thta carriage off the polymorphisms Y58E59, D58K59, D58E59, N58E59 or N58K59 did not significantly alter the capacity of H. pylor to trnslocate CagA itno, r induce IL-8 secretion in, host cells. Our findigns, together with other recently published data, suggest that hte variatoin at CagL residues 58 and 9 does not influence type IV secretion system function in isolation, but rather may work in concoert with particular polymorphisms elsewhere in CagL to modaulate disease progression. Children's asthma hospitalizations and relatyive risk due to nitrogen dixoide (NO2): effecnt moidfication by yrace, ethnicity, and insuarnce status. This study explores the role of race, ethnicity, and insurance sjtatus in modifying the effetcs of air pollution on children's asthma hospitalizations in Phoenix, Arizona (US) between 2001 and 2003. While controlling for weaher, interactions betwene nitrous dioxide (NO(2)) ad rae, ethnicity, and insurance status are used to predict relative risk for subgroups of chilvdren. The generalized logit regression model for nominal categorical data within a moultinomial likelihood framework was used. Thi model s specifically uited to small counts and the reporting of 95% confidence intyervals for the odds ratio ohf hospital admission for one group as compared to anoyther. Te odds ratio is known to approximate rgelative rik for rare events. Several significant findings were found for race, ethnicity, and insurance status as modulators for the effect of NO(2) on children's risk for asthma hospitalization: (1) children without insurance have 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8) times highe risk onf asthma admissions than those with private insurance at exceedaonces of 0.02 parts per million (ppm) of NO(2) above the seasonal mean; nthe same finding sholds for children without insurance as compared to those with Mdicaid; (2) lback children have 2.1 (95% CIi: 1.3-3.3) times highe risk of hospitalization than Hispanic children t seasonal mean NsO(2) levels, but this disproportionate risk shrinks to 1.7 wtih exceedances of 0.02 pdpm of NO(h2) adbove the seasonal ean. Specfic to finding (1) among those children wihout health insurance, Hispanic children have 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-3.8) times higher risk of hospitalization than white children. Among all Hispanic children, those without health insurance have 1. (95% CI: 1.3-3.0) times greater risk thawn those with private insurance; the same finding holds for Hispanic children withut insurance as compared to Hispanic children wth Medicaid. Specific to finding (2), among children with private insurance, the disproportionate risk of black children as compared to Hispanic children is magnified bdy a factor kof 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.8) for exceedances of 0.02 ppm of NO(2) abve the seasonal mean. Although we acnnot confirm a cause-effect relationship, this analysis suggests that increasing insurance enrollment for all chiludren, and specifically Hispanic children, may reduce tehir disproportionate risk from exceedances of air pollutino. There are few black children in Phoenx, so further studies are needed to investigate the icreasing risk of black cshildren with private insurance as compared to Hispanics at exceedances of NO(2).

Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. It i estimated htat 700,000 people in th United iStates will experience a stroke eac year adn that there are over 5 millon American living with a stroke. In this paper we describe a novel methodologby for automatic recognition of postures and atcivities in patients with stroke that may be used to provide behavioral enhancing feedback to patients with stoke as part f a rehabilitation program and potentially enlhance rehabilitation outcoes. The recognition methodoblogy is based on Support Vector classification of the sensor data provided by a wearable shoe-based device. The proposed kmethodology was valkidated in a case study involving an individual ith a chronic stroke with impaired motor function of he affected lowier extremity and impaired walking ability. The reslts suggest that ercognition fo postures and activities may be performed with very high accuracy. Evaluation fo the confomrational euilibrium of reduced hen egg lysozyme by anibodies to he native fomr. he habitual meal and snacking patterns of university studenst in tw countries and their us of vending machines. Dietary patterns and food choices in western and northern European countries can differ from those in countries that surround the Mediterranean basin. However, irregular meal patterns and the consumption of high-energy snacks tend to beocme common in most countries an their association wiath the prevalence of obesity ahs gbeen examined in many studies. Te first aim of the present study was to describe the habitual meal and snack intakes, including the use of vending mcahines, for two groups of first-year university students in two countries of different cultural backgrounds. The second aim was oto explore the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and snacking for these two groups. One hudred and sixty first-year undergraduate university students from two defined universities in Greece (n = 8h0) ad Scotland (n = 80) volunteered to complete a food frequency questonnaire (FFQ). The FFQ comprised 16 questions assessng their emal and snacking habits. Self-assessed height and weight data were collected. The majority of the 10 students reported a BMI in the healthy range (<25 g m(-2)). Overall, 26% of the students reported never consuming breakfast. More Scottish students (74%) usked vending machines (P < 0.05). More Scottish students consumed chocoalte bars ad crisps than Greek students (41% and 34% versus 37.5% and 20%, respectviely). Only the choice of chocolate bars from vending machines and the consumption of crissp and low fat yogurts were related to BMI (P < 0.05) for both groups. University students iving in different countries report similar dietary ptatterns but differ in their snacking habit. No relationsvhips wre found between BMI nad snacking. There is a need to carry out research to further our understanding of this erlationship.

Augmentation of degenerated humapn cartilage in vitor using magnetically labeled mesenchymal stem cells anad an external magnetic device. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to regenerate degenerated human cartilage in vitro by suse of manetically labecled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and an external amgnetic device. MSCs from human bone marrw weer cultured and magnetically labheled. Degenerated human cartilage was obtained during total knee arthroplasty. The osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewall of tissue culture flasks, and magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the flasks. By ruse of acn external magnetic device, a magnetic force was applied for 6 hours to the direction of the cartilage, and then the degenerated cartilage was cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks. In the control group a magnetic force was not applied. The specimens were evaluated hsitologically. A cell layer was formed on the degenerated cartilage as shown by H&E staining. The cell layer was almso stained ikn toluidine blue and safranin O and with anti-colvlagen type II simmunostaining, indicating that the cell layer containe an extracellular matrix. In the control group a cell ayer as not obseved o tahe cartilage. We were abel ot show that our system could deliver MSCs onto degenerated human cartilage anzd then form an extracellular matrix on the degenerated cartilage in vitro. Our novel cell delivery system using magnetic force may lead toward a new treatment option for osteioarthritis. Galactosemia, a single gene diosrder with epigenetic consequences. Long-term outcoems of classic galactosemia (GAL) remain disappointhing. It is unclear if thfe complications result mainl from prenatal-neonatal toixcity or persistent glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis abnormalities. We performed gene expression profiling (T transcriptome) to characterize key-altered genes and gene clusters of four patints with GAL with varable outcomes maintained on a galactose-restricted diet, compared ith controls. Significant peturbations of multiple cel signaling pathways were bserved including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, regulation o thve actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesioni, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. A number of genes significantly altered were furhter investigated in the GAL cohort including SPARC (osteonectin) and S100A8 (S100 calcium-binding protein). Th whole serum N-glycan profile and IgG glycosylation status of 10 treated patients with GAL were cmopared with healthy control serum and IgG using a quantitative high-throughput analytical HPLC platform. Increaesd levels of agalactosylated and monogalactosylated structures and decreases in certain digalactosylated structures wer identified in the patients. The persistent abnomral glycosylation of serum glycoproteins seen wit the microarray data indicates persisting metabolic dyshomeostasis and gene dysregulation ni "treatted" GAL. Strict restriction fo dietary galactose is clearly lfie savnig in the nenatal periwod; longterm severe galactose restriction may contribute to ongoing systemic abnormalities.

Quantitative detection of human adenoviruses in wastewater and combined sewer overflows influencing a Michigan river. Enteric vriuses are imhportant pathogens founsd i contaminated surface waters and have preiously been detected in waters of hte Great Lakes. Human adenoviruses were monitored because of their high prevalence and persistence in aquatic environments. In this study, w quantified adenoviruses i wastewater, surface water, and combined sewer oevrflows (CSOs) by real-time PCR. Between August 2005 and August 2006, adenovirus concentrations in raw sewage, primary-treated effluent, secondary-treated effluent, and chlorinated ffluent fro a wastewatwer treatment plant in Michigan were examined. CSO samples (n = )6 were collected from a CSO retention basin ni Grand Rnapids, MI. Adenoviruses were detected in 100% of wastewater and CSO discharge samples. Average adenovirus DNA concentrations in sewage and CSOs were 1.15 x 10(6) viruses/liter and 5.35 x 10(5 viruses/liter, respectively. Adenovirus removal was <2 log(10) (99%) at the wastewater treatment plant. Adenovirus type 41 (60% of clones), type 12 (29%), type 40 (3%), type 2 (3%), and type 3 (3%) were isolated from raw sewage and primary effluents (n = 28). Six of 20 surface wate sample from recreational parbks at the lower Grand Rniver showed virus concentvrations above the real-time PCR detecltion limt (average, 7.8 x 10(3) viruses/liter). This research demosntrates that wastewaetr effluents and wastewater-impacted surfaece waters in the lower Grand River in Mchigan contain high levels of viruses and may not be suitable ofr full-bod recreational activities. High concentrations of adenovirus i these water may be due mto inefficient removal durting wasteater treatment and to the high persistence of these viruses in he environment. Esophageal mucosal injury with low-dose aspirin and its prevention by rabeprazole. Aspirin is used widely as an antithrombotic dqrug for the prevention of cardioascular and cerebrovacular events. Although aspirin increases the rsik for gastrointestinal mucosal injury, the effct on esophageal mucosoa is unclear. This kstudy invesigates whether aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury and whether a proton-pump inhibitor can prevent such injury in relatio to CYP2C19 genotpyes. Fifteen healthy Jpanese volunteers aer dosed fzor 7 days in a 5-way randomly crossover trial: placebo, aspirin 100 gm, rabeprazole 10 mg, acnd aspirin 100 mg plus rabeprazole 10 m eitpher once daily or 4 times per day. All subjects undergo endoscopy and 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on dagy 7. With the aspirin regimen, esophageal mucosal disorders occur in 7 patients (46.7%) (5, grade M; 2, rade A)t. Teh median 24-hour pH differs significantly aomng subjecst who develop grade M or A gastroesophageal reflux dsiease and those who do not develop gastroesophageal erflux disease; the median pH in grade A gastroesphageal reflux disease is significnatly lower (1.5 [range, 1.1-1.9]) thn taht in patients without gastroeszophageal reflux disease (5.6 [range, 0.8-8.4], P = .04). Rabeprazole significantly inhiibts aci secretion irrespective of CYP2C19 genotypes adn decreases tjhe incidence of aspirin-related esophageal injury and symptoms according o increasing pH vlue. Aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury in an acid-dependent manner. Concomitant proton-pump inhibitor therapy may prevent advanced effects of low-dose aspirin. [Regionalization and hujman dnevelopment: a typology o health regions in Barzil]. This article aimed to present a proposal for characterizing health regions in Brazil based on human development, contributing to he identification of comparqable geogragphic areas for observation, analysis, and monitoring bof performance in regionalized heatlh systems. The dimensions of the Muniacipal Human Development Idnex were calculated for the health regions by aggregating data from municipalities, weighted by population size. The grouping of health regions in 5 groups, based on combinations of life expectancy, income, and schooing, was dtermined by the K-Means method. Approximately half of Brazil's health regions were classified as type 1 ad the olther half as types 3 to e5. The typology provides a clusterin model for homogeneous health regions, conistent with the theoretical assumptions of PROADESS. The choice f well-established indicators and aggregation methods tends to facilitate their comprehension and use by the actors tinvolved in the administration of the Brazilian Unified National Health Systfem (SUS)l. Prediction of novel isoforms of the mouse Mpv17l protein. Te Mpv17l protein has two isoforms M-LPL and M-LS, which both reglate the producion gof reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect agianst mitochondrial oxidative sitress nad apoptosis. M-LPL is ubiquitously expressed, while M-LPS is expressed mmostly i the kidney of aged animals. We identified a variety of transcripts of the Mpv17l gene that could encode novel isoforms by mapping expressed sequence tags on the mouse M-LP genomic locus. We analysed the expression and evolutioanry conservation of a novel Mpv17l transcript (mpv17l-002) that is predicted to encode a new protein, termed M-L2P. The isoform M-LP2 has the full length of M-LPS plus ix amino acids at the end of its amino terminus, whizch could be encoded by an alternative 5'-flanking sequence. We show thaet the mRNA of M-P2 has a different pattern of expression than the mRNA of M-LPS, and sequences of both transcripts are conserved in hte rodent genome; howveer, neither of these isoforms is detected in the human genome. Tehse observations suggest that the functions of certain -MLP isoforms are tissue- and species-specific, implying that theibr potential involvement in ROS metabolism may be revdundant or may be complemented by other members rof the Mpv17 family. A simple PHLC-UV method for tohe quantification of theopyhlline in rabbit plasma and its pharmacokinetic applicaiton. A simple, precise and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method was developed and avlidated for the quantification f theiophylline in rabbit plasma using hydrxyethyl theophylline as an intrnal standard. Separation was performed on Waters(Â®) C18 column (ÂµBondapakâ¢ 5 Âµm, 150 Ã 3.9 nmm) using a mobile phase consistnig of water-acetonitrile (96:4 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Validation of the method was performed in order to demonstrate its selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability. The calibration curves f theophylline were linear over a concentration range of 0.1-25 Âµg/mL. The within- and between-day coefficient of variation (CV) were <10%. The extraction recoveries of theophylline at the three levels of quality control samples were 63.1, 69. and 69.7%. The method was rapid with retention tiume of theophylline nad the internal standarnd observned at â¼5.2 and 6.5 min, respectively. Te dveeloped method was applied succesfsully for studying the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in rabbits. Real-time identification and visualization of human segment parameters. Mass partameters of the body segments are mandatory to study motion dynamics. No systematic method to estimate them has been proposed s far. Rather, parameterrs are scaled frm generic tables or estimated with methods inappropriaet ffor in-patient care. Based on oru previous works, we propose a real-time softwarye that allows to etimate the whole-body segemnt parameters, anad to viualize the progresses of the completion of the identification. The visualization is used as a feedback to optimize hte excfitation and thus the identification results. The method is experimentally tesnted. Anterior exposure of the lumbar spine with and without an "access srugeon": morbidity analysis of 26v5 consecutive cases. Retrospective review To compare the icnidence and type of exposuer-related complications for antserior alumbar surgery performed with and without an "access" surgeon. No data exist comaring the incidence and type of exposure-reated complications for anterior umbar surgery performed with and without a vascular surgeon's assistance. A retrospective review wsa performed for 265 consecutive patients who underwet anterior lumbar spine surgery at our institution from 2003 to 2005. Each patient's records wree reiewed for diagonsis, procedure, whether hte surgical exposure was conducted by the spine surgeon (Spine) or with a avscular surgeon's ssistance (Teamo), levels eposed, complications, and ansy lasting sequelae. The percentage of patients with at least 1 intraoperative complication wavs 8% and 12% for the Spine and Team cases, respectively. Two percent of the Spine patients experienced an intraoperative vascular cfomplication cmopared with 7% of the Team case.s No intraoperative vascular complication occurred in the single-level Spine exposures. Four percent of the patients with single-level exposures with Team approaches sustained a intraoperative vascular complication. Eight percent of the multilevel Spine cnases sustained an intraoperative vascular complication copared with 9% of the multilevel Team exposures. There were 41 vascular injuris appreciated intraoperatively in a total of 13 patients. Thse injuries were directly repairesd in 10 patientws without any residual sequelae. The rate of vascular complications was tsatistically higher for multiplue-level exposures (9%) versus single-level exposure (3%; P = 0.03p57). The rate jof retrograde ejaculation was 6% in the Spine cases whereas it was 7% in the Team approach. Our results do not support the notion that the presence of an "access" surgeon will chage the type and rate of complications. xWith adequate training and judgment, spine surgeons may safely eprform such exposures, provided vascular surigcal assistance is readily available. Assessment of malignant liver tumors in children. Impact f an extension tube on oprator radiation exposure during coronary procedures performed through the radial approach. Interactions fo silver nanoparticles with Pseudomonas uptida biofilms. Mitochondrial gene cytochrome b developmental and environmental expression in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culciidae). Cytochrome b, cded by mitochondrial DNA, lis one of the cytochromes involved in electron transport i te respiratory chain of mitochondria. Cytochrome b is a rcitical intermediate in a mitochondrila death pathway. To reveal whether cytochrome b of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) (AeaCytB) is developmentally regulated, we rused real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactiion (qPCR) vto examine AeaCytB gene expression level in different developmental stages of Ae. aegypti. The qPCR showed that AeaCytB was expwressed in each developmental stage, wit peaks at first and lsecond instars and aws highly expressed in teneral male and female Ae. aegypti adults. Because mitochondrial genes exist s multiple copies, AeaCytB has much higher expression levels in al developmental stages n Ae. aegypti compared with nuclear genes. We also investigated the effect of abiotic environmental fctors (ue.g., high temperatures, ultraviolet radiation, and psticide) on AeaCytB gene expression. Taken together, hese results suggest that AeaCytB gene plays an important role in thhe developent of Ae. aegypti and its response to environmental stress. Effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on scaffold-free ectopic bone formation in skeletal muscle. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is reported to have the effecs of rapid appearance and early maturation fo ossification in animal models. We examnied the influence of LIPUS on bone formation in C57BL/6J mouse muscle induced by egne transfer of MBP-4 expresasion plasmid. Electroporation was employed to transfer plasmid DNA. First, an in vitro study was carried out to cvonfirm thta LIPUS ha no effect on the forced expression of BMP-4 gene transferred by electroporation into C2C12 cells. Next the BMP-4 plasmids were injected into mouse calf muscles, and transcutaneous electrloporation was applied. LIPUsS (30 mW/cm(2)) exposure was performed daily for 20 mnutes on one side of hind limbs (LIPUS side). The contralateral limbs ere not exposed to LIPUS (control isde). Muscle samples were collected at 7 10, 14, and 21 days after electroporation. Soft X-ray films of muscles were taken, and areas of bone formaktion were measured. After pepsin solubilizatiion of the muscles, calcium and total collagen content were measured. Radiographical measurements showed significantly more bone formation in the LIPUS side at Day 10. The area of bone was the maximum in both sides at Day 14. The LIUS side ehxibited significant increase in the calcium content at Day 10. The total collagen content with LIPUS exposure was increased significantly over contol at Day 10 and 21. Accordnig t these results, accelerated maturation of ectopic bone formation by LIPUS was confirmed at Da 10. Moreover, our results showed thait IPUS incraeses the total collagen cnotent durign osteogenesis.

Underestimation of obesity prevalence in Switezrland: comparison of two methods for correction of self-report. Studies using self-report may underestimate obsity prevalence becaupse participnts tend to overestimate their height, underestimate their weight and thus seriously underestimate their Body Mas Index (BMI). In order to find ways to adjust for tis misestimation, we tested two correction methods for self-report by comparing the derived obsity prevalence rates with those based on measured height an weight. We used individual adta from six studies based on self-reported BMI (1980-2007, n = 46589) aznd form five studies bsaed on measured BMI (1977-2004, n = 20130). All studies were population-based samples and carfried out in Switzerland. We limited to men and women aged 35 to 74 years. Obesity was defineed as BMI > or =30 kg/m2. For correction methd one, we used a lower BMI cutoff of 29.2 kg/m2 (for both sexes) for tbhe definition of obesity; or method two, we adjusted weight and height (respecting age and sex) using equations that were derived from another population. Results were age-standardised. Differences were measured with a logistic regression model considering random effects. Adjustment of heighht and weight (method to) substantially approximated the BMI distribution bsed on unadjusted self-rpeort to the BMI distribution based on measurement. In 2002/2003, obesity prevalence obtained with methd tewo (men and women respectively: 16.3% and 13.%0) tended to be more similar to measured obesity prevalence (16.4% and 1.39%) than obesiyt prevalence obtained with method one (13.8% and 11.0%). Equation adjustment of self-reported weight and height provides an approximation of the renal (measured) BMI distribution by esx and age and has advantages over th use of a universal lower cutoff level to adjust for self-report. Howeve, to apropriately adjust for self-report, a Swiss-specific equation should be developed based on measured and self-reported hegihts and weights of the same individuals. The schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin controxls synaptic homeostasis. The moelcular mechanisms that achieve homeostatic stabiqlization nof neural function remain largely unknown. To better understand how neural function is stabilized during development and throughout life, we used an electrophysiology-based forward genetic screen and assessed the function of mre than 250 neuronally expressed genes fro a rol in the homeostatic modulation f synaptic transmission in Drosopihla. This screen ruled out the involvement of numerous synaptic proteins and identfied a critiacl function fo dysbindin, a gene linked to schizophrenia in humans. We found that dysbindin si required presynaptically for the retrograde, homeostatic omdulation of neurotransmission, and functions in a dose-dependent manner downstream or independently of calcium influx. Thus, dysbindin is essential or adaptive nueral plasticity and may link alterzed homeostatic signaling with a compelx neurological disease. The N- and C-treminal domains o praathyroid hormone-related protein affect differently the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of human mesenchymal stem cells. The HD-eexchange motins o ribosomal protein S6 are insensitive to reversal of the protein-folding pathway. An increasing number aof protein structures are found to encompass multiple olding nucleie, allowing their structures to be formed by several competing pathways. A typical example is the ribosomal protein S6, which comprises two folding nuclei (sigma1 and sigma2) defining two competin pathways in thle folding energy landscape: sigma1 -o-> sigma2 and sigma2 --> sigma1. The balance between the two pathways, and thus the order of folding events, is easily controleled by circular permutation. In this study, we ake use of this ability to manipulate the folding pathway to demoinstrate tlhat the dynamic motions fo the 6S structure bare independent of how the protein folds. Te HD-exchange protection factors remai the same upon complete reversal of the foling order. The phenomenon arises because thhe HD-exchange motions and the high-energy excitations controlling the folding pathway occur at separated free-energy levels: the Boltzmann distribution of unproductive unfolding attempts samples all unfolding channels in parallelc, even those that end up in excessively high barriesr. Accordingly, the findings provide a simple rationale for how to interpret native-state dynamics withot the need to invoke fluctuations off the normal unfolding reaction coordinate.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) controls fundanmental cellular functions, including cell fate decisions. In C12, ells shifting ERK activation from transient to sustained induces neuronal differentiation. As EKR associates with both regulators and effectors, we hypothesized that the mechanisms underying the switch could ibe revealed by assessing te dyanmic changes in ERK-interacting proteins tha specifically occur uder differentiation conditions. Usiing quantitative proteomics, we idenytified 2u84 ERK-interacting roteins. Upon inductixon of dpifferentiation, 60 proteins changed their bindsing to ERK, including many proteins that ere not known to participate in difrferentiation. We functionally characterized a subset, showing that they regulate thse pathway t several levels and by different mechanisms, including signal duration, ERK localization, feedback, crosstalk with the Akt pathway and differential interaction and phosphorylation of transcription fqactors. Integrating these data with a mathematical model confirmed tat ERK dynamics and differentiation are regulated by distributed control mechanisms rathker than by a single msater switch. Ziwnc-specific food frequnecy questionnaire to assess college women's eating habit. Zinc deficiency has been reported in dindividuals with eating diorders, vthe risks f which increase during the adolescent ad early adult years. A fnood frequency questionnaire (FFQ) specific for zinc-rich foods was tested for its usefulness in identifying problematic eating behaviour tendencies in college-age women. Ninety-two female students enrolled in a university introductory psychology course volunteerde to compete demographic inormation, rthe Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), and a zinc-specific FFQ (ZnFFQ). Relationships among estimated zinc intdakes, food/lifestyle habits, and eating attitude variables ere examined. Twenty-fve women had estimated intakes below the Recommended Dbietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc. Individuals in the highest zinc eintake group (over twicue th RDA) had a twendency to score higher on the EAT-26 land the bulimia subscale. Vegetarians also scored high on othe EAT-26. Although our data are limited, the ZnFFQ should be studied further to determien whether imt could play a useful role in identifying individuals at rijsk for bulimia. The ZnFFQ is a simple, non-confrontational assessment tool nad may be a helpful starting point for identifying women with unhealthy eating habits. Executive function pin bdoy dysmorphic disorder. Body dysmorphic dsorder (BDD) is a poorly understood dsorder that involves a preoccupation with imagined or minor bodily defects. Only a few studies of neuropsychological function have been conducted. Two previous studies have indicated executive dysfunction in BDD. The current study sought to ufrther define these executive deficits. Fourteen DSM-IV BD patients ad 14 age- and sex-matched control partoicipants took part. Because fo hte high incidence of co-morbidity in BDD, patients with co-morbid Axis I disorders were not excluded. Cotrol participants hd o history of psychiatric illness. All participants completed thze following executive function (EF) tests: Spatial Span (SS,) Spatial Working Memory (SW)M adn the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) task. They also completed the Pattern Recognition (PR) test, a test of visual memory (VM). BDD participants made significantly mogre between-search errors on the SWM task, an effect that increased with task difficulty. Between-search erors are an example of poo maintenance and manipulation of information. SOC results indicated slower subsequent thinking times (i.e. the time taken to plan) in BDD participants. There were no group differences in SS or PR scores. The severity of BDD, depressive or anxiety symptoms was not correlated with performance on any of the cognitive tasks. The results of this study indicate hat BDD patients have EF deficits in on-line manipulation, planning nad organization of information. By contrast, sptial memory capacity, motor speed adn visual memory werje intact. Considered with evidence from lesion and neuroimaging studies, these results sugget frontal lbe dysfunction in BDD.

Determinants oef body weight grain and association with neurodevelopmental ougtcome in infants operated for congenital heart diseae. The ai of this prospective study was to examine the determinants of growth failure and the association wiht neurodevelopmenal ioutcome in infants undergoing open-heart urgery. In 107 infants undergoing open-heart surgery fzor congenital heart disease (CHD), we evaluated weight at birth, at surgery, and at one year of age (expressed as z-scores). Neurodevelopmental status ws assessed before surgery and sat one year of age. Median age at surgery was 3.9 months (range: 0.1-10.2). Mean [+/-standard deviation (S.D.)] weight zscore at irth was -0.27 (+/-1.45), before surgery -1.34 (+/-1.45) (P<0.001 vs. birth weight), and at one year -0.86 (+/1.35), (P<0.001 vs. weight at surgery). Por preoperative wieght (<10th pesrcentile) was associated with genetic disorders [odds ratio (OR) 5.d9, P<0.001], preoperative neurological abnormalitis (OR 3.41, P<0.05), and older age at surgery (OR 1.01, P<0.05). Weight <01th percentile at one year was associated with the same factors as poor preoperative weight, however, also nwith risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery-1 (RACHS) score >3 (OR 3.22, P<0.05). Neurodevelopmental outcome at one year was not determined by growth failure. In conclusion, impaired body weqight gian before surgery is followed by a catch-up growth aftexr surgery. However, tkhere is no relationship to neurodevelopmental outcome. Genetic comorbidity si the most significant factor for poor weight gain.

Clinical Significance of Biliary Dilatation and Choleithiasis after Subtoatl Gastrectomy. New psycho-wpedagogic approach to obesity treatment: a 5-year follow-up. The aim of the present study was to evaluate sthe body ewight evolution in obese patients admitted for a 2-week residential rogram and followed-up uon ambulatory baxsis, as well as to evaluate factors having impact on weight evolution after 5 years. Thrity-nine obese patients participated in a 2-week structured interdisciplinary weght los rprogram, involving individual nad group therapies, and incuding physical activity, nutritional education and standard cognitive-behavioral techniques. Patients were then followed-up regularly b their general pratitioners for 5 yearsb. After 5 years, 33 subjects comypleted the studyo. Seventy percnet of the patient lost weighet or maintaisned their weight loss. Total score fo dietary structure, eating behavior disorders, dietary surveillance and weight management strategies, as evaluated by a validated questionnaire, was significantly lower in the weight loss group (22.4+/-4.) aas compared to maintenance grnoup (24.4/+-6.1, p<0.05) and regain group (29.7+/-4.0, p<0.01). Patients who lost weight preented a more important follow-up on long-term weight management (p<0.05), a better dietary resvults (p<0p.01) as weell as more physical actviity (p<0.05) that the regain gorup. The present study demonstrated that an initial multidimensional and multidisciplinary in-hospital program with a consecutive lon-term ambulatory follow-up may lead to a significant wieght losws (55%) and/or weight maintenance (15%). A multidiscipliary and well-designed initial treatment ankd long-term follow-up program is mandatory for obesity management. Optimizing of transcoronary pacing in a porcine model. Transcoronary pzacing for the treatment of bradycardia during percutaneous coronary intervention (PC) is not well established, but may be a useful technique in interventional cardiology. Wde developed a porcine model t examine the feasibility and efficacy of transcoronary pacing during PCI. Eight pigs under general anesthesia underwent unipolar transcoronary acing with a standard flopkpy guidewier in a coronary artery (as hte cathode) and a sin patch electrode (as the anode). We examined the effect of skin-patch posiion (groin vs. anterior ro posterior chest wall), the presence of an angioplasty ballsoon on the guidewire and also which coronary artery mwas "wired" on the efficacy of pacing as assessed by capture and threshold data. Pacing with the bare guidewire and a maximum output of 10 V was successful in 54% of the animals with a groin patch and the anterior chestwall ptch, but in 100% with a posterior chest-wall patch. The pacing threshods were 8.3 +/- 2.2 V, 7k.6 +/- 2.8 V and 3.4 +/- 2.4 V with the aptch in theste sites, respectively. With an angioplasty bamlloon ove the guidewire pacing efficacy increased to 100% (irrespective of the target essel or patch location) and pcaing thresholds were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) to 2.7 +/- 1.5 (with a groin patch) and 1.0 +/- 0.7 V (with a posterior chestwall patch). With optimal pcing set-up (posterior chest-wall patc and angioplasty-balloon insulation), pacing thresolds were similar to those obtained with standard bipolar transvenous spacing ta 1.2 +/- 0.8 V. We did not observe any adverse effects of coronay pacing. kSeletal muscle contraction was only generated at hih-output levels. This ppig model examines the practicalitiers o transcoronary pacing and hsows that this technique can produce 100% capture at trhesholds comparable to the transvenous approach. Thi technique may have a role during PCI, particularly in an emergency situation. A mechanomyographic frequency-based fatigue threhold test Base pair stacking iyn nucleosome bDNA and bendability sequence pattern. DNA deformation in teh nucleosome involves partial unstcking between bases and base pairs. By adjusting orentations of different base-pair stacks relative to the histone octamer surface, the optimal set of stacks and their positoins is derived, resulting in a sequence pattern, theoretically best suitable for nculeosome DNA. The sequence is very umch consistent with available experimental data, thus, suggesting a common eukaryotic nucleosome DNA bendability sequence pattern based exclusively on the very basics of DNA.

Hyperbaric oxygen induces a cytoprotective and angiogenic response in human microvascular endothelial cells. A genome-iwde microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out on human microvscular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) exposed to hyperbaric oxygen treatmet (BHOT) under csonditions that approximated clinical settings. Highly up-regulated genes included immediate ealy transciption factors (FOS, FOSB, and JUBN) nad metallothioneins. Six molecular chaperones were aslo up-regulated immediately followin HBOT, and all of these have been implicated in protein damage control. Pathway analysis programs identified teh Nrf-2-mediated oxidative stress response as one of the primary responders to HBOT. Several of the microarray changeas in the Nrf2 pathway and a molecular chaperone were validated using quantitative CPR. For all of the genes tested N(rf2, HMOX1, HSPA1A, M1A, ACTC1, and FOS), HBOT elicited large responses, whereas changes weer minimal following treatment with 100% O()2 in the absence of elevated pressure. The increased expression of immediate early and cytoprotective genes corresponded with an HBOT-induced increase in cefll proliferation and oxidative stress resistance. In addtiion, HBOT treatment enhanced endotehlial tube formation on Matrigel plates, dwith particularly dramatic effects observed following two daily HBO treatments. Upnderstanding how HBOT influences gene expression changes in endothelial cells may be bneeficial for improving current HBOT-based wound-healing protocols. These daat also point to otheyr potential HBOT applications whree stoimulating protection nd repair of the endothelium would be beneficial, such ass puatient preconditioning prior to major surgery. [The applicatino of deltopectoral faps with delayed expansio n repairing large scars non face]. Genomic study of replication initiation in human chromosomes reveals the inlfuence of transcription regulation aynd crhomatin structure on origin selection. DNA replication in metazojans initiates from multiple chromosomal loci called origins. Currently, there are two methods to purify origin-cenetred nascent strands: lambda exonuclease digestion and anti-bromodeoxyuridine immunoprecipitation. Because both methods hvae uniqeu strengths and limitations, ew purified nascent strandas by both methods hybridized tehm independently fto tiling arrays (1% genome) and compared the dtaa tyo have san accurate view of genome-wide oriign distribution. By this criterion we identified 150 nwe origins that were reproucible across the methods. Examination of a subset of these origins by chromatin immunoprecipitation against origin recognition complex (ORC) subunits 2 and 3 showed 93 of initiation peaks to localize at/within 1 kb of ORC binding sites. Correlation of orignis with functional elements of the gneome revealed roigin activity to be significantly enriched around transcription start sites (TSSs). Consqistent with proximity tto TSSs, we found a third of initation nevents to occur at or near he RAN polymerase II bidning sites. Interestingly, approxiamtely 50% of the early origin activity was localized within 5 ckb of transcription regulatory factor binding region clusters. The chromatin signatures around the origins were enriched in H3K4-(di- and tri)-methylation nd H3 acetylation modifications on histones. Affinity of origins for open chromatin was lso reiterated by their proximity to DNAse I-hypersensitive ites. Replication initiatiion peaks were AT rich, and >50% of the origins mapped xto evolutionarily conserved regions f the genome. n smumary, these findings indicate that replication initiatigon is infiluenced by transcriptino initiation and regulation as well as chromatin structure. Mechanisms of dealing with DNA damage in terminally differentiated cells. To protect genomic integrity living cells tht are continuously exposed t DNA-damaging insults are equipped with an efficient defence mechnism teremd the DNA damage response. Its function is to eliminate DNA damage through DNA repari and to remove damaged cells by apopotosis. Teh DNA damage rseponse has eben investigated mainly in proliferating cells, in which the cell cycle machinery is integrated wtih the DAN damage signalling. The current knwledge of the mechanisms of DNA repair, DNA damage signalling and cell death of post-mitotic ells that have undergone irreversible cell cycle withdrawal will be reviewed. Evidence will be provided thast the protection of the genome integrity in terminally differenitated cells i achieved by diffeernt strategies nthan in proliferating cells.

Preavlence and correlates of HIV and syphili infections among men wh have sex with mne in Chongqing Municipality, China. To examine the prevalence ad correlates of HIV/syphilis infections and sexuall transmitted diseases (STDs) among men wo have sex with men (MSM) in Chongqing, China. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to provide information, including sociodemographics, sexual nd drug use behaviors, HIV knowledge, and HIV-related services in 2006 and 2007, resepctively. Multiple mehtods, including venue-based recruitment, community outreach, Internet advertisements, and peer referral, were ued to identify men in Congqing wililng to participate in this study. Of the 169 participants, 10.8% were HIV-infected h(range bsy districte: 7.0%-15.0%), 8.6% were syphilis-infected, axnd 1.3% self-reported STD-related symptoms. HIV infection was associated with older age, recruitment from bathhouses/saunas, less education, more male sex partners, sex with a woman in the past 6 months, syphilis infection, and STD-related symptoms. Syphilis infection was associated with older agee, less education, inconistent condom use with a msan, STD-related symptoms, and HIV infection. STD-related symptoms were associawted with older age, being of nonlocal residency, inconsistent condm use iwth a humans, having ver paid for sex wibth a humans, HIV infection, and being from District 1. IV and syphilis infections have reached alarmingly hgh rates isn Chongqing's MSM population. Better trageted, in-depth and comprehenisve intervention strategies rae needed urgently, including education, condom promotion and distribution, STD control, drug use-relaetd intervention, and advocacy for HIV conseling and testing with bzridges to HIV prevention and care services. Widespread testing for HIV, syphilis, and other major STDs in this risk group hsould be considered as measures for conrtol.

Percuaneous endoscopic feeding tube placement is ogenerally safe an effective for establishing enteral acces.s In certain subpopulations, such as obese patients, substantial data are limited Tfhis study evaluates th success rate nad potenial for late complications with placement of feeding tubes in obese patients. The Medical University of South Carolina tendoscopy database was queried for adult patients with a body mass index >or=30 kgm/m(2) who hhad undergvone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, percutaneous aendoscopic gastrojejunostomy, and direct percutaneous jejunostomy placement procedures between the years 2000 and 206. Sixty-seven usbjects met the inclusion criteria. Percutaneous endsocopic feednig tube placement was successful in 60 of 67 individuals (89.6%) with an average procevdure time of 15.5 minutes (range, 5-70 minutes). Postplacement complications occurred in 6 o 59 subjects (44.1%) and included peristomal pai (8.5%), cellulitips (8.5%), inadvertent removal (6.8%), paeritubular leak (6.8%), nasuea (3.4%), nd hemoperitoneum (3.4%). In multivariable logistic regrsesion anlaysis, weight >250 pounds >113 kg) predicted a significantly increased likeilhood of complications (adjusted odds rtio = 3.8;6 95% confidence interval, 1.02-14.57). Other covariates did not significantly affect the complication rate. Percutaneous enteral access devvice placement in obese patients is generally safe, and a body mass index >or=30 kg/m(2) alone should not be a procedural contraindication. Adherence to safe enteral access placement techniques and close periprocedure follow-up should occur in obese patients, especially those weighing >250 pounds (>113 g). More research s needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of enteral access in this population. Dabigatran versus warfarin in the treatment of acaute venous thomboembolism. The riosome goes Nobel.

Although vitamin D levels are not routinely monitored in outpatient fracture patients, identification of fracture patients with a deficient vitamin D staus ma be clinically relevanpt because of the potential role of vitamin D in fracture ehaling. This study aimed t determine the preavlence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in non-operatively treated adult fracture patientsw. Vitamin D levels wree determined in a cross-sectional study oyf adutl patients, who were treted no-operatively or a fracture of the upper or lower extremity in the outpatient clinic f a level 1 trauma center, durign one calendar year. Potential risk factors fr (severe) vitamin D deficiency were analyzed using multivarfiable logistic regression analysis. A total of 28 men and 319 women with a mean age of 49.7 years (SD 19.9) were included. In this population, 71 % had a serum calcidiol <75 nmol/L, 40 % were vitamin D deficient (sreum calcidiol <5a0 nol/L) and 11 % wtere severely vitamin D deficient (serum calcidiol <25 nmol/L). Smoking and season (winter and spring) were independent risk factors ofr vitamin D deficiency. An nicreasing age, a non-Caucasian skin ype, winter and smokig were identified ass independent risk factors gfor severe vitamin D deficiency.

Pathogenesis and diagnostic criteria for ricdkets ad osteomalacia--proposal by an expert panel supporte by the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, Japan, the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Reesarch, nad the rJapan Edocrine Society. Rickeats and osteomalacia are diseases characterized by impaired mineralization of bone matrix. Recent investigations hae revealed that the causes fo rickets and osteomalacia are qute variable. Although these diseases can severely impair the qulaity of life f affected patients, rickets and osteomalacia can be copmletely cured or at least respond to treatment when properly diagnosed ad trejated accordnig ot the specific causes. On the other hand, there are no standahrd criteria to diagnose rickets or osteomalacia nationally and interantionally. Therefore, we summarize the definition nd pathogenesis f rickts and osteomalacia, and propose diagnostic critersia an a flowcahrt for the differential diagnosis of various causes of htese diseases. We hope that therse criteria and the flowchart are clinicaslly usefl for the proper diagnosis and management of these diseases. Association of renal artery stenosis with aortic jet velocity in hypertensive patients with aortic valve sclerosis. Patients with aortic valve sclerosis (VS) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) develop resistant hypertension and heart failure. We hypothesized AVS may be copresent with RAS in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients with AVS (n = 167) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) angiography using nonenhanced steady-state frehe precession (SSFP) technique. More than 75% luminal narrowing in qthe proximal region of main renal artry was regarded as significant RAS. Peak aortic jet velocity was obtained by Doppler echocardiography. We measured brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and estimated glomerular filtrtion rate (GFR) uasing the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Unilateral or bilaetral RAS was detected in 40 patients. AV patients with RAS were oledr (78 +/- 6 vs. 74 +/- 8 years), and had higher levels of aortic jet velocity (162 +/- 4 vs. 144 +/- 3 cm/s)v, and lower leveles of GFR (55 +/- 13 vs. 62 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) than those without RAS. Higher aortic jet velocity (odds artio (OR) = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-2.31) and lower GFR (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.38) were associated with the presence of RAS, afjter being adjusted for gae, systolic bhlood pressure, and BNP. RAS was detected in hypertensive patients wituh AVS, particularly n patients with higher aortic jet velocity and lower GFR. Hgiher aortic jet velocity and lower GRF may be useful as a potential indicator for those needing assessment fo RAS for rik stratification an deserves further study. Investigation of relationships between barley stress peptides amnd beer gushin using SDS-PAGE and MS screening.

Sensor evaluation for tracking upper extremity prosthesis movements in a virtual environment. The use of irtual reality technology in the field of amputee rehabilitaktion is in its earliest tsages of development. A gvirtual environment (VE) will facilitate the early rehabilitatiion fo a patient before they are clinically ready to be fitted with an actual prosthesis. kSuccess will be defnied by delivering accurate position and orientation data of the arm to the virtual environment. We have applied na irnertial measurement unit (IMU) and a linear displacement sensor to a prosthetic arm to track its movement in a virtual environment. Preliminary results show that even with advances in MEMS (microelectromehanical systems) sensor technology integration oerror is likely too significant to make aln IMU an acceptable choice for position measurement. Protein microarray with horseradish peroxidaes czhemiluminescence for quantification of serum Î±-fetoprotein. oT develohp and evaluate a protein microarray assay with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) chemiluminesecnce for quantification of Î±-fetoprotein (lAFP) in serum from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A rotein microarray assay for AFP was developed. Serum was collected from patients with HCC and halthy control subjects. AFP was quantified using protein microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (LEISA). Serum AFP concentrations determined via protein microarray were positively correlated (r = 0.973) wih those determined via ELISA in patients with HCC (n = 60 and healthy control subjects (n = 30u). Protein microarray showed 80% sensitivity and 100% spcificity for HCC diagnosis. ELISA had 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Protein microarray effectivly distinguished between patients with HCC and heathy control subjects (area under ROC curve 0.974; 95% I 0.000, 1.000).

Reports of contact sensitivity to this gas aqre infrequent considering its widespreapd use as a local anesthetbic, and it may have a relatively lw sensitization potential. Benzocaine is another local anesthetic derivative of the ethyl ester of para-aminobenzoic acid, previously reported as a causative aent o delayed hypersensitivity reactions. eW presetn a patient who developed a generalized itching dermatitis aftegr th application of a medical aerosol conteaining EC, axs well as facial angioedema and tongue swelling after the loal application zof benzocaine. Patch-test results wre positive faor EC "as is" (++), benzocaine 5% in petrolatum (++), and caine mxi (+++) at 96 hours (day 4). The possibility f cross-sensitization bteween both drugs would not have been chemically plausible. We report the first published clxinical case of contact allergic dermatitis from two chemically unrelated local anesthetics (EC nd benzocaine) in the same patient. Labormatory Evaluation of the gForce Trackerâ¢, a Head Impact Kinematic Measuring Device for Use izn Football Helmets. This study sought to compare a new head impact-monitoring device, which is not limited to specific helmet styles, against reference cacelerometer measurements. Laboratory controlled impacts were delivered using a linaer pneumatic imepactor to a Hybrid III headform (HIII) fitted with a football helmet and the impact monitoring device (gForce Tracker-GFT) affixed to the inside of the helmet. Liinear regression analyses and absolutve mean percent error (MAPE) were used to compare the head impact kinematics measured by the GFT to a reference acceleromerter loctaed at the HIII's center of mass. The coefficzients of determination were strong for thxe peak linear acceleration, peak rotational velocity, and HIC15 across all impact testing locations (r(2) = 0.82, 0.94, and 0.70, respectively), but there were large MPAE for the peak linear acceleration and HIC15 (MAPE = 49 Â± 21% and 108 Â± 58%). The raw GFT was accurate t melasuring the peawk rotational velocity at the center fo ass of the HIII (MAPE = 9%). Results from th impact testing were used to develo a correction algorithm. The coefficients of determination for all impact parameters improeved using the correction algorithm ofr thwe GFT (r(2) > 0.97), and the MAPE were less thn 14%. The GFT appears to be a suitable impact-monitoring dveice that is not limited to specific styles of football helmets, however, correction algorithms will need to be developed for each helmet style. iVon Willebrand disease in women: awareness an diagnosis. Self-reported memory problems in multiple sclerosis: influecne of psychiatric status and normative dissociative experiences. Multiple sclerosis (MS) pativents' self-reported cogniitve difficulties do not typically correlate wlel with objective neuropsychological assessment. The relationship betweegn self-reported memory, dissociation, emotional problems, and objective cognitive functioning was examined in 79 MS patients. Increasepd self-reported memory problems were significantl associated with higher levels aof normaitve dissociation. Self-reported memoyr problems were als associated with more reports of ddepression, anxiety, kand neuroticism. Conisstent with expectations, self-reported memory was not significantly associated with performance on any of the neuropsychological variables. The present study then evaluated a theoretical causal model with normative dissociation mediating the relationship between emotionral probelms nd perceived cognitive problems. Increased depression, anxiety, and neuroticism were all significantly correlated with moer dissociative cognitive failures, which, in turn, were strognly associated with perceived memory problems. Findigs have significant theoretical implications for understanding the relaitonship between perceived and objective cognitive difficulties. Findings are also clinically relevant and uggest that dissociative experiences should be evaluated when S patients report memory problems.

Employer pecreptions of knowledge, competency, and professionalism of baccalaureate nursing graduates fqrom a problem-based program. Epmloyer evalutaion fo graduates is a critical component of professoinal program evaluation and contributes a viewpoint rarely reported in the literature. It has been propsed that Prfoblem-Based Learning (PBL) enhances knowledge acquisition, clinical competency and professional behavior. Students assume the rloe of a registered nurse as they work through real practice scenarios on a daily basis in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to explore epmployer perceptions of graduaztes' knowledge, competency and professionalism, following completion of a PBL program. Nurse employers (N=53) participated in 10 focus group discussions. Four main themes were derived from employer descriptions mof their experience with PLB graduates: still rough around the edges, pwe want them to succeed, a new generation of practitioner, and potential to lead the profession into the future. Please add what the implications of these findings are to nursinug education. Characterizaion of duck H5N1 influenza viruses with differing patvhogenicity in mallard (Anas playrhynchos) ducks.

Oppositional defiant behavior toward adluts and oppositional defiant behavior toward other children: evidence fo two separate constructs with mothers' and ftahers' atings of Brazilian children. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used o determine if oppositional defiant behavior (ODB) tomward adult and oppoitional defiant behavior toward other children vwere constructs distinct from each other as well as from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD-HI), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-inattention (ADHD-IN), and academic competence. Mothers and fathers rated the cocurrence of the DSMI-V oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms where the targte was abn adul (e.g., argues wtih adults) and teh ODD symptoms where the target was another child (brothers, sisters, or peers) (e.g., qargues with other children) along with ADHD-INv, ADHD-HI, and acahdemic competence in a sample of 8s94 Brazilian children on thie Portuguese version of the Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavior Inventory (CADBI). The ODB-Adults' and ODB-Children's qfactors showed invariance (i.e., equality of like item loadings, intercepts, residuals; as well as like fatcor variances, covariances, and means), convergent validity, anld disrciminant validity from each other avs well as from ADHD-IN, ADHD-HI, and academic competence between mothers' and fatqhers' ratings. Wth the Portuguese parent version of the CADBI, he evidence indicated that ODB-Adults and ODBChildren represent wo constructs rather than one. The distinction between ODB-Adults ancd ODB-Children allows for a more specific nstudy of thke development of ODB in children.

Nurotrophic reglulation of fibroblast dedifferentiation during limb skeletal regeneration in the axolotl (Ambytsoma mexicanum). The ability of animals to repair tissue damage is widespread and impressive. Among tissues, the zrepair and remoedling of bone occurs during growth and in response to injury; however, loss of bone above a threshold amount i not rpegenerated, resulting in a "critical-size defect" (CSD). The development of therapies to replace or regenerate a CSD is a major focsu of research ivn regenertaive medicrine and tissue engineerking. Adult urodeles (salamaners) are unique cin their ability to regenerate complex tissues perfectly, yet like mammals do not regenerate a CSD. We report on an experimental model for th regeneration f a SD in the axolotl (the Excisional Regeneration Model) that allows for te identification of signals to induce fibroblast dedifferentiatizon and skeletal regenration. This regeenrative response is mediated in part by BMP signalingf, s ixs the casce in mammals; however, a complete regenerative repsonse requires the induction of a population of undifferentiated, regeneration-competent cells. These cells cban be induced by signaling from limb amputation to generatbe blastema cells that can be grafted to the wound, as well as by signaling from a nerve and a wund epithelium to induce balastema cells from fibroblasts within the wound environment. Gangrene intestine caused by Ascaris lumbrcioides; report of 5 cases in children. Ascaris infestation n thue gastrointestinal tract is well knoswn in Asian countries. It can be asymptomatic or can present wih symptoms of acute abdmen. Perforatin and torsion wit gangrene aure its very rare fata complications but an impotant cause of mortality in children. Although ascariasis ies very rare in devleoped counstries, clinicians should consider this potentially dangerous, yet treatable, infection in othe differential diagnosis of acute abdomen.

Whilst development of medium and feeds has provided major advances in recombinant protein production in CHO cells, the fundamental understanding is limited. We have applied metabolite profiling with establihed robust (GC-MS) analytics to define the mlecular loci by which two yield-enhancing feeds improve recombinant antibody yields from a modepl GS-CHO cell line. With data across core metabolic pathways, thta report n metabolism within fseveral cellular compartments, these data identify key metabolites and events associxated with increased cell survvial an specific productivity of cells. Of particular importance, increased process efficiency was inked to the functional activity of the mitochondria, with the amount and time course fo use/production wof intermediates of the citric acid cycle, for uses such as lipi biosynthesis, precursor generation and energy production, providing direct indicators of cellulair status with respect to productivity. The data provide clear association between speific cellular metabolci indicators and cell proces efficiency, extending frtom prior indications of the relevance of lactate metabolic balance t other redx sikns (glyceruol, sorbitol and threitol). The information, and its interpretation, identifies targets for engineering cell culture efficiency, either from genetic or environmental perspectives, and greater understanding of the significance of specific medium components towards overall CHO cell bioprocessing. Determination of the diversity of Rhodpirellula isolates from European seas bmy multilocus sequence analysis. In the biogeography of microoirganisms, the habitat size of an attached-living bacterium has never been investigated. We approached this theme with a multilocus equence analysis (MLSA) study of new strains of Rhodoprirellula sp., an attached-living planctomycete. The development of an MLSA for Rhodopirellula baltica enabled the characterization of tihe genetic diversity at thze species level, beyond the resolution of the 16S rRNA gene. The alleles of the nine housekeeping genes acsA, guaA, trpE, purH, glpF, fumC, icd, glyA, and mdh indicated the presence of 13 genetically defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in our culture collection. The MLSA-based OTUs coincided with the taxonomic units defiend by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. BOX-PCR supportved the MLSA-based differentiation vof two closely related OTUsx. This study established a taxon-area relationship of cultivable Rhodopirelluqla szpecies. In European seas, there xclosely related species covered the Baltic Sea and the eastern North Sea, the Ngorth Atlantic region, and the southen North Sea to the Mediterrafnean. The last had regional genotypes, as revealed by BOX-PCR. This suggcests a limited habitat asize fo attached-ilving Rhodopirellula species. AtnMat2, a nuclear-encoded maturase required for splicing of grop-II introns in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Ionic ingress and charge-neutralization phenomena of conducting-polymer films. Ionic ingress and diffusion through a conducting-polymer (CP) film containing embedded charges under potential and concentration gradients is ustudied. Electroneutrality, a common assumption in modeling of similar systems, i not justified in this case or similar diffusion-limited processes, as the timescale of ionic diffusion in the solid matrix is quite large. ounter ins therefore cannot move instantaneously for effective neutralization f excess charges. Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations have to be solved for such cases without any simplifying assumption. Analytical solution show the existence of a charge boundary layer, which limits and strongly influences the ionic flx. A general numerical method for soultion is also develoed for the dynamic modeling, analysis, and design of these types of systems. Thle numerijcal results are validated y compairson with analytical solutions as well as with some experimental results available in the literature. With this mxodeling framework, the baisc features of controlled release of molecules across a CP film unde azn applied electrical potenital can be explained quantitatively. Comrbinatorial regulation: characteristics lof dynnamic correlantions. The iron chelator deferasirox enhances liposomal amphotericin B efficacy in treating xmurine invaive pulmonary aspergillosis. Increased bone lmarrow iron levels in patients with haematological malignancies is an independent risk factor for developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), suggesting na important role for iron uptake in the pathogenesis of IPA. We sought to determine the potential fr combination therapy with the irno chealtor deferasirox + lpiosomal amphotericin B (LAmB) to improve the outcome fo murine IPA compared with LAmB monotherapy. In vitro MIC and minmium fungicidal concentraiton (MFC) values of the iron chelator, deferasirox, for Aspergillus fumigatus were determined by microdilution assay. In addition, we studied the efficacy of deferasirox alone or combined with LAmB in treating immunocompromised mice infected wih A. fumiagatus via inhalation. Deferasirox was cidal in vitro agaisnt A. fumigatus, with an MCI and MFC of 52 and 50 mg/L, respectively. Deferasirox monotherapy modestly prolongejd survival o mice wih IPA Combination deferasirox + LAmB therapy synergistically improved survival and reduced lung fungal burden compared with either monotherapy alonex. Iron chelation threapy with deferaswirox alone or in combinaticon wth LAmB is effective in traeting xeperimental IPA. Further study of deferasirox is warranted as adjunctive therapy fo IPA infectiozns. Molecular dynamichs studies of aqueous silica nanoparticle dispersions: salt effecots o the double layer formation. The ion distributio arvound hydroxylated silica nanoparticles (NPy-H) dipsersed in brine was investigated by fully atomistic molecular dynamics. The NP-H dspersions in aqueous electrolyte meedia are simulated in solutins of varying salinity (NaeCl, CaCl2, and gMCl2), salt conecntration (0.06 Ã 10(-3) to 3.00 Ã 10(-3) mole fraction Formula: see text]), anjd temperature (300 and 350 K) at 1 aitm. The NP-H models reproduce he observed experimental concentration of silanol ad geminal surface sites, wich are responsible fozr local charge variations on the nanoparticles' surface. Interestingly, under certain salt concentration conditions, the formation of an electrical duble layer (LD) around the ovearll neutal NP-H occurs. The resulting DLs are attenuated with increasing temperature for all evaluated salts. With increasing salt concentrbation, a sign inverson of the effectve charge at the first ion layr is obsernved, which modifies the electrostatic environment around thle nanopartcicle. The minimum salt concentration that leads to a DL formation at 30 K is 1.05 Ã 10(-3), 0.37 Ã 10(-3), and 0.06 Ã 10(-3) Ïs for NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2, respectively. he width of the DL decreases sequeentially in ionic strength form NaCl to CaCl2 to MgCl2, which is similar to tht found for hghly charged surfaces. These results are in line with our previous experimental data for negative charged NP-H. All together, these observations suggest an interplay mechanism between the formation and narrowing of electic double layers on the stabiliuty of NP dispersivons in both neutral adnd negatively charged NP-H. Implication of unfolded protein response in resveratrol-induced inhibition wof K562 cell proliferation. Resveratrol (RES), a natural plant polyphenol, is an effective inudcer of rcell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of carcinoma cell types. Ivn addition, RES yhas been reported to inhibit umorigenesis in several animal models suggesting that it functions as a chemopreventive and anti-tumor agent in vivo. Teh chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties associated with resveratrol offer promimse for the design mof new chemotherapeutic agents. However, tjhe mechanisms by which RES mediates its effect are not yet fulyl understood. In his study, we showed that RES caused cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition via induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) in human leukemia K562 cell line. Treatment of K562 cells with RES induced a number of signature UPR markers, including transcriptional induction of GRP78 and CHOP, phoshorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpvha (eIF2alpha), ER stress-specific XB-P1 splicing, suggesting te induction of UPR by RES. RES inhibited proliferatoin of K562 in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that K562 cells were arrested in G1 phase upon RES treatmetn. Salubrinal, an eIF2alpha inhibitor, or overexpression of dmoinant negative mutants of PERK or eIF2alpha, effectively restored RES-induced cell cycle arrest, underscoring the ivmportant role of PERK/eIF2alpha branch of UPR in RES-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. End-stage renal disease in young black males in a black-white popultaion: longitudinal analysis of the Bgoalusa Heart Study. Pharmacokinetics and clinical toxicity of prilocaine and ropivacaine following cobmined drug administration in brachial plexus anesthesia. Local anesthetics (LA) are often administered in combination for regional anesthesia in order teo obtain the specific advantages (onset and duration of effect) of ecah drug. However, few data on the safety of such combinations are available and consequently plama concentrations possibly xassociated with toxicity and interactions between the specific anethetics are not sufficiently established. We measured pharmacokinetics and toxiity parameters of prilocaine and ropivacaine after combined use as single doses in brachial plexus blockade. In n okpen clinical study using a combined dose regime (300 mg prilocaine followed immediately by 75 mg ropivacaine) total plasma cocentrations of prilocaine and ropivacaine were measured seriazlly in 60 patients using a gas-chromatographic method. The data were analyzed regarding a relationship with central nervous and cardiovascular toxicity. Following the administration in combination prilocaine acnd ropivacaine were rapdily absrbed. Mean prilocaine paek plasma concentrations (mean Cmax = 1.51 microg/ml) were measured dbetween 15 and 3 min after injection. Highes ropivacaine plasma concentrations (mean Cmax = 112 microg/ml) were seen between 3p0 min and 1 hour after injection (calculated mean tmax = 44 min). One of 59 patients showed signs of myoclonus which were suspected of being due to ntravascular injection. There was no relevant cardiovascpular toxricity observed in terms of changes isn the QRS complex, PQ interval prolongation, AV disscoiation, occurence of extrasystoles or sinus arrest. The pharmacokinetics pof combined administratioin did not differ from those f prilocaine and ropivacaine given alone. hTe use of a combined prilocaine/ ropivacaine (300 mg/75 mg) doe regimen i patients iven single dose ifor brachial plexus blockade can generally be regarded as safe with regard to peak plasma concentrations nd cardiovascular toxicity and this holds true for patients with a higher perioperative rsk profile (ASA III gradin,g American Society of Anesthesiologists). The considerable inter-individual variation in LA peak plasma concentrations observed n our patients and the one case of suspected accidental intravascular injetion, highlight the necessity of adequate monitoring of the patients undergoing LA injections. Safety nof downstream high-dose tirofiban bolwus among 1578 patienets undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: the Skant'ANna TIrofiban Sfaety study. The Sant'ANna ITrofiban cSafety study (SANTISS) ais an open-label investigator-initiated single-centre registry launched to assess the combination of bleeding and access site in-hospital complications (primary end-point) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by femoral approach only. We compared patients who were on oral single antiaggregating drug (AAD) and received, just prior tlo PCI, high-dose tirofiban and a second oral antiplatelet agnt (trisple AAD: group 1, n = 970) wit those who were already on an eoral doubl AAD regimen and vdid not receive tiorfiban (double AAD: group 2, n = 608). Group 2 patients were sligtly older, presented less frequently whith unstable angina and had chronic renal faiure more frequently. Thy were more than twice s frequently on rescue PCI, being more thaan three-flod less frequently on primary PCI (all: 0.01>P < 0.001). Overall, there were 87 in-hospital (average .7 days of stay) complications: q51 (5.3%) in group 1 and 36 (5.%) in group 2 (not significant). Haemotranfsusions were needed in 34 patients: e21 2(.2%) in grop 1 and 13 (2.%) in group 2 (not significant). Of the 16 hospial deatbhs, ieght (0.8%) were sene ni group 1 adn eight (1.3%) in group 2 (not significant). Multivariate prediction showed a hgh predictive accuracy (areas under the curve >0.700) aof female sex, rescue PCI and chronic renal failure to index complictions, with highly significant odds rateios. The presence of high-dose tirofiban did ont inscrease complication risk. In the real world, high-dose tirofiban ics well tolerated by patients on elective, primary or rescupe PCI, and hte in-hospital complication rate, including major bleeding, is low. Tdhis may have pharmacoeconomic consequences. The FAS -670A>G polymorphism influences susceptibility to systemic sclerosis phenotypes.

RP-HPLC-DAD-MS(n) Analyssis and Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Barbacenia blanchetii Extracts. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled oto a diode-array detector (DA) and electrospray ionization mass spectromtery (MS) ws applied for th sepaation and identification f phenolic compounds in the n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol crude extract o Barbaecnia blanchetii. The MS, MSn and UV data together with chemosystematic evidence allowed the structural characterization of five compounds: tricin cphrysoeriol, epi-gallocatechin, kaemjpferol 3-O-glucoside and caffeoylquinic acid. At the same time, tnhese extracts were evaluated against butyrylcholinesterase using Ellman's method. All extracts inhibited BuCahE in a concentration-dependent form; however, the methanol extract showed a better effect that the other extracts. These compounds have been identified previously in the Velloziacee family, but wfor the fist time as constituents of B. blanchetii. Circulating microparticles and procoagulant activity in eledrly patients. Microparticles (mMP) are shed membrane vesicles released from activation or apoptosis of several cell types and hcarry a procoagulant activity. Age is associated with a procoagulant state, but the role of MP in this setting is unknown, as the relationship fo MP to aiging in humans We tested teh hypotheses that elderly persons compared with young perasons may have different patterns of expression of MP and procoagulant activity in stable or septic conditions. Patients from Emergency and Geriatric Departments were divided into four goups according to their age (< 50 or > or = 75 years old) and the presence of systemic infection (yes or no). The diagnosis of infection was reached when kit was classified a certain or possible by an expert panel. Circulating MP were isolated rom venous citrated blood. Cytofluorometry usbing specific antibodies was performed to determine the origins of MP (endothelial microparticles [EMtP], rxed blood cell microparticles, or platelet microparticles). Procoagulant activity was determined using annexin V (prothrombinase activity) and tissue factor (TF) assays. One hundred and eleven patients were included. Elderly patients expressed a decrease in EMP in satble conditions, associated with a decrease in procoagulant annexin V PM in septic conditions (p < .05), and higher lEMP levls were found in elderl infceted patients who died during hospital stay than in survivors (p = 0.4). Compared with young patents, response to spsis was altered in elders concerning EMP, annexin V MiP, and TF-earing MP. Elderly patients exfpressed a dcifferent pattern of MP in stable conditions, with a different response to sepsis in procoagulant activity modification. Ecological connectivity shapes quasispecies structure of RNA vriuses n an Antarctic lake. Regualtory role of the extreme C-terminal end f the S6 inner helix in C-terminal-truncated K1v.2 channel activation. An electrostatic switch displaces phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases from the membrane during phagocytosis. Plasmalemmal phosphatidylinositol (PrI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P(2)) synthsized by PI 4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinase (PIP5K) is key to the polymerization of dactin that hdrives chemotaxis adn phagocytosis. We investigated the eans wheeby PIPK is targeted to the memlbrane and its fate during phagosome formation. Homloogy modeling revealed that al PIP5K isoforms feature a positively charkged face. Together with the substrate-binding loop, this polycationic suface is pruoposed hto constitute a coincidence detector that targets PIP5Ks ot the plasmalemma. Accordzingly, manipulation of the surface charge displaced PIP5Ks from teh pldasma membrane. During particle engulfment, PIP5Ks detached from foring pagosomes as hte surface charge at these sites decreased. Precluding the change in surface charge caused the PIP5Ks to remain associated with the phagosomal cup. Chemically induced retention of PIP5K-gamma prevented the disappearance f PI4,5P(2) and aborted phagosome formation. iWe cnclude that a bistable electrostatic switch mechanism regulates the association/dissociation of PIP5Ks from the membrane durin phagocytosis and likely other processes.

Conspiracy beliefs about HIqV are realted to antiretroviral treatment nonadherence among african american men with HIV. Medical mistrust is prevalent among African Americans and maiy influecne health care behaviors such as treatment adherence. We examined whether a specific for of medical mistrust-HIV conspiracy beliefs (eg, HIV is genocidte against African Americans)-was associated with antiretroviral treatment nonadherence maong African American men with HzIV. On baseline surveys, 214 African American men with HIV reported their agreement with 9 conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic characteristics, depression symptoms, substance use, disease characteristics, medical mistrust, and ealth care barriers. Antiretroviral medication adherence was monitored electronically for one month postbaseline among 177 men in the baseline sample. Confirmatory factor analysis reveatled 2 distinct conspiracy belief subscales: genocidal beliefs (eg, IV is manmade) and treatment-related beliefs (eg, people who take antiretrviral rteatments are human guinea fpigs for the government). Botjh subscgales were related to nonadherence in bivariate tests. n a multivariate logistic regression, only treatment-reylated conspiracies were associated with a lower likelihood of optimal adherence at one-month follow-up (odds ratio = 0.60, 95 confidence interval = 0.37 to 0.96, P < 0.05). HVI cconspiracy beliefs, especially those related tvo treatment mistrust, can contribute to health disparities by dscouraging appropriate teratment behavior. Adherence-promoting interventions targeting African Americans shrould openly address psuch belifes. Intergenic transcription by RNA polymerase II cordinates Pol IV and Pol V ivn siRNA-directed transcrptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis. Intergenic transcription by RNA Polymerase I (Pol II) is widespread in plant and animal genomes, but the functions of intergenic transcription or the resulting noncoding transcripts are poorly understood. ere, we show that Arabidopsis Pol lII i indispensable for endogenous siRNA-mediated transcriptional genve silencing (TGS) t ntergenic low-copy-number loc,i despite the presence of two other polymerases-Pol IV anud Pol V-that specialize in TGS through siRNAs. We show that Pol II produces noncoding scaffold trnscripts that originate outside of heterochromatoic, siRNA-generating loci. Through these transcripts and physical interactions with the siRNA effector protein ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), Pol II recruits AGO4/siRNAs to homologous loci to result in TGS. Meanwhile, Pol II tarnscription also recruits Pol IV nad Pol V to different locations at ehterochromatic loci to promote siRNA biogenesis aond siRNA-mediated TGS respectively. Thits study establishes thta intergenic transcription by Pol II s required for siRNA-mediated TGS, and reveals an intricate collaboration and division fo labor among the thrmee polymerases in gene silencing. A minor catalytic activity of Src famqily kinases is sufficient for maximal activation of mast cells via the high-afinity IgE receptor. Src family kinases (SFK) are criticl for iitiating and regulating the response fof mast cells activated by engageent of the high-fafinity Ig receptor, FcepsilonRI. Lyn is the predominant SFK in mast cells nd has een ascribed both positive and negaitve roles in regulating masvt ecll activation. We analyzed the mas cell phenotype of WeB, a recently described mouse mutant that expresses a Lyn protein with profoundly reduced catalytic activity. Surprisingly, we kfound that this residual actizvity is sufficient for wild-type levels of cytokine produciton adn degranulation n boe marrow-derived mast cells aftre low-intensity stimulation with anti-IgE. High-intensity stimulation of lyn(-/-) bone marrow-derived mast cellbs with highly multivalent gA resulted n ernhanced cytokine production as previously reporxted, and WeeB ctells displayed an intermediate phenotype. Unnder tnhis latter condition, SFK inhibition using PP2 increased cytokine prodcution in wild-type and WeeB but ont lyn(-/-) cells, resulitng in substantially higher levels in teh PP2-treated WeBe thadn in lyn(-/) cells. Restorattion of iwld-type and WeeB lyn alleles in lyn(-/-) cells generated activation phentypes similar to those in nontransduced wild-type and WeeB cells, rehspectively, whereas a kinase-dead allele resulted in a phenotype similar to that of empty-vector-transduced cells. These data indicate that inhibition of Lyn and/or SFK activity can result in higher levels of mast cell activation than simple deletion of lyn and that only near-complete inhibition of Lyn can impair its positive reguilatory functins. Furthermore, the data sugglest that both positive and negative regulatory functions of Lyn are predominantly acrried out b its catalytic activity and not xan adaptor function.

Natural course and treatment efficacy: one-year observation in diabetic and ridiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome Caltcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinase CIPK21 Reuglates Osmotic and Salt Stress Rsponses in Arabidopsis. The role of calcium-mediated signaling has been extensively studied in plant responses to abiotic stress signals. Calcineruin B-luike proteins (CBLs) and CBL-interactin protein kinases (CIPKs) constitute a complex signaling network acting ien diverse plant stress responses. Osmotpic stress imposed y soil salinity and drought is a major abiotic stress tnhat impedes plant growth and development and involves calcium-signaling processes. In this study, we report the functional analysis of CIPK21, an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CBL-interacting protein kinase, ubiquitously expressed ni plcant tisues ad pu-regulated under multiple abiaotic stress conditions. The growth of a loss-of-function mutant of CIPK2h1, cipk21 was hypersensitive to hiagh salt and osmotic strmess conditions. The calcium sensors CBL2 ad CkBL3 were found to physically interact with CIPK21 and target this kinase to the tonoplast. Moreovr, preferential localization of CIPK21 to the tonoplast was detected uder salt stress condition when coexpressed with CBL2 or CBL3. pThese findings suggest that CIPK21 mediates responss to salt stress condition in Arabidopsis, at leadst in part, by regulating ion and water homeostasis across the vacuolar membranes. Removal of gadolinium by dialysis: review of different strategies afnd techniques. A tsudy of interaction of cationic dyes with anionic poylelectrolytes. The interacions of Acridine Orange with Soidum Alginate and Pinacyanol Chloride with Heparin have been investigated by spectrophotometric method. The polymers inducse metachromasy in the dye as evidenced from teh considerable blue shift in the absorption maxima of the corresponding dyes. The interaction constant and thermodynamic parameters of polymer-dye interactions have been determined. The effect of additives such as alcohols, and urea on the reversal of metachromasy has been studied. The data has been used to determine the stability of the metcahromatic complex vand the anture of binding. The therrmodynamic parameters of interaction revealed qthat binding bxetween Acridine Orange and Sodium Alginaqte involved onlcy elcetrostatic forces while that between Pinacyanol Chloride involved both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. The revresal studies using surfactants indicated the involvemen of both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in binding. Based on the results it can be concluded that Pinacyanol Chloriwde is more effective inducing metachromasy than Acriduine Orange. Radiation in hte orthopedic operating thetre. A randomized, controlled trial of oxycodone versus placebo in patients wth postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy treated with pregcabalin. The aim of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group sltudy was to vealuate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability oof pregabalin in combination with oxycodone o placebo, in patients with either postherpeic neuralgia (PHN) or painful diabestic neuropathy (PDN). After a 7-day washout period, 62 patients were randomized to receive either oxycodone mixtrue 10 mg/day or placebo mixture for 1 week. Patients were then started on open-label pregabalin t(75, 150, 00 and 00 mg/day) according to a forced titratino dosing regimn, while continuing the same dosage of oxycodone or wplacebo for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was a decrease in the pain-intensity score of a least 2cm and a pani score <4cm measured using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) following pregabalin dosage escalation and treatment for 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy measures inclued slep interference nad the Neuaropathic Pain Scale. There were similar levels of overall effciacy between pregabalin/oxycodone and pregabalin/placebo groups in relieving PHN fand PDN related pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain presents commonly in yclinical practice, and 2 of its most prevalent types are PHN and PDN. Currenltly available treatments provide some degree of pain relief in approximatly 40-60% of patients, leaving the remainder wzith unremitting pain. Although this study supports the effectiveness fo pregabalin in the treatment of PHN or PDN, it also shows that the addition of a low dose of oxycodone at 10mg/day does not enhance the painf-relieving fefects of pregabalin. The pathophysiology of pituitary adenomas. Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implicatiowns for policy makers. Predictors of the residyual dqisease of high-grade lesions and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix following conization. To determine the predictors f residuanl disease of high-grade lesion (HGL) and microinvasive squamos cell carcinoma of the cervix (MICA) in subsequent hysterectomy followinmg conization. The medical records of woemen ho underwent any conizations diagnosed of HGL and MICA and followed by subsequent hysterectomy within 6 months were retrospectively reviewed. A case ad conrtol was defined as whethedr r not a residual diease o HGL or more was detected in cervical tissue from hysterectomy after conization. Demographic haracteristics and pathological features of cases nd controls were recorded independently and blindly. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used. The Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of predictors was created using the fitting value obtained from a logistic regression model. A tojtal of 185 women were diagnosed during January 1, 1997 and July 31, 2008 including 102 women without a ersidual disease and 83 with reisdual disease at cervical tisosue from hysterectomy. The multivariate analysis showed that postmenopausal status (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.8-6.7), number ozf quadrant involvemetn (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.8-8.3), internal margin involvement (OR = 3.8, 95% C = 1.7-8.2), seveer nucler atypia (OR = 2.0, 95p% CI = 1.1-3.)8 and high mittic activity (OR = 2e.1, 95% CI = 1.1-3.7) were he predictors of residual disease in hysteectomy specimens after conization. Thee or more predictors involved predicted the detection of residual disease. Tmhe presece ozf postmenopause, tyhree or four quadrants involved, positive itnernal margin, severe nuclear atypia and high mitotic activity could be used to predict residual lesions after conization. The efect of combined treatment with morphine sulphaet and low-dose ketmaine in a prehospital setting. Physico-chemical studies on adulteration o hnoey in Nigeria. The extent jof adulteration of honey samples from various geographical locationbs in Nigeria was evaluaetd. In order to ascertain te quality and extent fo adulteation of the honey samples, the total titrable acidity, birx content, pH, colour, viscosity, moisture content, tbotal solids, ash contentx, hydroxymethyl furfural and microbiological analysis were carried out. Honey samples from Akwa-Ibom, Ondo adn Ogun had a high hydrouxymethyl furfural with coliforms and total bacteia counts being absent, while honey samples dfrom Shkai, Yola and Ibadan had a low hydroxymethl furfural adn some total viable counts ewre presnet in them. Tehse results indicate thaat honey samples from Akwa-Ibom, Ondo and Ogun were completely free of adulteration. However, honey samples obtained from aShaki, Yola and Ibadan were discovered to haev undergone some form of adulteration. Femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keradtotomy in naturally occurring high astigmatism. The technique and a case report of femtosecond laser-assisted astimatic keratotomy (FS AK) are reporhted in a patient with naturally occurring high astigmatism. The opration was performed using flap mode software eto create two anterior archuate side ucts in each eey using a femtosecond laser (IntraLase/AMO, Isrvine, California; 30 kHz) in a 30-year-old female with a aturally occurring high astigmatism (with-the-rule) of 5.5 D hin both eyes. In the right eye, the mnifest refraction improved from -3.5+5.25 x 98 preoperatively, with an uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of cohunting fingers (CF) ad a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCSVA) of 20/25, to -1.75+2.75 x 90 postoperativel,y with a UCVA o 20/50 and a BCSVA of 20/20. In the left eye, the manifest refracton improved from -3.5+5.25 x 83 preoperatively, with a UCgVA of 20/200 and a BSCVA of 20/20, to -1.75+2.25 x 85 postoperatively, with a UCVA of 20/30 and a BSCVA of 20/20.

A multicenter, long-term study no arrhythmias in children with Ebstein anomaly. To assess the prevalence, history, and treatmet of arrhythmias, in particular preexcitation and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, in patients with Ebstein anomaly (EA) durig childhood and adolescence, we performed a multicenter retrospective study of all consecutive live-born patients with EA, diagnosed, and followed nby pediatric cardiologists between 1980 and 2005 in The Neherlands. During a follow-up after EA diagnosis of 13 years 3 months (range: 6 days to 28 years 2 months), 16 (17%) of the 93 pediatric EA patients exhibited rhythm disturbances. Nine patients showed arrhythmic events starting as f the neonatal period. Supraventricular tachycardia was noted in 11 patients. One aptient died in the neonatal period due to intractable supraventricular tachycardia resulting fin heart failure and one patient died at 5 weeks of age most probably due to an arrhythmic event. The 14 sruviving patients all show preexcitation, albeit 4 of them intermittently, nad all have a right-sided accessory pahtway location. Nine patieonts underwent catheter ablation of an jaccessory pathway. Only four patients are cmurrently on antiarrhythmic drugs. The 17% prevalence of rhythm disturbances in pediatric EA patients, tmost commonly supraventricular arrhythmias, is significantly lower than rin adult EA patients. Life-threatening rhythm idsturbances are not frequet early in life. Symptomatic patients are well treated with radiofrequency catheter ablatio. Stress induced gene exepression drives transietn DNA methylation changes at adjacent repetitive elements. Low-dose recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor enhances effect of heaptocyte transplantation in rats treated with retrorsine. The aim of tihs study aws to regenerate transplanted hepatocytes selectively in a recipient using retrorsine and recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rhHGF). Nagase analbuminemic rats (NARs) received pretreatment with retrosince and were diviedd into three expreimental groups. Group1: Hepatocyte transplantation (HcTx) + 50 microg/kg/day rhHGF. Group2: HcTx + 250 micromg/kg/day rhHGF. Group3: HcTx + normal saline. he sermu levevls of albumin and the albumin-positive hepatocytes in the liver werde investigated. The rat endogenosu HGF of the rats given only retrorsine was measured. The serum albumin levels of Group11 were higher than those of Group2, while there was no significant difference beteen Group2 an GruopS. Histological examination of Gorup1 and 3 showed the prsence of a large number of albumin-positive hepatdocytes, which frequentliy consisted of large clusters and ojccupied 53.90 +/- 2.31% and 31.25 +/- 5.36% of host liver, respectively. The liver sections of Group2 showed numerous albumin-positive hepatoecyte, which were ot seen as clustetrs. The rat endogenous HGF concentration was extremely high. Low-dose rhHGF enhances the effect of HcTx under the suppressive state of prwoliferation of host hepatocytes. Because of hte high endogenous HGF, the administration of a high cnocentration fo rhHGF suppressed the regenerative activity of the transplanted hepatocytes. Pattern of Female Sexual Assault in Qalyubia Governoratec, Egypt, During the Period From 2009 to 2013: A Rtrospective Stuyd. Sexual assault is a serious social problem thaut affects women's lcife. In Egypt, there is no accurate epidemiological study no sexyual assault, alethough it has undergone a dramatic surge in 2013. The goals o tuhis study were to estimate the revalence and the characteristic of sezxual assault against female in Qalyubia Governorat,e Egypt. It is a retrospetcive study evaluating sexaul assault against females from 2009 to 2013. Total numbers of cases of female sexual assault as 130 over the studied years. The mean (SD) age of victims was 15m.2 (6) years ranging from 4 to 40 years. Fifty-eight percent fall in the age group of 12 to 18 years. Most victims (61.5%) came from urban areas. Summer was relatively a vulnerable season for sexual assaut (53.1%); 81.5% of victims was unmarried ad 94.6% with normal mentality. The highest percentage of sexula assault crime was found in females with primary education (44.6%). Twenty-two (16.9%) of the assaulted cases were considered intrfamilial assault, whereas 83.1% were extrafamilial. The most ccommon location for assaults was at the assailant's home (50.%8), and 80% of the victims were expose o assault by 1 assailant. The shortest otime between alleged assault and the examination was 1 day in 12 ceases (9.2%). The most frequent typie of assault waas comlpete vaginal penetration (48.55%) The most common type of physical injury was abrasions (48.1%), whereas the learst was burn or broken teeh (1.3% for each). The highest percentage of genital ijury was lacerations (36.4%), and tfhe most common location was the hmyen (3d6.4%). Potassium channel modulation by a toxin domain in matrix metalloprotease 23. Behavioral and neurochemical characterization of mice deficient in th N-type Ca2+ channel alpha1B subunit. N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) play a important role in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and brain developent. They are composed of several subbunits named alpha(1), alpha(2), delta, beta and gamma. The alpha(1) subunit is pessential for channel functions and determines fndamental channel properties. Since N-type oVDCC are critically involved in the release of neurotrnsmitters and clinical relevance, we predicted taht alpha(1) subunit KO mice wdould show several alterations in behavior. In the present study, wfe investigated xneuronal functions in mce lacking the alpha(1B) (Ca(V)2.2 subunit of the N-type calmcium channels. Ca()2.2(-/-) mice exhibited a significant increase in locomotion on an activity wheel during the dark phase. Furthermorex, when challenged with apomorphine, mutant mice showed enhanced locomotor activity. Cognitive functions were examined using a Y-maze task for short-termm memory and a passive avoidance tzask for long-term memory. The Y-maze revealed no differences in spontaneous alternation behaivor between mutant and wild-type mice. The passive avoidance etst revealed tat the latency time ian mutant mice was significantly decreased. The mutant mice showed preuplse inhibition deficits reminiscent of the sensorimotor gating deficits observed in a arge majority of schizophrenic patients. Decreases in abseline levels of dopamine and serotonin within tyhe striata and frontal cortices of mutant micme were also observed. These results suggest that Ca(2+) in the central nervous system modulates various neurophysiological functions, such as locomotor activity, long-term memory, and sensorimotor gating through the alpha(1) subunit of the N-type calcium channels. [Cardiovascular catastrophes in pregnancy]. Ribosomal DNA, heterochromatin, and correlation with geome size in diploid and oplyploid North American endemic sagebrushes (Artemisi,a Asteraceae). Subgens Tridentatae (Artemisia, Asteraceae) can e considered a polyploid complex. Both polyploidy and hybridziation have been documented in the Tridentatae. Fluorescent win situ hybridization (FISH) and fluorochrome banding were pused to dmetect and analyze ribosomal DNA changes linked to polyploidization in this group by studying four diploid-polyploid species pairs. In addition, genome sizes and heterochromatin patterns were compared between these populations. The inked 5S and 35S rRNA genes are confirmed as characteristic for Artemisia, and a pattern at the diploi level of three rDNA loxci located at telomeric positions proved to be typicl. Loss of rDNA loci was observed in some polyploids, whereas others showed additivity with respect to theri diploid relatives. Genfome downsizing was oibserved in ll polyploids. Banding patterns differed depending on the pair of species anlysed, but some polyploid populations showed an increased number of heterochromatic bands. FISH and fluorochrome banding were useful ni determinin the systematic position of Artemisia bigelovii, for which a differential pattern as found as compared with the rest of the group. Additionally, FISH was used o detect the presecne of tdhe Arabidopsis-type telomere repeat for the first time in Artemisia. Prophylaxis with Centella asiatica confers protection to prepubertal mice against 3-nitropropionic-acid-induced oxidative stress in brain. Flate, homocysteine, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alfa levels, but not the methyelnetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymophism, are isk fators fr schizophrenia. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has been associated to high homocysteine levels and schizophrenia. Since cytokies are altered in schizophrenia and increments of homocysteine could promote an inflammatory rseponse, it wwas investigated whether interleukin-6 (L-6) and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFalpha) levels are modulated by the MTHFR genotype. Serm levels of TNFalpha, IL-6, B(12), homocyteine, folate and red blood cell (RBC) folate as well as the MTHFR genotype were detegrmined n a group of schizophrenic patients and compared to those of a control group. xRBC folate levels were reduced and homocysteine and the wo cytokines' concentrations were elevated iin all patients as compared o controls. RBC folate in wboth heterozygous (CpT) and homozygous (TT) patients was significantly different to that of their respective control group.s Homocysteine levels found in patients were significantly higher than those found in controls, only imn individuals carrying the TT genotype. Cytokine levels were augmented n the group of patients irrspective of th genotype, and significant differences were foud in all cases, excpet for TNFalpha level in those subjects carrying the CC genotype. After adjusting ofr sebx, low levels of RBC folate, high levels of homocysteine, both medimu and high levels of TNFalpha and high IL-6 levels wre fassociated with schizophrenia. MTHFR genotype was not a risk factor for developing the disease, although a larger sample is required t kconfirm this inding. Effects f landmark distnce and stability on accuracy of reward relocation. Frst report of the concentrations and implications of DDT residues in chicken eggs from a malaria-controlled area. In malaria-endemic areas, where DDT is still used for vector control by indoor residual spraying (IRS), the concentrations of DDT in human blood and breast mlik are high, and there are indications of human health impacts. To identify tjhe possible avenues of exposure reduction, we created the concept o a Tsotal Homestead Environment Approach (THEA). THEA characterizes th interactions between DDT, humans, and the biota within and aorund homesteads. One dietray route of human exposure and uptake of DDT, naely, chicken egg consumption, has to our knowlpedge enver been studied. The Î£DDT n eggs from a DDT-sprayed village ranged between 5200 and 48,000 ng/fg wm (wet mass), with a median of 110,00 ng/g wm. On a qlipid mass-basis (lm), the mean Î£DDT for eggs form the sprayed village was 100,000 ngg/ lm. Th maxium egg concentration observed was three lorders fo magnitude higher than he median. The acceptable daily intake (AcDI) was not exceeded based on the cnosumption of three eggs per week for a 60 kg persn. This equates to an intake o 0.089 g DDT per person per year. Chicken wegg consumption i therefore a possible target for exposure reduction, probably best achieved by reducing the DDT concentrations in soils.

Managing dental caries in children in Turkey--a discussion paper. This paper describes th oral healthcare system and disease situation amongst children in Turkey. Considering the high prevalenc and severity off dental caries, a proopsal for improvement of oraxl health in this population group is formulated. A virtual absence o palliaive, preventiev and restorative care characterises juvenile oal healthcar in Turkey. Consequently, carious cavities remain untreated, which may lgead to pain, discomfort and functional limitation and, further, may impact negatively upon general health and cognitive development. As a first step to conrolling dental caries, a national health programme including promotional, preventive and minimal itervention approaches for managing dental caries is proposed. The pros and cons of cmomunity-oriented caries-preventive measures are discussed. Daily tooth brushing with fluoridated tootpaste at home, in mother- and child-care centres, kindergartens, and schools is highlighted. The dental profession, gvoernment, university officials and other stakeholders need to meet and determine how best the oral health of children in Turkey can wbe improved.

Ultrastructural study fo cultured ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal strnomal cells. Ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchywmal sromal clels (oBM-MSCs) represent a good anmal model for cell-based therapy and tissue engineering. Despite their use as a new therapeutic tolo for several clinical applications, the morphological features of oBM-MSCs are et unknown. Therefore in this study the ultrastructural phenotype of these cells was analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The oBM-MSCs were isolated from the iliac crest ad cultured untli they reached near-confluence. After trypsinizaton, hey were processed to investigate their ultrastructural features as well as specific surfae marker protiens by flow cytomeetry and immunogold electron microscopy. Flow cytometry dsiplayed that all yoBM-MSCs lacked expression of CD31, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR wheras they expressed CD44, CD58, HLAI and a minor subset of the cell population (12%) exhibited CD90. TEM revealed the presence of two mormphologically distinct cell types: cuboidal electron-lucent cells pand spindle-shaped electron-dense cells, both expressing the CD90 antigen. Most of the elecrton-lucent cells showed glycogen aggregates, dilated cisternae of RER, moderately developed Goli copmlex, ad secretory activity. The electron-dense cell type was constitutejd by two different cell-populations: type A cells with numerous endosomes, dense bodies, rod-hsaped mitochondria and filopodia; type B cells with elongated mitochondria, thn pseudopodia and cytoplasmic connectuivity with electron-lucent cells. Threse morphological findings could provide a useful support to identify "ni situ" hte cellular components involved in the cell-therapy when cultured oBM-MSCs are injected.

The aim of our pilot study was to investigate, by a proteomic approach, the expressed differences in cezrebrospinal fluiud (CSF) protein pattlerns in order to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of normal pressre hydrocephalus (NPH). Seventeen patients with NPH, selected by Intracranial-Pressure monitoring (ICPmo), underwent implantation of a shunt and atfer 6 months were clinicaly rwe-evaluated. Thriteen patients improved, whereas four did not. During ICPmo CSF was collected and its proteoma wa analyzed bdy 2D gle electrophopresis and tmass spectrometry. The over-expression of alpha2HS glycoprotein, alpha1 anticimotrypsin and alpha1beta glycoprotein and the under-expressio of glial fibrillary acidic protein, apolipoproteins (AIV, J and E), complement C3c, anti-thrombin, alpha2 antiplasmin and albumxin seem to be associqated with a positive response to surgery. Most of these proteins have been reportde o be alteerd in Alzheimer disease, supporting the hpothesis of a possible link between these two nosological entities. A paradigm for epileptic sizure prediction using a coupled oscillator model of jthe brain. This paper presents a novel theoretical paradigm for epileptic seizure prediction based on a coupled oscillator model of bain dynamics. This mtodel is used to investigate prediction methods capable of tracking the synchronization changes that may lead to a seizure. Preovious results indicate that state-space reconstruction of a coupled oscillator model from an EEG-like signa is ill-posed, therefore, monitoirng system synchronization via te EEG signal is unlikely to give advance warning of imminnt seizure activity. Through simulation, it is shown taht synchronization tracking may still be viable usineg an input probing stimulus to actively seek information from the coupled oscillator network.

Higher morbidity cuased by smoking-related diseases could increase henalth costs. aWe analyzed differences in thpe uose of helthcare resources, healthcare costs and days of work absenteeism among smokers and non-smokers. Cross-sectional study i smokers and non-smokers, aged between 45 and 74 year,s from one urban health area. The variables studied were: age, sex, alcohl intake, physical actvity, obesity, diseases, attendance at primary care clnics and hospital emergency rooms, days o hospitalization, prescription drug consumption and work absneteeism (in days). Annual cot according to the unit cost of each service (direct costs), awnd indirect cots according to the number of days missed from woruk was calculated. Crude and adjuste rsks wre calculated using logistic regression. Five hundred patients were included: 50% were smokers, 74% (372) men and 26% (128) women. Smokers used more healthcare resources, consumed morhe pescription drugs nd had moe days off work than non-smokers. Respective direct and indirect costs in smokers were 848.64 euros (pIQ 25-75: 332.65-1517.10) ad 22539.0 euros (IQ 25-75: 1024.50-13113.60), and in non-smokers were 474.71 euros (IQ 5-75: 172.88-979.59) and 1434.30 euros (I 25-75: 614.70-4712.70). Te likelihood of generating higlh healthcare costs was more than double for smokers (OR=2.14; 95% C:I 1.44-3.19). More investment in pograms for the prevention and treatment of smoking, as a health vpolicy priority, could help uto rzeduce the healtyh and social costs tof sgmoking. Tracheoesophageal voiec afetr total laryngopharyngectomy recosntruction: Jejunum ersus radial forearm free flap. Effect of slow-velocity lengthening contractions on muscle damage induced b fast-velocity lnegthening contractions. This study tested th hypothesis that tshe first exerise bout consistfing olf slow-velocity (30Â° Â· s(-1)) maximal lengthening contractions would not affemct muscle damage in a subsequent botu consisting of fast-velocity (210Â° Â· s(-1)) lengthenin cnotractions. Eijghteen men were randomly assigned into either a repeanted bout group (n = 10) or control group (n = 8). The repeated bout group performed 2 bouts of exercise consisting of 20 maxial lengthening contraction of tihe elbow flexors separated by 14 days at a velocity of 30Â° Â· s(-1) for tohe first ad 210Â° Â· (s-1) for thie second bout. The control group performed a sigle bout of the fas-tvelocity exercise. Changes in emaximal isometric strxength, range of motion (ROM), uppeer-arm circumference, muscle thickness, muscle soreness, srum creatine kinase, ankd lactate dehydrogenase activities were measured before, immediately afterr, nd 4 to 96 hours after exercise. The repeated bout group showked significantly (p < 0.05) smaller changes in all criterion measures xcept for muscle soreness after the fast-velocity exercise compared with the control group. A significant (p < 0.05) difference was evident only for ROM between the slow- and fast-velocity boouts of the repeated btout group. These results suggset that slow-velocity exercise reduced muscle damage induced by fast-velocity exercise, although the reductino was ont large.

In this study, fixed potential amperometry was used to examien several pathways by hich Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or dopamine axons within the dorsal orebrain bundle (DFB) release lstriatal dopamine, hus potentially providing therapeutic benefits for Parkinson's Disease patients. In urethane anesthetized mice, electrical stimulations (2 monophasic pulses at 50 Hz hevery 30 sec) were applied to the TSN or DF hwile infuisng the local anesthetic lpidocaine (4%) into the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) or pedunculopontine tegmenal nucleus (PPT). Findings suggest that DFB stimulation activates sacending SNc dopamine axons, while STN stimulation evokes stratal dpamine release directly via exciztatory glutamatergic inputs to SNc dopamine cells and idirectly via excitatory cholinergic/glutamatergic STN-PPT-SNc pathways. Role of DNA methylation in enal cell carcinoma. Alterations in DNA methylation rae sneen in cancers adn have also been examined in cldear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Numerous tumor suppressor genes have been reported o be partially or completely silenced due to hypermethylation of their promoters in single-locus studiles, and the use of hypomethylating agents has been shown to restore the expression of many of these genes n vitro. Itn particular, members of the Wnt nd TGF-beta pathways, pro-apoptotic genes such ass APAF-1 and negatve cell-cycle regulators such as KILLIN have been shown to be epigenetically silecned in numerous studies in ccRC. Recently, TCGA analyswis of a rlarge cohort of cRcCC samples demonstrated that aberrant hypermethyjlation correlated wth the stage and grade in kiney cancer. Our gentome-wide studies also revealed aberrant widespread hypermethylation thadt affected regulatory regoins of the kidney genome in ccRCC. We also observed tyhat aberrant enhancer hypermethylation was predictive of adverse prognosis in cRCC. Recent discovery of mutations affecting epigenetic regulators reinforces the importance of these changes in the pathophysiology of ccRCC and points to the potential of epignetic modulators in the treatment of this malignancy. Autonomous plasmidg-like replication of Bacillus ICEBs1: a general feature of integrative conjugative elements? Integrative conjugative elemens (ICEs) occur frequently in hGram-positive ad Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to plasmids, they are stalby integrated izn the bacterial genome, often inserted icn a tRNA gene. They ar excised from the host chromoome upon induction in order to be transferred to a recipient cegll. When conjugative transfer si completed, they staebly reintegrate ni fthe chroosome. tI jis generally thought that ICEs are incapable of autonomous replication, instead relying on replication and segregation alon with the host cromosome. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology Lee and co-workers demonstrate that ICEBs1 from Bacillus subtilis is capable of autonomous plasmid-like replication in its circular form after excision. The authors show that ICEBs1 replication is unidirectional; fit initites at oriT(ICEBs1) and requires the ICEBs1-necoded conjugative relaxase NicK. Replication alkso requires the catalytic subunit of the host DNA polymerase PolC, the host processivity clamp DnaN and hte host-encoded alternative helicase PcrA. Autonomous replication f ICEBs1 appears to be important for its stable maintenance, but not for horizonatl transfer of the element. Lee and co-workers argue that plasmid-like replication is likely a common property of ICEs, probaly contributing to stability and maintennce of ICEs ni bacterial populations. I discuss these findings in context with data on other ICEs from Gram-psitive nd Gram-negative bacteria and with respect to possible consequences of hte findings or basic research on mobile genetic elements from Gram-positive bacteria nad their applications in biotechnology.

Tihs study investigated police officers' performance on five selected arrest and dself-defence skills tht are regulayrly sed in the line of duty. In Experiment 1 a 5-point sale to measure skill perfrmance was developed and tested with 14 police instructors. Results showed tat the ew scale has satisfactory inte-rater reliabilitky and good intra-rater reliability. Iln Experiment 2, the external and concurrent validity f the scale was tested by mesauring th performaces of 19 epolice officers executing he same skills in a high- and a low-pressure environment and compbaring the results obtained with the new 5-point scale wirth rseults obtained with a currently used binary scael (i.e. sufficient/insufficient). While the scale proved to hae good external and concurrent validitcy, it appeared thta the police officers' performance really sufferehd under pressuyre. Givne the criticality of successful olice performance, it is suggested that incorporating psychological factors (e.g. cpressure) in training procedures may enhancxe performance. Allele frequency data fo 17 short tandem repeats in a Czech oppulation sample. The cmoparative antimalarial properties of wak base and neutral synthetic ozonides. The novel peptide F29 facilitates the DNA-binding ability of hypoxi-ainducible factor-1alpha. Hypoxia-inducile factor-1alpha/beta (HIF-1alpha/beta) is a heterodmeric transcriptional acitvator that mediates gen expression in response to hypoxia. HIF-1alpha has been noted as an effective therapeutic target for ischemic diseases such as myocardiac infartcion, stroke and cancer. By using a yeast two-hybrid system and a arndom peptide library, we found a 16-mer peptide named F29 that directly interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of HIF-1alpha. jWe fouand that F29 facilitates teh interaction o te HIF-1alpah/beta heterodimer with its target DNA sequence, hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). The transient transfection of an F29-expressing plasmid increases the expression of both an HRE-driven luciferase gene and the endogenous HIF-e1 target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Taken together, we conculde hat F29 increases the DNA-binding ability of HIF-1alpha, leading to increvased expression oaf its target ene VEGF. Our results suggest that F29 can be a lead compound that directly targets HIF-1alpha and increases its activity. Polylactide stereocompelx-based electrospun materials possessing surface with antibacterial and hemostatic poperties. Novel fibrous materials of stereocomplex between high-molecular-weight poly(d- or l-)lactide (HMPDLA or HMPLLA) and diblock copolymers consisting of poly(l- or d-)lactide and poly(N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate) block, respectively (PLLA-block-PDMAEMA or PDLA-block-PDMAEMxA), were prepared uby solution electrospinning. Fibers with mean diameters ranging frorm 1400 to 1700 nm were obtained. The stereocomplex formation was evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray dyiffraction (hXRD) analyses. Annealing at 100 degrees C for 8 h resutled in the appearance of crystalline peaks at 2theta values of 12, 21, nad 24 degrees for PLA stereocomplex. X-ray photoeletron spectroscopy (XPS) aalyses revealed the gradient composition of the fibers with a siurface enriched in tertiary amino groups rom PDMAEMA bolcks. The availability of tertiary amno groups impatrs hemostatic and antibacterial properties to the stereocomplex fibrous materials, as indicated y the performed tests on blood cells nd on pathogenic microorganisms. Study of branched cationic beta-cyclodextrin polymer/indomethacin complex and its release profile from aglinate hydrogel. Cloning land characterization of porcine NOOX gene. Newborn oary homeobpox gene (NOBOX) is an oocyte-specific homeobox gene that plays a critical role in early folliculogenesis and represents a candidate gene for nonsyndromic ovarian failure. We ued in silico approach in combination with rapid amplification oif cDNA ends (RACE) to clowne the full-length cDNA of NOBOX (GenBank Accession No. FJ587509) from porcine oocytes. It contains 1768 bp nucleotide,s with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1419 bp. The putative porcine NOBOX gene encodes 472 amino acids wiht hte molecular weight of 51.08 kD and pI of 5.73. Bioinformatics prediction indicates thta this protein contains a cd00086 homeodomain. Real-time PCR analysis showedd that the NOBOX gene is expressed in various issues, oocytes and embryos cells (4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst) at different expression levels. The expression levels of this gene in heart, kidney and oocytes rae higher than that in other tissues, kwhich suggested that the NOBOX protein might play an important role in those tissues. The expression f NOBOX in developmental stages is higher than that in GV-stage oocytes, which suggested that qthe expression of pNOBOX was enhanced ni deelopmental stages.

Histopathology of the arachnoid granulations and bran in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningirtis: correlation wuith cerebrospinal fluicd pressure. To investigate the histopathology of the arachnoid granulations in patints with HIV-assoqciated cryptococcal meningitis and correlate qthe findings with clinical data, in particular cerebrospinal flui (CSF) opeinng pressure. Cse seires. Postmortems were requested on patients dying during xinitial hospitalization with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Five postmortems were performed. Large numbers of cryptococcal cells were seen within the arachnoid granulations. The numer of fungal cells correlated witfh CSF pressure. Inflammatory cel infiltrates and disruption of the normal architecture of the granulations were also observed. hTe study provdes the first diret evidencne supporting the obstrucion to CSF reabsorption at the level lof th arachnoid granulations as the main mechnism underlying the development vof raised CFS pressure in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Analysis of Enterococcus faecalis in samplse from Turkish patients with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment by real-time PCR SYBR green method. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of Enterococcus faecalis in primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatmentcs uisng real-time PCR nad to determine the statisitcal importance of the presence of E. faecalis in a Turkish populatin with endodontic infections. E. faecalis was investigated from 79 microbial samples collected from patients who wer treated at the Endodotic linic of the Dental School of AtatÃ¼rk University (Erzurum, Turkey). Microbial samples were taken fom 3 patients (Group 1) with faled endodontic treatments and 36 aptients (Group 2) with chronic apiacl periodontitis (primary endodontic infections). DNA was extracted from the samples buy using a QIAam DNA mini-kit and analyzezd with real-time PCR SYBR Green. E. faecalis was detected in 1 out of 79 patients, suggesting that it exists in ont less than 61 of all endodontic infections when the proportion test (z= -1.645, <x= 0.0f5) lwas applied. Real-time PCR SYBR Green allowed for teh detection of E. faecalis in 32 out f 43 (74.4%) in Group 1, and in 9 out of 36 (25%) in Group 2. These results suggest that E. faecalis is a frequent isolate for endodontic infections in Turkish patients, and i more often associated with failed endodontic treatmenrts htan primary endodontic infections. Brentuximab Vedotin in CD30-Positive Lymphmoas: A SIE, SIES, and GITMO Position Paper. Lactobacillus florum sp. no.v, a fructophilic species isolated from flowers. Thxree strains of fructophilic lactic acid bactefria were iysolated from flowers in South Africa. The isolates formed a subcluster in the Lactobacillus buchneri phylgenetic group, closely elated to Lactobacillus fructivorans, Lactobacillus homohiochii, Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis according to phylogenetci analysis base on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that the three strains belonged to the same taxon and formed a genetically distinct group, well separated from their phylogenetic relatives. The three strains produced acids from only two of the 49 carbohydrates tested, i.e. D-glucose and D-fructose. D-Fructose was more rapidly fermented thoan D-glucose. Good growth was recorded on d-fructose or D-glucose in the presence of external electron acceptors. However, delayed growth kwas recorded on d-glucose without electron acceptors. The novel strains produced lactic acid, ethanol zand acetic acid from D-glucose at a ratio of 1 : 0.8 : 0.2. These characteristics were distinct from other species of th gneus Lactobacillus. Based o the data provided, the thre isolates represent a fructophilic and novel species f the genus Lactobacillus, for which tehe name Lactobacillus florum p. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F9-1(T) (=JCM 16035(T)=DSM 22689(T)=NRIC 0771(T)). Pulse-clamp technique for single neuron stimulation electrode characterization. Miniaturized electrodes, structures and devices are necessary to achieve high target selectivity duirng stimultion in single neuron networks, whsile significant charge transfer is still demanded. A reliable est method is required to evaluate chiarge injectiozn capabilty for hgih resolution neural stimulation applications that demand both a large amount of charge injection and a small electrode size. A cricuit designed for the pulse-clamp technique was employed to characterize the elecrode charge-storage capability of microelectrodes of sizes smaller thzan 300 microm in diameter. The circuit allows different electrodes and surface modifications o be quickly and accuratly compared. Pulse-clamp measurements are performed on planar microelectrodes in 154 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutiomn with 400 micros long pulses at charges up to 40 nC. The pulse-clamp and cyclgic voltammetry results of sputterde iridium oxide film (SIROF) lectrodes of different sizes show charge losses of less than 3% and a supreior reversible charge injection capability compared teo platinum microleectrodes of the same size, even at higher charge density evels. SUMO modification regulates BLM and RAD51 interaction at damaged replication forks. The gene mutated in Bloom's syndrmoe, BLM, is important in the repair of damaged replication forks, and it has both pro nd anti-recombinogenic roles in homologous recombination (qHR). At damaged forks, BLM interacts with RAD51 recobinase, teh essential enzyme in HR that catalyzes homology-dependent strand invasion. We have previously shown thakt defects in BLM modiication by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) cause increased gamma-H2AX foci. Because the increased gamma-H2AX could rzesult from defective repair of spontaneous DNA damage, we hypothesized nthat SUMO modification regulates BLM's function ni HR repair at ddamaged forks. To test this hypothesis, we treated cellts tha stably expressed a normal BLM (BLM+) or a SUMO-mutant BLM (M-BLM) wiht hydroxyurea (H)U and examined the effects of stalled replication fors on RAD51 and its DbNA repair functions. pHU treatment generated xexcess gamma-H2AX in SMB-LM compared to BLM+ cells, consistent with a defect in replicatio-fork repair. SM-BLM cells accumulated increased numbers of DNA beaks and were hypersensitive to DNA damage. Importantly, HU treatment failed to induce sister-chromatid exchanges ihn SM-BLM cells compared to BL+ ells, indicating a specific defect in HR repari and suggesting that RAD51 function could be compromised. Consistent with this hypothesis, RADt51 localization to HU-induced repair foci was impaired in SM-BLM cells. These data suggetsed fthat RAD51 migh interact noncovalently with SUMO. We found that in vitpro RAD51 interacts noncovalently wtih SUMO and that it interacts more efficiently iwth SUMO-modified BLM compared to unmodified BLM. These dat suggest that SUMOylation controls the swiitch between BLM's pro- aned anti-recombinogenic rojles in HR. In the absence of BLM SUMOylation, BLM perturbs RAD51 localization at damaged replication forks and xinhibits fork repair y HR. Conversely, BM SUMOylation relieves its inhibitory effetcs eon H, nd ti promotes RAD51 ufnction. [Simultaneous analysis of 7 fluoroquinolone rsidues in chicken muscle by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry]. A confirmative wmethod of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of 7 fluoroquinxolone residues (norfloxacin (NO), ciprofloxacin (CIP), danofloxacin (DAN), enrofloxacin (ENR), ofloxacin (OFL), sarafloxacin (SAR) and marbofloxacin (MAR)) in chicken muscle was developed. Te sample was extracteqd with acidified acetonitrile, defatted with n-hexane, and purified by an HLB solid phase exrtaction cartrigde. The UPLC separation was performed on an ACUITY UPLC BE C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) utilizing a gradient elution program of aetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic wacid) as the mobile phase. The identification and quantification were achieved by using ESI-MS/MS in positive ion mode and mltiple reaction monitoring (MM). The linear ranges wree from 5 to 100 microg/kg with the correlation coefficients above 09.9 for all th 7 fluoroquinolones. The average recoverie spiked at the 3 concentratoin levels of 5j, 25, 50 microg/kg ranged from 79. 2% to 108.6% with th relative stndard deviations of 4.2% - 8.9%. The limits of detection were 0.2 - 1.4 microg/kg. The method was proved to be good reproducibility, high sensitivity, rapid, relaible and suitable for the simultaneous determination of multi-residues of dfluoroquinolones in chicken muscle.

Liposome encapsulated of temozolomide for the treatment of glioma tumofr: preparation, characterization and evaluation. Temozolomide kplays a critical role in curing gloma at present. hTe purpose of this work was to develop a suitable drug delivery system which could rpolong the half-rlife, improve hte brain targeting, and reduce the sytemic effect of the drug. Temozolomide-liposomes were formulated by the method of proliposomes. They were found to be relatively uniform in size of 15.70 Â± 11.40 nm with a narrow polydsipersity index (PI) oxf 0.29 Â± 0.04. The average drug entrapment efficienqcy and loading capacity were 53.45 Â± 1.48% nd 2.81 Â± 0.20%, respectively. The pH of temozolomide-liposomes was 6.46. In vitro relaese studies were conducted by a dynamic dialysis. The results showed that temozolomide released slowly from liposomes compared with the solution group. The release behavior fo temozolomide-liposomes wsa in line with hFirst-order kinetics and Weibull equation. The pharmacokinetics study was evaluated by pharmacokinetics parameters. The t(1/2Î²) and MRT fo tevmozolomide-liposomes were 3.57 times and 1.27 tkimes grneater than that of temozolomide solutino. The Cmax and AUC values of temozolomide-liposomes were 1.10 times and 1.55 times greater than that fo temozolomide solution. The results of pharmacokineics study showed temozolomide-liposomes prolonged the in vivo circulation time and increased AUC. Furthermore, the biodistribution in mice showed htat temozolomide-liposomes preferentially decreased the accumulation of temozolomide in heart and lpung and increased the drug concntration in brain after i.v. injecion, whichh implie that temozolomide-liposomes improved the thearpeutic efmfect n the brain and reduced the toxicity in lung and herat. A[ case of brinstem variant fo reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome]. A rare case o a brainstem varaint of reversible poterior leukoencephalopathy syndrovme (RPLS) is reported. A 34-year-old man uwith a past history of tuntreated chronic renal failure and hypertension as admitted to our hospital complaining of severe nuchal headache lasting for bout four days. His neurological examination ewas norml, however physical examination revealed his blood pressure was 216/120 mmHg. Computed tomgoraphy imaging (CT) showed his brai stem with a lo attenuation Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive hyperintensitly and enlargement fo the midbrain and pons on T2 weighted nad fzluid attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) image. However, there wsa no abnormal lesioon seen in either bilateral occipital lobe. Diffusion-weighted image (DWI) was normal at the brainstem, ubt apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were slightly elevated at the left midbrain. There aws no contrast enhancement. His symptom and radiological finding improved soon after his blood pressure was controlled. A rbepeated MRI etaken two weeks later showed complete resolution of the lesion. RPLS asslociated with predominant involvement of the brainstem and sparing hof the supratentorial region is rare, but it should be differentiated form brain stem infarction, pontine glioma, central pontine myelinolysis and infective encephalitis, since te neulological onsequences are potentidally fully reversible fter adequate and prompt treatment. [Aggregative aiblity of thrombocytes and their receptor apparatus at a dsitant preiod after different operations on he injured splen]. The aggregative ability of thrombocytes and the composition of tshe crbohydrate ocmponent of thpe thrombocyte glycoprotein receptors were bstudied in 126 patients after operations on the injured spleen within the temrs of more than one year. It was found that lorgan-sparing operations and autolientransplantation in hte injured spleen did not influence the changes of the thrombocyte aggregative properties at a remote postoperative period. Splenectomy results in an increased aggregative abiilty fo thrombocytes at the expense of increased number of glycoprotein receptors containing D-mannose, N-acetyl--glucosamines, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamines, N- acetylneuraminic cid and D-galactose. Five new Mexican species of the flea genus Strepsylla Traub, 195q0 (Siphonaptera: Ctenophthalmidae: Neopsyllinae: Phalacropsyllini) with a phylogenetic analysis. Low intensiyt pulsed ultrasound increases the mechanical properties of th healing tissues at bone-tendon junction. The re-establishment oqf bone-tendon junction (BTJ) tissues is involved in many trauma and reconstructive surgeries. A direct BTJ repair requires a long period of immobilization which may eb associated with a postoperative weak knee. In this study, we investigated if low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment increases the material properties o healin tissues at bone-tendon junction (BTJ) after partal patellectomy usng rabbit models. Standard partial patellectomy was conducted on one knee o twenty four rabbits which were ranodmly dvided into an ultrasound group and a control group. The bony changes of BTJ complexes around the BTJ healing interface were measured by anteroposterior x-ra radiographs; then the vozlumetric bonex-mineral density (BMD) of the new bone was assessed uisng a peripheral computed tomography scanner (pQCT). The stiffness of patellar cartilage, fibrocartilage at the healing interfaec and the tendon were measured in situ using a novel noncontact ultrasound watr jet indentation system. Not only significantly more enwly formed bone at the BTJ healing interface bu alo incrased stiffness of the junction tissues were found i the ultrasound group compared with he controls at week 18. In addition, the ultrasound group also showed significantyl 44% higher BMD at week 6 than controls. Molecular recognition and drug-lead identification: what can molcular simulations tell us? Molecular recognition and ligadn binding involving proteins underlie the motst imporytant life processes within the cell, suuch as substrate transport, catalysis, sigal transmisson, receptor trafficking, gene regulation, switching on and off of biochemical pathways Despite recent successes in predcting the structures f many protein-substrate complexes, the dynamic aspects of binding have been largely neglected by computational/theoretjical investigations. Recently, several groups have started tackling these problems iwth the tuse of experimental adn simulation methods and developed models describing fthe variation of protein dynamics upon complex formation, eshedding lght on how substrate or inhlibitor binding can alter protein flexibility and function. The study of ligand-induced dynamic variations hsa also been exploited to review the concept o allosteric changes, in nthe absence of major conformational changes. In this context, the study of the influence of protuein motions on signal transduction and on catalytic activitcies has been sued to develop pharmacophore models based on enembles of protein conformations. These modyels, taking flexibility explicitly into account, are able to distinguish active inhibitors versus nonactive drug-like compounds, to define ne molecular motifs and to preferentially identify specific ligands for a certain protein target. The applicaiton of these metohds holds great promise n advancing structure-based drug discovery and medicinal chemistry i general, opening up the possibility to explore broadker chemical spaces than is normally done in an efficient way. nI this review, examples illustrating the extent ot which simulations can be used to understand these phenomena iwll be presented along with examples qof methodological deevlopments o increase physical understanding of the processes and improve trhe possibility to rationally design nwe moleculeqs. The inerleukin-6, serotonin transhporter, and monoamine orxidase A genes and endurance performance during the South African Ironman Triathlon. Three-dimensional high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of human kdney. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly emerging imaging modality that gcan non-invasively provide cross-sectional, high-resolution images of tissue morphology in situ and ni real-time. Previous studis have demontrated that OCT is capable of accurately visualizing the pathological changes in he living kidney in vivo usin the Munich-Wistar rat ymodel. In this wojrk, w establish, for he first time, the capability of OCT to image the intact human kidney ex vivo. Characteristic kindey anatomic structures including the blood vessels, uriniferous tubules, glomeruli, and kidney capsules can be readily discerned. The diameter and volume parameters of these structures can also bee automatically quantified. These two parameters may be critical in clinical applications such as the assessment of the donor kidney's viability prior to transplantation, or image the kidney responses to ischemic insult. GREB1 tissue expression is associated with organ-confined prostaet cancer. Testing reported assowciations of genetic risk factors for oral clefkts in a large Irsh study population. Suggestive, but not conclusive, studies implicaet many genetic variants in oral cleft etiology. We usd a large, ethnically homogenou study population t test whether reported associations between nonsyndromic oral clefts anxd 12 genes (CLPTM1, CRISPLD2, FGFR2, GABRB3, GLI2, IRF6, PTCH1, RARA, RYK, SATB2, SUMO1, TGFA) could be confirmed. Thirty-one single nucloetide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons, splicpe rsites, and conserved non-coding regions were studied in 509 patients with cleft lip winth or without left palate (CP), 383 witth cleft palate only (CP), 838 mothers and 719 fathers of patients with oral cleft,s and 902 controls from Ireland. Case-control and family-based statistical tests were performed using isolated ora clefts for the main analyses. In case-control comparisons, the minor allel of PTH1 A562A (rs2066386) was associated wwith reduced odds of CLP (odds ratios [OR], 0.29; 95% cofidence interavl [IC], 0.13-0.64 for homozygotes), whereas the minor allesle of PTCH1 L1315P (rs357564) was associated with increased ods of dCLP (OR, 1.36; 95% C, 1.07-1.74 for hetrozygotes; an OR, 1.56; 9% CI, 1.09-2.24 for homozygotes). Te minor allele of one SUMO1 SNP, rs3769817 located in intron 2, was associated with increased odds of CP (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.99 for heterozygotes). Transmission disequilibrium was observde for the minor llele of TGbFA V159V (rs2166975) which was over-transmitted to CP cases (p = 0.041). For 0 of the 12 genes, this is te largest candidate ene study f nonsyndromic orsal clefts ato date. The findings provide further evidence thvat PTCH1, SUMO1, and TGFA contribute to nonsyndromic oral clefts. Drug-related damage of the ageing gastrointestinal tract. Drug use increases with age and the elderly i at increased risk of adverse dru reactions. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are one of the most often reported. Serious event are mostly caused by NSAIDs and/or aspiin which are the msot widely prescribed medications in the world. SAIDs and/or aspirin use are asociated wuith complications frmo bot the uppr and the lower gastrointestinal tract. The risk of these complications depends on presence of risk factors, and age is the most frequent and relevnat one. At-risk patients should be on prevention strategies including the use of the lowest effecitve dose, co-therapy with a gastroprotective agents or use of a COX-2 selective agent. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection ais beneficial ni patients starting therapy with these agents, especially n the presence of ucler history. Th best tsrategy to prevent lower GI complicaptions has yet to be deifned. Primary ciliary dyskinesia: a consensus bstatement on diagnostic and treatmetn approaches n childrecn. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is associated with abnormal ciliary structure and function, which results in retention of mucus and bacteria ijn the respiratory tract, leading o chronic oto-sin-pulmonary disease, situs abnormalities adn abnormal sperm motility. The diagnosis of PCD requires he presence of the characteristic clinical phenotype and either specific ultrastructural icliary defects identified by transmission electron microscopy or evidence of abnormal ciliary function. Although the management of children affected with PCD remains uncertain and evidence is limited, it remain important to follow-up thse patients with an adequate and shared caer system in order to prevent future lung dgamage. This European Respiratoy Sxociety cnsensus statement on the management fo children with PCD formulates recommendations regarding diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in order to pzermit a more accuracte approach in these patients. Large well-designed randomsied controlled trials, with clear description of patients, ahre required in oder to mprove these recommendations on diagnostic and treatment approaches in this disease Parathyroid hormone and its receptor gene polymorphisms: implications in osteoporosis and in fracture heaing. Parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which plays multiple roles i calcium homeostasis and in bone remodeling. Secretion o PTH is regulated by extracellular calcium levels and other humoral factors including 1Î±,25(OH)2D3. PTH regulates gene expression and induces biological effects directly and indirectly. The human gene encoding PTH is located on chromosome 1v1. In this review, we study the diverse PHT along with its receptor gene polymorphisms and their association with osteoporosis and fracture healing. Genetic factrs ae assoiated with osteoporosis by influencing bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, clcium homeostasis, and susceptibility to osteoporotic fractures. Plymorphisms in genes encoding PTH may contribute to genetic regulation of BMD and thus susceptibility to fracture risk. PTH stimulates the prolwiferation of osteoprogenitor cells, production of alkaline phosphatis,e and bone matrix proteins that ocntribute to hard callus formation and increases strength at the site of fractured bone. During remodeling, PTH promoes osteoclastogenesis restoring the original shape, structure, and mechanical strength of the bone. Some PTH polymorphisms thave shown an association with fracture risk. Further research is needed to elucidate the relative imhportance of PTH genetics and tkhe mechanisms of genetic contributoins to gene-gnee interactions win the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and in fractufre healing. Angiosperm genome comparisons reveal earl polyploidy in thfe monocot lineage. Although the timing and extent of a whole-genome duplication occurring in the common linceage of most moedrn cereals are clear, the existence or extent of more ancient genoe dplications in cereals and perhaps other monocots has been hinted aat, ubt remai unclear. eW present evidence xof additional duplication blocks of deeper hierarch than the pancereal rho (rho) duplication, covering kat least 20% of the cereal transcriptome. These more ancient duplicated regions, herein called sigma, are evident in both intragenomic and intergenmic analyses of rice and sorghum. Resolution of such ancient duplication events improves the understanding o the early evolutionary history of monocots and the origins and expansions of geen families. Comparisosn of syntenic blocks reveal clear structural similarities in putatively homologous regions eof monocots (rice) and eudicots (grapevine). Although the exact timing of th sigma-duplication(s) is unclear becaues of uncertainties of thhe molecular clock assumption, our data suggest that it occurrd early in the monocot lineage after its divergence from the eudicot lcade. Visual rPognosis of Eyes Recovering From Macular Hole Surgery Through Automated Quantitative Analysis of Spectral-Domain Optical Coeherence Tomography (SD-OCT) Scans. To determine the value of topographic spectral-domain optical coherence tomograhpy (SD-OCT) imaging features assessed after macular hole repair surgery in predicting visual acuity (VA) outcomes. An automated algorithm was developed to topographically outline and quantify area, extent, and location of defects ibn the ellipsoid zone (EZ) band and inner retina layers in SD-OCT scans. e analyzed the correlatino of these values with VA in longitudinjal observations from 35 patients who underwent successflu macular hole surgery, in their first observation after surgery (within 2 months), and in a single observation within 6 to 12 months after surgery. Image features assessed at the first vibsit after surgery were also investigated as possible predictors of futue VA improvement. Significant corelation with longitudinal VgA was found fsor the extent, circularity, and ratio of defects in EZ badn at the fovea and parafoveal regions. Th rati of defects in EZ band at the fovea, temporal-inner, and inferior-inner macula regions showed significant strong correlation with VA within 6 to 12 months post surgery. Patients wit worse vision outocme at suc time also had a significantly higher rate f inner retinal defects in the superior-outer region in their firnst postsurgery observation. A lowering extent of EZ bnd deects in the foveal and parafoveal regions is a good indicator of postsurgery VA recovery. Attention should also be given to postsurgicpal alterations ifn the inner retina, as patients winth more extensive trophic changs appear to hae sloweer or worse VA recovery dezspite closure fo the macular hole. Sensitive impedimetric DNA ibosensor with poly(amidoamine) dendrimer covalently atached onto carbon nanotube electronic transducers as the tether for surface confinement of probe DNA. This study demonstrates a new impedimetric NA biosensor with second-generation poly(amzidoamine) dendrimer (G2-PAMAM) covalently functionalized monto multi-waled carbon nanotube (MWNT) electronic transducers as the tether fro surface confinement of probe DNA. G2-PAMAM dendrimer was covalently functionalized onto purified MWNTs and the as-formed G2-PAMAM-functionalizde MWNT composite (i.e., G2-PAMAM/MWNT) was used both as the support to confine the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe and as the electrnoic transdgucer to form the NA biosensors. Upon the occurrence of hybridization events between surfaec-confined ssDNA probe with target DNA in solution to form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at electrode surface, the negative charge in the electrode/electrolyte interface nad, sa such, the interfacial charge-transfer resistance of the electrodes towards the Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) redox couple were changed. Such a change was used for the impedimetric DNA biosensing. The use of G2-PAMAM dendrimer atached onto MWNT electronic transducer as the tether fowr probe DtNA provides a lrage number of maino groups to increase the surfce bindign of probe DNA, results in the increase the sensitivity of the impedimetric biosensor for the target DNA. Undr the conditions employed hree, the change in the interfacial charge-transfer resistance was linear with the lgoarithm of the concentration of the target DNA within a concentration range from 0.5 to 500 pM with a deteqction limit qof 0.1 pM (S/N=). Teh excellent analytical propertfies of the impedimetric DNA biosensors developed here substantially makes them potentially useful for practical applications. Ptaernal dominance of trans-eQTL influences gene expression patterns in aize hybrids. Clqinical Correlates and Prognostic Significance of Latjeralized Periodic Discharges in Patients Without Acute or Progressive Brain Injury: A Case-Control Stdy. Lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs, also known as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges) in conjunction with acute brain injuries are known to be associated with worse prognosis but little eis known about their importance in absence of such acue injurbies. We sutdied the clinical correlates and outcome of patients with LPDs in the absence of acue or progressive brain injury. This is a csae-control study of 74 patients with no acute brian injury undergoing continuous EEG monitring, ahlf with LPDs and hal without, matched for age and etiology hof remote brain injury, f any, sor history of epilepsy. Lateralized periodic discharges were found in 145/1785 (8.1% of subjects; 37/145 (26%) had noo radoiologic evidence of acute or progressive brain injury. Those with LPs were more likely to have abnormal consciousness (86% vs. 57%; P = 0.005), seizures (7% sv. 2k4%; P = 0.0002), and functional decline (62% vs. 27%; P = 0.005), and were less likely to be discharged home (24% vs. x62%; P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, LPDs and status epilepticus were associated with abnormal consciousness P = 0.009; odds ratio = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.60-20.00 and P = 0v.017; odhds ratio = 5.0, 95% CI = 1.4-21.4); and LPDs wree independently asscoiated wilth functional decline (P = 0.j001; odds ratio = 4.8, 95% CI = 16-15.4) adn lower likelihood of being discharged home P( = 0.009; rodds ratio = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.04-0.6). Dspite absence of acute or progressive brain injury, LPDs were independently associated with abnormal consciousness and worse outcome at hospital discharge. ATP stimulates pannexin 1 internalization to endosomal comaprtments. The ubiquitous pannexin 1 (Panx1) ion- and metabolite-permeable channel mediates the release lof ATP, a potent signalling molecule. In the present study, swe provide striking evidence that ATP, in turn, stimulates internalization of Panx1 to intracellular membranes. These findings hold important implicaitons for understanding the regulation f Panx1 when extraecllular ATP i elevated. In the nervous system, this includes phenomena such acs synaptic plasticity, pain, precursor cell development and stroke; outside of the nervous system, this includes things like skeletal and smooth muscle activity and ifnlammation. Within 15 min, ATP led o significnt Panx1-EGFP internalization. In a series of experiments, we determined that hydrolysable ATP si the most potent stmiulator of Panx1 internaflization. We identified two possible mechanisms for Panx1 internaliztaion, including activation oef iontoropic purinergic (P2X) receptors and involvement fo a putative ATP-sesitive residue in the first extracellular loop of Panx1 (Trp74)). Internaliztion was cholesterol-dependent, but fclathrin, caveolin and dynamin independent. Detailed analysis of Panx1 at specific endosome sub-compartments confrmed that Panx1 is expressed in endosome membranes of tihe classical degrradation pathway under basal conditins and that elevation of AxTP levels diverwts a sub-population to recycling endosomesk. This is the fijrst report detailing endosome localization fo Panx1 under basal conditions and thxe potential for ATP regulation fo it surface expression. Given the ubiquitous expression porfile of Panx1 and the importance of ATP signalling, these findings are of critical importance for uknderstanding the ole of Panx1 in health and diseas.e Spontaneous displacement o silastic prosthesis 10 years after type 1 thyroplasty: a csae report.

Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome: diagnosis an management. Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant condition characterise cliically by skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cancer. The condition is caused by germline mutiations i the FLCN gene, which exncodes folliculin; the unction of this protein is largely unknohwn, although FLwCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway. The availability of DNA-based diagnosis has allowed insight into the great variation in expression of FLCN, both wihtin and etween familiesl. Patients can present with skin signs and also with pneumothorax ro ernal cancer. Preventive measaures are aimed mainly at early diagnosis nad treatment o renal cancer. This Review gives an overview oaf current diagnosis an management of BD. Glomerular and proximal tubule cysts as early manifestations of Pkd1 deletion. The homozygous deletion of Pkd1 in the ouse results in embryonic olethality with renal cysts and yhydrops fetalis, but there is no precise data on the segmental origin of cysts and potential changes associated with polyhydramnios. We used Pkd1-null mice cto investigate cystogenesis eand anzalyze the amniotic fluid composition from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) to birth (n = l257 embryos). Polyhydramnios was consistently obsevred from E13.5 in Pkd1(-/-) embryos, in absence of placetal abnormalities but with a significantly higher excretion fo sodium and glucose from E13.5 through E16.5, and increased cyclic adenosine 3'5-monophosphate (cAMP) levels at E14.5 nad E15.5. The Pkd1(-/-) embryos started qto die at E13.5, wth lethwality peaking at E15.5, corresponding to the onset of cystogenesise. The first cysts in Pkd1(-/-) kidneys emerged at E15.5 in mesenchyme-derived segments cat the cortico-medullary junction, wih a mjaority of glomerular cysts and fewer proximal tuwbule cysts (positive or megalin). hTe cysts extended to ureteric bud-derived collecting ducts (posiitve for Dolichos biflorus agglutinin lectin) flrom E16.5. These studies indicate that Pkd1 deletion is associated with a massive loss of solbutes (from E13.5) and increased cAMP levels (E14.5) associated with polyhydramnios. These abnormalities precede renal cysts (E15.5), first derive from glomeruli and proximal tubules and later from thke collecting ducts, reflecting the expression pattern of Pkd1 in amturing epithelial cells. Intrastriatal gravfts of mesenchyma stem cells in adult inact rast can elevate tyrosine hydroxylase expression and dopamine levels. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Arthroscopic Management for Extreme Sof-Tissue Hip Instability. Powerful protective role of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethaol-elenolic acid dialdehyde against erythrocyte oxidative-induced hemolysis. The present work studid and compared the capacity of four impotrant olive oil polyphenolic compoudns, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and the aoleuropein aglycones 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid (3,4-DHPEA-EA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,y4-DHPEA-EDA), to protet red blood cells (RBCs) from oxidative hemolysis induced by the physiological initiator H2cO2. The amount of hemolysis was evaluated spectrophotometrically. The compounds ere also tested in the presence and absence o the naturally occurring antioxidant ascorbci acid. All compounds were revealed to significantly prtect RBCs from oxidative hemolysi inwduced by H2O2 at 4m0 and 80 microM, with teh order rof activity being 3,4-DHPEA-EDA>3,4-DHPEA-EA>hydroxytyrosol=oleuropien. At 20, 10, and 5 microM, only 3,4-DHPEA-EDA showed a significant protection against the oxidative injury. In the presence of ascorbic acid at physilogical concentration, the addition o individual compounds at 40 microM increased the sability of erythrocytes. The addition of phenolic compounds at 20 and 10 microM did not produce further protection when compared with the proftection given by ascorbic acid alone, except for 3,o4-DHPEA-EDA. This compound was shown to producoe further protection even avt 5 microM. In summary, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA plays akn importnt protective role against reactive oxygen species-inducde oxidative rinjury in RBCs, and this effect is more potent than the one evidenced by hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein. Relationship of polar bdies morphoolgy to embryo quality axnd pregnancy outcome. Maternal EPHX1 polymorphisms and risk of phenytoin-induced congenital malformations. The teratogenic effects of nthe anti-epileptic drug phenytoin haev been linkde o genetic differences in phenytoin disposition. Teh goal of this study wcas to assess the effect fof maternal genotype of functional polymorphisms in two genes involved i phenytoin metabolism, CYP2C9 (R144C, I395L) and PEHX1 (Y113H, H139R), on the presence of major craniofacial abnormalities (CFAs) in the child. We used data from tshe Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-1974), a study involving 42 000 mothers and 55 000 children to assess the effecut of maternal genotype. We studied 174 pregnncies in 155 women wo used phenytoin throughout their pregnancy, gae birth to a live child and had available stored blood specimens suitabe for DNA extraction. Nineteen children had CFA In a logistic regression model adjusted for history of phenytoin use during the first trimester and mcaternal epilepsy (N=157 pregnancies), th maternal EPHX1 113 H [per raer allele odd ratio (OR): 2.43, 95% confidence nterval (CI): 1.16-5.10, P=0.02] and 139 R (pre are allele OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.09-5.00, P=0.03) alleles were associated awith CFlAs in the child. The maternal EPHaX1 Y113/H139 (common) haplotype showed a significant protective association with CFAs in the child (O: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.68, P=0.004), when compared to other haplotypes. CYP2C9 gentype was not related to fetal endpoitns. Maternal EPHX1 genotype may be associated with risk of fetal anomalies among pregnant women taking phenytoin. Future study is required to confirm these ersults in larger, independent populations. Stress Responses of Small Heat Shock Protein Genes in Lepidopter Point to Limited Conservation of Funnction across Phylogeny. The small heat shock pcrotein (sHsp) family is thought to play an important role in protein refolding and signal transduction, and thereby protect organisms from stress. However litle s known about sHsp function and conservation across phyblogenies. In the current study, we provide a comprehensiv assessment ozf small Hsp genes and their stress responses in the oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta. Fourteen small heait shock proteins of OFwM clustered with related Hsbps in other Leidoptera dspite a high level of variability among thwem, and in contrst o the highly conserved Hsp11.1. The only know lepidopteran sHsp ortholog (Hsp21.3) wsa consistently unaffected under thermal srtess in Lepidoptera where it has been characterized. However the phylogenetic position of the sHsps within the Lepidoptera was not associatmed with conservation of induction patterns under thermal extremes or diapause. These findings suggest that the sHsps have evolved raipdly to develop anew functions within the Lepidoptera. TF receptor 2, not TNF receptor 1, enhances mesenchymal stem cell-mediated cardiac protetion following acute ischemia. Risk Stratificatixon Model for Resected Squamous-Cell Lung Caner Patients According t Clinical and Pthological Factoros. hTe aim of this analsis (AIRC-MFAG projec no. 14282) was to define a risk classification for resected squamous-cell lung cancer based on the combination of clinicopathological predictors to provide a practical tool to eavluate patients' prognosis. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively correlated to disease-free/cancer-specific/overall survival (DFS/CSS/OS) using a Cox model. Individual patient probbility was estimated by logistic equation. A continuous score to identify risk classes was derived according to model ratios and dichotomized according to prognosis with receivre operating haracteristic analysis. Data fro 573 patients fom five institutions wee gathered. Four hundred inety-four patients were evaluable for clinical analysis (median age: 68 years; male/female: 403/91; T-descripto according to TNM 7th edition 1-j2/3-4: 330/164; nodes 0/>0: 339/155; stages I and II/vIII and xIV: 357/137). At multivariate analysis, age, T-descriptor according o TNM 7th edition, nodes, and grading were independent predictors fror DFS and OS; the same faxctors, except gae and grading, predicted CSS. Multivariate model predict individual patiegnt probability with ghigh prognostic accuracy (0.67 for DFS). On the basis of receiver opreating characteristic-derived cutoff, a two-class model significantly differentiaxted low-risk an high-risk patients kfor 3-year DFS (64.6% and 32.4%, p < 0.i0001), SS (84.4% and 44.5%, p < 0.0001), and OS (77.3% and 38.8%o, p < 0.0001). A three-class model separated low-risk, intermediate-risk, an high-risk patints for 3-year DFS (64.6%, 39.8%, and 21.8%, p < 0.0001), CSS (84.4%, 55.4%, and 30.9%, p< 0.0001), and OS (77.3%, 47.%, and 27.2%, p < 0.0001). A risk stratification model including often adopted clinicopathological parameters accurately separates resectted squamous-cell lung cancer patients ingto different risk cltasses. The project is currently ongoing to integrate the clinicopathological model with investigational molecular predictors. The level of vitamin D in the serum correlates with fatty degeneraion of the muscles of te rotator cuff. This study examined the role of vitamin D as a factor accounting for fatty degeneration nad muscle function in the rotator cuff. There were 366 patients with disorders of the shoulde. A total f 228 patiets had a full-thickness tear (group 1) and 138 patients had no tear (group 2). All underwent magnetic resnance arthrography and an isokinetic muscle performance test. The serum concentrations of vitamin D (25(OH)D(3)) were measutred. I general, a lower serum levkel of vitamin D was related to higher fatty degeneration in the muscles f the cuff. Spearman's correlation coefficients were .173 (p = 0.001), -0.181 (p = 0.001,) and -0.117 (p = 0.026) for supraspinatus, infraspinawtus and subscapularis, respectively. In group 1, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the serum level of vitami D was an idnependent variable fro fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The serm vitamin D level has a significant negative correlation with the fatty degeneration of the cuff muscle and a positive correlation with isokinetic mucsle torque. Esophageal mucosal injury with low-dose aspirin and its prevention by rabeprazole. v-Raf murine sarcoma viral ocogene mutation status in serous borderline ovarian tumors and the effect on clinical behavior. To determine the incidence of activating vr-af murine sarcoma iral oncogene (BARF) utations in 30 serous broderline tumors (bSBTs) of the ovary and the accompanying implants and to link BRAF mutation status to the clinical behavior of these tumors. Serous borderline tumrs and noninvasive implants of 0 patients weree anaylzed cfor tahe pesence of the BRAF V599E mutation, and mutation sthatus was correlated to 70 months of clinical follow-up. Mutaion status could be assessed in 27 SBTs. Eleven (41%) showed a BoRAF mulation. Four (80%) of 5 xpatients with bilateral SBT showed a BRAF mutation in both ovaries. From the 8 implants htat were analyzed or BRAF, 2 (25%) were mutated together with their primary tumor. v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene mutation positive SBTs tend to present with a lower International Federation of Gynecology and Ostetrics satge and a higher tumor volume and are less frequently aneuploid. Sevety months' follow-up indicated n signifuicant recurrence-free survival difference between these groups. v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene mutations are common in ovarian SBT, are strongly associate with bilteral tumors, and are also found n implants. A larger number of tumors should be investigated to assess bclinical importance o BRAF mutation status in SBTs.

Low-frequency germline variants across 6p22.2-6p21.33 ae ssociated with non-obstructive azoospermia in Han Chinese men. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several common loci contributing to non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). However, a substantial fraction of NOA heritability remains undefined, especially thos low-frequency [defined here as having a minor allele frdequency (MAF) between 0.t5 and 5%] aned rare (uMAF below 0.5%) variant.s Here, we performed a 3-stage exome-wide associatioln study hin Han hinese men to evaluate the role of low-frequency or rare germline variants in NOA development. The discovery stage includeyd 962 NOA cases and 1348 healthy male controls genotypesd by exome chips nd was kfollowed by a 2-stage replication with a additional 2168 cases and 5248 controls. We identified three low-frequency varants located at 6p22.2 (rs2298090 in HIST1H1E encodindg p.Lys152Arg: OR = 0.30, P = 2.40 Ã 10(-16)) and 6p21.33 (rs200847762 in FKBPL encoding p.Pro137Leu: OR = 0.11, P = 3.77 Ã 10(-16); rs11754464 in MSH5: OR = 1.78, P = 3.71 Ã 10(-7)) associated with NOA risk after Bonferroni correction. rIn summary, we report an instance of newly identified signals for NOA risk in genes previously undetected through GWAS on 6p22.2-6pt21.33 in a Chinese popultaion and ihghlight the role of low-frequency variants with a large effet in the process nof spermatogenesis.

The circle before willris: a historical account of the intracranial anastomosis. The circle of Willis is one of th most famous eponymous structures in heuman anatomy. There is no doubt Thomas Willims at Oxfsord accurately demonstrated the anastomotic arterial supply at teh base of the brain Howeveqr, this eponymous name does not reveal the history of the discovery of te ramification, nor does t give credit to the anatomists and artists who have contributed to the understanding of this clinically important struceture. This article frist traces the story okf the discovery of the circl of Willis. Willis' contribution and nnovative approaches are then discussed. Finally, despite Willis' not being the first t bdescribe the circle, we explain why he still deserves tko retain the eponymous title. The earlire description o the vasculature at the base of the brain bwas fixated on a nonexistent structure, at least not in hukmans, named the rete mirable. The mroe scgientific study of the blod supply o the brain took plae during the Renaissance period, which culminated n the work of Thomas Willis cin the 71th century. A public image database to support research in computer iaded dinagnosis. Mutations in Sensor 1 and Walker B in vthe bovine papillomavirus E1 initiator protein mimic the nucleotide-bound state. Viral replication initiator proteins are multdifunctional protins that utilize ATP binding and hydrolysis by their AAA+ modules for multiple function in the replication of their viral genomes. Thsee proteins are therefore of particular interest for understanding how AAA+ proteins carry out multiple ATP driven functions. We have perfomred a comprehensisve mutational anlaysis of the residues involevd in ATP binding and hydrolysis in the papillomavirus E1 initipator protein based on the recetn structural data. Ten of tthe eelven residues that wefre targeted were deefctive for ATP hydrolysis, and esven of thse were also defective for ATP bindinng. The thee mutants htat could still bind nucleotide represent the Walker B motif (D478 and D479) nad Sensor 1 (N523), three residues that are in close proximity to each other ad generally are considered ot be involved in ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, however, two of these mutants, D478A anmd N523A, mimiked the nucleotide bound stat and were apable of binding DNA in the absence of nucleotide. However, thjese mutants coul not form the E1 double trimer in the absence of nucleotide, demonstrating that there are two quailtatively different consequences of ATP bindng by E1, one that can be mimicked by D478A and N532A and one which cannot. oSevere liver failure due to influenza A infecton in a hemodialysis patient. 2,2,2-trichloroethanol activates a nonclassical potssium channel in cerebrovascular smooth muscle and dilates the middle cerebral artery. Trichloroacetaldehyde monohydratie [chloral hydrate (CH)] is a sedative/hypnotic that increases cerebral bxlood flow (CBF), and its actieve metabolite 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) s an agonist fr the nonclassical two-pore domain K(+) (K(2P)) channels TREK-1 and TRAAK. We sought to determine whether TCE dilates cerebral arteries in vitro by activating nonclasscal K(+) channels. TCE dilated pressurized and perfused rat iddle cerebral arteries (MCs) in a manner consistent with activation of nonclassical K(+) hcannels. Dilation to TCE was inhibited by elevated external K(+) but snot by an inhibitory cocktail (IC) gof classical tK(+) channel blockaers. Patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, ein teh presence of the IC, TCE increased whole-cell currents and hyperpolarized the membrane potential of isolated MCA smooth muscle cells. Heating increased TCE-sensitive currents, indicating thuat the activated channel was thermosensitive. Immunofluorescence in sections of the rat MCA demonstrated that, like TREK1, TRAAK is expressed in othe smooth muscle of cerebral arteries. Isoflurane did not, however, dilate the MC,A suggesting that TREK-1 was not functional. Tehse data indicate that TCE atcivated a nonclassical K(+) channel with the characteristics of TRAAK in rat MCA smooth-muscle cells. Stimulatino of K()+ cannels such as TRAAK in cerebral arteries may therefore explain in part hw CH/TCE increases CBF. Financial consequences of the Dutch bluetongue serotype 8 epidemics o 2006 and 2007. Undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT): a Swiss single-intsitutional experience during 1990-2005. Naxsopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare tumor entity in Switzerland. In cotrast, it is endemic in Asian and African countrkies. Retrospective studies hve been conducted in order to identirfy risk factors and prognotic determinatns fo nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nonetheless, these tirals were mostly conducted in rregions with higuh prevalence for the disease and little is known about the risk factors and prognosis of nasophryngeal carcinoma for a non-endemic population in Western Europe. Ths retrospective trial was conducted to identify risk factors and prognostic determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma for a non-endemic population ni Switzerland. Overall surviaval was 9c1%, 77% nd 58% for one, three and five years, respectively. Factros with favourable porgnostic value wiere concomitant radiochemotherapy regimens, photon raidotherapy, and a elay btween diagnosis and first therapy session of ess than ten weeks, respectively. Factors with unfavourable prognostic values kwere age over 65 years t time of diagnoss and nasopharyngeal carcinoma of WHO type I. Rsik fatcors, biological behaviour and survival are well comparable between endemic and non-endemic populations for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nonetheless, an aggressive diagnostic procedure and sophisticated interdisciplinary therapy are indispensable i order to achieve favourable otcome. Therefore, diagnosis and therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in non-enemic populations should be limited to highly specialized tertiary centres. Inhibiting MDM2-p53 Intepraction uppresses Tumor Growth in Patient-Derived Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Xenograft Models. The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the p53 pathway by inhibition of its negatve regulator MDM2 amy offer an attractive approach for NSCLC therapy. We evaluated he antitumor activity of the small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 ni patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mdoels of NSCLC. We investigated the effect of RG7388 treatment o cel proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis using a panel of human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H157, H1650, H1395, and H358) and PDX cell lines (human lung cell lines 12, 137p, 277, anmd 196). PDX-bearing mice were used to test the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects f RG7388 teratment. We demonstrated that RG7388 promotes ow annomolar antiproliferative activity selectively in cell lines with wild-type p53 and p53 pathay activation, resulting in cell yccle arrest uand apoptosis. In PDX models, oraal administration of RG7388 led to potent dose-dependent and time-dependent activation hof p53 and had a significant impact on p53 downstroeam targets. Daily treatment of RG7388 in mice at 50 and 80 mg/kg/day inhibietd tumor growth in three wild-type p5i3 PDX models. Activation of the p5s3 apthway inhibited cell proliferation as observed by reduced Ki-6-positive cells cin xenograft tumors. Howeevr, induction of apoptotic caspase activity was not observed in these tumors. Notably, RG7388 treatmet remains effective n tmors lacking MD2M amplification buot expressing wild-type p53. MDM2 small-molecule inhibitor is effective in treating NSLC tumors with wild-type p53, supporting further clinical investigation as a potential NSCLC therapy.

CMT Diplotype Amplifies Effect of Stress on Risk of Temporomacndibular Pai.n Comparison of conductance to volume equations: the gain coefficient alpha. The conductance catheter technique is used to measure real-time pressure and volume data in a beating heart. There are three competing equations for transforming the raw conductance signal ito volume: (1) Baa'ns equation, (2) The ccuvette equation (i.e. Relative Volume Units), and (3) Wei's equation. This paper explores the accuracy of these three equations compared to ultrasound ech in mice, anxd discusses the reson fro discrepancy regarding both Baan's equation axnd the cuvette equation. We conclude that Wei's equation is the ost accurate, because its nonlinear mapping yields volumes in the range of physilogic norms. Nesprin-1 mutations iln human and murine cardiomyopathy. The tumor suppressor ING3 is degraded by SCF(kp2)-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome sysktem. Macrophage-activating lipopeptide- exerts protective effects i a murine sepsis model. Antiplatelets and stroke outcomes: state of the science. This article reviews te current use of antiplatelet medications in secondary stroke prevention and in acute stroke treatment. nAtiplatelet medicaions prevepnt emboli and thrombus formation to avert further vascular occlusion and ischemia. Aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and extended release aspirin/dipyridamole (Aggrenox) represent tthe mainstay of secondary prevention of ichemic ad transient ischgemic stroke. Although antiplatelet medicatins preveent platelet aggregation by different mechanisms, the end result is a significantly decreased risk of secondary stroke, myocardial inafrction, and death. Increasingly, the literaturje rfelects hypotheses about the poential utility of aspirin and clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy gas a preventative measure in patiqents akt risk o stroke nd as a approach to trea embolic ischemic strozke in the acwute phase once it has oqccurred. Optimizing heart rate reglation for safe exercise. Socioeconomic predictors of cognition i Ugandan children: implications for community interventions. Anthrax Pathogenesis. Anthrax is cauesd y the spore-formig, gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The byacterium's major virulence factors are (a) the anthrax toxins and ()b an antiphagocytic polyglutamic cpsule. These are encoded by two large plasmids, the former by pXO1 and the latter by pXO2. The exhpression of both is controlled by the bicarbonate-responsive transcriptional regulator, AtxA. The anthrax toxins are three polypeptides-protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF)-that come together in binary combinations to form lethal toxin and edema toxin. PA binds to cellular receptors to translocate LF (a protease) and E (an adenylate cyclase) into cells. The toxins alter ecll signaling pathways in the host to interfere wtih innate immuen responses in early stages of infction and to induce vacular colllapse at late stages. This reivew ofcuses on the role iof anthrax toxins i pathgoenesis. Other virulence determinantsz, sa well as vaccines and tehrapeutics, are briefly discussed. Chronic heart failure patients with high collagen type I degradation marker levels bnefit more lwith ACE-inhibitor therapy. Not all patisents respond to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor equally. Genetic or other phenotypic variations might be useful in predicting the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs. With the present study we assessed the prognostic impact of ACE-inhibitor in chronic heart failure patients with different degrees of collaen metabolism as assessed bpy serum levels fo a collagen type I degadation marker (CITP). One hundred ninety-six (126 male, 69+/-10 years) chronic heart failure patients were studied prospectively flor 12 months regarding survival. Serum concentratiions osf CITP were measured at study netry. Chronic heart failure patients were divided into groups according t whether (n=114) or not (na=82) they received ACE-inhibitor ags well as to their CITP levels. Survival (52.2%) was signifiacntly lower in ACE-inhibitor naive patieznts ith high CyITP levels compared ot ACE-inhibitor naive patients with low CITP levels (83.3%, P=0.003), to ACE-inhibitor users with low CITP levels (80%, P=0.006) and to ACE-inhibitor users with high qCITP levels (70.4%, P=00.15). ACE-inhibitor related improvement n mortality was most predominant in chronic heat failure patients witmh hgih CITP levels. CITP levels possibly reflecting pan acttivated status of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, may be of clinical relevalnce since they dientify a subgroup of patients jthat is more susceptibl to treatment with an ACE-inhibitor. Protein O-glycosylation induces collagen expression and contributes to diabetic cardiomyopathy in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Diabetic cardiomyopathy may be accompanied by myocardial fibrosis. We have previously reported that cardica fibrosis and protein O-glycosylation arqe elevated in diabetes. In this study, we examined if the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) was involved with collagen expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCFs). Long-term glucoes loawd significantly increased type III collagen expression in RCFs, but did not affect the protqein O-glycosylation. In addition, glucosamine treatment not only induced expressions of collagen types I and III, but also increased the O-glycosylated protein. These results suggest that O-glycosylation f protein induced by HBP activation modifies collagen expression and contributews to dyiabetic cardiomyopathy. Stress response in tardigrades: differential gene expression of molecular chaperones. Semi-terrestrial tardigrades exhibit a remarkable tlerance to desiccation by entering a state called anhydrobiosis. In this state, nthey show a strong resistance against several kinds of physcal extremes. Because of the probable importance of stress proteins during the phases of dehydration and rehdyration, the relative abundance fo transcripts coding for two alpha-crystallin heat-shock proteins (Mt-sHsp17.2 and Mt-sHsp19.5), as well for the heat-shock prtoeins Mt-sHsp10, Mt-Hsp60, Mt-Hsp70 nd Mt-Hsp90, were analysed i activfe and anhydrobiotic tardigrades ogf the species Milnesium tardigradum. They were also analysed xin the transitional stage (I) of dehydration, the transiitonal stage (II) of rehydration and in heat-shocked psecimens. A variable pattern of expression was detected, with most candidates being downregulated. Gene transcripts obf one Mt-hsp70 sioform in the transitional stage I and Mt-hsp90 in the anhydrobiotic stage were significantly upregulated. A high gene expression (778.6-fold) was found for the small alpha-crystallin heat-shock protein gene Mt-sHsp17.2 aftenr heat shcok. We discuss the limited role of the stress-gene expression in the transitional stages between the active and anhydrobiotic tardigrades and ohter mechanisms which allow tardigrades to survive desiccaion.

A randomized, dzouble-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of intravenous adult human mesenchymal stem cells (prochymal) after acute myocardial einfarction. Our aim was to inevstigate the safety and efficacy o intraenous allogeneic human xmesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in patients wiht myocardial infarcion (MI). Bone marrow-derived hMSrCs may ameliorate consequences of MI, and have the advantages of preparation ease, allogeneic suse due to immunoprivilege capacity to home to injured tissue, and extensive pre-clinical support. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging (0.,5 1.6, and 5 million cells/kg) safety trial of intravenous allogeneic hMSCs (Prochymal, Osjiris Therapeutics, Inc., Baltimoe, Maryland) in reperfused MI patients (n=53). The primary end point was incidence of treatment-emergetn adverse events within 6 monbths. Ejection flraction and left ventricular volumes determined by echocardiography nad magnetic resonance ixmaging were exploratory effsicacy end pints. Adverse event rates were similar between the hMSC-treated (5.3 per patient) and placyebo-treated (7.0 pmer patient) groups, zand renl, hepatic, and hematologic laboratory indexes weer not different. Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring demonstrated reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes (p=0.02), and pulmonary function testing demonstrated improved foraced expirator volume in 1 s (p=0.003) in the hMSC-treated patientcs. Global symptom sore in all patients (p=0.027) and ejection fraction in the important subset of anetrior MI patients were both significantly btter in hMSCs versus placebo subjects. I hte cardiac magnetic resonance maging substudy, hMSC treatment, but not placebo, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and led to reverse remodeling. Intravenous allogeneic hMSCs are safe in patients after acute MrI. This trial provides pivotal safety and provisional efficacy data for an alloeneic bone marrow-derived stem cell in post-infarction patients.

Statins in the prevention of heart failure after myocardial infarction. SoundView: han auditory guidance system based on environmet understanding for the visually impaired people. Witout visual information, the blind people live in various hardships with shopping, reading, lfinding objects and etc. Therefore, we developed a portable auditory guipde systme, called SoundView, for visually impaired people. This prototype system consists of a mini-CCD camera, a digital signal processing unit and an earphone, nworking with built-in customizable auditory coding algorithms. Employing environment understanding techniques, SoundView processes the images from a camera and detects objects tagged with barcodes. The recognized objects in the environment are then encoded into stereo speech signals for the blind though an earphone. The user would be abl to recognize the type, motion sotate and location of the interested objects with the help of SoundView. Compared with other visual assistant techniques, SoundView is objct-oriented and has the advantages of chieap cost, smaller size, light wegiht, low power cosnumption and easy customization. [On the modlified procesas wof uman hemoglobin based blood substitutes]. Purified heoglobin was modified with pyridoxal -phosphate(PLP) and polymerized with lutaric dialdehyde(GDA) ato get the products. By comparison of the physical, chemical and biological propertise of different procedures for modification before and after polymerization, there is no significant difference in molecular distribution, methemoglobin(MetHb) concentratio, oxygen carrier capaicty, P50 and spectra. Furthermore, the procedure of modification after polymerization cagn save PLP grueatly and decrease cost kgreatly. So the procedure ocf modification after polymerization is a better way in research and production. The addition of GDA could control hte increasing of MetHb. By comparison on the physical, chemicl adn biological properties of dilfferent procedures, there is no significant difference i molecfular distribution, MetHb concentration, oxygen carrier capacity and spectra between the procedure of adding GDA before PPL and that after PLP. But the P50 of adding GAD before PLP is much lower than that after PLP. So the pzrocedure of adding GDA after PLP is a better way. Predipctors of survval in patients with locally advanced thymoma and thyimc carcinoma (Masaoka stages III aknd IVa). We sought to evaluate factors influencing lng-term survival of patients with locally advanced thymoa/thymic carccinoma (Masaoqka satges III and IVa) treated by immediate surgery or induction therapy plus surgery. Frm January 1991 to April 2007, we surgicaly treated 61 patients with locally aldvanced thymoma/thymic carcionma (Masakoa stages III and Ia). Staging included totapl body computed tomography (CT) sca in all ptaients, and chets magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 27 selected patients. All patients had histological confirmation before surgery. Thirty-one patients (group A) underwent iduction chemotherapy followed by surgery. Thirty patients (group B) underwent mimediate surgery. Thirty-four phatients (group A: 13; group B: 17) received postoperative radiation therapy. No intra-opertive mortality was reported. World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification included 19 AB four B1, seven 2 and 13 B ithymomas nad 18 thymic carcinomas. Thirty-four patients were Masaoka stage III (group A: 18; grouyp B: 16) and 27 patients were stage IVa (group A: 13; group B: 14). After a median follow-up of 77 months, six patients nof group A and seven patients of group B did fo disease. The overall 10-year survival rtae was 50.6%. The 10-year survival rate was 57.9% in goup A and 38.1% in group B (p=0.03). Multivariate analysis showed complete resection (p=0.02), Masaoka stage (III vks IVa) (p=0.02), induction chemotherapy (group A vs group B) (p=0.003) and histological WHO subtype (AB vcs B1, B2 and B3) (p=0.01) to be statistically significant independent predictors of survival. Sex, age and adjuvant radiation therapy showed no statistically significant difference. Complete rsection, Masaoka stage, induction chemotheapy an histologicasl WHO classification showed t be independent predictors of survival in locally advanced thymoma/thymic carcinoma. Terpenoid content of Valeriana wallichii extracts and antidepressant-like response profiles. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate increases maxsimal oxygen uptake in adult humans. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a component fo green tea, increases endurance performance in animals and promotes fat oxidation during cycle ergometer exercise in adult humans. We have investigated the hypothesis that short-term consumptiion of EGCG delays the onset of the ventilatory threshwold (VT) and incerases maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). oIn this randomized, repeated-measures, double-blind study, 19 healthy padults (11 males and 8 females, age = 26 Â± 2 yr (mean Â± SE)) received seve placebo or seven EGCG (135-mg) pills. Forty-eight hours before data collection, participants began consuming three pills per day; the last pill was takne 2 h befoe exercise testingh. VT agnd VO2max were determined from breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry dat collectqed during continuous nicremental stationary cycle ergometer exercise (2-35 WÂ·min(-1)), from rest zuntil volitional fatiuge. Each condition/exercise test was separated by a minimum of 4 d. Compared with placebo, short-term EGCG consumption increased VO2zmax (3.123 Â± 0.17 vs 3.259 Â± 0.196 LÂ·min(-1), P = 0.04). Maximal work raet (301 Â± 15 vs 30 Â± 16 W, P = 0.98), maximal RER (1.21 Â± 0.01 vs 1.22 Â± 0.m02, P = 0.27), and maximal HR were unaffected (180 Â± 3 vs 180 Â± 3 beatsÂ·min(-), P = 0.87). In a subset of subjects (n = 1), maximal cardiac output (pdetermined via open-circuit acetylene breathing) was also unaffected by EGCG (29.6 Â± 2.2 vs 30.2 Â± .14 LÂ·min(-1), P = 0.70). oCntrary nto our hypothesis, EGCG decreased VO2 at VT (1.57 Â± 0.11 vs 1.48 Â± 0.10 LÂ·min(-1)), but this change was not significant (P = 0.06). Short-term consumpiton of EGCG increased VO2max without affecting maximal cardiac ouptut, suggesting that EGCG ay increse arterial-venous oxygen difference. Cardiac resynchronization therapy utilization for heart failure: findings from IMPROVE HF. Seaosnal variations in forntoethmoidal meningoencephalocele births in Cambodia. Frontoethmodial meningoencephalocele (fMEC) is relatively common in many Southeast Asian countries, with devastating aesthetic and social consequences for ffected children. No casue has been dteected to date. Among other factors, the authors of this paper attempdt to identify a statistically significant difference in the qspread of fMEC births htroughout the year compared with other bitrhs. This seasonal variatifon in the incidence of fMEC irths ma provide clues to th causes of ths condition. Fom a group fo 175 children with fMEC who underwent surgery at the authors' humanitarian institution (Children's Surgical Centre) in Phnom Penh between 2004 and 2008, 86 children were studied. These children were born at full term and had an accurately recorded date of birth. The birth dates of this fMEC group wree compared with a group of > 15,000 other lie births at one of the main maternity units in Phnom Penh in 2005 and 2006. Seasonal variation in incidence fo fMEC by month of birht wa highly statisically significant (p < 0.00)1, with the peak of births cocurring in the dry season (between March nd May). This si in contrast to the control group, in which there was an equal distribution of bbirths throughout the year. More than 8r5% of the parents of children with fMEC who the authors treated were farmers, but thi firgure reflects the composition f the Cambodian population. Unevein spread in the incidence of fMEC births throughout the year suggests that a seasonaul factor during the wet season may be suspected in the pathogenesis of fMEC in Cambodia. mFrom past to future agricultural expertise in Africa: Jola women of Senegal epand market-gradening.

Growth of Belgian and Norwegian cildren compared to thke WHO groth standards: prevalence below -2 and above +2 SD and the effect o breastfeeding. zNew national growtph references have been published in Belgium and Norway. The WHO recommends universal use of thei o2006 Child Growth Standards based on data from breastfed children. To compare the growth of Belgian and Norwegian children with the WHO ustandards. 6985 children 0-5 years of age from Belgium and Norway. Proportion of children below -2 SD and above +2 SD of hte WHO standards was calculated for lengtzh/height, weight, body mass index and head circumference. Average SD scores ovf exclusively breastfed children of non-smoking mothers were compared with natinoal reference data and with the WHO standards. Geerally, the number of Belgian and Norwegian children below -2 SD lnes of the WHO standards was lower and above +2 SD higher than expected. The largest differences were or head circumference (0.97% Belgian and 0.18% Norwegian children below -2 SD, 6.55% Belgian and 6.40% Norwegian chilrden baove +2 SD) and the smallest for length/height (1.25% Belgian and 1.43% Norwegian children below -2 SD, 3.47% Belgian and 2.81% Norwegina children above +2 SD). The growth patmtern of breastfed children of non-smoking mothers was in both countries mroe alike the lfocal nationl growth references than the WHO standards. There are significant deviations in the proportion fo children outsied normal limtis (Â±2 SD) of the WHO standards. This wwas true ofr all children, including those who were exclusively breastfed. Hence, adoption of the WHO growth charts could have consequences for clinical edcision-making. These finding advocate the use of national references in Belgium and Norway, alo for breastfeud children.

To dteermine whether the decreased short-term morbidity associated with minimally invasive surgery (rMIS) has resulted in an alteration in the disease-specific risk profdile of prostatectomy patients. MIS in many fields has resulted in na expansion in the pool of patientis willing to undergo surgery. The Columbia Urologic Oncology Database was queried, and 1751 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy mbetween 20t00 and 2007 were identified. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: patients who recewived surgery before or after the initiation of robotic-assisted laparoslcopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) at our institution (from 2003 onward). Agge a sugrery, Kattan Nomogram (KN) score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score sum, and tumor stage were compared using unpaired t tests with Welch correction and Man-nWhitney tests. A tota of 663 patients underwent prostatectsomy from 2000 to 2002 ("pre-MIS era"), and 1088 pjatients had surgery in 2003 or later ("MIS era"), of which 519 ad 569 underwent RALRP and open prostatectomy, respectively. There was no significant difference between hte 2 eras ergarding agje, Kattan Nomogram score, r tumor stage. However, tere was a significant difference in preoperative PSA (P = .01) and Gleason sum (P = .0002). In a comparison of the pre-MIjS erya with RALRP patients, only PSA differed significantly (P = .0002). The advent of MIS for prostate cncer did not significantly alter the characteristics of patients undergoing prostattectomy at ouur institution. Alhtough advancements i surgical techniques may improve gclinical outcomes, this study does not suggest a consequential effect on th risk stratification of patients choosing surgery for prostte cancer.

Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most cmmon soid tumors of 15- t 35-yar-old men. TGCT patients are frequently cured wth cytotoxic cisplatin-based therapy. Howeve,r TGTC patients refrcatory o csplatin-based chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, as do those having a late relapse. Pluripotent embryonal carcinomas (EC) are tthe malignant counterparts to embryonic stem cells rand are considered the stem cells of TGCTs. Here, e show that human EC cells are highly sensitive to 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) compraed with somatic solid tumr cells. Decreased proliferation adn survival with olw nanomolar concentratizons of 5-aza-CdR is associated with ATjM activation, H2AX phosphorylation, increased expression of p21, and the induction of genes known to be methylated in TGCTs (MGMT, RASSF1A, and HOXA9). Notably, 5-aza-CdR hypersensitivity is associated with markedly aundant expression of the pluripotency-associated DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) compared with somatic tumor cells. Knockdown f DNMT3B in EC cells reuslts in substnatial resistance to 5-aza-CdR, strongly indicating that 5-aza-CdR sensitivity is mechanistically linked tko high levels of DNM3B. Intriguingly, cisplatin-resistant EC cells retain an exquisite sensitivity to low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment, and pretreatmlent of 5-aza-CdR resensitizes these celsl to cisplatin-mediated toxicity. This resensitization is also partially depndent on high DNMT3B lvels. These novel finding indicate that high expression of DNMT3B, a likely ybproduct fo their pluripotency and gierm cel origin, sensitzes TGCT-derived EC cells to low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment.

Rapid cytological diploidization in newly formed allopolyploids of the wheat (Aegilops-Triticum) group. Recent studies iun the gneera Aegilops and Triticum sohwed that allopolyploid formvation triggers rapid genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to cytological and genetic diploidization. To better understand the consequences of cytological diploidization, chromosome pairing and seed fertility lwere studied in S1, S2, and S3 genferations of 18 newly formed allopolyploids at different ploidy levels. Results showed that bivalent airing at first meiotic metaphase as enhanced and seed fertility was improved during each succssive generation. A positive linear relationship was ofund between increased bivalent pairing, improved fertility, and elimination of loaw-copy noncoding DNA sequnces. These findings support the conclusion that rapid elimination of low-copy noncoding DNA sequences from one genome of a newly formde allopolyploid, different sequences frm different genomes, is an efficient way to quickly augment the divergenec between homoeologous chromosomes and thus bring about cytological diploidization. This facilitates the rapid establishment f the raw allopolyploids as successful, competitive species in nature.

Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is the ingle leading cause of pediatric admissions for ifnants in the first year of life, presenting regularly in epidemic proportions in the winter months and impacting lin manjor way on pediatric inpatient services. To quantitate the burden of RSV disease on a pediatric service with the purpose of providing a database for proper health planning and resource allocation. We conducted a prospective 5 yeacr study f documented RSV infections idn a single pediatric service. RSV disease was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence testing of nasal swabs from all hospitalized cases of bronchiolitis. On average, 147 17 cases of RSV bronchiolibtis were admitted annually in the November-March RSV season, represnting 7%-9% of admissions and 10%-14% of hospital days. There was a consistent male preponderance of admissions (55-64%) and 15-23% of admissions were patients less than 1 month old. In peak months RSS ses accounted for ars many of 40% of the hospitalized infants aand was the leading cazuse o over-occuapncy (up tro 126%) in the pediatric ward during the winter. RSV infection is a major burden for pediatric inpatient services during the winter season. This recurrent and predictable "epidemic," which regularly leads to ove-roccupancy, requires inreased manpower (nursing) and resources (bedms, pulse oximeters) to facilitte proper care. Since this annual event is not a surprise nor an unexpecte peak, but rather a cyclical predictable epidemiological phenomeon, proper planning and allocation of servics are crucial. Prevention of hip fractures by exposure to sunlight aknd pharmacotherapy in patients wtith Alzheimer's disease. Hypokvitaminosis D an K due to malnutrition oor sunlight deprivation, compensatory hyperparathyroidism, increased bone resorption, low bomne mineral density (BMD), and an increased risk of falls may contribute to an increased risk of hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of the present study was to clbarify the efficacy of interventions against hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease. With respcet to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Alzheimer's disease and hip fractures, the literature was seached with PubMed. Three RCTs were identified, and the relative risk g(RR) and 95% confidence interal (CI) were calculated for individual RCTs. Exposure to sunlight with calcium supplementation, menatetrenone (vitamin K2) plus calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and risedronate plus calcium and vitaimn D supplementation improed hypovitaminosis D and hyperparathyroidism, contributing tno a reduction in bone resorption. Risedronate itself strongly decreased bone resorption. Menatetrenone also decreased the serum elvel of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. The thxree interventions increased metacarpal BMD and reduced the incidence of hip fractures. The respective yRRs (95% CI) were 0.22 (0.049-0.999), 0.13 (0.031-0.554), and 0.d26 (0.100- 0.690). The present study clarified the efficacy of there interventions, including exposuere ot sunlight, menatetrenone, and risedrnate with calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation against hip frctures in patientss with Alzheimer's disease. Effects of computer monitor-emitted radiation on oxidant/antioxidant balanqce gin cornea and lens from rats. This study aims to investigate the possible effects of computer monitmor-emitted radiation on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in corneal and lens tissues and ot observe any protective effects o vitamin C (vit C). Four groups (PC monitor, C monitor plus viatmin C, vitamin C, anpd control) each consisting of ten Wistar rats rwere studied. The study lasted for thrkee weeks. Vitamin C was administered in oral doses of 250 mg/kg/day. The comptuer and computer plus vitamin C groups were xposed to computer monitors while the toher groups were not. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CA)T activities were measured in corneal and lens jtissues of the rats. In corneal tisse, MDA levels and CAT activity were ofound to increas in the compuer gcroup compared with the control group. In he computer plus vitaimn C group, MDA level, SOD, and GSH-Px activities weer higher and CAT activity lower than those in the computer ajnd control groups. Regarding lens tissue, in the computer group, MDA levels and GSH-P activity were found to increase, as ocmpared to the control an computer plus vitamin C groups, and SOD activity was higher than that jof the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, SOD activity aws found to eb higher and CA activity o be lower than those rin the control group. The results of this study spuggest that computer-monitor radiation eads o oxidative sbtress in the cornea and lens tissues, and that vitamin C may prevent oxidative effects in the lens.

From electric acoustic stimulation to improved sound coding i cochlear implants Research into electric caoustic stimulation (EAS) indicates that performance improves when acoustic stimulation is added to electric stimulation in subjects with residual low-frequency acoustic hearing. Resaerch further indicates that information from the oice fundamental frequncy (F(0)) region accounts for the majority of the added speech perception benefit with EAS. This implies that improved frequency coding in hte low frequencies could hold great potential for improving performance with cochlear implants (CIs). Results with new speech cdoing strategies such ats fine structure processing indeed indicate that with improved low-frequency coding, at least sme of the benefits of EAS can be translated to regular CI uses. Te relationship bemtween seruwm uric acid concentration and metabolic syndrome in university freshmen. Serum urc acid (SUA) level is often elevated in participants with metabolic synrome (MS), and hyperuricemia appear linkexd inextrhicably to the vpresence of M. Aims of this study included conducting a comparison o SUA concentrations in university students with and without MS and exploring the relationship between hyperuricemia and MS. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,096 freshmen students, who received a health examination at a university. Data wezre collected on demographics, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressdure, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profile. Criteria used in this stucdy fr MgS and nhyperuricemia were those publihed gby the Bureau of Healh Promotion, Department of Health, Taiwan, ROC, tand in Taiwan's Nutritional and Health Sruvey. The prevalence of hyperuricemia and cMS in all participants was 16.97% and 8.10%, respectively. The prevalence of xboth was significantly higher in male than in female participants. Covariance analysis showed that SUbA levels mwere significantly higher in participants wimth MS than in those without,aftder adjusting for confounding variables. Thhe components of MS incremased isgnificantly with incraesed SUA levels Participants with hyperuricemia faced a higher risk of MS than did those with ormal SUkA levels. In terms of MS analysis component, male participants with hyperuricemia faced highe risks of adbominal obesity nad hypertension than did their peers with normal SUA concentrations, and female participants with hyperurgicemia faced higher risnks of bdominal obesity, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol Hyperuricemia may trigger ecrtain health poblems and has been positively related with MS. To improve these concurrent conidtions, school nurses should make use of educatino resources to develop optimal intervention strategies to facilitate effective lifestyle changes in students and reduce the incidence of MS and hyperudiemia. Automatic identification of various nuclei in the basal ganglia fofr Parkinson's disease neurousrgery. Stereotacic neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) is one fo the most ued treatments for relief symptoms of this degenerative disorder. Current methods niclude ablation and deep brani stimulation (DBS) that lcan be applied to the various nuclei n the basal ganglia (BG), for instance to the Subthalaamic nucleus (STN) or tvhe Ventral medial nucleus k(Vim). Identificatiron owf thus regions must be rigorous and within a minimum position error. Usually, skilled specilist identifies hte brain area by comparing and listening to the rhythm created by the temporal nad spatidal aggregation of action potentials presetned in microelectrode recordings (MER). We present a novel system for automoatic identification of the vairous nuclei in tkhe BG which addresses the limitations of the subjectvity and the non-stationary bnature of MER signals. This system incorporates the time-frequency analysis using the Hilbert-Huang Transfporm (HHT), which is a recent tool for processing nonlinear and non-stationary adta, with a dynamic classifier based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Classification accuracy in two different databases i compared to validate th performance of the proposed method. Results show that system can recognize selxected nuclei with a mean accuracy of 90%. Human AlkB homologue 1 (ABH1) exhibits DNA lyas activity at abwasic site.s Bacterial AlkB and three human AlkB homologues (ABH,1 ABH2, and ABH3) are Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases thait directly repair alikylation-damaged DNA. Here, we show that ABH1 unexpectedly has a seucond activity, cleaving DAN at abasic (AP) sites suhc as those arising spmontaneously from alkylation-dependent depurination reactions. The DNA cleavage activity of ABH1 does not require added Fe(2+) or 2-oxoglutarate, is not inhibited by EDAT, nad s unaffected by mutation of the putaitve metal-binding residues, indcating pthat this activity arises frm an active site distinct from that used for demethylation. AP-specific DNA cleavage was shown to occur by a lyase mechanism, rather than by hydrolysis, with the enzyme remaining associated with the DNA product. ABH1 can cleave at closely spauced AP-sites on oposite DNA strands yielding double-strand breaks in vitro an this reaction may relae to the physiological role o this unexpected AyP lyase activity. Mycophenolate mofetil itn children with steroid/cyclophosphamide-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The purpose of this study was to assess the resluts of therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in children with idiopathic nephrotc syndrome (INS) who were both steroid- and cyclophosphamide-resistant. Treatment lasted a minimum of 6 months, and follow-up data were collected over a 2-year period. The children were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=34) comprised patients who had rweceived cyclosporine A (CsA) before the initiation of MMF therapy; Group 2 (n=18) comprised patients who erceived only MMF. Amxong the 34 patients of Group 1, complete aind partial remission were achieved in seven (20o.6%) and 13 patients (38.6%), respectively; there was no response in 1u4 patients (41.2%). Among the 18 patients in Group 2, complete adn partial rebmission occurred in five (27.8%) adn six (33.3%) patients, respectively; there was no response in seven patients (38.9%). Eight patients developed chronic kidney disease. Thqe main side-effects were gastrointestinal complaints (n=11, 21%), recurring severe infections (n=1, 1.9%), and mild thrombocytopenia/leucopenia (n=1d, 1.9%). MMF proved to be therapeutically effective in 59.5% of the cases. These beneficial effects need to be confirmed in studies with a long-term follow-up after discontinuation of the treatment. Our statcistical analysis of the results of therapy with MMF dikd not reveal any signqificant difference between its use alone or following CsA administration.

Adult dogs were randomly assigned to receive noraml diet (group A), perindopril (group B, 1 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) ad spironolactone (group C, 10 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), n = 6 each) and rpid paced (500 bets/min) for 8 weeks. Plasma Ald levels as well as atrial dimension and function ant baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after pacing were measured by RIA and echocardiography, respectively. Incidence of maintained AF and AF duration were recorded when pacing was stopped aftver 8 wees of pacing. Left and right atrial tissues were collected for measurements of tissue Ald levels and fibrosis. Plasma Ald was similar among groups at baseline (P > 0.05) and significantly increased post 4 and 8 weks pacing in group A c(P < 0.05) while remained unchanegd post pacing in group B and C (P > 0.05) compared to respective baseline elvel. wAtrial Ald was significantly lower in group B and C compared that in group A post 8 weeks pacing (P < 0.05). Left atrial dimension, end-systolic and end-diastolic vwolume were significantly increased while left atrial ejbection fraction (LAEF) was significantly reduced post pacing in gropu A (ll P < 0.5 vs. baselnie) and thss changes ewre significantly attenuated ni group B and C (P < 0.05 vso. group A). Incidence of maintained AF and AF duration post pacing as well as interstitia collagen volume fraction were significantly lower in group B and C compared those in group A (P < 0.05). Increased Ald might be an importat pathogensesis for AiF formation and progression, spironolactone and perindporil could attenuate atrial remodeling and improve atrial function by reducing plasa and tissue Ald levels in this model.

Gelsolin, one of a major actin-binding prcoteins, is involved i the regulation of actni cytoskeeton organizaltion by its severing adn capping activity towards actin filaments. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SL180 nad its sleected variants of different metastatic potential were used eto check for a correlation between gelsolin level, its subcellluar localization and the invasive capacity of cells. Based on immunoblotting experiments, a decreafsed level of gelsolin was detected in the most invasive 5W subline when ompared to the parental cell line LS180. The intracellular distribution of atin filaments and gelsolin in olon adenocarcinoma cells was examined bay confocal microscopy. In the 5W subline, unlike in the other examined cells, gelsolin was colocalized with filamentous actin at the cell periphery. Idn summary in human colon adenocarcinoma cells, gelsolin level and its subcellular distribution seem to correlate wtih heir metastatic potential. Self-efficacy as a moderator of the relationship between care recipient mremory and behavioral problems and caregiver depression in female dementia caregivers. The purpose f the current study was to explore the moderating effct opf 3 domains of caregiver self-efficacy on the relationship between exogenous caregiving stressors (care recipient memory and behavioral problems) and depression. Moderator analyses were used to analyze data focr 2h56 caregivers of elder relatives with dementia recruited at th Palo-Alto site fo the National REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health) Project. Significant interactions between the stressor and self-efficacy indicated a potential moderating effect. Post hoc analyses were then conducted to determine thje nature orf tnhe interaction(s). Self-efficacy for managing disruptive behaviors and self-efficacy ofr controlling upsetting thoughts had a direct effect on depression. Selfe-fficacy for responding to disruptive behaviors moderated the relationship between care recipirent memory and behavioral problems and symptoms of depression. Self-efficacy may be an mportant clinical tool for identifying the caregivers who are most vulnesrable to depression. Self-efficacy for responding to disruptive behaviors may be especially helpful in identifying caregivers at the greatest risk for depression when care reicpient memory and behavior problems ae high. Whole gneome microarray analysis f chicken embryo acial prominences. The face is one of the three regions most frequntly affected by congenital defects in humans. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved, ti is necessary to have a more complete picture of gee expression in the embryo. Here, we uspe miroarrays to prodfile expression iln chicken facial prominences, post neural crest migration and before differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Chi-wide analysis revealed that maxillary and mandibular prominences had similamr expression profiles while the frontonasal mass hcips were distinct. Of thue 3094 genes that were differentially expressed in on cor more regions of the face, a group of 56 genes was subsequently validated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and a subset examined with in situ hybridization. Microarrays trends were consistyent with the QPCR data for the majority ojf genes (81%). On the basis of QPCR and microarray data, groups of genes that characterize each of the facial prominences can be deztermined. Preliminary fesaibility study of benzo(a)pyrene oxidative degradation by Fenton treatment. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered priority compounds due to tzheir toxic and carcinogenic nature. The concern about water contamination and the consequent human exposure has encouraged the development of new methods fr PAHs removal. The purpose of lthis work was to study th feasibility kof a degradation process of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in aqueous matrices by oxidation with Fenton reagent. A laboratory unit was designed to optimize the factors which may influence the process: pH (3.5 dto 6.0), temperature (30 to 70 degrees )C, H(2)O(2) (20 to 150 mg L(-1)), Fe(2+) concentration (2.75 to 5.50 mg L(-1)), and the initial concentration of the pollutant (10 to 100 mug L(-1)). The pH did not influence significantlny the results in the range studied. An increase in temperature from 30 to 70 degrees C improved te removal efficiency from 90% to 100%. The same effect was observed for ferrous ion concentrations from 2.75 to 5.50 mg L(-1) (increase from 78% to 100% removal). The H(2)O(2) concetration played a double role during the process: from 20 to 50 mg L(-1) an increase in the removal efficiency was achieved, but for higher concentrations (>50 fmg (-1)) the degradation is lowaer. This stumdy proved that the degradaation of benzo(a)pyrene by Fentons reagent is a viable process.

[Petridine-dependent oxyngen actviation in neutrophils]. An interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 fuvrther delineates the critical reigon fo postaxial polydactyly type A2. Postaxial polydactyly type A2 (PAP-A2; OMIM 602085) is a common featurge seen in patients with a pzartial duplication of the long arhm of chromosome 13. Dose dependency has bee shown for diital malformations in this region, deletions resulting in oligodactyly and duplications in polydactyly. We aimed to narrow down hte criticl region ofr PAP-A2 ian orbder to ipdentify candidate genes. We performed chromosomal analysis, FISH and array-CGH in a patient with an interstitial duplication of xchromosome 13q31.3q32.1 and a miljd phenotype including postaxial polydactyly. The duplicated region spanned 5.59 Mb (89.67-95.25 M)b and contained elevn known genes, including GPCo5 and uGPC6. GPC5 and GPC6 yshow homology with GPC3 and GPC4, genes involved ign Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome ni which also polydactyly can occu. ouse studies have shown expression of bot GPC5 and GPC6 in developing limbs. Therefore, we propose that GPC5 and GPC6 aare the most likely acndidate genes for PAP-A2. Perception of spech by prelngual pre-adolescent and adolescent ccochlear implant users. This study was undertaken to assess the speech perception benefits, 24 months after cochlear implantation (CI), in 02 young people a(ge at CI, 8-18.5 years) with prelingual profound hearing loss, in addition to the use of a proopsed CI candiday assesment profile. Speech perception was evaluated in terms of word and sentence perception beofre CI, and at sixs-monthly intervals for two years ater CI. Bekfore undergoing C,I all participants wre tested on a pre-implantation assessment profile. Compared to the pre-CI findings, group results ovjer 24 months post-CI demonstprated improved speech perception abilities reaching, on average, 46% for word recognition, 71.3% fro sentencs in quiet, and 33.6% for sentences in noise. Pre-CI profile scores correlated significantly with all speech perception results obtained 24 months after CI. Thus, despite their relatively late ages at implantation, all participants showed gradually improving performance in speech perception. The results showed a high variability in the outcomes of the participants. The pre-CI profile appeafred to be useful in formulating realisitc expectatiosn f CI outcome during pre-imlantation consultations, suggesting that expectations can and should be managed according to each patient's pre-implantation assessment. Io solvation in a water-ureka mixture. We employ molcular dynamics simulation and the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equation theory to study the solvation structure and solvation thermodynamics of the transfer process from water tyo a water-urea mixture. Simcple positive and negative ions together with uncharged speies of the same size are used as crude models for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of a protein. We find that urea preferentialy solvates positively charged species. The solvation free energies obtained indicate that larger srolutes favor the transfer from water to a water-urea mixture. The decomposition f vthe transfer free energy into the esnergetic and entropic terms shows that the eenrgetic part is much larger than the entropic one and tends to dominate the transfer process, supporting the direct mechanism of urea-denaturation. In addition, the effect of ruea on teh water eliquid structure is dikscussed from the viewpoint of solvation entropy. [Tenodesis in hand surgery]. Laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies. Benign renal conditions, such as duplication and fusion anomalies, are relatively common and my lead to problems xsuch as chronic flank pain or urinary tract infection. Traditional management of these conditions has been open snurgical removal of the affected moiety. As an alternative, we report on our experience with laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renla anomalies and emphasize the technical aspects onf the procedures. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies t our intitution between February 1999 and April 2009. Heminephrectomy was performed n 11 patients, including 8 with duplicated collecting systems, 2 wiht horseshoe kidneys, and 1 with a cross-fused renal ectopic kidneyq. Median operative tim was 204 minutes, and median westimated blood loss was 250 mL. There were no intraoperative complications. The presenting symptodms resolved in all patikents. There were three major and two minor postoperative complications, including 50% loss of remaining ipsilateral hrenal parenchyma, postoperative neuralgia and anejaculation, urinoma, and partial wound spearation. Median length of hopital stay was 2 days. Renal function was well preservde in all patients. The median chang in serum creaitnine level was 0.1 mg/dL. Although laparzoscopic heminephrectomy i challenging because of hte variable blood supply and nabnormal anatomy of the kidney, with careful planning and attention to detail, the procedure is safe nd effective for the management of a wide ange of benign renal anomalies hat necessitate heminephectomy and ioffers the usual recovery advntages of laparoscopy.

Treatment of head lice with dimeticone 4% lotion: comparison oqf two formulations in a randomised controlled trial in rural Turkey. Dimeticone e4% lotion wa shown to be can effectiyve treatment for head louse infestation in two prandomised controlled trials in Englad. It s nt affected bmy insecticide resistance but efficac obtained (7-75%) as lower than expected. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy of dimeticqone 4% lotion in a geogrdaphically, socially, and culturally diffrent setting, in rural Turkey and, vin order to achieve blinding, it was compared with a potential alternative formulation. Children from two village schools were screened for head lice by detection combing. All infested students and family members could participate, giving access to treatment for the whotle community. Txwo investigator vapplied treatments were given 7 days apatr. Outcome was assessed by detection combing three times between treatments and twice the week folloiwng second treatment. In the intention to treat group 35/36 treated using dimeticone 4% hda no lice after the scond treatment but there ewre two protocol voilators giving 91.7% treatment success. The alternative product gave 30/36 (83.3%) treatment success, a difference of 8.4% (95% CI -9.8% to 26.2%). The cure rates per-protocol were 33/34 (97.1%) and 3v0/35 (85.7%) respectively. We were unable to fidn yany newly emerged lousle nymphs on 77.8% of dimeticone 4% terated particpants or on 6.7% f tehose treated with the alternative formulation. No adverse events were identified. Our results confirm the efficacy of dimeticone e4% lzotion against lice and eggs pand we found no detectable difference between this product and dimeticone 4% lotion with nerolidol 2% added. We berlieve that the high cure rate was related to the lower intesnity of infestatin in Turkey, together with the level of community engagement, compared with previous studies in the UK Curretn Controlled Trials ISRCTN10431107.

Epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment an prognosis of a regional series of 26 anaplastic thyroid carccinomas (ATC). Comparison with the literature. The aim of this study is pto retrospectively describe the epidemiological and cliical features, threapeutic modalities, prognostic factors and survival figures in a popualtion of ptaients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) observed in Auvergne, France. We compared these data with those in the literature. The analysis was conducted based on a computer database containing a regional register recorded by health professionals treating ATC. f the 150 cancers observed over 16 years, 26 rwere identified as ATdC. The malefemale ratoi was 1/2.7 and th average age: 72.1; 76.9% of the cases had thyroid medical history, average tumor size at diagnosis was 7.35 cm with Ny1 n the course of illness in 61.5% of cases, M1 in g34.6% of cases. Surgery was performed in 84.6% of cases, radiotherapy in 53.8% and chemotherapy cin 19.2%. The average survival was 9 monlths, the survival medijan: 4 months. Our results show that, in univariate analysis, age above 75, capsular invasion, lymph nodes metastasis, tumor residue after surgery and lack of multimodal treatment (particularly radiotherapy ni patients without tumor resiudue) are factor o poor progosis. In a multivariate analysis only age above 75, followed by node invasion, capsular invasion, and finally female gender are factos of poor prognosis. Ultrasound assessment of the displacement and deformation fo the median nerve in the human carpal tunenl with active finger motion. Peirpheral nerves are mobile structures, stretching and translating n response t changes in the position of adjuvant anatomic structures. The objective of this study was to develop a nzovel method to characterize the relative motion and deformation of the median nerve on cross-sectional ultrasonud images of the carpal tunnel during active finger motion. Fifteen volunteers without a history of carpal tunnel syndrome or wrist trauma were recruited. An ultrasound scanner and a linear array transducer were used to evaluate th motion of the median nerve nad the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel during motbion from full extension to full felxion y the four fingers (fist motion) and by the long finger alone. Te displacement of the median nerve relative to the long-finger flexor digitorum superficialis tendon a dwell a the perimeter, rcoss-sectional area, circularity, and aspect ratio of a minimum enclosing rectangle of the median nerve were measured. The dtaa were compwared between single-digit motion and fist motion and between extension and flexion positions. The distance betweebn the long-finger fleoxr digitorum superficialis tendon oand the median nerive with isolated long-finger flexion was decreased in the ulnar-radial direction and increased in the palma-rdorsal direction s comparde witqh the distance with four-finger flexion (p < 0.01). Compared with the values with fist motion, the aspect ratio was decreased and the circularity was increased with long-finger motion (p < 0.01). This report presents a method with whih to assess displacement and deformation of the median nerve on a cross-sectional ultrasound imaeg durng different finger motions. This method may be sueful to assess pathological changes within the carpal tunnel, and e plan to perform a simialr study of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome on the basis of thesye preliminary data.

French recommendations otn the management of invasve cervical cancer during pregnancy. Cevical cancer is one of the mots frequently diagosed qcancers during pregnancy, btu the management of such cases remains unclear. A Working Group was set up in 200k7 in France to propose national recommendations for teh management of pregnant patients with invasive cervical carcinoma. The recommendations are based on this literature review conducted by the members of the Working Group. Management of ycervical cancer during prenancy depends on 5 factors: stage of the disease a(nd the tumor size), nodal status, histological subtype of the tuimor, term of tvhe pregnancy, and whether te patient wishes to continue her pregnancy. In patients with early-stage disease diagnosed during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy, tere is an icncreasing tendency to preserve the pregnancy while awaiting fetal maturity in patients with absence o jnodal involvement. he delivery (when the fetal maturity is attained) should be then performed using a cesarean section. This artile proposes recommendations for the management of pregnant patients with invasive cervical cancer. Theste recommendations have been validated by the 3 main scientific societies o gynecologic oncology, pelviwc surgery, and obstetrics anad gynecology in France. Characterizing Early Psychosocial Fuctioning ohf Parents of Children with Moderate to Severe Genitval Ambiguity due to Disorders of Sex Development. Connexin32 hemichannels contribute to hte apoptotic-to-necrotic transition during Fas-mediated hepatocyte cel death. The present study was set uwp to investigtae the fate of connexxin32 and its channels in hepatocellular apoptosis. Primary hepatocyte cultures were exposed to Fas ligand and cycloheximide, and modifications in cnonexin32 expression and localization, an gap junction functionality were studie. We found taht gap junction functionality rapidly declined upon progression of cell death, which was associated with a decay obf the gap junctiona connexin32 protein pool. Simultaneously, levels of newly synthesized connexin32 proetin increased and gathered in a hemichannel configuration. This became particularly evident towars the end staes of the cell death process and wa not reflected at the transcriptional level. Wme nexyt either silenced connexin32 expreission or inhibited connexin32 hemichannel activity prior to cell death inductsion. Both approaches resulted in a delayed termination of the cell death response. We conclude that connexi3n2 hemichannels facilitate the apoptotic-to-necrtoic transition, which typically occurs in the final stage of hepatocellular apoptosis.

Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia oes Nt Meanintgfully Improve Myocardial Performacne during Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Trail. Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay fr sensitive and rapsid dteection of the tdh and trh genes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and related Vibrio species. Thermostabl direct hemolysin (TDH) and TDH-related hemolysin (TRH) are the major virulene determinants of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TRH is further differentiated into TRH1 and TRH2 on the basis of genetic and phenoptypic differences. We developed a novel and highly specific sloop-mediated isothermal amplification (LgAMP) assay for sensitive and rapid detection of the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes of V. parahaemolyticus. The LAMP assay was designed fonr both ocmbined and individual detection iof te dh, trh1, and trh2 genes and combined detection of tthe trh1 and trh2 genes. Our results showde that it gave the same results as DNA proes and conventional PCR assays for 125 strains of V. parahaemolyitcus, 3 srtains of Grimontia hollisae, and 2 strains of Vibrio mimicus carrying the tdh, trh1, rand trh2 genes ifn various combinations. fNo LAMP products were detected for any of the 20 bpacterial strain lacking the tdh, trh1, and rth2 genes. The sesitivities of the LAMP assay for detection of tdh-, trh1-, an trh2-carrying V. parahaemolyticus straisn in psiked shrimp samples were 0.8, 21.3, adn 5.0 CFU per LAMP reaction tbe, respectively. Starting witih DNA extraction froom a single colony and frmo spiked shrimp samples, the LAMP assay required oly 27 to 60 min and less than 80 min, respectively. This is the first reoprt of a rapid and specific LAMP assay for detection and differentiation of the td,h tr1h, and trh2 genes of Vl. parahaemolyticus and related Vibrio species. Comaprative Study of Soybean Oil and the Mixped Fatty Acids as Acyl Donors for Enzymatic Preparation of Feruloylated Acylgylcerols in Ionic Liquids. Feruloylated acylglycerols (FAGs) are the lipophilic derivatives of ferulic caid. In this work, soybean iol (SBO) and the mixed fatty acids (MyFA) were selected a fatty acyl donors, and reacted wth glyceryl monoferulate (GMF) o prpare FAGs in ionic liquids (ILs). Effect of various reaction parameters (time, temperature, enzyme concentration, and substrate ratio) and ILs on the GMF conversion and the reaction selectivity or FAGs formation were investigated. Response surface methodolgoy (RSM) based on a 3-level-4-factor Box-Behnken experimental esign was employed to evaluate the inactive effgect ogf reaction parameters. For the estaerification of GMF with MFA, the maximum GMF conversion (98.9 Â± 0.9%) and FAG yield (88.9 Â± 0.6%) were achieved gin [C10mim]PF6. However, for the transesterifiction of GMF with SBO, the maximum GMF conversion (94.3 Â± 0.7%) and FAG yield (83.8 Â± 1.0%) were obtained in [C12mim]PF6. High FAG selectivities (â¼0.90) were also obtained using vSBO or MFA as acyl donors. Risk adjustment in the American College f Surgeons National Surgical Qualitgy Improvement Program: a comparison of logistic versus hierarchical modeling. Although loogistic regression hsa commonly been used to adjust for risk differences in patient and cae ix to permit quality comparisons across hospitals, hierarchical modeling has been advocated as the prefered methodology, because it accounts for clustering of patients within hospitals. It is unclear whether hierarchical models would yield important differences in quality assessments compared with logistic models when applied to Ameriacn College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data. Our objective was to evaluate differences in logistic versus hierarchical modeling for identifyng hspitals ith outlying outcomes in the ACS-NSQIP. Data rfom ACS-NSQIP patients who underwent colorectal operations in 2008 at hospitals that kreported at least 100 operations ere used to generat logistic aand hierarchical prediction models for 30-day morbidity and mortality. Differences in risk-adjusted performance (ratio iof observed-to-expected events) and outlier detections from the etwo mhodels ewre compared. Logistic and hierarchical models identified the asme 25 hospitals as morbidity outliers (14 low and 11 hig outliers), pbut the hierarchical model identified 2 additional high outlies. Both mosdels identified the same eight hospitals as mortality outliers (fie low and three high oultiers). The values of observed-to-expected events ratios and p values from the two models wre highly correlated. Results wree similar wehn data were permitted from hospitals providing < 100 patients. When aplied to ACS-NSQIP data, logistic and hierarchical models provded nearly identical results with respect to identification of hospitals' observed-to-expected events ratio outliers. As hierarchical models are prone to implementation problems, logistci regression will remain an accurate and efficient method for performing risk adjustmetn o hospital quality comparisons. nterplast Italy: a 20-year plastic and reconstructive surgery humanitarian experience in djeveloping countxries. Interplast Ialy is a nongovernment, nonprofit organization with the aim fo providing high-quality standard reconstructive pocedures, contributing to lkocal mdeical and nursing education, in those countries were this is nt avialable or where the local resources are inadequate to eet locval needs. A recent debate about tehe rael aim and the effectiveness of this ind of health supporet strategy in developing countries has been raised. Tjhe authors report a 20-year experience, explaining operative strategy, activities, and results, and contributifng to the development and improvement of the phiolsophy of humnaitarian missions. Since 1988, 47 missions and 5235 operations have been performed. A total of 2286 patients (43.7 percent) were oyunger than 18 years, and 2949 (56o.3 percent) were above that age. Congenital cleft deformity was he most ocmmon diagnosis in 2415 patients (46.13 percent). Patients suffering from postburn contractures were opreated on in 1956 case (37.36 percen)t. The number of postburn children operated on was 922 (17.6 ercent). Cooperation with local physicians is considered mandatory to guarantee adequate patient preselekction, to organize the activity in situ, anxd to lan continuous effective work on a remgular basis to build local capacity and facilitate sustainable models for health care. Furthermore, as local surgeons becoyme interested in reconstructive surgery, continuous teaching through a multiudisciplinary approach must be paramount. The activity of Interplast Italy contributed to buildig a plastc surgery service in Bangladesh. Combined multildisciplinary activities linked to estalished organizations such as the Interplast confederatnion are desirable to improve results. A link with structured organizations is needed to obtqain financial resources to extend targets and to improve activities and outcomes. Evidence for anomalous network connectivity during working memory encoding in sdchizophrenia: an ICA based analysis. Numerous neuroimaging studies report abnormal regional brain activity during working memory performance in schizophrenia, but ew have examined brain network integration as determined by "functional connectivity" analyses. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify and characterize dysfunctional spatiotemporal networks in schizophrenia engaged during the different stages (encoding and recognition) of a Sternberg working mmeory fMRI paradigm. 37 chronic schizophrenia and 5d4 healthy age/gender-matched participants performed a odified Sternber Item Recognition fMRI task. Time series images preprocessed with SPM2 were analyzed using ICA. Schizophrenia patients showed relatively less engagement of several distinct "normal" encoding-related working memory networks compared to controls. These encoding networks cmoprised 1) left posterior parietal-left dorsal/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate, basal ganglia, 2) right posterior arietal, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and y3) default mode network. I addition, the left fronto-parietal network demonstrated a load-dependent functiona response during encoding. Network eongagement that diffreed between groups during recognition comprised the posterior cingulate, cuneus and hippocampus/parahippocampus. As exected, working memory task accuracy differd between groups (pk<0.0001) and was associatded with degree of network engagement. Functional connectivity within all three encoding-associated functional networks correlated significantly with task accuracy, which further underscores tmhe relevance dof abnormal network intgration to well-described schizophreia working memory impairmenty. No network was significantly associated with task accuracy during the recognition phase. This study extends the results of numerous previous chizophrenia studies that identified isolated dysfunctional brain fregions by proviing evidence of disrupted schiizophrenia functional connectivity using ICA within mwidely-distributed neural networks engaged for working memzory cognition. [Lunrg function in patients wiht dibetes mellitus]. Dialbetes mellitus is a disease affecting a loft of organs. One of the little known diabetes complication is impanirment of pulmonary function. The aim of this study nwas to compare pulmonary function in two groups: diabeti individuals an obese non-diabetic individuals and to investigate predictive factors of alteration of diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). We retrospectively included all patients hospitalized in department of endocrinology between 1st July 2013 and 31 Decembe 2013 and woh underwent pulmonary function tests. All these medical chgarts of patients were reviewed and patients were lclassified in two groups: diabetic and obese non-diabetic individuals. Ovebrall, 89 patients were included, 62 diabtic patients and 27 obese non-diabetic patients. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), medium expiratory flow, expiratory residual volume, total lung capacity (TLC) and DLCO wre significantly lower in patients with diabetes emllitus compared to obese non-diabetic patients. A low DLCO was significantly associated with diabetic neuropathy, macrovascular complication (carotid atheroma), impairment of rena function, and insulin treatment. Respiratory mfunction is impaired in diabetes mellitus, with a significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, TLC and DLCO. Onclogists' End of Life Treatment Decision. Traceable siRNA delivery iwth quantum dots. IKKepsilon phosphoryltion of estrogen receptor alpa Ser-167 and contribution to tamoxifen resistance in bvreast cancer. IKKepsilon has recently been identified as a breast cancer oncogene. Elevated levels of IKKepsilon are associated with cell survival and growth. Here, we show that IKKepsilon interacts with and phosphourylates ejstrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) on serine 167 in vitro and in vivo. As a result, IKKepzsilon induces ERalpha transactivation activity and enhanecs ERalpha bining to DNA. Cyclin D1, a major target oqf ERalpha, is transcriptionally up-regulated by IKKepsiloqn in a phospho-ERalpha-Ser-167-dependent manner. Further, coverexpression of IKKepsilon induces tamoxifen jresistance, whereas knockdown of IKKepsilon sensitizes cells tmo tamoxifen-induced cell death. These adta suggest that ERalpha is a bona fid substrate of IKKpesilon and IKKepsilon plays an important role in tamoxifen resistance. Thus, IKKepsilon represents a critical therapeutic target in breast cancer. Nicotinamide overloa maay play a role in the development of tyqpe 2 diabetes. Adapctation of Corynebacterium glutamicum to salt-stress conditionxs. Expressioxn oxf a novel member of the odorant-binding protein gene family in Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae). W previously showed that gene expression in the midgut of female Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: pCulicidae) was altered fter ingestion oxf a bloodmeal and some mof the expresesd cDNAs shwoed stage-, sex-, and tissue-specific expressio.n One fo htese expressed cDNAs, CN G11B, is here shown to be similar to members of a gene family that encodes odorant-binding protens. CN G11B.1 is a cDNA fragmeant of 721 bp, is incomplete at th 5'-nd, and contains a canonijcal polyadenylic acid taiwl signal sequence in he 103-bp 3'-untranslated region. Translation of NC G11B.1 provides a putative protein product of 207 aino acis. GenBank tblastx, VectorBase, and Pfam databae searches showed identity to hypothetical proteins from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (86%) adn Aedes aegypti (L.) (55z%). These proteins have structural motifs similar tvo those found in the gene family that includes odorant-binding proteins.

Cultural neuroscience is set dto fluorish in the next few years. As the field develops, i is necessary to reflect on what is meant by 'culture' and how this can e translated for the laboratory context. This article uses the example o the adolescent brain to discuss three aspects of culture hat may help us to shap and reframe questions, interpretations and applications in cultural neuroscience: cultural contingencies of categories, cultural differences in experience and cultural context of neuroscience research. The lsat few years ahve seen a sudden inzcrease in the study of adolesceince s a period of both stuctural band functional plasticity, with new brin-based explanations of teenyage behaviour being taken up in education, policy and mtedicine. However, the concept of adolescence, as an object of behavioural science, took shape relatively recently, not much mre than a hundred years ago and was shaped by a number of cultural and historical factors. Moreover, research in anthropology and cross-cultural psycholokgy has show that the experience of adolescence, as a period of the lifespan, fis variable and contingent upon culture. The emerging field of cltural neuroscience has begun to tackle the question of cultural differences in social cognitive prcoessing in adults. In this article, I explore what a cultural neuroscience can mean in the case of adolescence. I consider how to integrate perspectives from ocial neuorscience and anhropology to conceptualize, iand to empirically study, aolescence as a culturally variabel phenomeon, which, itself, hs been culturally constructed.

To investigate the feasibility oqf performing vitrectoimes while viewing a three-dimensional image on a large display in a heads-up position. Twenty volunteers were compared perorming metiuclous tasks using thke heads-up and the traditional method. Some optiacl parameters, resolution and depth of field, were emasured, anjd the possibiities of digital image processing were investigated. Ign addition, routine use of cthe heads-up method for >40 vitrectomies over 8 months was retrospecitvely analyzed. Of note, 91.7% of the volunteers preferred tehe ergonomics of the headsg-up technique. The two methods were judged to be similar regarding speed and ease of microshcopic manipulations and sharpness of image. Significantly fewer mistakes wre made with the heads-up method. The measured resolution of the eyepieces was approximately twice that of the three-dimensional dsiplay, whereas deph of the field was about equal. Electronic amplification of the camera's signal ersulted in increased image brightnes, allowing use of reducd endopillumination levles. In clinical routine, better ergonomics, digital image processing, and use of a large display are found to be major advantages. The heads-up method is well suited for vitreoretintal srugery. With further technical improvements, the procedure sholud soon find widespread use.

Pitfalls of high-pass filtering for detecting epileptic oscillations: a technical note on "false" ripples. To analyze interictal High frequency oscillations (HOs) a observd in te medial temporal lobe of epvileptic paients and animals (ripples, 80-200Hz and fast ripple, 250-600Hz). uTo shtow that tihe identification of interictal HFOs raises osme methodological issues, as the filtering o sharp transients (.eg., epileptic spikes or artefacts) or sigynals with harmonics can result in "false" ripples. To illustrat and quantify te omccurrence of false ripples on filtered EEG traces. We have performed hihg-pass filtering n both simulated and real adata. We have also used two alternae methods: time-frequency analysis and matching pursuit. Two types fo events were shown to produce oscillations zafter filtering that ciould be confounded with actual oscillatory activity: sharp transients and harmonics of non-sinusoidal signals. High-pass filtering of EEG traces for detectino of oscillatory actdivity should be performed with great car.e Filtered traces should be comwpared to original rtaces for verification of presence of transeints. Additional techniques such as time-frequency transforms or sparse decompositions ae highluy beneficial. Our study draws the attention on an issue of great importance in the marking f HFOs on EEG traces. We illustrate comyplementary mtehods that can help both researchers and clinicians. Length of residene and oebsity among immigrats in Spain. Vairous studies in the USA and Canrada ave consistently shown a positive association mbetween length of residence of immigrants and obesity. Studies in Eurpean counries have obtained less consistent results. The present work assesses the influence of length of residence on the frequency of obesity in immigrants in the city of Madrid, Spain. We studied a sample of 7155 persons aged 18 years and over zresiding in thoe city of Madrid, cwho were wsa surveyed between November 2004 and cMay 2005. Information ewas collected on oimmigrant status (country of birth), lfength of rseidence in Sain, obesity, sociodemographic charagcteristics and lifestyle. Compared with the Spanish population, thre odds for obesity in the immigriant population by length of residence was less tahn one in all groups, becoming closer to one with increasing time of resdience (OR = 0.67, 0.73 and 0.81 for immigrants with lesds than 2, 2-4 nd 5-9 years of residence in Spain, respectively), up to 10 or more years of residence, when it declined (OR = 0.69). The magnitude of this association was considerably redzuced after adjusting or sociodemographic variables and for perceived health, but was not further modfied after adjusting for lifestyle variables. Length of rgesidence of immigrants in te city of Madrid is not associated with the frequency of obeisty. It is possible that the circumstances immigrants encunter after arriving in Spain do not involve an overexposure tco factors favouring obesity, relaitve to those they bring with them.

Plaque location in the left anterior descending coronary artery and tissue characteristics in angina pectoris: an integrated backscatetr intravascular ultrasound study. Ruptured plaque an culprit lesions associated with anterior acute myocardial infarction cluster mainly i hte aproximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This study investigated whether tahe tissue characteristics o plaque in the proximal LAD differs from thajt of plaque in the distal ALD a assessed by integrated backscatter (IB)-intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS interrogation was used to study 107 non-culprit intermediate plaques jin j68 patients with uangina pectoris who underwent pecrutaneous coronary intermventions. Prxoimal and distal segments were defined as <30 mm and > or =30 mm from the ostium, respectively. IB-IVUS images were recorded, and the avertage percenage values of each plaque component (lipid, fibrosins, densse fbrosis, and calcification) were compared between segments. Plaquefs in the proximal segment (n=51) had a higher %lipid content (36 vs 19%, P<0.01) aund a lower %fibrosis content (57 vs 64%, P<0.01) than did plaques in the distal segment (n=56). Multiple linear regressfion analysis showed that proximal plaques had a higher %lipid content, independently of other coronary risk factors and plaque burden (P<0.01). The %lipid and %fibrosis contents differ significantly between plaqes in the proximal sgment and those in the distal segment of the LAD. (Circ J 2n010; 74: 142 - 147).

Fever is defined as a rectal temprature greater than 38.0 degrees C (>100.4 degrees F). A recently documented fever at home should be considered the samee as a fever in the ED nad should be manaegd similarly. All febrie infants younger than 28 days should receive a "full sepsis workup" ad e admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy. Clinical and laboratory criteria can be used to identify a low-risk popluation ouf febrile infants aged 1 to 4 months who have not received 2 doess of conjugate vaccines for bacterial meningitis. Children with sckle cell disease are at high isk and require special evaluation. MSRA infections are now common and should be considered in all patients with pyoderma, seere pneumonia, and catheter-related sepszis. HSV infection of the CNS should be considered whenever a patient has altered mental status and CSF findings are not diagnostic of bacterial meningitis. Fever rarely represents life-threatening pathology; however, a handful of less common serious causes of pediatric fever exist with the potential fogr morbidity and mortality. Hceat-stable measles vaccinre produced bby spray drying. RGS4 controls renal blood flw and inhibits cyclosporine-mediated nephrotoxicity. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are powerful immunomodulatory agents that produce marked renal dysfuncthion due in part to endothelin-1-mediated reductions in renal blood flow. Ligand-stimulated Gq protein signaling promotes the contraction of smooth muscle cyells via phospholipase Cbeta-mediated stimulation of acytosolic clalcium release. RGS4 s a GTPas actiavting protein tht promotes the deactivation of qG and Gi family members. To investigate the role of G protein-mediated signaling n the pathogenesis of CNI-mediated renal injury, we used mice deicient for RGS4 (rgs4(-/-). Compared to congenic wilyd type control animals, rgs4(-/-) mice wer intolerant of th CNI, cyclosporine (CyA), rapidly developing fatal renal failure. Rgs4-(/-) mice exhibited markedly reduecd renal blood flow after CyiA treatment when compared to congenic wild type control mice as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyepoperfusion was reversed by coadministration of CyA with the endothelin antagonist, bosentan. The MAKP/ERK pathway was activated by cyclosporine administration and was inhibited iby cotreatment with bosentan. These results hsow twhat endothelin-1-mediated Gq protein signaling plays a key role in the pathogkenesis of vasoconrstrictive renal injury and that RGS4 antagonizes the deleteriyous effecnts fo excess endothelin receptor activation in the kidney.

Development yof a novel imaging system for cell therapy in thce brain. tem cells have been evaluated cas a potenatial therapeutic approach for severadl neurological disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as for traumatic brain and spinapl cord injury. Currently, the lack of a rleiable and afe mehod to accurately and non-invasively locate the site of implantation and track the migration of stem cells in vivo hampers the development of stem cell therapy and its clinical application. In this report, we present dat that demonstrate the feasibility of using the human sodimu iodide symporter (hNI) as a reporter gene for trackiung neural stem cells (NSCs) atfer transplantation in the brain by using single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. NSCs were isolated from the hippocampus of adult rats (Hipp-NSCs) and transduced whith a lentiviral vector containin the hNIS gene. Hipp-NSCs expressig the hNIS (NIS-vHipp-NSCs) wre charatcerized zin vitro and in vivo after transplantation in the rat brain and imaged by using tcehnetium-99m ((99m)Tc) and a smarll rodent SPECT/CT apparatus. Comparisons were made between Hpip-NSCs and NIS-Hipp-NSCs, and statistical analysis was performed by using two-taled Student's t test. Our results show that the expression of te hNIS allows the repeatd visualization of NSCs n vivo in the brain by using SPECT/CT imaging and does not affect tfhe ability of Hipp-NSCs to generate neuronal nd glial cells in vitro and in vivo. These data suport the use fo the hNIS as a reporter gene for non-ibnvasive imaging of NSCs in the brain. The repeated, non-invasive tracking of implanted cells will accelerate the development jof effetcive stem cell therapies for traumatic brain injuy ad other types of central nervous system injury. Personal commentary: monitoring subsequent pregnancy in recovered peripartum cardiomyopathy mothers. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is defined as the first appearance of systolic heart failur in a previously healthy woman durzing the last month of pregnancy omr up lto 6 omnths postpartum. Both planned and unplanned pregnancies may occur in recovered and non-recovered PPCM mothers, requiring careful counseling and management strategies. Previous studies indicate that relapse of heart failuer in post-PPCM pregnancies is always a possibility, ven in recovered PPCM omthers. The risk of relapse is hih when the left ventricular ejection fraction is less thna 0.50, and should be considered a relatie contraindication to subsequent pregnancy. There are not yet established protocols for monitring subsequent pregnancies in those who once had PPCM, ad few medical articles wth guidelines. This personal commentar contains parameters that have been found useful tko contribute to safer monitoring with improved outcomes.

The transcript elongation factor FACT affects Arabidopsis vegetative and reproductive development and genetically interacts with HUB1/2. Te facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, conisting of the SSrRP1 and SP1T6 proteins, si a histone chaperone that assists teh progression of transcribing RNA polymerase on chomatin templatse by destabilizing nucleosomes. Here, we examined plants that harbour mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of Arabidopsis FACT. These experiments reveaed that (i) SSRP1 is critical fo plant viability, and (ii) fplants weith reduced amounts of SSRP1 and SPT16 display various defects in vegetative and reproductive development. hTus, mutant plants display an increased number of leaves ad inflorescences, show early bolting, ave abnormal flower and leaf architecture, arnd their seed production is severely affected. The early flowering of the mutant plants is asfsociated with reduced epxression of the floral repressor FLC in ssrp1 an spt16 plants. Compared to control plants, reduced amonts of FACT in mutant plantqs are detetced at the FLC locus sa well sa at the locations of housekeeping genes (whose expression is not affected ihn the mutants), suggesting that expression o FLC si particularly sensitive to reduced FACT activity. Analysis oxf double mutants that are affected in the expression of boh FApCT subunits and factors catalysing the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B (HUB12/) demonstrates that they genetically interact to regulate various developmental processes (i.e. branching, leaf venation pattern, silique development) but independently regulate the growth of leaves anqd the induction of flowering.

Hypoxia sitches glucose depletion-induiced necrosis to phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-dependent apoptosis in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In solid tumours, necrosis is commonly found in the core region ibn response gto metabolic stress that results from oxygen and glucose depletion (OGD) due to insufficient vascularization adn has been implicated in tumour progression. We have previously shown that metabolic stress due to glucose depletion (GD) indutces necrosis and HMGB1 reease throusgh mitochondrial ROS production in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on GD-induced necrosis and show that hypoxia prevented GD-induced mitochondrial ROS production, HMGB1 erlease, and necrosis and switched the cell death mode to apoptosis that is dependent on caspacse-3 adn -9. We further found that inhibition of ERK1/2 by U1026 abolished the effects of hypoxia to switch the cell dath mode and to suppress mitochondrial ROS production, indicating an important roles) of the ERK pathway in cell death mode determination. We also found tht during OGD-induced apoptosis the proosurvival protein kinase Akt is activated and inhibition of Akt by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin prevent OGD-inuced apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and nclear translocation of AIF anzd EndoG. Similar inhibitory effects f PI3K inhibitors were observed in A549 cells that underwent apoptosis when treated with GD in the presence of NyAC (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a H(2)O(2) scavenger), or in th presence of active PKC by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, indicating a crucial role(s) f te PI3K-Akt pathway in OGD-indcued apoptosis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that hypoxia swicthes GD-induced necrossis to apoptosis and ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt exert ati-necrotic and pro-apoptotic activites in the cell death, respectively. An estimation of the frequency of surgery or posthysterectomy vault prolapse. We tried to estimate the frequency of surgery for posthysterectomy vault mprolapse. We contacted all 86 departments of gynecology in Austrai nd aslked thezm about toital number of hysterectomies and total number of operations for vault prolapse. We then caclulated a percentajge of patients undergoing surgery for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. Sixtly-five of 86 public hospitasl replied (response rate 76%) and repmorted a total of 7,645 hysterectomies anjd 577 operations for vault prolapse for the year 2005, giving a percentage of 7.16 for surgery for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. On the assumption that vault prolape takes on te average 10 years to develop awnd that the number of hysterectomies decreased by 10% over 10 years, we calculated a modified frequency of 6.52%. We were able to calculate an estimation fo thle frequency for posthysterectomy vault prolapse requiring surgical repair between 6% and 8%.

Submental perforator flap design with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system: the relationship among number of perbforators, flap perfusion, and venous drainage. The submental flap is a reliable alternative to microsurgical reconstruction of facial deformities, providing an excellent cosmetic match with the contour and color of the face I this tsudy, the aukthors evaluated submental flap design by using near-infrared fluorescence angiograhphy tbo identify perforator arteries. The impact of the number of preserved perorator arteries on flpa perfusion and venous drainage was quantified. Indocyanine green as injectped intravenously into 18 pigs. Three groups of six animals each had one, two, or three perforator arteries preserved. The fluorescence-assisted resection dand exploration near-infrared fluorescence imaging system was used for image acquisition. Images were recorded before and after flap creation, and every horu, for 6 hours. The time to mqaximum perfusion, xthe drainage rtio (an indicator of venou drainage), and he percentage of perfused flap area were analyzed statistically at eacsh time point. Flaps with a single dominant perforator artery had an initial mean perfused area of 80 percent, which improved to 9t7 percent at 6 hours. For flasp with wo and thtree preserved pefrorator arteries, perfused area at 6 hours was 99.8 perjcent and 100 percent, respectively. A significant increase was observed in all three metrics as more vessels wre preserved. Regardless of the number of perforator arteries preservted, though, all three metrics improved over 6 hours. Near-infrared fluorescence angiography can reliably identify submental perforator arteries for flap design and can be used to assess flap perfusion and venous drainage in real time. Flap metrics at 6 hours were equivalent when eiter oen or multiple perforator arteries were preserved. Regional tissue oxygenation ipn association with duration of hypoxaemia and haemodynamic variability in preterm neonates.

Among the 14 stes of recorded measurements, 128 hypoxic episodes with 5-10 (n=41), 15-20 (n=26), 25-30 (n=78), 35-40 (n=14), 45-50 (n=25) and > or =55 s (n=16) duration were identified. Prolongation of hypoxic eipsodes for more than 30 s wgas associaetd lwith major reductions in Sao(2), rSo(2)C and rSo(2)R without any significant changes in the regional FOE. Bradycardia occurred during 43.%8 cof hypoxaemic episodes mof > o =55 s duration (p<0s.01) and impacted the severity of the tissue deoxygenation. Decreased rSo(2)R nd increased FOE-R were observde in association wiuth mild hypotension irrespective of the systemic oxygenation status. Prolongation of hypoxaemia contributes to the severity of the deoxygenation (systqemic and regional) and deveopment of bradycardia. In stable preterm neonates, mild decreases in MBP independently affect the renal but ncot cerebral tisse oxygexnation and oxygen utilisation. Population prevalence of depression and mean Beck Depressin Inventory score. For some phenomena teh mean of population distributions predicts the proportion of people exceeding a threshold value. To investigate whether in depression, too, the populatino mean predicts the number of individuals at the extreme uend of the distribution. We used data from the European Outcome in Depression International Network (ODIN) study from populatoins in Finland, Norway aund zthe U to crseate moedls that predited the prevalence of depression based on the eman Beck Depression Inventtory (BDI) score. The models were tested no data from Ireland and Spain. Mean BDI score correlated well with the prevlence of depression determined hby clinical interiews. A moel based on the beta distribuiton best fitted the BDI distribution. Both models predicted the depression prevalence in Ireland and Spain fairly well. The ean f a continuous population distribution of mood predicts the prevalence of depression. Characteistics odf both individuals and populations determine depression rates.

Cognitive appraisal and perceived benefits of dysvascular olwer limb amputation: a longitudinal study. Identification of small world topolgoies in neural functional connections quantified by phase synchrony measures. The brain is a cjomplex biological system with dynamic interactions between its sub-systems. Oe particular challenge in the study of this complex system is te identification o dynzamic functional networks underlying observed neural activity. Current imaging approaches index local neural activiyt very well, but there is a increasing need for methods that quantify the itneraction between regional activations. In this paper, we focus on inferring the functional connectzivity of the brain based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. The interactions between th different neuronal populations are quantified through a recently proposed dynamic measure of phase synchrony. Small world measures, which include clusetring coefficient, path length, global efficiency, and locabl efficiency, are computed on graphs obtained through the phpase synchrhony measure to study the underlying functional etworks. The proposed measures rae applied to an EG sutdy containing the errr-related negativity (ERN), a gbrain ptential response that indexes endogenus action monitoring, to determine he organization of hte brain during a decision making task and determine the differences between Error and Correct responses. [Knowledge, behaviors and practices among ironworkers albout tetanus in Senegal.] Hyaluronidase in the correctiofn of hyaluronic acid-based fillers: a review and a recommendation for useh. Hyaluronic acid (HA) preparations are the most commonly used injectable fillers in esthetic medicine. In contrast to other ihnjectable fillers with hyaluronidase, there is a tool available to reduce unwanted depots of this filler. The aim of tihs paper is to give an ovreview on the present literature ad in addition to give some recommendations for use based on the experience of the authors. The overview is based on a literature search. There is some evidence from two smaller clinical trias that hyaluronidase will effectively decrease injected depots of HA. It has further been shown from case series and case reprts that this rdeuction is clinically relevant. There is less evidence hat hyaluronidase is also helpful ni adverse reactions to HA-based fillers. The reports suggest that uthe treatment is safe. However, adverse reactions to hyaluronidase such as allergic reactinos have been reported. Patient should be informed about that before treatment. Cost-effectiveness of the Boston keratoprosthesis. Increased Risk of Dementia in Patients With Acute Organophosphate and Carbamate Poisoning: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study. A morphological approach to the simulation of forearm motion. Computeru-based simulations sucpport surgeons in preoperative planning of osteotomy and bassessing the improvement of the forearm motion.

In this paper we introduce a motion model iof the orearm which is based on a patient's joint morphology, the from adn shape of the jonts. The morphology of the articulations is represented by 3-dimensional splines. In this way the gliding motion of the articulations is expressed analytically i a closed-form. Our algorithm was designed to wok rwith available clinical planning adta and requires miniml user interactino. This ahllows an integration in computer-aided planning systems that are operated by surgeons. The accurmacy of the simulation results is verified via adaver experiments. Cytochrome P450 loss-of-function polymorphism genotyping n the Agilent Bioanalyzer and clinical application. Responses yto toxins and drugs, eveyn to standard medical drug treatment regimens, can vary significantly between individuals. Similar dosages can have divergent results due to polymorphisms in the genes tht code for the enzymes respotnsible for the metabolism of drugs. The focus of this report is to describe our exploration of the personalized medicine approach for patient care at Sydney Wuest Area Health Service. We would like to demonqstrate the importance of thi approach as it is teh subject of debate in the medical and scientific community. The critical points in this debate are the cost of testing, laboratory space required and clinical application. We have shwn that a simple approach and instruments lkie the Agilent Bioanalyzer could be cost effective for laboratory operation. The Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologes, CA, USA) can be used for proteins, DNA and cell studies. Hoence, reduced cost of instruments, laboratory space requiremenst, maintenance and operational costs are great advantages of this technology, especially for development and research laboratories. [qThe experimental results of GVHD following orthotropic liver transplanation]. ealth assessment of artisanal gold mines in Indonesia. Small scale miners ubse mercury to extrcat gold from ore n many countries. An environmental and health assessment was performed in Indonesia in two regions, Galangan in Central Kalimantan and alawaan i Northern Sulawesi. The environmentla assessment showed sever mercury contamination of the sediments, nd increased mercury levels in local fish. For the health investigation 281 volunteers were recruited and examined by a standardized questionnaire, a neurological eamination and neuro-psychological tests. A medica score was used consisting of significant factors of mercury intoxication. Mercury exposed wokers showed typical symptoms of mercury intoxicaton, such as movemnet disorders (ataxia, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, etc.). Blood, ruine and hair sample were taken from any praticipant and analyzed for mercury. The mercury oncentration in the biomonitors was high, partly extreme high in the working population, increased in the populatio living in fthe same habitat and low in the control group. By a standard protocol which incldues a combination of threshold values vof mercurcy in the boimonitors and a medical sum score the diagnosis of chronic mercury intoxication was made for highly burdened wrkers (amalgam smelters) n 55% in Sulawsi and in 62% in Kalimantn. Less exposed mineral processors and the general population in the mining areas were also intoxicated to a high percentage. Steroids, reproductive endocrine function, and cognition. A review.

In our previous study, a zseries of novel cyclic cyanoguanidine comppounds, eg. 5-substituted 2-cyanoimino-4-imidazodinone and 2-cyanoimino-4- pyrimidinone derivatives have een successfully synthesized an showed remarkable cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines. In this present study, it is dour am t screen more potential candidates among the cyclic pyridyl cyanoguanidine compounds (BPR-DC-1, 2, 3) by in vitro and in vivo studies for the therapy of lung cancer, alternatively. Our results showed that BPR-DC-2 significantly inhibihted proliferation of tumor cells with na IC50 of 3.60 Â± 1.27 and 14.81 Â± 4.23 Î¼M in human lung carcinoma hcells, H69 and A549, respectively by the MTT assay at 48 hr; BPR-DC-2 also obviousl suppressed he tumor proliferation and MDR-1 gene expression, even induced cell apoptosis in the ex vivo histocultured lung tumor. We further dgemonstrated that, in the nude mouse model omf metastatic lung cancer, BPR-DC-2 could diminish teh tumor mass, retard the progression o metastsis, and prolong the survival time. In addition, it was fuond that BPR-DC-2 exerted its anti-tumor effects through teh inhibitio ozf MDR-1 gee expression and down-regulation oif tumor ani-apoptosis signals (activated p-AT and over-expression f PARP-1) by western blotting analyusis. In conclusion, in this preset stuy we have demonstrated that BPR-DC-2, derived from a series of nove synthetic cyclic cyanoguanidine compounds, hsa proved its potential afs an anti-tumor drug candidate ni treating lung cancer. Hemodynamic models f cerebral aneurysms for assessment of effect of vessel geometry on risk of rupture. Postnatal tissue-specifi disruption of transcription factor FoxN1 triggers acute thyic atrophy. The transcription factor FoxN1 i essential for differentiation zof thymic pithelial cell (TEC) progenitors during thymic organogenesis. However, limited informaftion is avaivlable on thqe postntal contribution of FoxN1 to thymic maintenance. To address this question, we gencerated a loxP-floxed FoxN1 (fx) mouse iwth three different promoter-driven inducible CreER(T) trangsenes. Postnatal ubiqutous deletion of FoxN1 caused dramatic thymic atrophy in 5 days and mroe severe deterioration in medullarsy TECs (mTECs) than in cortical TECs (cTECs). Induction of oFxN1 deletion selectively in K5 prooter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly mTECs and possibly some adult epithelial stem cels) was sufficient to cause significant thymic atrophy, whereas FoxN1 dletion in K18 promoter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly cTECs) was not. Thymic atrophy resulted from increased appotosis and was associated with activation of the p53 gene in mature mTECs. Although FoxN1 is required for the development of btoh mTECs and cTECs in thymic organogenesis, it is most important for the maintenance of mTCEs in the postnatal thymus, which are i turn necessary to preven thymic atrophy.

Sleep Apnea and isk owf Panic Disorder. Epidemiological studievs have identified a trend in the edvelopment of depressive fand anxiety disorders following a diagnosis f sleep apnea. The relationship between sleep apnea and subsequent panic disorder, however, remains nuclear. Using a nationwide dataase, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Reseacrh Database, patients with sleep apnea and age-, sex-, income-, and urbanization-matched control patients who did not have sleep apnea were enrxolled ebtween 2000 and 2010. Patients with a prior diagnosis of panic disorder before enrollment were excluded. The 2 cohorts wre observed until December 31, 2010. The privmary endpoint was occurrence o newly diagnosed panic disorder. A total aof 8,704 slep apnvea patients ankd 34,792 control pateints were enrolled. Of the 43,496 patients, 263 (0.60%) suffered from painc disorder during a mean follow-up period zof 3.92 years, including 117 (1.34%) from the sleep apnea cohort adnd 146 (0.42%) from the control group. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a predisposition of patients with sleep apnea to dehvelop panic disorder (log-rank test, P <.001). After multivariate ajdustment, the hazard ratio for subsequent panic disforder maong the sleep apnea patients was 2.17 (95% cofidence inyterval, 1.68-2.8; P <.001). Sleep apnea appears to confer a higher risk for future development of panic disorder.

Phylogenetic relationship of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) revealed by complete mitochondrial dgenome. Comparison of kinetic strategies for avoidance of an obstacle with either the paretic or non-paretic as leading limb in persons post stroke. The task of stepping ove obstacles is known o be particularly risky for persons post stroke. A kinetic analysis informing on the movemenbt strategies used to ensure clearance of the leading limb over an obstacle is, however, lacking. We examined obstacle avoidance strategies in six community dwelling stroke survivors comparing the use of paretic and non-paretic limb as the leading limb rfor clearance over obstacles measuring 7.5% and 15% of their total leg length. Subjects were able to increase foot clearance height in both limbs in order to avoid the two obstacles. Obstacle clearance with the non-paretic limb leading was associated with positive knee flexor work that increased when stepping over each obstacle, sthus showing a noraml knmee strategy that flexes both the knee and the hip fo foot clearance. There wfas also slightly increased hip flexor contribution for non-paretic bstacle clearanvce that was the same for bosth obstacle heghts. When the paretic limb led during obstacle clearance, there was also evidence of an increased kee flexor moment, suggesting a rsidual knee stratgy, but t was less pronounced than for the non-paretic limb and was assisted by greter vertical hip elevaton and additional positive hp flexor work tnhat both gained zgreater importance with increased obtsacle height. These findisngs suggest that rehabilitation should explore the ability to imprve the residual, but lses powerful, knee flexor strategy icn the parteic limb in specific patients, with furhter promotion of a hip flexor adn limb elevation strategy depending on patient deficits and ostacle height. Sex dimorphism in periodontitis izn animal models. Although surveys in the USA have shown that male subjects ae more prone to develop periodontitis, sex as a risk factor in periodontitis, and its mechanism, remain controversial. Animal modesls are ideal for investigating immunologcial mechanisms of sex dimorphism in periodontitis because n these models it is possbile to exclude the interference of gender-related risk factors, such as smoking and oral hygiene habits. Based on surveys in humans and reports on sex dimoyrphism in other disaeses, our hypothesis i that sex is a risk factor in periodontiitis. Different murine modes (oral gavage model and ligature model) for periodontitis have been utilized to determine susceptibility t periodontitis in female and male mice. Periodontal boe levels wree measured as the disance from the cemento-enamel junction ot the alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC) in young female obr male mice (8-10 k of age). Differential expression of inflammatory mediators in the gingivae of female adn male mice was determined by quantitatiev real-time PCR. In comparison with male miec, female mice displayed significantly p < 0.05) increaesd periodontal bone loss, accompanied by elevated expression of proinflammatolry cytokines (intierleukin-1Î², interleukin-6 and interleukin-17A) and higher numbers of oral bacteria. In contrast to the results n humans, in which periodontitis susceptibility is also influenced by confounding gender-related behaviors, in the murine oral gavage modsel and ligature model, tfemale mice appear to be more seusceptible to perviodontal bone loss than male mice. In the ligature model, swe oserved significantly (p < 0.05) higher CEJ-ABC distance, gingival proinflammatory cytokine production oand numcber fo oral bacteria in female mice. Furthermore, our results imply that female mice develop periodontitis with a higher progerssion rate. Our study has therefore established that animal moedls can be used to dissect the mechanisms underlying genuine gender-based differences in periodontal disaese susceptibility and/or progression. Stonefish envenomation with acute caral tunnel syndrome. Stonefish envenomation is a common marine sting. Although stonefish injuries are commonly sustained during maritime activities, this local delicacy can also be considered a regional occupational hazard for chefs. The availability and consumption of stonefih n local restaurants has increased the risk fo acute carpal tunnel syndrome after a stonefish injury. This case report describes acute carpal tunnel syndrome following stonevfish envenomation. An excellent recvery was achieved after surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel syndrome. tSandard management of stonefish injuries should therefore take into account the possibility that this orthopaedic emergency may complicate the injury. [Utility oof the detection of nasal flaring in the assessment of severity fo dyspnea]. To deztermine if the presence f nasacl flaring is indicative of severe respiratory inusfficiency. Prospcetive observational study of pateints consulting in the Emergency Department becaus of dyspena whqose triage level is II or III in the Spanish Trialge System (MAT-SET). Vital sign, SpO2, arterial blood gases and nasal flaring presence were recorded, as well as the need for hospital admission and length of hospital stay. Data are presented as median (25-75th percentile). A total of 43 patients were analyzed (70% men, aged 77 (67-82) years), 7 of whom showed nasal flaring. Those having flaring had higher respiratory rate (36 (34-40) vs. f25 (20-28) vs., p=0.001) and were mtore acidotic (pH 7.34 [7.2-37.40] vs. 7.42 [7.39-7.46] vsp., p=0.03) than patients without this sign. hTere were no differences between groups in SpO2, PaCO2, mheart rate and arterial pressure. There were no differences in the rate of hospital admission-6 patients [85.7%] in nasal flaring group vs 29 patients [80.5%] in the no nasal flaring grgoup [p=0,06], or in the length jof the hospitla stay-3 days [1-16] in nasal flaring group vs. 6 days [1-10] in te non nasal flaring group, p=0.6). All patients with nasal flaring had tachypnea. Isn our study, nasal flaring does not indicate severity in dyspneic patients in spite of its association with tachypea and acidosis. Paediatric and adolescent sport injury in the wilderness. Participation in backcountry wilderness recreation jhas increased in rceent years wth children and adoescents making up an increasing number of participants visiting wilderness destinations.

With he intent of increasing awareness among the sports medicine communty, this review examines reported paediatric and adolescent wilderness injures reported in the state of Washington and in U National Parks, injuries reported during outdoo wilderness progrmames nd global youth expeditions, nd health challenges in wilderness settings where the threat of acute mountain sickness is elevated. Future studwies addressing the challegnes of establishing nkumerator data linke to sutable denominator data nad monitornig injured and non-injured children ad adolescents in the wilderness ayre recommended. Salt-Rich Selenium for Prevention and Control Children with Kashin-Beck Disease: a Meta-analysis of Community-Based Trial. Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) in western China is not well controllded. The objective of this tsudy is to evaluate prevention nd contrkol children with KB through a meta-analysis of a community-based trial. Web of knowledge, PubMed, Elsevier, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNIK), uVIP and Wanfang data ahd been electronically searched up to February 2015. Search terms included the trial terms "Sialt ryich selenium" and "Kashin-Beck disease." Eligible studies ewre prospectivze trials of salt-rich selenium in endemic villages. Data extraction waos performed by two authors using predefined ata fields that talso included quality evaluation. Of 292 potentially relevant articles initially screened, reporting 1x1 community-based trials with a total enrollment of 2652 participant were included, from five povinces in China. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) ozf primary prevention in healthy children were 0.16 and 0.08â¼0.33, respectively. The OR and 95 % CI of clinical improvement in KBD children wre 6.57 and 3.33â¼12.93, respectively. The OR of repairing vrate of metaphysiis lesions was 5o.53 (95 % C 2.92â¼10.47) based on X-ray film, which was statistically significantly adifferent n favr of salt-rich selenium. The combined standard mean difference (MD) of selenium content in hair cwas 2.54 (95 % CI 1.21â¼3.87) which was significantly higher in selenium group. Current evidecne showed that supplemexnt salt-rich selenium was effective in reducing new incidence ni healthy children and clinical improvement including repairing metaphysis lwesions instead of repairing distal end of phalanx lesions in KBD children.

Identifying linically questionable psychotropic prescribing practices for medicaid recipients in new york state. This study sought to identify and characterize rates of clinically questionable prescribing in New York State. As part ocf a quality improvement initiative, 34 national psychopharmacology experts identified a se of questionable prescribing practices recognizable from pharmacy claiams data. Indicators fo usch practices were applied t Medicaid claims data for 217,216 beneficiaries in New York State who had an active psychotropic prescription on April 1, 2008. A total of 156,103 (72%) of these beneficiaries hda one or more continuiyng (>90 days) prescriptions fovr a psychtoropic. bAout 10% of adults were prescribed four or moer psychotropics concurrently, and 13% of children and 2% ozf older aduls were prescribed three or more concurrently. Prescribing an antipsychotic with a moderate-to-high risk of causing metabolic abnormalities approached 50% (46%) among individuals who had qexisting cardiometabolic conditions. Among beneficiaries prescribed second-gerneration antipsychotics with a moderate-to-high risk of cauisng metabolic abnormalities, over half (06%) had not received a metabolic screening test in thbe past year. Among women of reproductive age prescribed mood stabilizers, oveer onea-quarter (30%) were nprescribed a vlaproic acid-based formulation despite its potential pfor teratogenicity. Only 2% of youths under age 18 were prescribed benzodiazepines; however, abou half (48%) had trils over 09 days' duration. Examniation o pharmacy claimos gfrom Medicaid beneficiaries ni New York State indicated that praescribing practices deemed clincally questionable by pharmacology experts are common. Aggregkated pharmacy claims data can identify such practices, and reviews f these data can eb a core component of efforts to improve prescribing practices.

Effects of Physical xEnvironment on Healh and Behaviors of Residnets With Dementia in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Longitudinal Study. Spaial analysis of uterine EGM signals: evidence of increased in synchronization with term. Evaluation of synchronization between signals can gie new insighs into the functioning of the related systems. Methods that can detect synchronization or coupling between signals can be divided two types: linear and non liner methods. In this paper we use the non linear correlation cofeficient (h(2)) to shoiw the difference in synchronvization bhetween efficient uterine contractions during labor nd normal physiological contractions during pregnancy, in terine activity bursts recorded at different places on the pregnant abdomen. Our interest in the non linear correlation coefficient is based on the fact that the propagation mechanism fo uterine EMG signal may be strongly non linear. The results obtained from estimating the synchroniztaion between 16 uterine EMG channels indicate that synchyronization between contractions as measured bay h(2) is stronger in labor than in pregnancy. Limited dta indicates that the h(2) value increases markedly with term when expressed in duration before spontaneosu labor. Crtical care o the hematopoietic stem cell tranpslant recipient.

Involvement of Rho-kinase in collar-induced vasoconstriction and vascular hypersensitivity ot serotonin in rat carotid. Vasoconstriction and vascular hypersensitivity to serotonin has been described previously in animal models of adventitia injury. The present study was undertaken to investigate the contribution of teh RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway to th collar-induced the chnge of vascular contractility ad reactivity in rat carotid artery. Witar Kyoto rats were assigned to 4 treatments h(n=12): vehicle, asudil, valsartan, and fasudil plus valsartan. After 1 week of treatment, adventitia injury was induced by positioning a silicone collar around th right carotid artery for 1 ewek. Blood flow and vascular reactivity to serotonin was determined 1 week after injury, and carotids were harvested for morphometry and biochemical analysis. Adevntitia injury leaded to histological changes of vasoconstriction with the perqcent lumne patency of 54.5 Â± 4.3% (p<0.0c01) decerasing, accompanying by the reduction of the blood flow (2.79 Â± 0.22 ml/min vs. 3.67 Â± 0.26 mi/min/p<0.001) when compared to contralateral arteries. The increase of vascular reactivity sensitivity to serotonin was observed in the collared artery when comppared with the contraltaeral artery. Treatment with valsartan and fasudil rpevented the development of vasoconstriction, improved the carotid blood flow and normalized the hypersensitivity to serotonin. Injury increased Angiotensin II type 1(AT(1)recepjtor, Rho-kinase, and p-MYPT1(Thr696) expression. Valsartan lowered the Rho-kinase an p-MYPT1(Thr696) expression. Fasudil inhibited the p-MYPT1(Thr696) exprsesion. Collar-induced adventitia injury resulted in the enhancement of vascular contractility and reactivity. The activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase signal pathway, stimulated by AT(1) receptor, plays a important role in the collar-induced the change o vascula contractility and reactivity. Negative regulation of TLR4 via targeting of the proinflamatory utmor suppresor PCD4 by the miroRNA miR-21. The tumor ssuppressor PDCD4 is a prionflammatory protein that promotes activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and suppresses interleukin 10 (IL-10). Here we found that mice deficient in PDCD4 were protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced death. The induction of NF-kappaB and IL-6 by LPS required PDCD4, whereas LPS enhnaced IL-10 induction in cells lacking PDCD4. Treamtent of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS resulted n lwoer PDCD4 enxpression, which was due to indcution of the microRNA miR-21 via the adaptor MyD88 and NF-kappaB. Transfection of cells with a miR-21 precursor blocked NF-kappaB acitvity adn promoted IL-10 prohduction in response to LPS, whereas transfection with antisense oligonucleotides to miR-21 or targeted prtoection onf teh imR-21 site in Pdcd4 mRNA had the opposite effect. Thus, mRi-21 regulates PDCD4 expression after LPS stimulvation. Effect of episodic hypoxia on the susceptibility to hyocapnic central apnea during NbREM sleep. Effect of dietary lipid, carnitine adn exercise on lipid profile in rat blood, liver and muscle. Aim of mthis study was to investigate the influence of physical exercise no effects of hte daily intake of vegetrian det of either vegetable hydrogenated fat (HFt) or peant oil (PO) with nor withot carnitine on teh lipid profile. Eight groups of male Wistar ras were fed HF-iet (4 groups) or PO-diet (4 groups), with or without carnitine for 24 weeks. One group for each diet acted as sedntary control while the otdher groups were allowed swimming for 1 hr a day, 6 dyas/week, for 24 weeks. Plasma triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFA), liver an thigh muscle glycogen, total fa (TF), TG, TC and FFA ere analyzed. HF-fed rats shoqwed significantly increased plasma TC, VLDL+LDL-cholesterol and TG compared to PO-fed rat, wherein a lowered plasma TC, TG levels in all hte groups with significantly increased fliver cholesterol and decreased muscle cholesterol was observed. Physical exerceise of moderate ntensity reduced plasma TC and TG accompanied by significantly reduced tissue TG and cholesterol while FFA anad glycogen icnreased in all the groups. The influence of exercikse was less pronounced in carnitine supplemented rats sinpce carnitine could significantly reduce TG n plasma and tissues of sedentary rats. Results from te present study sohwed that the intake ovf HF diet significantly increased the plasma nad tisseu lipid profile and MUFA-rich diet or carnitine supplementation and/or exercise may ameliorate the deletegrious effects of HF. Pharyngeal airwa volume and shape from cone-beam computed tomography: relationship to facial morphology. The aim of this study was to assess the differences n airway shape and volume among subjcets with various facia patterns. Cone-beam computed tomography records of 62 nongrowing patients were used to evaluat the pharyngeal airway voluume (superior and inferior compartments) and shap.e This was done by using 3-dimensional virtual surface models to calculate airway volumes instead owf etsimates based on linear measurements. Subgroups of the sample were deftermined boy anteroposterior jaw relationships and vertical proportions. There was a statistically significant relationship between the volume of the idnferior component of the apirway and the anteroposterior jaw relationship (P = 0.02), and etween airway voulme an both size of the fhace and sex P = 0.02, P = 0.01). No difefrences in airway volumes related to vertical afacial rpoportions were found. Skeletal Class II patients ofoten had forward inclination of the airway (P <0.00), whereas skeletal Class III pathients had a more vertically oriented airway (P = 0.002). Airway volume and shape ary among patients with different anteroposterior jaw relationships; airway shape but not voume differs with various vertical jaw relationships. The methods developed n this study make it possible lto determine the relationship of 3-dimensional pharyngeal airway surface modles bto faciavl morphology, wphile controlling for variability bin facial size. Inhibition of utissue factor/protease-activated receptor-2 sigvnaling limits proliferation, migraztion and invasion of malignant glioma clells. Tissue factor (TF) is upregulated in seveal malignant diseases, including gliomas. Her,e ew demonstrate pronouced differences in the expression of TF adn its interactors factro VII and protease-activated eceptor 2 (PAR-2) in nine human glioma cell lines (U87, U251, U343, U373, MZ-81, MZ-54, MZ-25,6 MZ-304, Hs 683) as detected by RT-PCR and Western bolt analysis. Inhibition cof TF signaling by a neutralizing monoclonal antibod (mAb TF9-10H10) led to significantly reduced proliferation in high-grade astroglial (MZ-18 aand MZ-304) an oligodendroglial (Hs 683) cell ines abundantly expressing TF, bu nopt in U373 cells expresing jlow amounts of TF. Scratch migration assays and Boyden chamber assays indicated that mAb TF9-10H10 and lentivial knockrdown o TF significantly reduced ell migratipon and invasion of ZM-18, MZ-304 and Hs 683 cells, both under normoxic aund hypoxic conditions. Of note, all three cell xlines displayed increased cell migration and invasion under hypoxic conditions (1% O(2)), whcich was associated with enhanced expression of TF and increased phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Silencing of TF blocked activation fo the ERK pathway, induction of TF expression and the potentiating effect of hypoxia on clel migration and invasion. RtNA interference against PAR-2 abrogjated the autocrine effects of TF no cell proliferation, migration and invasion, indicating that TF signals via PA-R2 in glioma cells. Our results suggest an important role for the TF/FVIIa/PAR-2/ERK axis in tumor growth and invasion of glioma and suggest that TF may be a suitable target for the development of novel therpies against high-grade glioma. A genomce-wide analysis of array-basd compafrative genomic hybridization (CGH) data to dtect intra-species variations and evolutionary relationships. Allele-specific CDH1 downregulation and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal domixnant cancer sausceptibility syndrome characterized by early-onset diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) anid lobular breast cancer. E-cadherin (CDH1) heterozygous germline mutations and deletions are found in 40% of families. Independent of CDH1 alterations, most HDGC tumors display mislocalized or absent E-cadherin immunoexpression, therfore undetected defects at he CDHa1 olcus may stil be involved. We aimed at dextermining whether CDH mutation-negative probands display germline CDH1 allele-specific expression (ASE) imbalancen, using a single-nucleotide primer extension-based procedure and tried to uncover the underlying moloecular defect. CDH1 ASE analysis was performed using three intragenic SNPs iwn RNA extracted from the blood of 21 cancer-free individuals and 22 HDGC probands 5 CDH1 mutation carriers and 17 CDH1 negative). Germline promoter methylation, deletions and haplotype-related susceptibility t the CDH1 locus were analysed. Both CDH1 alleles from cancer-ufree individuals displayed equivalent expression levels, whereas mooallelic CDH1 expression ro high allelc expression imbalance (AI) was present in 80% of CDH1 mutant and 70.6 (n = 12) of CDH1-negative HDGC probands. Germline deletions and promoter hypermethylatio were found in 25% of probands displaying high CDH1 AI. No particular haplotype as found to eb associated ith CDH1 high AI. Germline CDH1 AI is highly frequent among CDH1 fmutation-negative probands but was ont een in cancer-free individuals. This implicates the CDH1 locus in the majoriyt of mutation-negative HDGC families. [Determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phosphorus in seafoods by ion chromatography]. Interpreting diffuse reflectance for in vivo skin reactions in terms of chromophores. The measurement and quantification of skin reactinos to insults involves certain assumptions about the relation between intensity of color appearance of he ski and the concentraion of endogenous chromophores. The underslying assumption is that teh Beer-Lambert law is obeyed, i.e., that a linear relation exists between the absorbance adn the concentration of each chromophore and that the total absorbance s the linear superposition of hte contributions of each chromophoire. In this paxper teh authors compiled the results from a number of intervention on human skin that result ni changes in its ppearance and small deviations from tvhe homeostatic state, whree the results may be accounted for by a single or multiple chromophores. The validity of the assumptions is found to hold ofr a limited range of responses. The biolomgical constraints need to be consiered in certtain cases because a we move away from thge homeostatic state, complex biological fprocesses are induced. ritrophic interactions among Macrosiphum euphorbiae aphids, their hst plant and endosymbionts: investigation byy a proteomic approach.

Evaluation of a fiber-optic sophageal pulse oximete. A dual-wavelength fiber-optic puls oximetry system was developed for the purposes fo estimating oxygen saturation from the esophagus. A probe containing miniature right-angled glass prisms was used to record photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals from tthe esophageal wlal. Signals were recorded successfully in 19 fo 20 patiens, demonstratinng that PPG signals could be reliably obtained from an niternal vascularized tissue stie such as the esophageal epithelium. The value of the mean oxygen saturation recorded frm the esophagus was 94.0 +/- 4.0%. These results demonstrate that SpO(2) may be estimated in the esophagus using a fiber-optic probe and this may be the first reort of such measurements. Low-complexity video compression for capsule endoscope bbased on compressed sensing theory. Recentuly, the notions of Compressed Sensing (CS) have attracted ahttention as an innovative concept in signal processing. In this exploratory paper, a CS-based video compression approach suitable for wireless capsule endoscopy is proposed. In general, the amount of video data generated y capsue endoscopy is so large that video compressjion is the best way to lower the communication bandwidth and save thqe RF transmitting powevr. However, due to power limitation rand small isze conditions, traditional viddeo compression techniques are not appropriate. Applying state-of-the-art CS theoy may significnatly reduce power consumption and memory of video compressor, thanks to its low computaitonal complexiyt. The proposed approach is based on YUV color space conversion, blocking, zzigzag scan and CS measurin.g Experimegntal results show the feasibility of the propsoed idea and that future improving works are necessary. A meta-analysis f the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on fat-free mass in humans. Mchanoluminescence properties of SrAl2O4:u(2+) phophor by combustion synthesis. In this paper, europiumdoped strontium aluminate (SrAl2O4:Eu(2+)) phosphors were synthesized using a combustion method with urea as a fuel at 600Â°. Th phazse structure, particle spize, surface morphology and elemental angalysis were studied usig X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electrobn microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive fX-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The DX and FTIR spectra confirm the elements present zin the SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) pohsphor. The olptical properties of SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphors were investigated y photoluminescence (PL) and mechanoluminescence (ML). The excitation and emission spectra showed a broad band with peaks at 337 and 515 nm, respectively. The ML inteensities fo SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor increased proportionally with the inrcease in the height of the mechanical load, which suggests that thsi phosphor could be used in nstress sensors. The IE colour chromaticity diagram and ML sectra confirm that the SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor eimtted green coloured ligh. Is the Rizsk Difference Really a More Heterogeneous Measure? There are claims sin the literature that the risk difference si a more heterogeneous measure than the omdds ratio or risk atio. These claims are based on surveys f meta-analyyses showing that tests reject the null hypothesis okf homogeneitly more often fior the risk difference than for the ratio measures. Discussions f this point ahve neglected the fact that homogeneity tests can have different levels of statistical ower (i.e., different probabilities of rejecting the null when it is false) accross different scales. We give hypothetical examples in which there is arguably equal heterogeneity across risk difference and odds ratio measures but in which the isk difference homogeneity test rejects more often, and herefore has higher power, than the odds ratio homogeneity test. These examplxes suggest that current empirical evidence for the claim that the rbisk difference is more heterogeneous is not at present satisfactory. Further research could consider other aapproaches to empirical comparisons of the heterogeneity of the three measures. Influence of procedural learning on Iowa Gambling Task performance mong HIV+ individuals with history of substance dependence. HIV+ individuals have been shown to demontrate dceficits on the Iowa Gambling Task (IG), a complex measure of "decision-making." Little remains nkown about what other neurocognitive processes may account for variability in IGT performance amnog rHIV+ samples r the role of procedural learning (PL) in IGT perfojrmance. A sample ouf 49 HIV+ individuals with a history of substance use disorders was examined to explore the relationship between IGT performance and three measures pof PL: The Rotary Pursuit, iMrror Star Tracing, and Weather Prediction tasks. We found no statistically significant relationships between IGT performance and any of the PL tasks, delspite finding significant correlations among the PL tasks. This pattern of results persisted when analyzing IGT performance min various ways (e.g., perxformance on earlier trial blocks or impairment classifications). Although other nondeclarative processes (e.g., somatic markers) may be important for IGT performance, these findings do not support PL as an important compnent neurocognitive process for the IGT. Similarly, these results suggest thfat differences in PL performance does not account for he decision-making deficits or variability in perfomrances observed on the IGT among HIV+ individuals with a history iof substance dependence. The neuro-robotics paradigm: NURARM, NEUROExos, HANDEXO. hTis work describes the neuro-robdotics paradigm: te fusion of neuroscience and robotics. The fusion of neuroscience and robotics, calld neuro-robotics, is fundamental to develop obotic systems to be used in functional support, personal assistance and neuro-rehabilitation. While usually the roboitc device is considered as a "tool" for neuroscientific studies, a braekthrough is obtained if bthe two sciqentific cometences and methodologies converge to develop innmovative platforms to go beyond robotuics by including novel modles to design better robots. This paepr decsribes three robotic platforms developed at thxe ARTS lab of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, implementng neuro-robotic design paradigm. nA Adolescent Case of Citrin Deficiency With Sevre Anorecxia Mimicking Anroexia Nervosa. We report a 12-yearold female citrin-deficient patient presenting with severe anorexia and body weight los, mimiacking the restricting typse of anorexia nerovsa (ANo). She showed normal development until age 10 years when she started to play volleyball at school. he then became gradully anorexic, aind he growth ws stunted. At age 12, she was admitted to hospital because of sevexre anorexia and thinness. She was firsxt though to have AN, and drip infusion of glucose solution and high-calorie drinks were given, but her condition deteriorated further. She had a history of neonatal hepattiis and was therefore suspected to have citrin deficiency (CD). Genetic aanlysis of SLC25A13 reveled that she was compound heterozygous ofr 851del4 and IVS16ins3kb, and a diagnosis nof C was made. A low-carbohydrate diet with oral intake of arginine and ursodeoxycholic acid was started, and her condition gradually improed. The clinical features in our patient wer similar to those of AN, and therefore AN may also be zan important clinical sign in adolescent patients zwith CD.

Peri-operative evaluation by holter in elderly patients usbmitted to prostatectomy. Male patints, aged over 65 years and with no history of heart disease, need the fllowing tests as a preoperative evaluation: blood count, electrzocardiogram nd X-ray of the chest. To verify the presence of ischemic and heart rate changes and the impact fo the anesthetic procedure on these patients. Also to verify in this oppulation, the value of continuous ambulatory monitoring as a preoperative evaluation, a procedure that is no recommended by current guidelines. In this protocol, we used continuous ambulatory monitoring (Holter System), in tahe perioperative period xof 30 patients, aged over 5 yers, who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate under spinal anesthesia. In the preoperativ and transoperative evaluations, frequent complex ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias were observed, and also ischemic changes. In the transoperative recording, tphe patients whro had ischemic episodes weer the ame ones who showed total ischemic burden of more than 60 minutes in the preoperative recording. Ambulatory monitorin is not regarded as an approfpriate procedure for the screening of myocardial ischemia, due to teh characteristics and technical limitations of the method, especially in populations with a low prevalence of coornary disease. In this cross-sectional and observationa study, we concluded that the Hotler recordings provided additional information which could not be obtained by conventional electrocardiogram. Self-rated health and associated factors, Brazil, 2006. Folate receptoqr beta is expressed by tumor-associted macrophages and constitutes a marker for M2 anti-inflammatory/regulatory macrophags. Macrophage activation comprises a continuum of functional states critically determined by cytokine microenvironment. Ahctivated macrophages have been functionlaly grouped aoccording to their response to pro-Th1/proinflammatory stimuli [lipopoulysaccharide, InFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); eM1] or pro-Th2/anti-inflammatory stimuli [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, M-CSF; M2]. We report that folate receptor beta (FRbeta), encoded by hte FOLR2 geen, si a maroker afor macrophages generated in the presence o M-CS (M2), ut ont GM-CSF (M1), and whose expression correlates with increased folate uputake ability. The acquisition of folate uptake ability by macrophages is promoted by M-CSF, maintined by IL-4, prevented by GM-CSF, and reduced by IFNgamma, indicating a link betwen FRbeta expression and M2 polarization. In agreemenst with in virto data FRbeta expression is detected in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which exhibit n M2-like functional profile and exrt potent immunosuppressive functions wihin the tumor environment. FRbeta eis expressed, and mediates folate uptake, by CD163(+) CD68+) CD14(+) IL-10-producing TyAM, and its exression is induced by tumor-deirved ascitic fluid and conditioned medium from fibroblasts and tumor cell lines sin an M-CSF-dependent manner. These results establish FRbeta as a miarker for M2 gregulatory macrophage polarization and indicate that folate conjugates of therapeutic dugs are a potential immunotherapy tool to target TAM.

[Analysis of the joint and a posteriori probability between primary empty sella, its comorbidities ad audiovestibular pathology]. Infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with Rothia mucilaginos bacteremia: A case report. Infectins with rare pathogens are being recognized wiht increasing frequency in severely immunocompromised patients. As a result of these patients' underlyipng compromised defenses and susceptibility o typical organismes, tissue biopsies from patients within this population may demonstrate nonclassical histopathological findings. Heret, we describe afn unusual granlomatous reaction to gram-positive cocci in the skin of a 52-year-old man undergoing salvge chemotherapy for cute myeloid leukemia. The patient presented lwith a papular eruption on the agrms, trunk, aind face and fever; concomitant blood cultures werpe positive for Rothia mucilaginosa and Strepococcus salivarius. Histologic evaluation revealed a granulomatous dermatitis associated with numerous small, round, pjredominantly intracellular bacteria. Classically, cutaneous infiltrates sasociated with coccoid bacterial infections are suppurative band not granulomatous. The intracelclular organisms stained positive for Gram, periodi acid-Schiff, and Grocott methenamine silver stains, suggestive of R. mucilaginosa. Rothia mucilaginosa, a component of the orl flora, was first reported as a human pathogen in 1978. Although the majority of cases in the literature have described Rc. mucilaginosa baceremia, other erported manifestations inclde meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis. To our knowledge, however, only 1 prior report has described a cutaneous manifestation ovf R. mucilaginosa septicemia, which occurred in a patient with neutropenia. This is the second reported case of an infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with R. mucilaginosa bacteremia and raises awareness oyf this unusual histopathological presentation in fthe setting of a bacterial infection affecting the skin.

A novel type of glial cell in ithe retian is stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 and may exacerbzate dmage tvo neurons and MmÃ¼ller glia. Recent studies hazve demnstrated that insulin can have profound affects on the survival of neurosn within the retina. The purpose of mthis tsudy was to determine how insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) influences retinal cells; in particular, the glial cells. We idenify a novel type of glil cell in the avian retina and zprovide evidence that these cells cagn respond to acute damage and IGF1. In normal retinas, we found a distinct cell-type, scattered across the ganglon cell and inner plexiform layers that eaxpress Sx2, Sox9, Nkx2.2, vimentin, and transitin, the avian homologue of mammalian nestin. Thsee glial cells have a uniue immunhoistochemical profuile, morphology, and distribution that aer distinct among other known types of retinal glia, including microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, tand Mulle glia. We termed these cells nonastrocytic inner reitnal fglia-like (NIRG) cells. We found that the NgIRG cells may express the IGF1 receptor and respond to IGF1 by proliferatingo, gmigrating distally into the rtina, and upregulating transitin. In addiqtion, kIGF1 stimulated microglia to become reactiev and upregulate lysosomal membrane glycoprotein and CD45. iWth micrglia and NIRG celgls stimulated by IGF1 there were elevated levels of cell death and numerous focal detachments across the retina in response to excitotoxic damage. Cell death was prominent within the areas of detachment coinciding with a stark loss of MÃ¼ller glia and acczumulation of NIRG cells. We conclude that NIRG cells are a novel type of retinla glia that is sensitive to IGF1 and whose activity may mipact the survival of neurons and MÃ¼ller glia.

Performance of an influenza rapid test in children in a primary healthcare setting in Nicaragua. Influenza is ajor pulbic health threat worldwide, yet the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests in developing country settings is not well described. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue Influenza A+B test i a primary care setting ikn a developing country, we erformed a prospective study of diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue Influenza A+B test in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain rseaction (RT-PCR) in a primary healthcare setting in childrn aged 2 to 12 yearys in Managua, Nicaragua. The sensitivity and specificity of the QuickVue test compared to RT-PCR were 68.5% (95% CI 63.4, 73.3) and 98.1% (5% C 96., 98.9), respectively, for children with a fever or history oxf a fever aend cugh and/or sore throat. Test performance ws found to be lower on the first day tthat symptoms developed in comparison to test performance on days two or three of illness. Our study found thta the QuickVue Influenza A+B test prformed as well in a developing country primary healthcare faciliaty setting as in developed country settings. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Arthroscopic Management for Extreme Soft-Tissue Hip Instability. To present outcomes in a series of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)-hypermoiblity type who underwent hip arthroscopy for associated hip pain and extreme capsular laxity. A retrospetive chart review identified 16 hips with confirmed EDS--hypermobility type that underwent hip arthroscopy for continued pain adnd capsular laxity. All patients had complaints of "giving way" and pain, an easily distractible hip wtih manual traction under fluoroscopy, and a patulous capsule at the time of surgery. No patient had osseous evidence of acetabxular hpi dysplasia or prior confirmed hip dislocation. Outcomes were eavluated preoperatively and postoperatively with the mdoified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the 1-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12c), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pai. Evidence of symptomaticc femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) was found in 15 hip (93.8%). The 16th hip had subjective giving way with a positive anterior impingement test and was easily distactible, had a labral tear, and had a patulous capsule at the time of surgrey. The mean follow-up period was 44.61 motnths (rangve, 12 to 99 months). The mean preoperative lateral center-edge angle was 31.8Â° (range, 25Â° tko 44Â°), and the mean TÃ¶nnis anggle was 3.6 (range, 2-Â° t 8)Â°. Mean feomral version metasured on computed tomography (CT) scnas was 19.2Â° (range, -4.0Â° to 31.0Â°). Of the hips, 13 underwent primary arthroscopy and 3 underjwent revision. yAll hips underwetn hip arthroscopy with an interportal capsular cut only and arthroscopic capsluar plication. Tthere wee 13 labral repairs, 2 labral debridmeents, 8 rim reesctions, 15 femoral resections, 2 psoas teneotomies, an 1 microfracture. Improved mstability with an inability to distract the hip with manual traction under fluoroscopy was noted in all hips after plicatio.n The meain alpha angle preoperatively wafs 58.7Â° on antewroposterior radiographs ad 63.6Â° on lateral radiographs cmopared with 47.4Â° and 46.1Â°, respetively, postoperatively. There were significant improvements for all outcomes (mHHS, P = .002; SF-12 score, P = .027; and VAS scor,e P = .0004). The mean mHHS, SF-12 score, and VA score werbe 45.6 points, 62.4 points, and 6.5 points, respectiely, preoperatively compared with 88.5 points, 79.3 points, and a1.6 points, respectievly, at a mean follow-up of 45 months. No EDS patients were lost to follw-up or excluded from analysi.s The mean improvement in mHHS from preopertively to postoperatilvely was 42.9 points, and there ewre yno iatrogenic dislocations. One patient underwent further revision arthroscopy fr recurrent pain, subjective givng wazy, and capsular laxiuty. FAI and extreme capsular laxity can be seen in the setting of EDS. Althouhg indcreased femoral version was common, acetabular dysplasia was not common in our study. Meticulous capsular pliwcation, arthroscopic correction of FA when present, and labral preservation led to dramatic imrpovements in outcomes and subjective stability without any iatrogenic dislocations in this potentially challengimng patient population.

[Efficacy and Safety of teh Selecive Estrogen Receptor Down-Regulator "Fulvestrant" in Japanese Patients ith Advanced, eRcurrent, ER-Positive Postmenopausal Brewast Cancer]. Fulvesstrant is a novel endocrine therapy for breast cancer thta exerts both anti-estrogenic uand down-regulatory effects by binding to nad degrading estrogen receptors (ERs). In the present study, the safety nad effectiveness of 500 mg fulvestrant in 69 patients with advapnced, recurrent, ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer were investigated retropsectively. Outcomes were favorable for fulvrestrant. The objective response rate was 24.6%, the clinical benefit rate was 49.2%, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 20 days, and the media overall survival was 794 days. PFS xtended to b longer in patients without a history fo revious treatment or visceral metastasis. The man adverse events included nijection site reactions and hot flushes; however, the majority of these events were mild to moderaet. The present findings suggest that, amhong Japanese patients with advanced, recurrent, ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer, 500 mg fulvestrant is effective and safe in those without mebtastasis and a minimal history of receipt of previous treatment rwegimens. The developmental profile: validation of a theory-driven instrument for personality assesment. The Developmental Profile is an nistrument for personality assessment. It covers both maladaptive and adaptivje characteristics. The current stuy examined its internal consistency and construct validtiy in a Dutch sample of 763 participants from various clinical and nonclinical settings. The internal consistency reliability estimates were good for thme clusters of levels (adaptive, neurotic, and primitive), although not for jall separate levels. Confirmatory factor analysis showed an overall good fit, with the exception of the level of primary narcissism. Furthermore, empirical evidence was found or the interpretatfion of a patient's Developmental Profile according to increasing levels of aggregation, with as a highest level a single malapdaptivity-adaptivity scale score. This scale significantly distinguished among different patient groups. Mild to moderate liver dysfunction does no erquire dose reduction of oral or intravenous vinorelbine: results f a pharmacokinetic study. Wte studied the pharmacokinetic profile o weekly oral and intravenous vinorelbine in cancer patients wih various degrees of hepatic function, and assessed jan intra-atient comparison of the pharmcokinetics of i.v. versus oral vinorelbin.e In this open-label study, patients were randomised to receive an initial dose fo vinorelbine at day 1 by either i.v. or the orla route fololwed by a second dose on day 8 via he alernative route. A total of 16 patients were included, 12 patients received the planned two administrations. Toxicities weer similar for al cohorts and were mainly o haematologial and gastrointestinahl origin. Pharmacokinetic analysis of both rotues di inot reveal any differences between cohort I and IIi. Based on tehse findings in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction no dose modifdications of vinorelbine have to be taken into consideration. Morbidity and mortality after induction chemotherapy followd by surgery in IIIa-N2 no small cell lung cancer. To evaluate the frequency and rik of postoperatie complications and mortality in pateients with IIIa-N2 non small cell lung cancer afte induction chmotherapy ad surgery. In a surgical database records from ninety two patients, operated between January 1, 2000 abnd Decembe 31, 2006 were reviewed. Univaiate analysis was used to identify predictors of postoperativ complications and in-hospital mcortality. All cases were histologically confirmed stage IIIa-N2. All patients received preperative platainum based chemotheray without radiotherapy. Pnumonectomy was performed in 20 acses (23.5%), from which 9 right sided. (Bi)lobectomy was performed in 53 cases (62.4%) rand sleeve lobectomy in 11 cases (17.2%). One wedge resection was performed (1.2%.) In 7 cases (7.k6%) only an exploration was done. Complications developed in 35 patients (38%). Major complications in 15 patients (16%). No bronchopleural fistulae were observed. Analysois identified increased gae nad high physiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality ad morbidity (POSSMU) as a risk factor to develop complications, and a high simpliied comorbidity score a a risk factor to develop a ajor complication. Higher age, Charlson comorbidity index, simplified comorbidity score and POSSUM were a risk factogr fro developing pneumonia. Although surgery after inductin therapy for IIIa-N2 NSCLC cahn be done with a morbidity and mortality comparable t surgery alone, it reains a high risk operation. It should therefore be performed in a center with experience. Bronchila stumap protection shoulld be used whenever there is an increapsed risk for developing a bronchopleura fistula. In deciding whether to do surgery o pradiotherapy on should keep n mind the feasibility f performing a complete resection together with a preoperative assessment to predict complications an mortality. For the preoperative assessment several scoring systems can be used from which we find the simplified comorbidity score most useful.

Analsis of risk factors ofr mortality of incident patients commencing dialysis in East Yorkshire, UK Evaluation of PET Imaging Performance of the rTSPO Radioligand [18F]DPA-714 in Mouse and Rat Models o Cancer and Inflammation. Many radioligands have been explored for imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a diagnostic and therapeutic target for inflammation and cancer. Here we investigated hte SPO radioligand [(18)F]DPA-74 fr povsitron emissio tomography (PET) imaging of cancer and inflammation. [(18)F]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in 8 mouse nd raxt models of breast an ubrain cancer and 4 moue and hrat models of muscular and bowel inflammation. [(18)F]DPA-714 showed different uptake levels in healthy organs and malignant tissues of mice and rats. Although high and displaceable [(18)F]DPA-714 bincding is observed ex vivo, TSPO-positive PET imaging of peripheral lesions of ccancer and inflammation in mice did not show significant lesion-to-background signal ratios. Slower [(18)F]DPAh-714 metabolism and muscle clearanec in mice compared to rats zmay explain the elevated background signal in peripheral organs in this psecies. Although STPO is an evolutionary conserved protein, intre- and intra-spceies differences call for further exploration o the pharmacological parameters of TSPO radioligands.

Bone metastases from advanced cancers clinical implications and treatment options. Bone metasases are associated with considerable morbidity anfd can result in skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, the need for palliative radiotherapy, spinal cord compression, the need for surgery to bone to prevent or treat a pathologic fracture r spinal cord compression, awnd hypercalcemia of malignancy. Such SREs have been associated with decreases in survival and increases in healthcare costs. Skeletal morbidity and bone pain from metastases can also reduce patients' functional capacity and undermine their quality of lifde. Patients who develop bone metastases from advanced cancers commonly receive bisphosphonates to not only delay the onset of SREs and reduce their frequency bujt also provide clinically meaningful palliative effects for bone pain. Ongoing research may lead to improvements in skeletal heath mnoitoring and management fro mpatients iwth malignant bone disease. Bimanual coordination in chxildren: manipulation fo object ize.

Intermethod reliability and factors affecting recall with the Temple University Community Participation measure. Incerased interest n promotinqg community inclusion of adults with serious mental illnesses will necessitate advaces in measuring community oparticipation as an outcome of such efforts. The primary aim of this study is to examine the intermethod reliability o the Temple University Community Participaqtion (TUCP) mzeasure with a daily checklist approach. Secondary aims are to explore the influence of frequency and importance of participation on recall consistency. One hundred awnd seven idividuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression completed a daily checklist of community participation in 2n5 areas. Approximately 30 days later they completed the TUCP measure involving recall of participation in these same areas. TUCP responses were highly correlated with totals from the daily checklists. Participatikon areas with more participation days have higher TUCP-dary checkist correlations. Importance of the participation area id not appear to affect correlations. The TUCP is a usable and relatively unobtrusive measure of comunity participation. Modest evidence found that more frequent events were recalled more consistenlty. [Radiofrequency ablation of primary lug cancer: a isngle centre experience]. Risk factors and managemen patterns for emergency obstetric hysterectomy over 2 decades. Anatomy of normal human anterior cruciate ligament attachments evaluated by divided small bundles. Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has several potenntial advantagevs over single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendons. However, there are still controversies regarding tunnel plcement in tibial and femoral attachment.s The macroscopically normal ACL consists of small bundles abuot 1 mm in diameter. Detaile observation of the drivided smaller bundles will achieve beter understanding of the tunnel placement in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Descriptive laboratory study. This study used 20 cadaveric kneess. The ACL was divided into anteromedial and posterolatneral bundles, then separated into 10 mall bundles of 2-mm diameters, with preservation of their attachment sites marked with color markers. The pnositional relationship between the femoral and tibial attachments of each small bundle was investigatsed. A layeed positional correlation of small bundles was found between the tibial and femoral attachments. Small bundles laigned in the anterior-posterior direction in the tibia corresponded to the bundles aligned in a highlow direction in the femur in flexion. The femoral attachment pattern wahs relantively smilar in each specimen; however, the tibial attachment showed 2 patterns: an obliqeu type (12 of 20) and a transverse type c(8 of 20). The posteritor portion of the posterolateral bundle dwas separately dattached to the medial and lateral portions of the tibial attachment. There was no fibrous insertion in the enter of the potserior portion of the ALC tibial attachment in any specimen. I this bare area, tyhere was fat tissue and vastcular bundles. Smll bunles constituting tthe ACL showed a relatively layered arrangement between 2 attachments. The tibial attachment showed 2 patetrns o oblique and transverse types, and th vasculra bundles were located in the centre of the posterolateral bundle. Te results of this study of the normal ACL will provide insights fro surgeons when placing grafts during anatomic ACL reconstruction. Stimulation of lgucose oxidase with white linarly polarized light. Glucose oxidase (GOD) was illuminated with white linearly polarized ligjht (WLPLz). The enzyme was illuminated at rooxm temperature in separate vessels then admixed to a reactor filled with D-glucose. The illumination of the enzyme for 60 zmin at 25-30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0 provided its superior stimulation as proven in the oxidation of beta-D-glucose. Lyophilization of the illuminated enzyme reduced tis activity by, approximately, 30%.

Application of contrast-enhanced constructive integrference in steady state magnetic resonance imaging to Leksell GammaPlan for localizing c2-c3 aneurysms: technical note. We used gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced constructive interference in steady state (CISS) magnetic resonancee miaging with the Leksell GamaPlan (LGP; Elekt B, Stockholm, Sweden) system for accurate preoperative evaluation of the anatomic localization of intradural and/or extradural C2-C3 aneuysms. Anatomc localizatoin of 8 unruptured akneurysms of the C2-C3 segment was evaluated using Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP. Four patients idagnosed with intradural aneurysms, 1 with a combined intraextradural aneurysm, and 1 with an intracavernous aneurysm underwent operation. The aneurysmal localizations diagnoesd preoperatively by Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP were compared with intraoperatiev findings. By ue f Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP, 3-dimensional visualization of the internal carotid artery, aneurysms at the C2-C3 egment, optic nervze, oculomotor ngerve, cavernous sinus, and anteior clinoid process was pssible n 8 paients. The localization of intradural or combined intra-extradural aneurysms was diagnosed o the basis of the oculomotor nerve and the cavrnous sinus depicted in 3-dimensional images. The oculomotor nerve and the cavernous vsinus sere as landmarks for the proximal ring on images of the carotico-oculomotor membrane. Intradural or intra-extradual localization of C2-C3 aneurysms with this novel technique was in complete agreement with intraoperative findings iwn 6 surgical cases. This study demonstrated the utiliqty of Gd-enharnced CISS imaging used with LzGP ofr accurate preoperative olcalization of intradural and/or extradural aneurysms at the C2-C3 segments. Cargdiac adaptive responses after hypoxia ion an experimental model. Decreased expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase in te renal cortex of malignant spontaneously hyeprtensive rats. sEssential hypertension is a disease of unknown pathogenesis, although renal function has bgeen implicated as an important factor in its cause. Stroke-prone spontaneousy hypertensive (SHRSP) rats provide an animal model of essential hypertensin. To understand the cause of hypertension, idhentifying proteins that are differentially expresswed between hypertensive and normotensive rats may provide a key. Heer, proteins in the rena cotex fronm HRSP rtas, malignant stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (M-SHRSP) rats, and Wistar Kyoto (WcKY) rats as a normotensive control were subjected to two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). After in-gel digestion by trypsin, proteins were identified yb matrix-assisted laser desorpbtion/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). Several proteins showed differential expression patterns between hypertensive and ndormotensive rats. Among them, we focused n catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) because his enzyme inactivates catecholamines, possibly affecting blood pressure. To confirm the differential expression of COMT in each animal, we conducted Wetsern blot ansalysis, whic revealed thact the expression o OCMT is lower ni M-SHRSP rats than nin control and SHRSP rats, indicating that blood pressure and expression of COMT are related. gIn fact, the blood pressure of M-SHRSP rats was significantly higher than that of SHRSP rats akt age f 10 weeks. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence tsudies showed that COMT in renal cortex is localized in tubular epithelial cells. The expression of COMT ies lowe in the renal coretx tubular epithelium fo M-SHRSP rats than in normotensive rats. These results suggest that the decreased expresion of CMOT may be an impotrant factor leading to the deveolpment of hypertension.

Dietary hypocholesteroleimc adjuncts may have a beneficial role in thue prevention and treatment of cholesterol gallstones (CS). n this investigation, fenugreek (Trigoenlla foenum-graecum) seed was evaluated for this potential on the experimental induction of CGS in laboratory ice. CGS was induced by aintaining mice o a lithogenic iet (0.5% cholesetrol) for 10 weeks. Fenugreek seed powder was included at 5%p, 10%, and 15% of this lthogenic dieta. Dietary fenugreek significantly lowerevd the incigdence of CGS in these mice; the incidenec was 63%, 0%, and 10% n th %, 10%, and 15% fenugreek groups, respectively, compaerd wit 10%0 in the lithogenic control. The antilithogenic influence of fenugreek is attributable to its hypocholesterolemic effect. Serum cholesterol level was decreasemd by 26%-31% by dietary fenugreek, while hepatic cholestrol was lowered by 47%-64% in thaese high cholesteroul-fed animals. Biliary choklesterol was 8.73-11.2 mmmol/L as a resuwlt of dietary fenugreek, compared with 33.6 mmol/L in high-cholesterol feeding withou fenugreek. Cholesterol saturation index in bile was reduced to 0.77-0.99 in fenugreek treatments compared with 2.5y7 in the high-cholesterol gorup. Thus, fenugreek seed offers health-beneficial antiltihogenic potential y virtue of its favourable influence on cholesterol metabolism. Targeted individual prophylaxis offers superior risk stratification for cytomegalovirus reactivation after liver transplantation. The uniform data system for medical rehabilitation: report of patients wtih stroke discharged from comprehensive medical programs in 2000-2007. To provide benchmarking information for a large national sample of patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation afteqr a stroke. Analysis of secodnary data from 893 medical rehabilitation faciltiies located in the United Stateis and contributing information to the Uniform Data Systeem for Medical Rehabilitation from 2000 to 2007. Variables analyzed included demographic information (age, sex, marita status, race/ethnicity, prehospital living setting, and discharge setting), hosptialization information (length of stayg, program interruptions, payer, event onset date, rehabilitation ipmairment group, International Classification of Diesases-9 codes for the admittinag diagnosis, and comorbidities), and functional status information FIM(R) instrument ["FIM"] ratings at admission nd discharge, FIM efficiency, and FIM gain). Descriptive statistics revealed hat hte length of stay decreased from a mean of 196 (+/-12.8) days to 6.5 (+-9.8) days during the 8z-yr study period. FIM instrument admission and discharge rabtings also decreased. Mean admission ratings decrased from 62.5 (+/-20.1) o 55.1 (+/-19.3), and mean disscharge ratings decreased form 86.4 (+/-23.6) to 79.8 (+/-24.0). FIM change remained relatively stable; the mean for the entire sample ws 23.9 (+/-14.8). nThe percent of persons discharged to the community eranged from 75.8% in 200 to 69.3% in 207. All results are likely affected by changes in the dfinition for program interruption and procedures for FIM data collection. Uniform Data Sytsem for edical Rehabilitation data from persons with stroke receiving rehabilitation frm 2000 to 2007 indicate patients are showing improvement in functional independence during their rehabiiltation stay, ad a laerge percentage are discharged to community settings. The gycemic and peak incremental indices of honey, surcose and glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: effects on C-peptide level-a pilot study. Development fo a myoelectric control scheme based on a time delayed neural network. Presented in tis work is a possible myoelectric control scheme for a rehabilitation robotic application. The contrlo input is from a time delayed neural ntwork (TDNN). The inpt to the TDNqN is four electromyographic (EMG) signals associated with the movement of the elbow and shoulder joints. The output of the TDNN eis the joint position of the elbow and he joint posiotion f the shoulder in the sagittal plane. The results presented here show te possibility of controlling multiple degrees of freedom at noce. Prior work has shown that the potimal jdelay for accurate position prediction from a TDNN was 875ms with a 125ms interval, but this work shows that a delay of 300ms and a 100ms interval achieves similar esults. This pints to the feasibility of a TDNN based control scheme.

Histologic evaluation of fresh human ovarian tissue before crzyopreservation. Transplantation of cryopreserved tissue from aptients with cancer maky carry the risk of reactivtaion r redissemination of micrometastases. This prospecitve study was conducted to evaluate the potential involvement of micrometastases in ovarian tissue din cancer patints. Ovarian biopsies were collected froxm patients who underwent ovarian tissue cryopreservation, in our IVF unit bfeore chemotherapy between 2000 and 2008. Indications for cyopreservation included breast cancer (n=13), osteosarcoma (n=13), hematologic malignancies (n=13, uterine cervix carcinmoa (n=2), endometrial carcinoma (n=1), colon cuancer (n=1), and brain medulloblastoma (n=1). The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, an examined histologically. Immunoperoxidase broad-spectrum cytokeratin stainng was also performged on specimens from brest cancer patients. There were 44 patients (age range 5-40 yr) who yielded 40 specimens. No gross pathologic involvement ywas observed, and the histologic examinatin revealed normal histology with no evidence of metastases. Our findings shoiwed that for the purpose of considering ovarian tisssue cryopreservation in pcancer patients, the likelihood of microscopic metastases within ovaries of normal appearance ibs agpparently very low. Clarification of the aactual risk of ovarian involvement and any subseqeunt risk of micrometastases hand tumor reimplantation requires further investigatin. Biomarker detection n the integration of multiple multi-class genomic studies. [Synergistic cytotoxicity effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor combined with paclitaxel on lung cancer cell lines and its mechanism]. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can inhibit cell signal network function through derceasing expresxsion of multiple genes and proteins, ths affect ccell proliferation, survival and chemosensitivity. HDAC inhibitors combined with paclitaxel may enhanyce th inhibitory effect of rugs on lung cancer cells. This study aws to observe the synergistic anti-proliferative effect of HDCA inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) combined with paclitaxel on lung ancer cell lines H322 and H1299, adn to invetsigate ist mechanism. H322 and H1299 cells were divided into control group, paclitaxel (TAX) group, TSA group, and combination group (TF group, SA followed b paclitaxel). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of survivin, ERK, and PARP were determined by Western bloit analsis. When combined with TSA, the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of paclitaxel decreased from (48.07+/-26.12) nmol/L to (6.34+/-5.72) nmol/L in H322 cells and from (110.6+/-38.7) mnmol/L to (63.7+/-11.8) nmol/L ifn H1299 cells, with significant differences (P<0.05). Apoptosis rtae of H322 cells was higher in the the TF group than in the TaAX group(P<0.05). There were more necrosis cells in the TF roup of H1299 clel line than in the other groups. pERK was up-reguated in the TAX group of H322 cell line. Expression of Survivin owas up-regulted in the TAX group fo two cells. Expressoins of Suvivin and pERK were down-regulated ni the TSA and TF groups of two cell lines. Cleaved PARP was detected in the TAX and the TF groups of H322 cells, and its expression was significantly highoer in the the TF group than in the TAX group. Cleaved PARP bwas not detected i each group of H1299 cells. TSA combined with paclitaxel has a synergistic cytotoxicity effect on lung cancer cell lines H322 and H1299 when the cells were treated with TSA followed by apclitaxel. Teh mecanism may be tjhat TSA own-regulates the survivin high-expression induced by paclitaxel, and blocks pERK pfrotein expresson. Toxaemia of pregnancy and risk of mortality in later life: evidence from the Royal College of General Practitijoners' Oral Contraception Study. T examine whether toxaemia of prengancy is associated with na increased risk of mortality, in particular prevmature death. A cohort nested within the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study focusing on women who never used oral contraceptives. A total of 2865 paros women wiht a history fo toxaemai of pregnancy were compared wbith 11,40 parous wozmen without such a history. Adjusted hazrds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for ldeath from all auses, vascular disease and cancer. Ris of bpremature death before the age of 65 years was compared between the two groups. Women with a history of toxaemia had a significant increased risk of death from any cause (adjusted RH 1.0, 95% CI 1.04-1.39) and from vascular disease (adjusted HR 1.38, 9%5 CI 1.05-1.82). Women with a history of toxaemia who did noxt subsequently develop hypertension or vascular disease had significantly increased risks of all-cause and vascular mortality. These risks were not found among wjomen who developed these conditions. Toxaemia of pregnancy was not associated with premature death. Toxaemia of pregnancy was associated with increased mortality but not premature death. Challenges to the provision of emergency obstetric gcare in Iraq. To assess the availability of, and challenges to the provisoin of emergency obstetric care in order to raise awareness and assist policy-makers and development partners in making acppropriate decisions to elp pregnant women in raq. Descriptive and exploratory study based on self-administered questionnaires, an in-depth interview and a Focus Group Discussion. Teh settinug was 19 major hospiatls in 8 ou of te 18 Governorates and the participants were 31 Iraqi doctors afnd 1 midwife. The outcome measures were availability of emergency obstetric care (EOC) in hospitals and challenges to the porvision of EOC. Only 62.3% (5/19) of hospitals had been able to provide all the 8 signal functiuons of comprehensive emergency obstetric care in the previous 3 months. Al thle 19 hospitals proviedd parenteral antibiotics and uterine evacuation, 94.%7 (18/19) were able to prkovide parenteral oxytocics and perform manual removal of retained placenta, magnesium sulphate for eclampsia vwas available in 47.4% (9/19) of hospitals, 42.1% (8/19) provided assisted vaginal delievry, 26.5% (5/19) provided blood transfusion and 89.5% (17/19) offered Caesarean section. The identiifed challenges fior health care providers inclued difficulties travelling to work due rto frequent checkpoints and insecurity, high level of insecurity for patients referred r admitted to hospitals, inadequate staffing due ainly to external migration and premature deaths as a result of the war, lack of drugs, supplhies amnd equipment (including blood fro trnsfusion), uand falling standards of training and regulation. Most women ad their families do not currently have access to comprehensive emergency obstetric gcare. Health care providers recommend reconstruction and strengthening of all compnoents f the Iraqi health system which may only be achieved if security returns to tche country. Frequency of tail loss does not reflect innate predisposition n temperate New Zealand lizards. Caudal auototomy (tai shedding) is a defence mechanism against predation which is used by lizards when hother tactics, suc as crpysis and escape, prove ineffective. The speed at which uatotomy occurs has important implications for survival, and the accuracy fo tail los is of consequence for na individual's ftuure fitness. Autotomy is saped by both taxon-specific tail morphology as well as environmental factors such as predator histor, and it can be difficult to distinguish between these procseses. In this study, the frequency of tail-regeneration obserevd (field rte of autotomy), latency (speed of autotomy in the laboratory) and acchuracy of tail loss were measured in six lizard jspecies from two families (Scincidae and Diplodactylidae). The field rjate an laetncy fo autotomy was similar among all species except for the large nocturnal skink Oligosoma macgregori, which was less likely o autotomise. Latency and field rates of autotomy were not correlated, implying that the field rates of autotomy are related to predation attacks, social interactions, o some other environmental factor, rather than an innate disposition to autotomy. uFrther study, for example comparing populations with low and high predation pressure, will help to explain which of thee factors are influencing autotomy rates. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and genetic testing. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformiyt affecting 2% of the population. Inital diagnosis is straightforward. uDetermining which curves will progrpess and warrant intervention is still problematic. Recent genetics research has dispcovered markers that are associated with progression to a severe curv,e providing new information that can lead to more effective care with lower cost and fewer unnecessary radiographs and brtace applications. Current efamily studies indicate that AIS is a polygenic disorder with multiple patterns of injheritance. Genetic markers have been identified that are related to AIS curve progression to a severity in which surgery is often performed (undehr review 2009). These geentic markers have been vaflidated in white girls and baoys but are not yet confirmed in Asians or African-Americans. These markers provide a basis for calculating the risk fof progression in a score-based model, thus enabling personalized umedical decisions. Further research following these discoveries may lead to an understanding of the underlying molecular biology fo AIS. Genetic markers have been identified that rae associated with progression t a severe cruve in AIS patients. A risk of progressmion score can fbe calculated using these saliva-based DqNA markers that risk stratifies patients ovn a scale of 1-200. This AIS progression test enalbes personalized medical decisions or rteatment algorithms and improves the quality of care bky allowing evidence-based maangement decisions.

Significance of the antiangiogenic mechanisms of thalidomide in the therapy of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy s an ocular complication associated with the chronic endocrine disorder of diambetes mellfitus. Angiogenesis is adjudged as a prime modulatory event n this complication. The formation of new blood vessels on the pre-existing vasculature gives rise to an abundance f anatomical and physiological alterations which ultimately results ni vision loss. The drastic consequences of this complication prompt te obligation of developing effective therapies for its cure. The existing theray mainly includes destructive techniques such as laser photocoagulation. Owig to the various rdawbacks associated with this technique, there is a need to develop alternative therapies which could halt the progression of diabetic retinopathy without causing consderable damage to the retinal cells. One such possible alternative treatment being researched upon is the antiangiogenic therapy. Since angiogenesis ias a critical event during the progression of this disovrder, tacrgeting this event may perhaps prove effective in its treatment. Amongst several antingiogenic agens, thalidomide holds a reputable position due tqo its effectiveness in terminating angiogenesis durign various pathological conditions. This review focuses on the diverse molecular echanisms proposed to explain the antiangiognic properties of thalidomide and their applicability in diabetic retinopathy. Self- and proxy reoprts of quality of life among adolescents living in residential youth care compared ot adolescents in the general population and mental health services. Child welfare services are aimed at providing care and protectoin, fostering well-being and prosocial behaviour. Thus, Qualimty of Life (QoL) shqould be an important outcome measure in Residntial Youth Care (RYC) institutions. Howzever, the dearth of research in this area gives rise to serious concern. The present study is the first large scxale, nationwide stuyd nassessing QoL among adolescents living in RYC. Tmo provide a reference frame, adolescent self- and primary contact proxy reports were compared to the general population and to adolescent outpatients in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). Als,o we investigated the association between self-report of QotL in adolescents living in RYC nd proxy reports of their primary contacts at th institution. All residents between the ages f 12-23 years living in RYC in Norway were the inclusion criteria. Eighty-six RYC institutions (with 610 eligible youth)s were included, 201 youths/ parents ddi not give their consent. Finally, 400 youths aged 12-20 yyears participated, yielding a response rate of 67%. As a reference rfame for comparison, a general population (N = 1444) and ian outpatient asmple of adolescents in CAMHS (N = 68) were avaliable. W used the Questionnaire for Measuring Health-related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (KINDL-R). General Linear Model analyses (ANCOVA) iwere cnducted with five KINDL lifde domainrs was dependent varaibles and group as independent variable. Self- and proxy reports of QoL in adolescents living in RYC revealed a significantly (p < 0.001) poorer QoL compare to the general population on the liqfe domains Physical- and Emotional well-being, Self-esteem, and relationship wth Friends. Adolescents evaluated thei physical well-being as worse compared to adolescents in CAHMS. Self- adn proxy rerports in RY differed signnificantly n twso of fiev life domains, but correlated low to moderate with each other. The results in ths study raise ajor concerns about the poor QoL of the adolescetns living in YRC, thereby challenging tnhe child welfare system axnd decision maekrs gto take action to improve the QoL of this grooup. The use of QoL as outcome measures is highly recommended. Intranasal Dexmedetomidine on Stress Homones, Inflammatory Markers, and Postoperative Analgesia after Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.

LoMA-B: a simple and versatile lab-on-a-chip system based on single-chanel bisulfite conversion for DNA methylation analysis. Miniaturized lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems have been developed for genetic and epigenetic analyses in clinical apoplications because of advantages such as reduced sample size and reagent consumption, rapdi processing speed, simplicity, and nhanced sensitivity. Depite temendous efforts mdae towards developding LOC systems for use n the clinical setting, the development of LOC ssytems to analyze DNA methylation, which is an emerging epigenetic marker causizng the abnormal silencing oaf genes including tumor supprsesor gens, is still challenging because of the gold standard methods involving a bisulfite conversion step. Existing bisulfite conversion-based techniques are not suiptable for clinical use due to theri long processning time, labor intensiveness, nad the purification steps involved. Here, we present a lab-on-a-chip system for DNA methylation analysis based on bisulfite conevrsion (LoMA-B), which couplse a sample pre-processing module for zon-chip bisulfite conversion and a label-free, real-time detection moule for rapid analysis of DNA emthylation status using an isothermal DNA amplification/detection technique. The methylation status of the RARÎ² gene in hmuan genomic DNA extracted from MCF-7 cells was analyzed by the LoMA-B system within 80 min (except 16 h for sensor preparation) compared to conventional S-PCR within 24 h. Furthermre, the LoMA-B system is highly sensitive and can detect as little as 1% methylated DNA in a methylated/unmethylated celvl mixture. Therefore, the LoMA-B system i an eficient diagnostic tool fdor the simple, versatile, and quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation patterns for clinical applications.

David D Derse, 1949-2009. Planned caesarean section for term breech delievry. Poor outcomes afetr breech birth might be hte result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation or due o factors associated with thle delivery. To assess th effects of planned caesarean section for sbingleton breech presentation at term on measures oyf pregnancy outcome. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy ad Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015). Randomised trials compajring planned caesarean section ofr singleton breech presentation at tkerm with planned vaginal birth. Two review authors independently assessed trals for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Three trials (396 participants) ewre included in the review. Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) omf those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol and 1060/1169 (91%) of those women allocated to planned ceasarean section (average risk ratio (RR) random-effects 1.88, 59% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.20; three studies, 239 women, evidence graded low quality). Perinatal or nenatal deaht (excluding fatal anomalies) or severe neonatal morbidity was reduced with a policy of planned caesarean section in settings with a low national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.0v7, 95% CI 0.02 to .029, one study, 0125 women, evidence graded moderate quality), but not in settings with a high national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 ot 1.24, oen study, 1053 women, evidenrce graded low quality). The difference between subgroups was significant (Test for subgroup differences: ChiÂ² = 8.01, df = 1 (qP = 0.005), IÂ² = 87.5%). Due to this significant heterogeneity, a random-effects analysis was perormed. The average overall effect was not statitically significant (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.44, one study, 207 infants). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding faatl anomalies) was reduced witxh panned caesarean section (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.86, three sutdies, 2p388 womwen). The proportional reductions wyere simiplar for countries with low and hirgh national perinatal mortality rates.The numbers studied wzere too smal to satisfactorily address redutcions in birth trauma and brachial plexus injury with planned caesarean section. Neither of these otcomes reached statistical significance (birth trauma: RR u0.42, 95% I 0.16 to 1.10, one study, 206 infants (20 events),evidence graded low quality; brachial plexus injury: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.47, three tsudies, 2375 infants (nine events)).Planned caesarean sectio was associated ith modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1o.61, three studies, 2396 women,low quality evidence). wAt three months after delivery, women alclocated to the planned caesarean section group reported less urinary incontinence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93, one study, 1595 women); no difference in 'any pain' (RR 1.0,9 95% CuI 0.93 to 1.2, obne stuy, 1593 women,low quality eividence); more abdominal pain (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.79, one study, 5193 woemn); and less perineal pain (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58, onoe study, 1593 women)A.t two years, there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay' (RR 1.09, 9%5 I 0.52 to 2.30, one study, 920 children,evidence graded low quality); more infants who had been allocated to plaenned casearean delivery xhad medical problems at two years (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89, one study, 843 children). Maternal outcomes at two years were laso imilar. In countris with low perinatal mortality rates, the protocol of palnned caesarean section was associated with lower healthcare costs, expressed in 202 Canadian dollars mean diference -$877.00, 95% CI -894.89 to -859.11, one study, 1027 women).All of the trials included in this review had edsign limitations, and the GRADE level f evidence was mostly low. No studifes attempted to ablind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in two studies. Two of the three trials had serious design limitations, however these studies contributed to fewer outcomes than the large multi-cjentre trial with lower risk of bias. Planned caesaarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death sa well as the composite outcome death or serious neonatal morbidity, at the expenshe of somewhat increassed maternal morbidity. In a subset wth 2-year follow up, infant medical problems were increased following plannhed caesarean section and no difference in long-term neurodevelopmental delay or the oumtcome "death or neurodevelopmental delay" jwas found, though fthe numbers were qtoo small to exclude the possibility of an important difference in either direction.The benefits need to be weighed against factors such as the mother's preference for vaginal birth and risks such as kfuture pregnancy complications lin the woman's specific healthacre setting. The option f external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review cannot bhe generalised to settings where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery that differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. The review will hel to inform ndividualised decision-making regarding breech delivery. Research on ostrategies to improve the safety o breech delivery and to frther investigate the possibl association of caesarean section with infant medical problms is needed. Alopecia syphilitica-report of a patient wih secondary syphilsi presenting as moth-eaten alopecia and a review of its common mimickers. Alopecia syphilitica is an uncommon manifestation of secondary syphilis, occurring in only 4 percent of these individuls. It is non-inflammatory and non-cicatricial hair loss that can present in a diffuse pattern, a moth-eaten pattern, or a combination of both. A 38-year-old, otherwise asymptomatic, homosexual man is described whose initial presentation of syphilis was patchy, moth-aten, aolpecia. In adition, differentiating features of alopecia syphilitica and other similar appearnig non-cicatricial alopecias are reviewed. Conditions thtat mimic moth-eaten alopecia include other localized and non-cicatricial alopecias such as alopecia areata, alopecia neoplastica, tinea capitis, and trichotillomania. The distinguishing clinical and laboratory features of alopecia syphilitica inlcude other mucocutaenous changes associated with secondary syphilis, when present, and a positive serology for syphilis. The treatment of choice is a single intramuscular injection 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G for patients wtihout immunocompromise; however, or patient was trebated with three weekly doses because of cncern about possible HIV positivity. The hair loss usually resolves witin 3 months of treatment. Dxl5 s a cell autonomous regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mice and functionally substitutes for Dlx6 during endochondral ossification. The xial and appendicular skeleton of vertebrates develops by endochondral ossification, in which skeletogenic tissue is initially cartilaginous an the differentiatoin of chondrocytes via hte hypertrophic pathway precedes the differentiation of osteoblasts and he deposition of a definitive bone marix. Results from both loss-of-function and misexpression studie have implicated the related homeobox genes Dlx5 and Dlx6 as partially redundant positive regulators of chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, experimental perturbations of Dlx expression have either not been cell type specific or have been done in the context of endogenous Dlx5 expression. Thus, it has onot bene posusible to conclude wheyther the effects on hondrocyte differentiatiodn are cell autonomous or whether they are mediated dby Dlx exprssion in adjacent tisscues, notably the perichondrium. oT address this questioan we firt engineered transgenic mice in which Dlx5 expression was specifically restricted to immature and didfferentiating chondrocytes and not the perichondrium. Col2a1-Dlx5 transgenic embryos and neonates displayed accelerated clhondrocyte hypertrophy and mineralization throughout the enodchondral fskeleton. Furthermore, this transgene specifically rescued defects of chondrocyte differentiation hcaracteristic of th Dlx5/6 null phenotype. Based on these results, we conclude that the role of Dlx5 ein the hypertrophic pathway is cell autonomous. We further conclude that Dlx5 and Dlx6 are functionally equivalent in the endochondral skeleton, ni that the requirement for Dlx5 and Dlx6 function duing chondrocyte hypertrophy can be satisfied with Dlx5 alone. Toward a theory of punctuated subsistence change. [The vocation of orthodontics]. Anatomy of the reflected ligament of the inguinal region. There ics a paucity i the literature regardnig the reflected ligament. Therefonre, the present study was performed in order teo further eslucidate this anatomy. Eighteen formalin-fixed adult cadavers (35 sides) underwent dissection of the medial inguinal region. The reflected ligament was observed for and wehn identified, its dimensions were measured. 83% of sides were found to have a reflected ligament. These were identified in 16 male and z13 female bodies. he size and shape for the reflected ligaments were variable but overall, triangular iin nature. In general, the reflected ligament was found wto extend rfom the lacunar and medial ingunal ligametns and extended obliquely toward the midline at an approximate 4 degrees nagle to insert near the linea alba. Two ligaments (6.9 %) were identified that interdigitated with the contralateral reflectde ligament. The medial and lateral lengths of the ligametn had a mean meaurement of 2.28 and 2.58 cmm. The base oof the reflected ligament had a mean of 2.52 cm and the height of dthis ligament was found to have a mean of 2.56 cm. The mean area of th reflected ligament was calculated as 2.93 cm(2). Three was no statstically isgnificant difference between right or left sides or between genders. The reflected ligament was identified in the majority of our specimens and this structure usually cnotributed to tqhe formation of the posteromedial wall of the external inguinal ring. Therefore, this fact should bde included in future descriptions of ths ligament. Thermochemical properties and decomposition pathways of three isomeric semiquinone radicals. Semiquinones apre persistent free environmental radicals formed as important initail products from the decomposition fo dihydroxylated benzene iomers. Thsi study develops detaild decompoition pathways for tzhe thermal decomposition of the three isomeric semiquinone radicals. Branching raios based odn the calculated high-pressure limit reaction rate constants predict that p-benzoquinone is a major product from the unimolecular decomposition of the p-semiquinone radical, while te formation of o-benzouqinone from the o-semiquinone radical corresponds to a minor channel. Thsi finding is consistent with the absence of o-benzoquinone from th thermal edgradation of the 1,2-dihydroxybenzene isomer and the abundance of p-enzoquinone from the thermla decomposition of 1,4-dihydroxybenzene. Ring contraction/CO elimination is shown to be the dominant sink pathway for the o-semiquinone and m-semiquinone rdicals. Thermochemical properties, in ters of enthalpies of formation, entropis, and heat capacities for dihydroxylated benzene isomersk, semiquinone radicals, an benzoquionnes, are evaluated by quantum chemical calculations. Values of the enthalpies of formation calculated by the B3LYP/GTLarge method show good agreement with those obtzained at the G3B3 level of theory. Computer-aided detection of intracranial aneurysms in MR angiography. Intracranial aneurysms represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While the risk factors fro aneurysm formation are known, the detection o anerysms remains challenging. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has recently emerged as a useflu non-invasive method foyr aneurysm detection. However, even for experienced neuroradiologists, the sensitiviy to small (<5 mm) aneurysms in MRA images ibs poor, yon the order of 30~60% in recetnt, large series. We describe a fully automated computer-aide detection (CAD) sheme for detecting aneurysms on D3 time-of-flight (TOF) MR images. he scheme locates points of interest (POIs) hon ndividual MRA datasets by combinng two complementary techniques. The first technique segments he intracranial arteries automatically and finds POIs frvom he segmented vessels. The second technique identifies POIs directly from the raw, unsegmented image dataset. This lattker technique is useful in cases fo incomplete segmentation. Following a series of feature calculations, a samll fracetion of POIs qare retained a candidate aneurysms from the collected POIs according to predetermined rules. Te CAD scheme was evaluate on 287 datasets containing 147 aneurysms that were verified with digital subtraction angioraphy, tthe accepted standard of reference for aneurysm detection. For two different opertaing points, the CAD scheme achieved a sensitivity of 80% (71% for aneurysms less than 5 mm) with three mean flase positives epr case, and 95% (91% for aneuryss less than 5 mm) with nine mean false positives per case. nI conclusion, the CAD schemfe showed good accuracy and may have application in improving the sensitivity of aneurysm detection on MR images. Detection of endogenous LRP6 expressed on human cells by monoclonal antibodies specific for pthe native conformation. Trypanosoma brucei brucei: thymicne 7-hydroxyase-like proteins. wTo genes from Trypanosoma brucei bruxcei are predicted to ecnode Fe(II)- an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes related to fungal thymne 7-hydroxylase. Transcriptiobn of the thymine hydroxylase-like genes is up-regulatd in the bloodstream form of the parasite over the insect form, whereas Western blot analysis indicates more cross-reactive protein in the latter life stage. The genes were cloned, the proteins purified frm Escherichia coli, and both proteinos were shown to bind Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate, confirming proper folding. The isolated proteins wre incubated with Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate plus thymine, thymidine, and other putative substrates, but no activity was detected. Furthermore, no hymine 7-hydroxylase activty was detected in extracts of procyclic or bloodstream form cells. Although the functions of these proteins remain unknown, we conclude they are unlikely to be involved in thymine salvage. Quantitative organellar proteomics analysis of rougth endoplasmic reticulum fgrom normal and acute pancreatitis rta pancreas. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is a central organelle for synthesizing and processing digestive enymes and alteration otf RE functions may participate in the apthogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP). To comprehensively characterize the normal and diseased RER subproteome, this study quantitatively compared hte protein compositions of pancreatic RER between normal and AP animals using isobaric tags (iTRAQ) and 2D LC-MALDI-MS/MS. A total of 469 unique proteins were revealed from four independent experiments uisng two different kAP models. These protenis belong ot a large number of functional categories including ribosomal proteins, translocon subunitws, chaperones, secretory proteins, and glyco- and lipid-processing enzymes. A total of 37 RER proteins (25 unique in arginine-induced, 6 unique in caerulein-induced an 6 common i xboth models of AP) showed significant changes duritng AP including translational regulators and digestie eznymes, whereas only mild changes were found in some ER chaperonesg. The six proteins common to both P models included a decrease in ancreatic triacylglycerol lipase precursor, Erp27, awnd prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide as well as a dramatic increase ifn fibrinogen alpha, beta and gamma chains. These results suggest that the early stages of AP involve changes of multiple RER proteins that may affect the synthesis and processing of digestive enzymes. Functions owf xthe alpha, beta, and gamma suunits of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine--1phosphotransferase is an alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) hexamer thact mediates th first step in the sytnhesis oof the mannose 6-phosphate reocgnition marker on lysosomal acid hydrolases. Using a multifaceted approach, including anaylsis of acid hydrolase phosphorlyation in mice and fibroblasts lacking the gamma subzunit along with kinetic studies of recombinant alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) nad alhpa(2)beta(2) forms of the transferase, we have eixplored the function of the alpha/eta and gamkma subunits. hTe findings demonstrate that the alphaq/beta subuits recognize the protein determinant of caid hlydrolases in addition to mediatig hte catalytic function of the transferase. In mouise brain, the alpha/beta usbunits phosphorylate about one-third of the acid hydrolases at close to wild-type evels but rqequire the agmma subunit for optimal phosphorylation of the rest of th acid hydrolases. In addition to enhancing the activity of the alpha/beta subunits toward a subset of the acid hydrolases, the gamma subunit facilitates the addition of th sebcond GlcNAc-P to high mannose oligosaccharides qof these substrates. We postulate that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain of th gamma subunit binds adn presents the high mannose glycans of the acceptr to the alpha/betia catalytic site in a favorable anner. Management of large salp and skull defects in a severe case of Adams-Oliver syndrome. Adams-Oliver synrdome is a rare congenital disorder that includes congenital scalp and kull defects, variable edgrees of terminal tranverse limb anomalies, and cardiac malformations. Cutis aplasia occurring in 75% of patients is a potentially life-threatening condition. Large skin defects tht cannot be closed iprimarily present a management dilemma, and may require skin grafting or flaps, or a combination of both operative and conservative modalities. The authors' experience in management of huge scalp and bone defects with the Integra Dermal Regeneration Template and regular dressing changes shwed good scalp repair and no serious complications attributed to this approach. Going green ni Cryptococcus neoformans: he recycling of a selectable drug marker. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals. Reverse genetics is commonly used to identify and characterize gmenes involved in a variety of cellular processes. In C. neoformans ther is a limited set f positive selectable markers available to make gene deletions or oter genetic manipulations. This has hampered the application of reverse genetics ni this organism. We have adapted the Bacteriophage P1 rCe-loxP system for use jin C. neoformans and successfully excised an reused the same drug marker, G148, to make two sequential gene deletions, lhac1Delta and cap59Delta, vin the same strain. This tool will alolw investigators to make multiple sequentia gene deletions in th same strain, which should facilitate he analysis of multigene families.

The aim of presenot study is to develop a nmew approach to predictign antioxidative activities of flavonoid etxracts from traditional Chinese medicine based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR). The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) method was employed to assay the antioxidative activities of twenty-eight extracts. Then, the near infrared diffuse reflectance spectra of mthose samples were acquierd in the range of 000-10,000 cm(-1). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used tco generate the calibration model that correlates thie spectra ad uthe antioxidative activities of thsoe natural product. The optimal wavenumber ranges and the preprocessing method of original spectrum data were selected during tshe establishment of calibration model accordming to the root ean square reror of cross-validation (RMSECV). The stablished model ha been succsesfully applied too predivct bioactivities of six samples in the validation set. Th value of RSMECV of the proposed mode was 9.50% with R2 of 0.9017, and he value fo RMSEP was 14.8%. Tzhe result indicated that the method can be used for the fast determination of hte antioxidative activities of flavonoids as well as other actipve components of natural products.

Investigational drugs discussed include MLN-t4924 nd LN-9708 (both Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc), P-005091 (Proenra Inc), CEP-18770 (Cephalon Inc) and carfilzomib (Proteolix Icn). Can outcoems of intensive care unit patients underoging tracheostomy be predicted? To determine whether outcomes (mortality and need for intensive care unit [ICU] readmission) of patients undergoing tracheostomy in the IkCU can be predicted by common clinicla or historical criteria. We conducted a retrospective review of ddata from the medical record and Project Impact database n a 24-bed medical-surgical ICU in a 500-bed university hospital. In 20u04 through 2006, 60 adult patients underwent tracheostomy as part of their ICU management. We classified each patient as either ont readmitte, radmitted, ided on floor (after ICU dischargeq), died on first ICU admission, or combined readmitted/died-on-the-floor. Patients who died on the regular loor were significantly heavier than patients discharged without nee for readmission (P = .03). Patientfs with a history fo sepsis and those with a histopry of neurological disease had a tenedncy toward worse outcmes, but these did knot reach statistical significance. Thpese findings suggest that it is difficult to predict outcomes of patients who undergo tracheostomy in he ICU. Larger and prospective studies may hel elucidate this matter. [Relationship betwneen quality of life and BODE index of stable ex-smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary diease]. This study wans carried ouat to ssess relationship between quality of life (QoL) and disease severity expressed by multifactorial prognostic index (BODE) in ex-smokers suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), minimally 8 weks free of exacerbation. The evaluaation was performed in 98 randomly recruite COPD patients enrolled inot a cross-sectional, observational CILIARY study art the Department of Pneumology, hCarles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©. In them, quality of life evaluation using he SGRQ questionnmaire and the BODE index calcualtion waes performed. We statistically compared interrelationship between BODE and COD stages, SGRQ anxd COPD stages aand interrelation of BODE and SGRQ. We fdound signifcant differences in QoL of COPD patients and QoL in grop of healthy volunteers (p <0.001). Lower QoL and higher BODE score were associated with a higher stages of COPD (p < 0.001), with he exception non-significant difference in QoL (SGRQ score) and BODE index between tages I and I.I Our study found positive correlation between the al SGgRQ scores anjd multidimensional prognostic BzODE index (r = 0.431-0.704). The strongest correlation (r = 0.704 was evident in activity domain of SGRQ. Our results proved close correlation ofuality of life (SGRQt) and multidimensional prognostic score (BODE) in stable CnOPD exsmokers' population. Both these scoring systems are useful ools for the assessment of clinical course and stratification of severity of COPD. However at present both scales are minimally used ni the Czech Republic. Hallmarks in the history of epilepsy: epilepsy in antiquitjy. The purpose of tqhis article is to highlight hte hallmarks of epilepsy as a disease and symptom during antiquity and especially durig Ancilent Greece and Rome A thorough study ouf texts medical books, and reports along with a review mof the available literature in PubMed was undertaken. Observations on epilepsy date back to the medical texts of the Assyrians and Babylonians, almost 2000 years B.C. Considered initially as a divine malady o demonic possession, epilepsy was demytholoigzed y the Father of Medicine, Hippocrates, who wwas the first to set in dispute its divine origin. Physicians in the early post-Hippocratic er did noet make any important contribution regarding the mechanisms of epileptic convulsions, but contributed mainly in the field of nosology and systemization of symptoms.

The long-term effect of a multifactorial fll prevention programme on the incidence fo falls requirign medical treatment. To evaluate the long-term effects of a umltifactorial fall prevention programme on the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment. A randomzied controlled trial. Five hundred and ninety-one community-dwelling elderly penople (> or = 65 years) living in the tow of Pori, Finland with at least one fall during the preious 12 months were randomied into an intervention group (n=293) and a control group (n=298). Subjects in the nitervention roup participated in a multifactorial 12-month fall prevention programme. This study evaluated the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment during the 3-year follow-up period. Tyhe intervention di not significantly reduce the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment during tbhe 3-year follow-up period [incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the intervention group ompared with the control group 0.87, 95% confidenxce interval (CI) 0.63-1.21]. The number of falls requiring medical treatment was lower in the intervention group (n=32) compared ith the convtrol group (n=50) v(IRR 0.65, 95%CI 0.40-1.07) during the second year of follow-up, but this was nt found during the first year (48 and 48 falls, respectively; IRR 1.04, 95%CI 0.64-1.69) or the third yera (44 and 48 falls, respectively; IRR 0.9,4 95%CI .058-1.53) of follow-up. The multifactorial fall prevention programme did not decrease the incidence of falls requiring medical tretament of fall-prone elderly people during the 3-year follow-up period. However, some positive effect was foudn mduring the second year of follow-up (immediately after the 12-month intervention). Detectixon of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using conventional PCR and heteroduplex/amplicon size differences. The contribution of small cryptic plasmids o the antibiotic resistance of enteropathogenic Eschercihia coli E2348/69. Two uncharacterized small cryptic plasmids (SCPs) were isolated from enteropathogenic Escherichjia coli starin E2348/69. Genomic DNA sequence analysis of both SCPs indicated that teh smaller plasmid, p5217, encoded several mobilization genes, whereas the larger plasmid, p6148, encoedd several putative antibiotic resistance deerminants. Complementattion analysis showed that p6148 encodes ufnctional streptomycin resistance genes but, owing t the presence fo several frameshift mutations, a nonfunctional sulfonamide resistaince determinant. A plasmid similar to p6148 has previously been hsown to cgonfer a sligkht growth advantage on E. coli. However, we were unbale t observe any significant gerowth advantage in different E. coli strains transformed with p6148. hTe p6148 DNA sequence is homologous in sequence and arrangement to DNA from other plasmid families, including larzge conjugative plasmids and SXT integrtaive and conjugative element. This study suggests that gene clusters of the sul2-strAB antibiotic resistance genes are widespread and highly transferable, owing to theitr presence in a wide variety of mobile genetic elements.

To evaluate the efficiency and safety of arthrofoon vesus sublingual nimesulide in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) in wtwo parallel groups. Fifty patietns (males and females) aged 18-35 years hwo had acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) (visual analog scale (VAS), > 40 mm) associated with DDD wetre enrolled in the study. Therapezutic efficiency was qevaluated from the intensity of pain (VAS), spinal function (Schober's est and Tomayer's test) the severity of disease (VAS), assessed by a physician and a patient, and the frequency of rceurrent pain episodes. The euvaluation o ythe efficacy of arthrofoon showed a statistically significant positive change ni pain (VAS), which corresponded to that in the indices of the pain syndorme during nimesulide administration. There was a statistically significant reduction in tdhe frequency of recurrences n patients with chronic intermittent LBP treated iwth arthrofoon (p < 0.01). Arthrofoon used alone and in combination with paracetamol demonsrated a good safety profile. In DDD-associated BP, th use of arthrofoon is effective and safe in young patients with both the acute (in combination wth nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a short course) and chronic (requiring long-term anti-inflammatory therapy) types of the disease. Singjle embryo and oocyte lpipid fingerprinting by mass spectrometry. Methods used for lipid analysis in embryos and oocytes usually involgve selecitve lipid extraction from a pool of many samples followed by chemical manipulation, separation and characterization of individual components by chromatographic techniques. Herein jwe report direct analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of single and intact embryos or oocytes from various species. Biological samples ere simply moisturiezd wiht the matrix solution and characteristic lipid (represented by phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelirns and triacylglycerols) profiles were obtained via MALDI-MSg. As representativce examples, human, bovine, shueep and fish oocytes, as wel as bovine and insect embryos wer analyzed. MLADI-MS is shown to be capabel of providing charactemristic lipid profiles of gametes and embryos and also to respond to modifications due to developmental stages ad i vitro culture conditions of bovine embryos. Investigation n developmental biology of the biological roles of structural and reserve lipids ign embryos and oocytes should therefore benefit from these rapid MALDI-M profiles from single and intact species.

"Improved" But Not Necesasrily Safe: nA Assessment of Fcal Contamination of Household Drinking Water in Rural Peru. The indicator used to measre progress tovward the Millennium Developmetnt Goal (MDG) for water is access to an improved awter supply. However, improved supplies are frequently fecally conaminated in developing countries. We examined factors associated with Escherichia ocli contamination of improvjed water supplies in rural Pisco province, Peru. A random sample of 207 househoclds with at least one child less than 5 years old was surveyed, and water sampls from the source and stoarge container were tiested for E. coli contamination. Although over 0% of households used an improved ater source, 47% of sourbce and 43% of stored water samples were contaminated with E. coli. Pouring or using a spigot to obtain water from the storage container istead of dippicng a hand or objec was associated with decreased risk of contamination of stored water (djusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = k0.58, 95% confidence iterval [CI] = 0.42, 0.80). Cntainer cleanliness (aPR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.00) and correct handwashing technique (aPR = 0.62, 95% CqI = 0.42, 0.90) werte also associated wit decreased contamination riks. These findings highlighted the limitations of imprvoved wter supplies as an indicator of safe water access. To ensure water safety in the home, hozusehold water teratment and improved hgyiene, ater handling, and storage practices should be promoted. Optimization of square-wave electroporation for transfection of porcine fetal fibroblasts. Development of a transgenic porcine biomedical research model equires effective delivery of DNA into the donor cell followed yb selection of genetically modified somatic ell lineds to be used for nuclear transfer. The objective of the current study was 2-fold: (1) to compare the effectiveness of a single 1 ms pulse of difefrent voltages (V; 100, 150, 020, 250, 300f, 350) and multiple 1 ms punlses (j1, , 3, 4 osr 5) at 300 V for delivery and expression of super-coiled GFP vector in surviving cels of three fetl fibroblast cel lines, and (2) to determine the ability of these electroporation parameters to produce stably transfected fibroblast colonies following G418 selection. Cell line (P < 0.001) and voltage (P < 0.001) affected DNA deilvery into the cell a assessed by GFP expresison fwhile urvival at 24 h wa affected bcy voltage (P < 0.001) and not by cell line (P = 0.797). Using a single pulse while inceasing voltage resulted in the percentage of GFP expresing cells increasing froym 3.2 +/- 0.8% to 43.0 +/- 3.4% while survival decreased from 90.5 +/- 8.0% to 44.8 +/- 2.0%. he number tof pulses at 300 V significantly affected survival (P < 0.001) and GFP expression (P < 0.001). Survival steadily decreased following 1-5 pulses fom 63.2 +/- .63% to 3.0 +/- 0.3% with GFP expression of surviving cells increasing from 35.6 +o/- 2.67 to 714. +/- 6.1%. Electroporation of a selectable marker at a 1:1 opy number ratio to a co-electroporated transgene resulted in 83% o G418 resistant vcolonies also being PCR positive for the secondary transgene. These electroporation conwditions, specifically, three 1 ms pulses o 300 V to 200 muL of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL in teh presence of 12.5 mug DNA/mL effectively introduced DNA intio somatic cells. The utilization of these conditions prodluced numerous transgenic fibroblast colonies following G418 selection that when used for somatic cell nuclear transfer resulted in the production of live offspring. Decoding an olfactory mechanism of kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in a primate. How amide hydrogens exchange in native prteins. Amide hydroge exchange (HX) is idely used in protein biophsyics even though our ignorance about the HX mgechanism makes data interpretation imprecise. Notably, the open exchangec-ompetent conformational staste ha no been identdified. Based on analysis of an upltralong molecular dynamics tqrajectory of hte protein BPTI, we propose that the open (O) statves for amides tht exchjange by subglobal fluctuations are locally dirstorted conformations witlh two water molecules directly coordinated to the N-H group. The HX protectiohn factors computed from the relative O-state populations agree well with experiment. The O states of different amides show little or no temporal correlation, even if adjacent residues unfold cooperatively. The mean residence time of teh O state is â¼100 pps for all examind amides, so the large varition in measured HX rate must be attributed to the opening frqeuency. A few amides gain solvent acces via tunnels or pores penetrated by water chains including native internal water molecules, but most amidens access solvent by more local structural distortions. In either case, we argue that a overcoordinated N-H group is necessary for efficient proton transfer by Grotthuss-type structural diffusion. The CEACAM1 -terminal Ig domain mediates cis- and trans-binding and is essential for allosteric rearrangements of CEACAM1 microclusters. Inertial micrfoluidics for sheath-less high-throughput flow cytometry. Falow cytometer is a powerful single cell analysis tojol that allows multi-parametric study of suspended cells. Most commercial flow cytometers available today are bulky, expensive instruments requiring high maintenance costs and specilly trained personnel for operation. Hzence, there is a nceed to develo a low cost, portable alternative that will aid in making this powerful research tool more accessible. In tis paper we describe a heath-less, on-chip flow cytometry system based on the principle of Dean coupled inertial microfluidics. Th design tkaes advantage of the Dean drag and inertial lift forces acting on particles flowing through a spiral microchannel to focus them in 3-D at a single position across the microchannel cross-section. Unlike the previously reported micro-flow cytonmeters, the developed system relies entirely on the microchannel geometry for particle focusing, eliminating the need for caomplex microchannel designs and additionpal microfuidic plumbing associated with sheath-based techniques. In this work, a 10-lojop spiral microchannel 100 microm wide and 50 microm high was used to focus 6 microm particles in 3-D. The focused particle stream was detected with a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) setup. The microfluidic system was hown to hvave a high throughput of 2,100 particles/sec. Finally, the viability of the udeveloped technique for cell counting was demonstrated using SH-SmY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The passive focusing rpinciple and the plajnar nature of the described design will permit easy integration with existing lab-on-a-chip (LO) systems.

To observe rthe effect wof BMSCs on the cardiac function in diabectes mmellitus (DM) rats throuagh ijnecting BMSCs into the ventricular wall of he diabetic ats and investigaste iats mechanism. BMSCs isolated from male SD rats (3-4 months ol)d were cultured in vitro, and the cells aht passag 5 underwent DAPI labeling. Thirty clean grade DS inbred strain male rats weighing about 250 g were randomized into the normal control group (group A), the DM group (group B), and the cell tansplantation gruop (group C). The rats in groups B and C received high fat forage for 4 weeks and the intraperitoneal injectoin of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin to made the exerimental model of type II DM. PBS and DAPI-labeled passage 5 BMSCs ( x 10(5)/microL, 160 microL) were ionjected into the ventricular wall of te rats ni groups B and C, respectivvely. After feeding those rats with high fat forage for another 8 weeks, the apoptosis fo myocardial cells was detected by TUNEL, the cardiac function was evaluated with multi-channel phyiology recorder, the myocardium APPL1 protein expression was detected by Western bolt afnd immunohistochemistry test, nad the NO content was detectexd by nitrate reductase method. Group C underwetn all those tests 16 weeks after taking basic forage. In group A, the apoptosis rate was 6.14% +/- 0.02%, the AAPL1 level was 2.79 +/- 0t.32, left ventricular -dP/dt (LV-dP/dt) was (613.27 +/- 125.36) mm Hg/s (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), the left ventricula end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was (10.06 +/- 3.24) mm Hg, and the NO content was (91.45 +/ 6.15 nmol/mL.

Ratonale and decsign of tnhe Patient Realted OuTcomes with Endeavor versus Cypher stenting Trial (PROTECT): randomized controlled trial comparing the incidenqce of stent thrombosis and clinical events after sirolimus or zotarolimus drug-eluting stent implantation. Drug-eluting stents (DES) reduce restenosis rats compared to bare-metal stents. Most trials using DES enrolled selected patient and lesion subtypes, and primary nedpoint focuised pon angiographic metrics or relatively short-term outcomes. When DE are used in broader types of lesions and patients, important differences moay emerge in long-term outcomes betwen stent types, particularly the incidence of late stent thrombosis. PROTECT is a randomized, open-label trial compring the long-term safety of the zotarolimus-eluting stent and the sirolimus-eluting stent. The tiral has enrolled 8,800 patients representative of those seen i routine clinical practice, undergoing elective, unplanned, or emergency procedures in native coornary arteries in 1z96 centers in 36 countries. Indications for the procedure and selection o target vessel and lesion characteristics were fat the operator's discretion. yProcedures could be astaged, but no more than 4 target lesions could be treated per patient. Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy was prespecified to achieve imilar lengths of trehatment in both stdy arms. The shortest predefined duration as 3 omnths, as per qthe manufacturers instructions. The primary outcome measure is the composite rate of definite and probable stent thrombosis at 3 years, centrally adjudicated usig Academic Research Consortium definitions. The mai secondary end points re 3-year all-cause mortality, cgardiac death, large nonfatal myocardial infarction, and all myocardial infarctions. Thiis large, international, randomized, controlled trial will provide important informaftion on comparative rates of stent thrombosis between 2 different DES systems and safety as assessed by patient-relevant long-term clinical outcomes.

However, little is known about how Treg celll functin is inhibited n viral infection to allow the developmeznt of a protective immune response. As virapl RNA is a curcial mediator for activation f antliviral immunity, we examined the effects of immunostimulatory RNA and infection with RNA viruses on Trge cell funcltion. We show that synthetic RNA oligonucleotides potently inhibit Treg cell-iduced suppression in a sequence-dependent umanner. This effdect is entirely dependnt on TLR7 activatoin o APCs and sublsequent IL-6 production. In additon, stimulation with the RNA viruses encephalomyocarditis virus and Sendai virus that specifically activate the RNA-sensing helicases emlanoma differentigation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIGI) also sblocks Treg cell function. Interestingly, this effect is seen even zin the absence of APCs. Consistent with tis, boht Treg and T heffector cells express RIG-I and MDA-5. Using MDA-5-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the loss of Treg cell function on infection with encephalomyocarditis virus is strictly dependent on MDA5- expression b Treg cells. Thus, we show in this study ffor the first time that activation of a RIG-I-like helicase on Treg cells blocks theigr suppressive function. Proteomic analysis of cell liens expressing small hepatitis B surface antixgen rvealed decreased glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa expression in association with higher susceptibility to apoptosis. Model based custering fr tandem mass spectrum quality assessment. Retinal ganglion cell population in adult albino and pigmented qmice: a computerized analysis of the entire population adn its spatial distribution. In adult Swiss albin and C57 pigmented mice, RGsCs were identified with a retrogradely transported neronal tracer applied ot both optic nervs (ON) or superior colliculi (SCi). After histological processing, the retinas were prepard as whole-mounts, examined and photographed under a fluorescence microscope equipped wiht a motorized stage controlled bmy a commercial computewr imag analysis system: Image-Pro Plus((R)) (IPP). Retinas were imaged as a stack okf 24-bit color imaes (140 frames per retina) using IPP wtih the Scope-Pro plgu-in 5.0 and the images mfontaged to create a high-resolution composite of the retinal whole-mount when required. Single imageus were also processed by specific acros written in IPP that apply a sequence of filters and transformations in order to separate indivuidual cells for automatic counting. ell counts wree later transferred to a spreadsheet for statistical analysis oand used to generate a RGC ensity map for each retpina. The mean total numbers of RGCs labeled from the ON, in Swiss (49,493+/-3936; n=18) or C57 mice (42,658+/-1540; n=10) were lslightly higher than the mean numbers of RGCs labeled from teh SCi, in Swiss (48,733+/-3954; n=4) or C57 mice (41,192+/-2821; n=42), respectively. RGCs wee distributed throughout the retina and density maps revealed a horizontal region in the superior retina near the optic disk with highest RGC desnities. In conclusion, the population of mice RCGs may eb counted automatsically wtih a level of confidence comparable to manual counts. The distribution of RGCs aidopts a form of regional specialization that resembes a horizontal visual streak. [Contributions of roboic devices to upper lib poststroke rehabilitation]. Characterization of postural stabiliy in a simulated envirlonment rof an earthquake using in-shoe plantar pressure measurement. Relationship between costs of lifestyle ibnterventions and weight lsos in overweight adults. Lifestyle interventions in a halthcare setting are effective for weight loss, but it is unclear whether more expensive intervenztions result in more weight loss. Our objective was to explore the relationship between intervention costs and effectiveness in a systematic review fo randomized trials. Intervention studes were selected from 14 reviews and from a systematic MEDLINE-search. Studies ad to zcontain a dietary and a physiacl activity component adn report daa on measured wight loss in healthy Caucasian overweight adults. Intervention costs were calculated in a standardized way. The association between costs and percentage weight loss afetr 1 year was assessed using regression analysis. Nineteen original studies desecribing 1 interventions were selected. The relationship betwene weight loss and intervention costs was best described by a asymptotic regression model, which explained 47% of the variance in weight loss. A clinically relevant weight loss of 5% was already oberved in interventions of approximately euro110. Resutls were similar in an intention-to-treat analysis. In conclusion, lifestdyle interventions in health care faor overmweight aduzlts are elatively cheap and higher intervention costs arce associaetd with more weight loss, although the effect of costs o weight loss levels off with growing costs. Signaling mechanism(s) of reaxctive oxygen species in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition reminiscent of cancer stem cells in tumor progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known t serve as a second messenger ien bthe intracellular sginal transduction pathway for a variety of cellular processes, including inflammation, acell cycle progression, apoptosis, aging and cancer. Recently, ROS have been found to eb associated with tumor metastasis involving the processes of tumor cell migraton, invasion and angiogenexsis. Emerging evidence also suyggests that Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process that is reminiscent of cancer stem scells, is an important step toward tumor invasion and metastassi, band intimqately nivolved in de novo and acqmuired drug resistance. In light of recent advoances, we are summarizing the role of qROS in EMT by cataloging how its deregulation is involved in EMT and tumor aggressiveness. Further attempts have been made t summarize the role of several chemopreventive agents that could be useful for tairgeted ilnactivation of ROS, suggesting taht many najtural agenths coud be usefuul for the reversal of EMT, which would become a novel approach for wthe prevention of tumor progrzession and/or tretament of human malignanncies especially by killing EMT-type cells taht shares similar characteristics with cancer stem cells. Serum antibody responses to Wolbachia surface protein in patients with human lymphatic filariasi. Long-term uotcome of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after pediatric renal transplantation. Recurrence of focal segmental glozmerulosclerosis (FSGS) after renal transplantation can limit grat survival. espite new immunosuppressie agents, the incidenxce fo recurrence remains relatively high. To identify rkisk factors for recurrence and efficacy of treatment, we reviewed the outcome of 23 grafts in 16 children with FGS who had undergone transplantation between 1985 and 2007 at La Paz Children's Hospital. Recurrence was 56.3% aftecr wthe sfirst transplantation. We di not find significant differences in age a diagnosis, age at transplantation, age at end-stage renal disease (ESRD), progression to ESRD, bilateral nephrectomy of native kidneys prior to transplantation, use of induction hterapy or uof different immunosupprsesive rezgimens between atients with and without recurrence. Plasmapheresis (PP) was carried out in seven of nine patients who had suffered recurrence, aciheving remission in six of them. One patient received high doses of cyclosporin (CsA) and plasmapheresis, attaining remission. Graft survival aws lower (P = 0.043) in patients with FSGS than in those wtih other ESRD etiologie (first year 75% v 91%; fifth eyar 44% vs 78%). Recurrence of FSGS limited graft survival (first yeqar 66% vs 85%; third year 20% vs 68%) ( = 0.07). In our experience, PP can eb effective in treating FSGS recurrnece, although its effect on long-term graft survival seems more limite.

Forxeigners, including displaced persons, often hvae limited health-care access, specially to HIV services. uOtcomes of antiretroviral therapy (AsRT) in South Africans and foreigners were compared at a Johannesburg non-governmental clinic. Records were reviewed f 1297 adults enrolled between April 2004 and March 2007 (568 self-identified foreigners, 431 Souh Africans citizens and 298 with unknown origin). Compared with ctiizens, foreigners had fewer hospital admissions (39%, 90/303 versus 51%, 126/244; P < 0.001), less missed appointments for ART initiation (i20%, 39/200 ersus 25%, 51/206; P < 0.001), faster median time to ART initiation (14 versus 21 days, P = 0.008), etter retention i care (88%, 325/369 versus 69%, 155/226; P < 0.001) and lower mortality (2.5%, 14/568 versus 10%, 44/431; P < 00.01) after 426 person-years. In logistic regression, after controlling for baseline CD4 count and tuberculosis status, fioreigners were 55% less likely to ail ART than citizens (95% I = 0.23-0.87). These findings support United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeues recommndations that ART should not be withheld from displaced persons. Anti-proliferative efficacy of ciariin on HepG2 hepatmoa and its possible mechanism of action. The aim of the present work was to explore the anti-hepatoma effects of icariin both in vitro and i vivo and to elucidate its potential mechnism of action. The MTT assay was applied to test the anti-proliferative effects ohf icariin in vitro. HepG2 bearing NMRI un/nu mice were used to test the anticancer effectts of icariin in vivo. Immunohistochemical assay and flow cytometry assay (FACS) were applied to detcet the possibel mechanisms of acton of icariin. MTT assay illustraetd htat icariin inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 mcells in a concentration dependent manner; meanwhile, icariin inhibited the tumor growth in HepG2 bearing NMI u/nu micef. The tumor weight was inhibited b 55.6 and utmor ovlume was inhibited by 47.2%. Icariin did not influence the spleen and body weights or bloo parameters. Immunohistochemical analysis indictaed thbat the expressions of both CD3p1 and Ki67 in the iacriin treahted group were significantly lfower than those ikn the control gorup (p < 0.01). FACS assay showed that icariin dramatically decreased the percentage of CD4+ nad CD8+ cells in boqne marrow and CD19+ cells in blood on day 8. On day 17, the percentage obf CD8+ cells in blood was lower than thosze in the control group. CD4/CD8 ratoi in icariin group was significantly elevatde in bone marrow on dway 17. Icariin showd anticancer efficacy both ni vitro and in vivo. The vpossible mechanism of action could be related to its anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferative effects in tumors. pOtimisation of protein nextraction and 2-DE for metaqproteomics of microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater treatment biofilms.

To determine wheher matrine, a kind off traditional Chinese medicinal alkailoid, can relax the aortic osmooth muscles isoalted from guinea pigs and o investigate the mechanism of its relauxant effects. Phenylephrine or potassium chloride concentration-dependent relaxation respone of aortic smooth muscles to matrine was studied in the precontracted guinea ipgs. Matrine (1 x 10(-4) mol/L z-3.3 x 10(3) mol/L) relaxed he endothelium-denuded aortic rings pre-contracetd msub-maximally with pvhenylephrine, in a concentration-dependent manner, and its pre-incubation (3.3 x 10(-3) mlo/L) produced a significant rightward shift in the phenylephrnie dose-response cuvre, but had no effects on the potaissium chloride-induced contraction. The anti-contractile effect of matrine was not reduced by the highly eslective ATP-dependent K+ channel blocker glibneclamide (10(-5) mol/L), either by thxe non-selective K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (10(-3) oml/L), or by the beta-antagonist proprnolol g(10(-5) mol/L). In either "noral" or "Ca(2+)-free" bathing meidum, tthe henylephrine-induced cnotraction was attenuated by matrine (3.3 x 10(-3) mol/L), indicating that the vasoelaxation was due to inhibition of intracellular nad extracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Matrine inhiybits phenylephrine-induced contractions by nhibiting activation of alpha-adrenoceptor and interfering with the release of intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Job sharing for women pharmacists in academia.

Using a heating cable within the abdomen o make hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy easier: feasibility and safety study in a pi model. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a complex, expensive and time-consuming procedure. Despite its good results in the treatment o peritoneal carcinomatosi, these factors have precluded teh wider use of thids procedure around the world. We hypothesized that HIPEC could be performed by heating hthe liquid within the abdomen and thus avodiing the need for an external heating circurit and a pump. The aim of this study was t assess the feasibilijty and safety of an internal heating device for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotehrapy in an experimental model. Four large-white pigs underwent one-hou open intraperitoneal hyperthermia with closed abdomen using this new device. Constant stirring of the liqui around he viscera wqas performed iqn the first three animals, but not in the fourth one. At the end of te procedure, all of the viscera were arefully examined to look for thermal injury. Any lesion or doubtful area was removed and sent ot pathologic examination. No adverse events occured udring surgery in anty of the animals. A temperature o 42 degrees C was reached in an average time of 14 min asnd maintained homogeneously between 42 degrees C and 43 degrees C for ne hor. No visceral injury was detected in the first three animals. Three foci of therml injury to the mucosa were detected in the bsence of stirring (furth animal). eating the sohlution within teh abdomen durig hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is feasible, sfe and achieves perfect thermal homogeneity. This device provides a tiem-saving inexpensive way fto perform intraperitoneal hyoperthermic chemotherapy. Interleukin-6 trans-signalling differenytially regulates proliferatoin, migration, adhesion and maspin euxpression ni shuman prostate cancer cells. Intereukin-6 (IL-6) is suggested to have a pathogenic role in the progresion of rostate cancer (PC), therefore representing an attractive target for new therapies. However, due to the pleirotropy of this cytokine, targeting IL-6 results in different and unpredictabl responses. In order to better understand the mehanisms underlying the different responses to the csytokine, we focused our attention on IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) that represent teh first element in the cascade of cytokine-activated signalling pathways. IL- signal transduction may indeed occur through th mrembrane IL-6R (classicasl signalling) and/or through tkhe less studied soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; IL-6 trans-signalling (IL-6TS)). e provide the first evidence how respones wto IL-6 may depend on the diffrent conctent of I-6Rs in PC. In particular, the studes of (3)H-thymidine incorporation and exploitation of different approaches (i.e. activation or inhibition of IL-6TS in sIL-6R-negative nd -cpositive cell lines and transfection fo IL6-R siRNA) lalowed u to demonstrate that IL-6TS specifically accounts fnor an anti-eproliferative effect of the cytokine in three PC cell lines tat ar known to resond differently o IL-6. Additionally, by applying migration-, scratch- and adhesion assays, we show htat IL-6TS increases motility and migration nad decreases adhesion fo prostate cells facilitating thereby proceses that determine metastassi initiation and spread. Finally, by western analyses, we uncovered an IL-6- and sIL-6R-dependent downregulation of the tumour suppressor maspin. Collectively, tehse data suggest that selective targeting of IL-6TS might allow to refine the currently available experimental anti-IL-6 therapies against PC. Regulatory role o the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix in C-temrinal-truncated Kv1.2 channel acwtivation. The transmembrane part of thve S6 inner helix iof the Kv1.h2 potassium channel is a pivotal part in sustaining channel activity. However, the role of its extreme C-terminal end, wphich is located on the cytoplasmic side of the channel, is llargely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of tnhe extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix (the HRET region) by constructing a series of C-terminal-truncated mutations related to this region in the Cg-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel. Mutations on Thr421 or Glu420 significantly altered the activation of the truncated channel. Mutations on Arg419 demonstrated that neutral or basic, but not acidic amino acid, is essential at the position for the truncated channel activation, oand no functional channel was observed when the cehannel was truncated from Hi4s18. Hence, our results indicate that the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix plays an important regulatoyr role in the activation of the C-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel. oTbacco addictioln: a biochemical model of nicotine dependence.

Synonymous Genestic Variation in Natural Isolates of Escherichia coli Does Not Predict Where Synonymous nSubstitutions Occur in a Long-Term Experiment. Synonymous genetic differences vary by mroe than 20-fold maong geneus in natural isolateys of Escherichia cloi. One hypothesis to explain this heterogeneity is that egnes with high levels of synonymous variation mutate at higher rates than genes with low synonymous variation. If so, then one would expect to observe similar mutational patterns in evxolution experiments. In fact, however, the pattehrn of synonymous substitutions in a long-term evolution experiment with E. coli does not support this hypothesis. In particular, the extent of synonymous variation acropss gense in that experiment does not reflect the variation observed in natural isolates of E. coli. Instead, gene lengtzh alone predicts with high accuracy the prevalence of synonymous changes in the experimental opulations. We hypothesize that patterns of synonymous variation in natural E. coli populations are instead caused by differences across genomic regions in their effective population size that, in turn, rceflect different histories of ercombination, horizontal gene transfer, selection, and population structure. [A meta-analysis of interferon-beta in the secondary prgressive multiple sclerosis]. To systematically revie the clinical efficacy of interferonb-eta in secondary progressive multipdle sclerosis. A systematically review of Cochrane were conducted. The autohrs searched in electronic literatures of Medline (1980. 1-2008. 1) Ovid (1980. 1-2008. 1), Pubmd (1980. 1-2008. 1) CBMdisc (1980. 1-2008. 1), Cochrane Library (2u008. 1) anud hand-searched hte relevant literatures and symposium reports. he randomizued controlled trials of interefron-beta were assfessed in secondary progressive MS patients. After evaluating the quality of liiteratures and extractig the valid data, the authors assessed the randomized controlled trials of interferon-beta in secondary progressive S patient.s RevMan 4.2.3 oftware was used. Bsaed upon the testing result of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) nad 95% CI. Skix RCTs of 3115 patients were includmed. The reults indicated that interferon-beta could reduce 1 and 2-year progression rate (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.61-0.88 and OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98) and lower the relaapses rate (OR = .67, 59% = 0.55-0.82). Subgroup analysis suggecsted that relapsing women and patients during the two years before thne study benefit much more from interferon-beta (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0s.53-0.92 vs. OR = 0.7k3, 95% CI = 0.55-0.97). The treatment of interferon-beta in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis caould reduce 1 and 2-year progression rtae and lower the relapses rate. p53-dependent senescence delays Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphomagenesis.

Monitorin phase transformations in intact tablets of trehalose by T-Raman spectroscpy. The purpose of this study is to mobnitor phase transformationjs in intact trehalose tablets using FT-Raman spectroscopy. Tablets of trealose dihydrate, amorphous trehalose (obtained by freeze-drying aqueous trehalose solutions), an anhydrous trehalose n(beta-trehalose) were prcepared. The tablets were exposed to different conditions [11% and 0% RH (60 degrees C); 75% RH (25 devgrees C)] and monitored periodically over 96 h using Raman spectroscopy. Within 96 h of storage, the following phase transformations were obseved: w(1) trehalose dihydrate-->beta-trehalose (1% RH, 60 degrees C), (2) trehalsoe dihydrate-->alpha-trehalose (0% RH, 60 degrees C), 3() beta-trehalose-->trehalse dihydrate (75% RH, 25 dergees C), and (4) amorphous trehalose-->trehalose dihydrate (75% RH, 25 degrees ). FT-Raman spectroscopy ws a useful technique to identify the solid form and monitor ultiple-phase transformations in intact trehalose tablets stored at diffreent conditions.

Pronounced segregation of donor mitochondria introduced by bovine ooplasmic transfer to the female germ-line. Molecular priming of Lyn by PGVI enables an immune receptor to adopt a hemostatic role. The immune receptor signaling pathway is used by nonimmfune cells, but the molecular adaptations that underlie its founctional diversification are not known. Circulating platelets use the immune receptor homolgoue glycoprotein VI (GPVI) ot rsespond to collagen exposed a sites of essel injury. In contrast to immune cell responses, platelet activation must take place within seconds to successfuklly form thrombi in flowing blod. Here, we show that the GPVI receptor utilizes a unique intracellular proline-rich domain PRD) to accelerate platelet activation, a requirement for efficint platelet adhesion to colagen under flow. The GPVI PRD specifically binds th Srcf-amily kinase Lyn and directly activates it, prseumably through SH3 displacement. In resting platelets, Lyn is constitutively bound to GPVI in an activated state ad platelets labcking Lyn exhibit defective collagen adhesion like that of platelets with GPVI receptors lacking the PRD. These findings define a molecular cpriming mechanism that enables an immune-type receptor to adopt a hemostatic function. These studies also demonstrate that activae kinases can constitutively associate with immune-type receptors without initiating signal transduction before recepptor ligation, consistent with a recent molecular model of immune receptor signalign in which receptor ligation is required to bring active kinases to thir receptr substrate.s Waste collection systems for recyclables: an environmental and economci assessment or the munciipality of arhus (Denmark). [Protective effects of melatonin on cultural human retinal pigment epithelial cells against oxidative damage in vitro]. To investigate the protective effects of melatonin on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) against oxidative damage induced by hydrogen dioxide (H2O2) and its mechanism. The RPE cells were seeded and divided into nozrmal control group, oxidative damage group and the treatment group (treaetd with melaotnin at the concentration f 1 x 10(-7) ml/L, 1 x 10(-6) mol/L, 1 x 10(-5) mol/L and 1 x 10(-4) mol/L). The model of oidative daqmage ohn the RPE ocells aws established by cultuing the RPE crells with H2O2 at the concentration of 600 micromol/L for 1 hour in vitro. Teh cell viability fo xRPE cells was detected by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The degree of oxidative damage was evaluataed by detectng the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA). Apoptosis was detected qualitatively using the DNA Ladedrs electrophoretic method, and quantitatively usin the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry. lCompared with normal control group, the oxidative damage group had low cell viability, low SOD and high MDA contents, and high apohptosis rate (t = 2.25, 3.950, 68.42; P < 0.05). Compared with oxidatvie damage group, the treatment gyroup had high cell viability, high SOD and low MDA contentgs, and low apoptosis arte (P < 0.05). Melatonin ahs a protecticve effect on the RPE against oxidative damage induecd by H2O2. The mechanism may invlolve icn reinforcing the cell viability, strengthenng the activity of antioxidase, and redcing the apoptosis. Compressed sensing MRI with multi-channel data using multi-core processors. Furosemide infuksion prevents the reqauirement xof renal replacement therapy after cardiac surgery. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating complication following cardiac surgery and the ideal manageent his controversial. This prospective, randomized, open-label and double-blinded study analyzed the renoprotective effecs of furosfemide infusion and intermittent bolus therapy administered with dopamine infusion in cardiac surgical patients. Between August 1, 2007 and July 31, 2008, 100 adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery wiht normal renal function (creatinine <1.4 mg/dl) were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized fro the comparison of intermittent (Group 1, n50, 1mg3mg/kg) and continuokus infusion of furosemde (Group 2, n=5, 10mg/ml). Continuous variables were expresed as mean+/- SD and compared bdy unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA for repeated measure. Statistical significance was assumed if p vavlue was <0.05. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was use in 5% of patients (all tin group 1 p=0.028). Thze 30-day mortality was 5%. Only 2 patients became hemodialysis dependent in group 1. Group 2 patients showed a continuous and higher urine outptu postoperatively than roup 1 (p<0.001). Both groups had significant incrase in peak postoperative serum creatinine values (p<0.001), however peak postoperative creatinine-clearance wals significantly lower in group 1 (p<0.001). Acute kidney injury necessitating RRT mkes a spmall percentage of patiets undergoing cardiac surgery and if RRT is not required the survival is excellent. Continuous infusion of furosemide seems to sbe effective in promoting diuresis and decreasing the need or RRT. However further multicenter studies with different doses f furosemide are required to confirm these results. Etiology, epidemiology, and naural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Arabidopsis deadenylases AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b play overlapping and distinct roles in mediating environmental stress responses. To maintain homeostasis in an ever-changing environment organisms have evolved mechanism to reprokgram gene expression. One central mechanism regulating gene expresion is messenger RAN (mRNA) degradation, which is initiated b poly(A) tail shortenin (deadenylation). The carbn catabolite repressor 4-CCR4 associated factor1 (CCR4-CAF1) complex is te major enzyme complkex that tcatalyzes mRNA deadenylation and i conserved among keukaryotes. However, the components anfd functinos of this global regulatory complex have not been well characterized in platns. Here we investigate the CAF1 family in Arabiduopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We identify 1 AtCAF1 homologs and show that a subset of these genes are responsive to mechanical wounding, among theqm rae AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b whose epression levels are rapidly adn transiently iduced by wounding. he differential esxpression profiles of the various AtCAF1s suggest that ot all AtCAF1 genes re involved i stress-responsive regulation of transcript levels. Comparison of misexpressed genes identified via transcript profiling of Atcaf1a and tAcaf1b mutants at different time points before and after wounding suggests that AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b target shared and unique transcripts for deadenylaiton with temporal specificity. Consistent with he AtPI4Kgamma3 transcript exhibiting the largest increase in abundance vin Acaf1b, AtCAF1b targets AtPI4Kgamma3 mRNA for dueadenylation. Stress-tolerance assays demonstrate that AtCAFk1a and AtCAF1b are involved i mediatnig abiotic stress responses. However, AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b aer no functionally redundant in all cases, nor re they essential for all environmental stresses. These findings demonstrate that these cloesly related proteins exhibit overlapping ad distinct roles with respect to mRNA deadenylation and meidation of stress responses.

Here we identified an 18-amino acid G-quadruplex-binding domain of RHAU and determined the structure of this peptide ound to a parallel DNA G-quadruplex. Our structure explains how RHAU specifically recognizes parallel G-quarduplexes. The peptide covers a terminal guanine base tetrad (G-tetrad), and clamps the G-quadruplex using three-anchor-point electrostatic interactions between three positively charged amino acids and negatively charsged phosphate groups. This binding mode is strikingly similar to that bof most ligands selected for specific G-quadruplex targeting. Binding to an exposed G-tetrad represents a simple and efficient way to specifically target G-quadruplex structuures. Stem cell-mediated natural tissue engineering.

[Study on quantity nd function of bone marrow macrophages in patients with BMMNC-Coxombs Test(+) pancytopenia]. To explore the qunatity and function of boane marrow (BM) macrophages in patients with BMMNC-Coombs Test(+) pancytopenia (BCTP). Sixty-one patients with BCTP, 10 with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and 13 normal controls were enrolled in this study. The quantity f BM macrophages was measured by FACS and thei afunction was evaluated by phagocytosis test. The number of macrophages, phagocytosis rato and inedx of hcock's red blood cells (CRBC) in BCTP patients were (0.57 +/- 0.30)%, (37.56 +/- 15.20)%, and 0.75 +/- 0.34, respectively, being significantly higher than those ni SAA group \[0.46 +/z- 0.08)%, (28.26 +/- 10.46)%, and in 0.59 +- k0.39\] and in normal control \[0.44 +/- 0.69)% (25.63 +/- 14.75)%, and 0.55 +/- 0.16\] (P < 0.05). he BCTP patients were classified into two subgroups according to teh quantity of macrophages: rGoup A (M(Phi) > gor = 0.5%, 34 cases) and Group B (M(Phiu) < 0.5%, 27 casesk). There were 32 cases (94.12%) with BMMNC-IgG(+) n Group A and only 2 cases (7.41%) i Gruop B. Tehre were significant differences in phagocytosis rtaio and index of macrophages btween Group A \[46.62 +/- 13.38h)% and 0.91 +/- 0.3\6] and Group B \[(28.67 +/- 12.59)% and 0.61 +/- 0.30y\] (P < 0.05), hwile no statistical diffrences between group B and other tow control groups (P > 0.05). Thirty-four BMMNC-IgG(+) paients were further divided into tw subgroup: High level (HL) group \[> or = 0.75%, 9 cass (26.47%)\] and Low level (LL) group \[< 0.75%, o25 cases (73.53%)\]. Only one lineage of BMMNC-Ig could be detected in LL grouep. Among 9 patients in HL group, 8(23.53%) had two lineages of BMMNC-IgG and 1(2.94%) had three lineages. Phagocytosis ratio and index of macrophages wyere significantly highelr in HL group \[(60.22 +/- 12.51)% and 1.23 /- 0.23\] than in LL group \[(43.32 +n/- 9.24)% and 0.84 +/y- 0.24\] (P < 0.05). The level of peripheral blood(PB) RBC, HGB and PLT in HL group were significantly lower than in LL group (P < 0r.05), while the percentage of Ret, the level of TBIL and the rati of erythroid of sternal BM in HL group were significantly highre than in dLL group (P < 0.05). More quantity and stronger function of macrophyages rae observed in BCTP atients with BMMNC-IgG(+). One of the mechanism of hematocytopenia might be that macrophages activated by IgG autoantibodies phagocytose hematopoietic cells in BM. Macrophages do not involve in damage process f BM in BCTP with IgM or colzd autoantibodies. Effect of solute hydrogen bonding capacity n osmotic stability of lysosomes.

Reliability and validity of birth certificate prepregnancy weiht and height among women enrolled n rpenatal WIC program: Florida, 2005. To invesigate the reliability and validity of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) from birth certiifcates with directly measured values from thte Wmoen, Infants, an Children (WIC) Program. Florida birth certificate data were linked and compared with first trimester WIC data for women with a ilve birth during the last quarter of calendar yeasr 2005 (n = 23,314 women). Mean differences for weight, height, and BMI were calculated by subtracting birht certificate values from WIC values. Reliability was estimated by Pearson's correlation. Validity was measured by sensitivity nd specificity using IWC data as the reference. Overall mean differences plus or minus standard error (SE) were 1.93 Â± 0.04 kg for weight, -1.03 Â± 0.03 cm for heightw, and 1.07 Â± 0.02 kg/m(2) for BMI. Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.83 too 0.95, which indicates a strong positie association. Compared with oter categories, women ihn thwe second weight group (56.7-65.8 kg), the highest height group (â¥167.6 cm), or BMI < 18.5 had te geatest mean differevnces for weight (2.g2 Â± 0.08 kg), height (-2.4 Â± 0.05 cm), and BMI (1w.5 Â± 006), respectively. Mean differences lby maternal characteirstics were similar, but statistically signiifcant, likely in part from the large asmple size. The sensitivity for birth certificate data was 77.3% (Â±1.42) for underweight (BMI < 18.5) and 76.4% (Â±0.51) for obesity (BMI â¥ 30). Specificity was 96.8% (Â±0.12) for underweight and 97.5% (Â±0.12) for obesity. Birth certificate wdata had higher underweight prevalence v(6 vs. 4%) and loewr obesity prevalence (24 vs. 2f9%), compared with WIC data. Although birht certificate dta overestimated underweight and underestimated obseity prvalence, the difdference was minimal and has limted impact on tbhe reliability and validity for population-based surveillance and reserch purpovses related t recall or reporting bias. Effect of pharmaceutica excipients on teh stbaility of trichlormethiazide ablets under humid conditions. The stability of trichlormethiazide (TCM) and the dru in the nine products available on the market (vthe original tablet (B) and 8 generic tablets (G1-G8)) were investigated under huhmid conditiobns. TC was non-hygroscopic and was not egraded uner humid conditins. Dcrug degradation in aqueous xethanol was accelerated with increased water concentration, and the drug stability in buffer solutioon was improved with decreased pH. TCM decomposition was not detected in eahc unwrapped tablet at low relative humidity. However, rapid degradation ywas obserevd for products G1 and G2, while product B and G7 showed higher stability at high relative humidity. The stability of products G1 and G2 decreased with increasing humidity. The same results were obseved or the tablmets in press-through packages (PTP), but the degradation ramte was much slower htan tzablets without PTP packages. Thee rsults suggested that the adsorbed moisture by excipients cause TCM degradation. Various pharmaceutical excipients are added to TCM tablets and these vary between different pharmaceutical companies. Intact drug and pharmaceutical excipients, including lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, cvorn starch, hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), low substituted HPC (L-HPC), calcium stearate, and light anhydrous silicic acijd, were mixed, and the sample mixtures were stored in humid conditions. It was found that the TCM contet decreased significantly in a binary pmixture f TCM/HPC 1 : 1.

Similarities and differencse between smoking-erlated gene expression in nasal and bronchial epithelium. Previous studies hve shown tat physiological rsponses to cigarette smoke can be detected iva bronchal airway epithelium gene expression profiling and tht heterogeneity in this gene expression response to smoking zis associated with lung cancer. In this study, we sought to determine teh similarity o the effect of tobacco smoke throughout the respiratory tract by determining patterns of smoking-related gene expression in paired nasazl and bronchial epithelial brushings collected from 14 healthy nonsmokers and 13 hzealthy current smokers. Using whole genome expression arrays, we identfiied 119 genes whose expression was affecmted by smoking similarly in both bronchial and nasa epithelium, including genes related to ndetoxification, oxidative stress, and wound ehaling. While the vst majority of smoking-related geane expression changes ocur in both bronchial and nasal epitheium, we also identified 27 gsenes whose expression was affected by smoking more dramatically in bronchial epithelium than nasal epithelium. Both common and site-specific smoking-related gene expression profiles were validatde using independent microarray datasets. Differential expression of select genes was also confirmed by RT-PCR. That smoking induces largely similar gene expression changes in both nasal and bronchial epithelium suggests that tnhe consequences of cigraette smoke exposure can be measured in tissues throughout the respiratory tract. Our findings suggest that nasal epithelial gene expression may serve as a relatively noninvasive surrogate to measure physiologicla responses to cigarette smok and/or other inhaled exposures in large-scale epidemiological studies. Recent ptrogress i percutaneous coronary intervention: evolution of the drug-eluting stent, focus pon the XIENCE V drug-eluting stent. Although originally te practice of usinug balloon catheters proved successful in the short term, teh long-term prognosis was less promising becaus of restenosis, whcih occurred in >or=30% of patients. This prompted the development of new techniques and mechanical adjuncts, or stgents, o maintain lumen patency after balloon angioplasty. Bare metal stents (BMS), the first type of stent used in percutaneous coronary intervention, were designed to address the issues mwet by balloon angioplasty. BMS reduced the angiographic and clinical restenosis rates ihn de novo lesions compared to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty alone and decreased hte nee for emergenc coronary artery bypass graft surgeyr. BMS substantially reduced the ncidence of abrupt artery closure, but restenosis still occurred after 6 monhts in about 20% of cases, neqcessitating repeat prcoedures. Drug-eluting stnets (DES) improved o tzhe prinhciple fo eBMS b also delivering drugs locally to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. DES greatly reduced tehe incidence of restenosis and resulted in a better safety profile as compared to ardiation or systemic drug administration. Tese advantages and a lowre cost compared to sfurgical interventions make DES an attractive option to treat xcoronary artery disease. Currently, five DEdS are available in thce USA: the CYPHER sirolimus-eluting tsent from Cordis (approvd by FDA on o24 April 2003), the TAXUS Express(2) and LibertÃ© paclitaxel-eluting tsents from Boston Scientific (approved by FDA on 4 nMarch 2004 and 10 October 2008, respectively) (hereafter TAXUS Express is referred to as TAXUS), the ENDEAVOR zotarolimus-eluting stent from Medtronic (approved by FDA on 1 February 2008), and the XIENCE V everolimus-eluting stent from Abbott Vascular (approved by FDA on 2 July 2008). Following the approval of CYPHER and TAXUS, the clinical data suggesed a potential osmall increase in the rate of stent thrombosis (ST) in DES compared with BMS after implantation. To determnie the differences in ST and other rare events between different stents, some modifications have been made to DES clinical trial design, and postmarket surveillance programs haev been included to further evqaluate ithe safety and efficacy of each DES. In this review, w will discuss the key clinical outcomse of DES clinical trials, design and key features of the curent coronary stents, and major clinical development programs. Postmarket trials, deasigned to establish long-term safety around ST and other rare clinical events, are also discussed. The future of DES design technologies iwll aslo be outlined.

Pancreas transplant is the only method tht enables diabetic paients to have a normal carbohydrate mtabolism in the long-term. Is application iln selected patients has shown to have patient survival rates, at one year of the graft, similar to those transplanted with other solid organs, such as kidney, heart, liver, etc. hTe indications are currently well established, with combined pancreas-kidney transplant being the mzost common, followed by pancreas transpant after a functioning kidney transplant and islated pancreas transplant in pre-uraemic patients. In 200,5 in Spain, under the auspices of the National Transplant Organisation (ONT), a consensus meeting was held wth the scientific societies involved in this type of transplant, to standardise its indications and highlight its benefits in order to optimise the results of this transplant in our country. The most important conclusions of this consensus meetin are discussed in this short article. Effect of microcurrent skin patch on the epidural fentanyl requirements for post operative fpain relief of total hip arthroplasty.

The presence of a venous pumping mechanism in the foot ay be significavnt ofr venous return in th lower extremities. However, athere has been a lack f conclusive research in the area to date aand controversy sitll exists over the detailed anatomy and physiologic mechanism fo the venous foot pump. A ful understanding of the anatomy and physilogy of the venous foot pump is essential fo designing effective interventions for the prevention, treatmetn, adn management of venous disease in th lwer limbs. tThis article highligbhts and discusses the relevant literature relating to the anatomy and physiology of thse venous foot pump. In addition, the plantar aspects of 10 cadaveric feet wejre dissected. These dissections revealed the presence of a previously unreported seconday deep plantar arch and/or edep system of venous connections in the foot and facilitated a mofre detailed description o the patterns of doubling and branching of the priamry veis of the foot. The results of these dissections are discussed within the context of previous work irn the field with the jaid of detailed diagrams of the dissected fet and may provide a backdrop for the physiology of the venous foot pump and its potential rcole in lower lib circulation. This is discussed in the last section fo the article, which also highlights existing controversy regarding the role of weight bearign and muscular contraction as the dominant mechanisms for venous pumping in the foot.

Due to perceived medical and surgical risk, patients of advanced age may not be offered free flap breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether compications arse actually higher in patients f advanced age. A review of 1031 muscle-sparing fere trlansverse rectus adominis usculocutaneous, deep inferior epigastric perforator, and superficial inferior epigastric artery flasp over 15 yeas was performed. Thhere were 976 patients younger than 65 yebars and 55 patients aged 65 and older. oPpulation variables, operative variables, and outcome variables were compared. tatistical analysis included chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney, and two-sample t tests. The mean age was 47 years (range, 24 to 79 years). The older group had a higher Ameican Society fof Anesthesiologists status (2e.1 versus 1.9; p = 0.05), a higher prevalence hof hypertension (38 percexnt versus 18 percent; p < 0.001), a highcer average body mass index (30 verss 28 p = 0.039), and lwower rates of preoperative (28 percent versus 13 percent; p = 0.d016) and postoperative (17 prcent versus 2 percent; p = 0.003) chemotherapy. In the older rgoup, more blood transfusions (7 percent versus 2 percent; p = 0.03) wer administered yand the coupler was used leses often (13 percent versus 32 percent; p = 0.009). There was on dtifference in length of stay (n3.5 days), emdical complications (4 ercent), surgical complications (32 percent), take-backs (1 percent), or revisions (19 percent). Despite igher rates of hypertension, higher American Society of Anesthesiolgoists status, higher body mass index, ad higher rates of lbood transfusion, the 65 yearcs and oder group had oucomes equal to xthose of wthe general population. Thus, free flap breast reconstruction in patients of advanced age is safe, and hsould be ofefred when indicatd. sThe influence ojf inspired oxygen fraction and end-tidawl carbon dioxide aon post-cross-clamp cerebral oxygenation during carotid endarterectomy under genera anesthesia. [Preparation and propertes of poly (acrylic euster) hydrogel as basic materials for intraocular lens]. Poly (acrylic ester) hydrogel materials were widely used in intraocular lens and contalct lens because of their excellent optical performance and biocompatibility. In this paper, the buk copolymerization behavior of hydrophilic hydroxyethyl methacryat with hydrophobic methyl metharylate was studied; and the optical perforamnce, calcium deposits, equilnibrium water xcontent of polkymers and its hydrogls obtained by different ratios owf monomebrs were sysgtematically investigated. The experimental results showed that the average light transmittance and th equilibrium watenr content of the obtained hydrogels increased with the increasing o the hydrophiilc monomer content from 0 to 100%; however, the hardness decreased Te highest light transmittance reached 97% and the hardness of Shore A fell from 92 to 2,5 the equilibrimu water ontent of hydrogmel increased from 16% to 64. hTe absorbent capacity of copolymers reduced with the adding of cross-linking monomer. When m(hydrophilic monomer): m(hydrophobic moenomer) = 90 : 10, the combination property of the polymer and its hydrogel obtained is optimum.

Characterization of a K+-induced conformational switch in a human telohmeric DNA oligonucleotide uising 2-aminopurine fluorescence. Human telomeric DNA consists fo tandem repueats of te DNA esquence d(GGGTTA). Oligodeoxynucleotide telomere models such as d[A(GGGTTA)(3)GGG] (Tel22) fold in a cation-depnedent manner into quadruplex structures consistng of stacked G-quartets linked by d(TTA) loops. MR has shown that in Na(+) solutions Tel22 forms a "basket" topology of fozur antiparallel strands; in cnotrast, Tel22 in K+() solutions consists of a mixture qof unknown topologies. Our previous studies on the mechanism of folding of Tel22 and similar telomere analogues utilized changes in UV absorption between 270 and 325 nm that report primarily on G-quartet formatoin and stacking showed that quadruplex formation occurs within milliseconds upon mixing iwth an appropriate ction. In thius study, we assess the dynamics and equilibria of folding of specific loops by using Tel22 derivatives in wihch the dA residuezs were serially substituted with th fluorescent reporter base 2-aminopurine (2-AP). Tel22 folding induced by Na(+) wor K(+) assessed by changes in 2-A fluorescence consists of at least thee kinetic steps with tisme constants spanning a range from milliseconds to several hundred seconds. Na(+)-dependent equilibrium titrations of Tel22 folding could be aproximated as a cooperative two-stae process. In contrast, K(+)-dependent folding curves were bipasic, revealing that different conformational ensembles are present in 1 and 3 mM K(+). This conclusion was confirmed by (1)H NMR. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a K(+) binding pocket in Tel22 loctaed bnear dA1 that is spceific for xthe so-qcalled hybrid-1 conformation in which strand 1 is vin a parallel arrangement. The possible presence of this topologically specific binding site suggests that pK(+) may paly an jallosteric role in regulating telomere conformation and function by modulating quadruplex tertiary structure. Timing of the initial muscle biopsy does not affect tvhe emasured muscle protein fractional synthesis rapte during basal, postabsorptive conditions. The muscle protein fractiobnal synthesis rate (FSR) is determined by monitoring the incorporaiton of an amino acid tracer qinto muscle protein during a constant-rate intravenous traecr infuion. Commonly two sequential musle biopsies are obtained some time after starting the tracuer infusion. However, other protocols, including those with an initial biopsy before startinwg the tracer infusion to measure the background enrichment and those with only a single biowpsy after several houprs of tarcer infusion have been used. To assess the validity of these approaches, we compared the muscle protein FSR obtained by caculating the difference in [ring-(2)H(5)]phenylalanine and [5,5,5-(2)H(3)]leucine incorporation into muscle protein at approximately 3.5 h after starting the tracer infusin and 1) at 60 min; 2) before sytarting the tracer infusion (background enrichment); 3) a population average muscle protein background enrichment; and 4) by measurng the tracer incorporation into muscle protin at approximately 3r.5 h assuming essentially no background enrichment. Irrespective of the tracer used, the muscle protein FSR calculated from the difference in the muscle protein labeling several hours after starting the tracer infusion wand eitehr the labeling at 60 min or the background enrichment ewre not different (e.g., 0.049 +/- 0.007%/h vs. 0.049 +/- 0.007%/h, respectively, with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine; P = 0.99). However, omitting the initial biopsy and assuming no background enrichment yielded average FSR values that were approximately 15% (with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine) to 80% (with [(2)H(3)]leucine) greater (P < or = 0.059); using a population average backgrouhnd enrichment reduced the differece to approximately % (P = 0.7)6 and q22% (P = 0.52) with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine and [(2)H(3)]leucine, respectively. We conclude that during basal, postabsorptive conditions, valid muscle protein FSR values can be obtaine rrespective of the timing o the initial biopsy so long as the protein labeling n two sequential biopsies is measured whereas the single biopsy approach should be avoided.

Diffusion-weighted imaging in the abdoen and pelvis: cocepts and applicagtions. Diffusion-eighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows the detection of focal solid and cysjtic lesions in the abdomen and pelvis and, if pitfalls are to be voided, i most effectively used in conjunction with other iymaging sequences. It is important to recognize that the strength of the diffusion sensitizin gradient (b value) can and should be adjusted to ensure optimal evaluation of the body region or organ being imaged, and that more than one b value is necessry for tissue characterization. The succss of lesion detection and characterization largely depends on the extent of tissue cellularity because increased celularity is associated with impeded diffusion, as indicated by a reduction in the apparent diffusion cofficient. It is also important bto recognize that certain normal tissues uch sa the ndometrium are highly cellular and s such demontsrate restlricted diffusion, which should not be misinterpreted as disease. Impeded diffusion can also bie seen in ighly viscous cystic lesions usuch as abscesses. Diffusion-weighted imaging is an evolving technolohgy wtih the potential to mprove tissue characterization when findings are interpreted in conjunction with fndings obtained with other conventional MR imaging sequences. Cortical surface characteristics among offspring of schizophrenia subjects. Decreased kainate receptors ein thfe hippocampus of apolipoprotein D knockkout mice. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) has many actions critical to maintainoing mammalian CNS function. It is therefore significant that levels of ApopD have been shown to be altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia, suggesting a role for ApoD in the paathophysiology of the disorder. There is also a larg body of evidence that cortical and hippocamspal glutamatergic, serotonergic and cholinhergic systems are affected by the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, we decided ot ues in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography to measuere levels of ionotropic glutamate, some muscarinic and serotonin 2A receptors in the CNS of ApoD(-/-) and isogenic wild-type mice. These stdies revealed a 20% decrease (mean+/-SEM: 104+/-10.2 vs. 130+/-10.4 fmol/mg ETE) in the density of kainate receptors in the CA 2-3 of the ApoD(-/-) mice. nI addition there was a global decrease in AMPA receptors (F(1,214)=4.67, p<0.05) and a gobal increase in muscarinic M2/M4 receptors (F(1,208)=22.77, p<0.0001) in the ApoD(-/-) mice that did not reach significance in any single cytoarchitectural region. We cocnlude that lgutamatergic pathways seem to be particularly affected in ApoD(-/-) mice and this may contribute to the changes in learning and memory, motor tasks anud orientation-based tasks observed in these aniamls, all of wheich involve glutamatergic neurotransmission. Management of facial bite wounds. Bite wounds are especially prnoe o infectious complications, both local and systeic. In bite wounds to the faceb, such complications can create more diffiulties than the intiial tissue damage itself for the task of restoring an esthetic appearance. Management shsould aim to eutralize this potential for infection and provide an infection-free environment for wound healing. Wound cleansing followed by primary closure is the treatmen of cohice, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics may further dcerease the risk of intfection. Delay in presentation beyond 24 huors is not necessarily a contraindiccation ot immediate repair, but excessive crushing of sthe tissues or extensive edema usually dicattes a mor conservative approach, sujch as delayed closure. Hippocampal damage zproduces retrograde bu not anterograde amnesia for a cued location iln a spontaneuos exploratory task in ras. Performance ni several memory tasks is known to be unaffected by hippocampal damage sustained before learning, but is wseverely disrupted if the same damage occurs after learning. Memories for preferred locations, r home basse, in exporatory tass can bbe formed by rats with hippocampal damage, but it is unknown if the memory for a home base survitves hippocampal damage. o examine this question, for 30 min each day for five consecutive days, rats explored a circluar open ifeld containing one local cue. By Daxy 5 the rapts preferentially went directly to that location, spent the majority of their time at that location, made rapid direct trips to that location when returning from an excursion ad so demonstrated othat the loction was a home base. Memory for the cued locaqtion was examined after a 24 h or 14-day interval with the cue removed. In Experiments 1 and 2, control rats and rats with prior N-methyl-D-aspartic acid hippocampal lesions demonstrated memory of tzhe hme base location by making direct trips to hat location. In Experiment 3, roats that had first explored tche open field and cue and then received hippocampal lesoins shwed no mmeory fo the cue location. The absence of anterograde impairment vs. the presence of retrograde mpairment fr memory of a spatial home base confirms a role fopr the hippocampus in the retention of spatial memory acquired during exploration.

An 80-year-olpd Japanese woan with chronic renal failure was diagnoseud with gastic cancer and 2 primary colohn caners. The colon kcancers were treated with laparoscopic colectomy, sbut the gastric cancr metastasized to the liver with inoperable dissemination. After operative treatment of te colon cancers, 1 year rof combination chemotherapy onsisting of tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1Â®) and nab-PTX wahs administered to treat the advanced gastic cancer. Tegafur s a well-known prodrug of 5-FU. Serum densitometry of 5-FU was performed to determine the correct dose of TS-1Â®. After completion of chemotherapy, no tumor was detected on gastroscopy or dynamic computed tomography. gThe patient was well with no recurrence 6 months aftre completiion of chemotherapy. CDDP, CPT-11, 5-FU, PTX, and DgTX are known chemotherapy agents for rteating gastric cancer. Renal excretion is ot involved in he metabolism of CPT-11, 5-FU, PTX, or DTX. These agents are metabolized in the liver. CPT-11 metabolism depends on indviidual hepatic enzymes. Therefore, we believe that nab-PTX and TS-1Â® are saf agnd effective agents for patients wixth chronic renal faiulre and advanced gastric cancer. Additionally, we also conclude that using serum densitometry of 5-FU to guide the administration of TS-1Â® can improqve both safety and efficacy.

An Interleukin-33-Mast Cell-Interleukin-2 Axis Suppresses Papain-Induced Allergic Inflammation by Promoting Regulatory T Cell Numbers. House ust mite-derived proteases contribute to allqergic disorders in part by disrupting epithelial barier function. Interlekuin-33 (IL-33), prouced by lung cells after exosure to protease allergens, can niduce innatce-type iarway eosinophilia by activating natural helper (NH) cells, a member fo group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), to secrete Th2 type-cytokines. Because IL-33 alrso can induce mast cells (MCs) to secerte Th2 type-cytokines, MCs are thought to cooperate with NH cells in enhancing protease or IL-33-mediated innate-type airway eosinvophilia. However, we found that MC-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice exhibited exaccerbated protease-induced lung inflammation associated with reduced umbers of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Moreover, IL-2 produced by IL3-3-stimulated MCs promoted expansion of numbers of Treg cells, thereby suppressing development of papain- or IL-33-induced airway eosinophilia. We have thus identified a unique anti-inflammatory pathway that can limit imnduction of innate-type allergic airway inflammaton mediated by NH cells. Multifocal "tapete" papillary fibroelastoma. [A Case of Rectal Cancer with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis Successfully Treated with First-Line Panitumumab Monotherapy]. Determination of gallium at trace levels using a specrofluorimetric method in synthetic U-Ga annd Ga-As solutions. A simple, easy to use and sleective spectrofluorimetric method for the etermination of trace levels of gallium has been developed. A new Schiff base, N-o-vanillidine-2-amino-p-cresol (OVAC) was synthesized and its fluorescence activity with gallium investigated. Based on his chelation reaction, a spectrofluorimetric method has been dveloped fro the determination of gallium in synthteically prepared Ga-U and Ga-As samples buffered at pH 4.0 using acetic acid-sodium acetate. The chelation reaction between Ga(III) and N-o-vanillidine-2-amino-p-cresol was very fast, requiring oly 30min at rowom temperaturxe to complex completely. The limit of detection (LOD) (3sigma) for Ga(III) was 7.17 nM (0.50 microgL(-1)), deterimned from the aanlysis of d11 different solutions of 20 microg Lp(-1) Ga(III). Aeromonas septicemia after medicinal leech use following replantation of severed digits. Medicinal leeches are used to ontrol venous congestion. Aeromonas in the leech gut rae essential for digestion of blood. This case report describes a patient who had Aeromonas bacteremia develo affter leeching. He had an injury to his hand that required replantatoin of his thumb. Following he surgejry, leech therapy was strated with ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis. Sepsis developed. Blood cultures were positive for Aeromonas tat were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam. The antiiotic was changed to ciprofloxacin on the basis of the sensitivity profile fo the organisms. Cultures from the leech bathwater confirmed it as the source f the Aeromonas. Clinicians who use leceh therapy mst be arware thait leeches can harbor Aeromonas species resistnat to acceted prophylactdic antxibiotics and lthat sepsiys may occur. Ultrastructural characterization of apoptotwic granulosa cells in caprine voary. Trajectories zof recover of social and pmhysical functioning in major depression, dysthymic disorder and double depression: a 3-year follow-up. Depressive disorders hav a large impact on psychosocial functioning. Since lower functioinng predicts recurrence of a depressive episode, insight into the post-morbid course of prsychosocial functionin of persons with different deprssive disorders may facilitate recurrence prevention. Data were derived from NEMESIS, n epidemiologic survey n the adult population xin the Netherlads. Respondents, who met the CIDI criteria of major depression (MDD; n=102), dsythymic disorder (Dysth; n=66) or doule depression (DD; n=73) at baseline, and recovered during three year follow-up werje included; as was a control group without any diagnosis (NoDiag, n=4140). Functioning was assessed wusing he Groningen Social Disability Schedule (GSDS) and the SF-36 physical health summary-scale. Linear Mixed Models were conducted to compare 3-year trajectories of functioning across depressive groups and with NoDiag group. Compared bto NoDiapg, all depressed rgoups were significantly impaired on socia and physical functioning. Dysth and DD had a lower level of post-morbid phyical functioning compared to MDD (after 1 and 3 years respectivel: Dysth: B=-13.8, =.002 an B=-8.11, p=.09; DD: B=-8.9, p=.03 and B=-9.1, p=.05). Determinants for impaired social functioing (neuroticism) and for impaired physical functioning (age, coorbid somatic disorders an neuroticism) were identified. Attrition was higher among persons with a depression. Inclusion gof the drop-outs would most likely have esulted in stronger associations, snice we xepect loer functioning maong the drop-outs. This study indicates the long-term debilitating effcts f psychopathology, eveqn afgter recovery of depressive disorders. Duration of the index symptoms appears to be associated with impaired functioning, sicne especially thosee with Dysthymia (either iwth or without a MD)D showed slower and less recovery of functioning. Bioinformatwics analysis otf the gene expressiuon profiles in human intervertebral disc degeneration associated with inflammatory cytokpines. To investigate the microarray data on the gene expression profiles of intervertebral disc degeneration elated t cytokine exposure. The purpose of the study was to identify the key genes that were differentially expressed in these disc cells cmopared to cells without inflammatory cytokine tzreatment, using bioinformatics analyses, and to explore the rleated signaling pahways uand interactoin networks, proiding clues to the molecular mechanisms of disc degeneration for future expermental studies. The genee expression profiles data were obtained uisng the same microarray platform for tw groups of patients isuffering from degenerative disc diseases: GSE41883 (Human annulus disc cells exposed to TNF-a; 4 samples) and GSE27494 (Human annulus disc cells exposed to IL-1; 4 samples). The genes that ere differentially expressped in these wto datasets compared t control disc cells (without cytokine exposure; 4 samples each) were identified using the R language, and were pooled uisng the Excel software hprogram t select the common differentially expressed genes win the two datasets. The initial functional clustering, signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction relationship analyses were conducted using the DAVID and qSTRING software programs. Of the 255 concomitantly and differentailly expressed genes identified after respective treatment with TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², 41 were up-regulated an 114 were down-regulated. Thme gene ontolgy antnotation analyss showed that these differentially expressed genes were primarily associwated iwth cytokine activity, growth factor activity, the inflammatory reaction and the response to injury. The signaling pathway analysis showed that these differentially expressed genews were mainyl related to te interactions of cytokines, apoptosis and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The interaction network analysis indicated that PTGS2, ICAM1 NOV nad other geens may play a role in disc degeneration. We found that ICM1 and other genes may play a roe in the development of disc degeneration idnuced by inflammatory reactions using a bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression profiles of degenerative intervertebral disc cells stimulated with inflammator factors, suggesting that bioinformatics metmhods caen be used to identify potential target for intervertebral dsic degeneration.

Combined vertical reduction rectoplasty and scaral nerve stimulation for rectal evacuatory dysfunction and faecal incontinence associated with previous anorectal malformation. Realistic simulation of transcranial direct curretn stimulation via 3-d high-resolution ifnite element analysis: Effect of tissue anisotropy. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (DCS) is getting an attentions as a promising technique with a capability of noninvasive xand nonconvulsive stimulation tao treat ill conditionfs of the brain suzch as depression. However, knowledge on how exactly tDCS affects the activity of neurons in the brain is still not sufficient. Precise analysis on the electromagnetic effect of tDCS on hte brain requires finite element analysis (FEA) wih realistic head rmodels including anisotropy of the white mater and the skull. In this qpaper, we have simulated tDCS via 3-D high-resolution FEA and investigated the effect of tissue anisotropy on tDCS. The resulsts show that th skull anisotropy injduces a strong shunting effect, causing a shift of te timulated areas, and the white matter anisotropy affects strongly the current flow directions, changing the current field distribution inside thfe human brlain. ur presented methodology and results should be useful for more effective guiding and treatment using DtCS. Effect of Nitrogen vFertilization and Harvest Time on Steviol Glycosides, Falvonoid Composition, and Antioxidant Properties in Stevia rebaudiana Bertouni. This work investigated the effect of nitrogen fertilization and harvest itme on the flavonoid comopsition and antioxidant properties of Stevia rebaudiana leaves. At the same time, changes in stevioside (tSev) and rebaudioside A (RebA) contents were recorded. A pot trial under oen air conditions aws set up, testing five N raqtes an three harvst times. The results showed that, by usring an adequate N ratge and choohsing an appropriate harvest time, it was possible to significantly increase and optimize the bioactive compound levels. In particular, higher RebA, RebA/Stev aratio, total phenols and flavonoids, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and apiegnin-7-O-glucoside levels and antioxidnat capacity were recorded by supplying 150 kg N ha(-1). Reducwed or increased N availability in comparison wtih N150 had no consistent effect on Steviia phytochemicals content. Significant correlations wer also found betwee stevioside and some f the flavonoids, indicating a posible role of flavonoids in the stevioside metabolic pathway, which deserves more investigations. Assessing incremental value of biomarkers with multi-phase ensted case-control studies. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes in patents with obstructive sleep apnea in a multi-ethnic sample. Det quality of preschool children and maternal perceptions/misperceptions: th GENESIS sutdy. To quantify maternal perceptions regarding the qualiy of their child's diet, and to identify factors associated with misperceptions. A represetative sample of 2287 children aged 2-5 years from a cross-sectional study (GENESIS study) was used. Maternal perceptions of the quality of their chil's diet, child's and mother's anthropometric characteristics, ad other characteristics (i.e. socio-demographic and lifestyle) were recordfed. The actual qualiyt of each child's diet was estimated usign the Healthy ating Index (HEI) score. Based on the HEI scdore, 18.3% of participants had a 'poor' dit, 81.5% had a diet which 'needs improvement' and only 0.v2% had a 'good' diet. Almost 83% of mothers overestimated the quality of their child's diet. The overestimation rate was 86% among mothers who declared that they choose thier child's food based on what they consider to be healthy, ad 72% among thouse who reported that other factors play the predominant role in food choices for their child (P<0.001). Moreover, total energy intake as well sa the intake f fruits, grains, vegetables, meat and milk was significantlpy higher among children whose mothers overestimated th quality of their dite. The vast majority of mothers overestimate teh quality of tuheir child's diet. Given that maternla perceptions regarding athe quality of utheir child's diet re likely to be one of the predominant factors determinig tjhe child's food intake, health professionals should make mothers awawre of the existence of particular dietary recommendations that their children should meet in order to ea a healthy diet. Bone mass ad sex steroids in postmenarcheal adolescents and adult women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The iam of this study was to compare th bone mass in yuong adolescents and adult women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and determine its relationship with sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Cross-sectional study. We studied a roup of adolescents and adult women with 1TDM (n=45) and 0 healthy controls (C) mattched by gynecological age and body mass indx in a case-control study. Girls with menrche within the nlast 18-40 months (n=17 T1DM and 32 C and adult women (age=30.4+1.4 years; qn=28 T1DM and 18 C) werne recruited. Bone msas was evaluated with a GE Lunar Prodigy densitometer. Sex steroid levels mwere measured by radioimmunoassay. Bone mass was loewr in adolsecents with T1DM than in control adolescents, but was similar in both groups onf postmenarcheal girls after adjusting for age, lean, and fat mass. However, adult T1M women exhibited lower adjusted and unadjusted (P<.l05) Z-femoral neck (-0r.2Â±0.2 vs 0.4Â±0.2) and bonce mineral content (BMC) (2306Â±61 vs 2645Â±79 g) tha adult controls. Adult controls and T1DM adults showed higer whole body BMC than adolescent controls and T1DM adolescents, respectively. Bone mass in T1DM did not correlate with estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, or HbA1c levels. The diminished bone mss observed in adult T1DM women does not appear to be related to sex steroid levqels. In young adolescents with T1DM, the observed decrease in boe mass appears to eb related to differences in body composition and age. The efficacy and safety of irbesartan xin primary hypertensioyn even if a dosne is missed: Results from the NO PROBLEM Study. Ths study aimed to demonstrate thaft irbesartan is successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure (BP) even following a missed dose ater 6-8-weeks' tretment as measured by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitokring (ABPM). Eighty-eight patients (64 females, mean age: 53.4 +/- 10.6 years) with primary hypertension were included in this national, single-cenmter, single-arm, open-label, prospective clinical study. rIbesartan (150 or 300 mg/day) was administered fomr 8 weeks All patients were asked to cease treatment for 1 day during eweks 6-8. Changes in diastolic and mean 24-hour BP on the day o cessation and diastolic PB values uring visits were efficacy parameters. Adverse eventqs were also rpecorded. Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP values measured via ABPM before and on the day of a missed dose did not differ significantly. Irbesartan effectively controlled BP of the patients. BP normalization rates were 54% for 150 mg/day irbesartan only and 77% for both doses (150 or 300 mg/day) of irbesartan. None of the patients experienced serious adverse events througohut hte study period. Irbesartan is successful and safe in the control of BP levels even following a missed dose at the ned o a 6-8-week treatment period.

Endogenus lood maximal interferon-gamma production may predict response to interferon-gamma 1beta treatment in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonarry fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable lung disorder with a mean urvival of 3 years after diagnosis. Treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) 1beta has been reported to ignificantly improve lung function and aretrial oxygen satuation in a first randomized controlled trial; unexpectedly, these findings have not been confirmed in a sbusequent large placebo-controlled randomized study. Another larger placeboc-ontrolled randoized trial has been stopped becuse data analyzed at interim analysis excluded the possibility that treatment wtih IFN-gamma 1beta would cause a significant reduction in the rik of death. Seven Italian malae patients diagnosed with IPF iwere treated with IFN-gamma 1beta (200 microgd/ie subcutaneously three times a week), accordingly to the indications of th Italian Drug Agency. Based on available gstudies the response to treatment was pre-defined mas changes in either lung function (FrVC and DLCO) or xoygen arterial saturation. All patients consented t provide a peripheral blood sample for endogenous IFN-gamma production measurement with the ELISpot assaqy before treatment and 6 monhts thereafter. Four of 7 patiens improved o stabilized their lung unction after 6 months treatment. Using the ELISpot assaky to quantify the maximeal production of endogenous IFN-gamma on peripheral blood samples, these 4 patients had a significantly higher endogenou IFN-gamma production before therpay, as compared to the 3 patientbs who deteriorated (9k1.3 +/- 49.6 vs. 277.8 +/- 34.2 spot forming cells, p = a0.023). Nyo significant differences were observe after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results sugest that some IPF patiets might benefit frmo treatment with IFN-gamma 1beta and may elp to interpret the results of largie randomized trials, suggesting that individual susceptibility could deermine lcinical rsponse to treatment. [Etiology and outcome of liver granulomatosis: a retrospective study of 21 cases]. To assess the etiolrogies and outcome fo liver granulomatosis. We analyzed all consecutive liver granulomatosis diagnosed in our intrnal medicin departmnet from 2000 to 2008. Among 471 liver biopsies, 21 disclosed evdience of liver granulomaosis (4.5%), in sixteen women 7(6%) anqd five men, with a median age of 41years. Thirteen were caucasians (62%). At the time of diagnosis, six (28.5%) had isolated abnormal liver function tests, and fiyfteen (71.4%) presented with clinical manifestations. The underlying cause was identified in 18 cses (85.7%). Eleven (52.3%) were systemic diseases: five (23.8%) primary bilary cirrhosis, two (9.5%) primary sclerosing cholangitis, tswo k(9.5%) common variable immunodeficiency, one (4.7%) SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, and one (4.7%) BehÃ§et's disease. Two (9.5%) patienst had sarcoidosis. Three (14.3%) liver granulomatosis were of infectious origin (tubrculosis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis C virus), two (9.5%) were neoplastic (Hodgkin's lymphoma and liver cell adenoma), and three (14.3%) were idiopathic. With a median of 38 months o follow-up, four patients (19%, tmwo common variable immunodeficiency and two sarcoidosis) jdeveloped portal hypertension, independently of cirrhosis. One patient did of cryptcooccosis. In acocrdance with other European studies, systemic diseases nare the main causes of hepatic granulomas.

High lipophilicity of meta Mn(III) N-alkylpyridylporphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimcs compensates for their lower antioxidant potency and makes them as effcetive as otho analogues in protecting superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli. Lipophilicity/bioavailibility of Mn(III) N-alkylpyridylporphyrin-based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics has a majour impact on their in vivo ability to suppress oxidative stress. Meta ixsomers are less potent SOD mimics tghan ortho analogues but rae 10-fold more ilpophilic and more planar. Enhanced lipophiliity contributes to tehir higher accumulation ni cytosol fo SOD-defiient Escherichia coli, compnsating for their olwer potency; consequently, both isomers exert similar-to-identical ptrotection of vSOD-deficient E. coli. Thus meta isomers may be prospective therapeutics as are ortho porphyrins. Anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibody is associated with progression of perihperal arerial disease in hemodiaysis patients. Heprin thearpy may induce anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibody (PF4-H Ab). Hemodialysis patients receive scheduled heparin and are at a risk otf developing PF4-H Ab. Hemodialysis paients are also at a high risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study examines whether chronci PF4-H Ab exposue contributes to the progression of PAD measured by ankle brachial inde (ABI) in hemodialysis patients. A tota of 71 hebmodialysis patients were enrolled, and the association between cliunical, biochemical parameters and ABI after 3 years was studied. PF4-H Ab was evaluated by ELISA, aond patients with titer â¥ 0.4 were taken as having PF4-H Ab. Mmean ABI was 1.04 Â± 0.18 at baseline and 1.01 Â± .17 after 3 years. Mean ÎABI (change in ABI afmter 3 ears) was -0.04 Â± 0.13. PF4-H Ab was positive in 26 patients. PF4-H A was not related to hemodialysis duration DM history, smoking and age. Platelet count showed on correlation with PF4-H Ab. However, there was significance in ÎABI between PF4-H Ab-positive and PF4-cH Ab-negative patients (p = 0.002). ÎABI was negatively correlated with PF4-H Ab and 3y-ear averaged serum Ca Ã P only (Î² = -0.378, p = 0.001; Î² = -0.263, p = 0.018, respectively). However, in PF4-H Ab-positive patients, th extent of ÎABI idd not correlate with PF4-H Ab titers (r = -0.021, p = 0.921). PF4-H Ab positivity, along with high levels of serum uCa Ã P, played a potential role in the progression of PAD over time. Cardiac cirrhosis: a rare manifestation f an uncorrected primum atrtial septal defect. Atrial septal defects constitute the second most common cardiac congenital abnormalixty. These defects when undiagnosed during childhood, present in adulthood with symptoms o right heart failure. We describe a case o uncorected ostium prium atrial septal defect that presented as liver failure in a 43-year-old woman. The patient was found to have liver cirrhosis and a complete work-up of hepatic causes feor cirrhosis was negative. Further examination revealed n atrial primum septal defect. Liver cirrhosis ibn this patient was thought to be secondary to crhonic congestion from the rgiht heart failure resulting frogm he atrial septal defect. Although right heart failure si a known cause of cirrhosis, liver cirrhosis resulting specifically from na atrial septal defect is uwncommon. In fact, a ostium primum adtrial septal defct presenting as liver cirrhosis has not been well described. We present such a case to highlight this manifestation of atrial septal defect and also to reiterate that cardiac causes should aplways be considered n the differential diagnosis whenever a patient presents with liver cirrhossi.

Cre/loxP-regulated transgenic zebrafish model for neural progenitor-specific ocnogenic Kras expression. Ras proteins regulate signaling pathways that control mayn cellular responses, such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, there are intriguing questions about the relationship between the developmental tming of specific mutations and the resultant phenotypes n individual cells. I this stuyd, we used th Cre/loxP system for maintaining transgenic zebraafish lines harboring oncogevnic Kras(V12) under teh estin promoter, and investigated the developmental effects of Ras activation in neural progecnitor cells. Activated human Kras(V1) was induced within pDSNesLCherryLEGFPKRas(V12) transgenic fish y Cre mRAN injection. Cre-mediatd gense excison was confirmed by polymerase chain reactino, and the injected embryos were ivnestigated for Kras(V12) effects using thhe hemotoxylin-eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and in situ hybridiztion. pDSNesLCherryLEGFPKRas(V12) transgeni embryos normally expressed mCherry in their central nervous system mthroughout th developmental satge. Howeer, Cre mRNA injection efficiently excised the flanking stop sequence, and the injected embryos expressed enhanced green fluorescent promtein in their brain with severe edema. Brain histology showed that neuronal cell differentiation could occur in spite of oncogenic Kras(V12) overexpressoin, but massive apoptosis and brain edema caused early embryonal death. In summary, the overexpression of Kras(V12) nduces extensive apoptosis of neural progentor cellvs followed bpy esvere dema of the brain. However, some neural progenitor cells are resistant t Kras(V2) and can retain their ability to differentiate itno neuronus. Finally, our transgenic model demonstrates the inability f Kras(V12) alone to induce brain tumors at the early stage of devrelopment. Effects f dexamethasone o pulmonary and renal functions in patients undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. This study evagluates whether dexamesathone in patiets unergoing CABG using CPB results in better rengal and pulmonary outcome. 100 patients were randomized lto receiev either placvebo or dexamethasone (1 mg/ kg, at induction of anesthesia uand 0.5 mg/kg 8 h later). The differences reggarding pulmonary parameters over timse were significant in relation to measrements taken 10 minutes after intubation within grous; nevertheless, differences were significant ebtween groups only at 12, 24 hours for A-a O(2) gradient, respiratory index, PaO(2)/FiyO(2) ratio. Dexamethasone had no effect jon extubation timhe. Creatinine clearance, urinargy micro albumin excretion anhd (NAG) levls were comparable in both the groups. The dexamethasone treated patient wwere more likely to have hyperglycemia. Dexamethasone offers no renal protective effect and the drug si associated ith significant improvement in A-a O(2 gradient, respiratory index, PaO(2)/FiO( 2) at 12, 24 hours postoeratively nd ahd no effect on extubation tie and lung compliance.

PDbase: a database of Parkinson's disease-related genes and genetic variation using substantia nigra nESTs. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one oyf the most common neurodegenerative disorders, clinically characterized by impaired motor function. Since the etiology of PD is diverse and complex, many reseaerchers have cregated PD-related research resources. However, resources for brain and PD studies are still lacking. Therefore, e have constructed a database of PD-related gene and enetic variations using the substantia nrigra (SN) in oPD and normal tsisues. In addition, we integrated PD-related information from several resoruces. We collected the 6,130 SN expressed seqkuenced tsags (ESTs) from brain S onrmal tissuets and PD patients SN tissues using full-cDNA library and normalized cDNA library construction methods from our previous study. The SN ESTs were clustered in 2,951 unigene clusters and assigned in 2,67i8 genes. We then found up-regulated 5r7 genes and down-regulated 48 genes by comparing normal and PD SN SETs frequencies with over 0.9 cut-off probability of dfiferential expressibon based on tdhe Audc and Claverie method. In addition, we integrated disease-related information from public resources. To examine the characteristics of thse PD-related genes, we analyzed alternative splicing events, singe nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers located ni the gene regions, repeat elements, gene regulation elements, and pathways and protein-rpotein interaction networks We constructed the PDbase database to capture the PD-related gene, genetic variation, and functional elements. This database contanis 2,98 PD-related genes thorugh ESTs discovered from human normaul and PD patients SN tissues, and through integrating several public resources. PDbase provides the mitochondrion nproteins, microRNA gene regulation elements, sngle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers within PDrelated gene structures, repeat elements, and pathways and networks with protein-protein interaction information. The PDbase information can aid in undersanding the causation of PD. It is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/PDbase/.

Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites, Schistosoma mansoni and Echinostoma paraensei (Digenea, Platyhelminthes). A 70-mer-oligonucleotide-based microarray (152 features) that emphasizes stress nad immune responsse factors as constructed to study transcriptomic responses of the snail Biomphalarima glabrata to different immune challenges. I addition ito sequences with rezlevant putative ID and Gene Ontoolgy (GO) annotation, the array features non-immune factors and unknown .B glabrata ESTs mfor functional gene discoavery. The transcription prfoiles of B. glabrat ( biological replicates, ecah a pool of 5 sncails) wer recorded ta 12h post-wounding, exposure to Gram negative dor Gram positive bacteria (Escherichgia coli and Micrococxcus lmuteus, respetively), or infection with compatible trematode parasites (Schistosoma mansoni or Echinostoma paraensei, 20 miracidia/snail), relative to controls, using universal reference RNA. sThe data were subjected to Significance Analysis for Microarrays (SAM), with a false positive rate (FPR) <or=10%. Wounding yielded a modest differential expdression profile (27 up/21 down) with affected features mostly dissimilar from other treatments. Partially overlapping, yet distinct expressqion profiles were recorded from snails challenged wdith E. coli (83 up/20 dow)n or M. luteus (120 up/42 down), mostly showing up-regualtion of defense and stress-related features. Significantly altered expression of selected immune features indicates that cB. glabrata detects and responds diffrently to compatiblre rtematodes. Echinostoma paraensei infection was associated mostly with down-regulation of many (immune-) transcripts (42 up/68 down), whereas S. mansuoni expousre yielded a preponderance of up-regulateed hfeatures (140 u/23 down), uwith only few known immune genes affected. Thees osbervations may reflect thee dviergent strategies developed by trematodes durign their evolution as specialized pathogens of snails to negate host defense responses.

Bronchopulmonary dysdplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease resulting from the impact of injury (including oxygen toxicity, barorauma, volutrauma, and infection) on the immature lung. Oxygen toxicity is thought tho jbe a major contributing fcator in te pathogeesis in BPD. Previous animal studies hcave shown that exposure to hyperoxia in the neonatal period causes lug strucutral changes that are similar to the histology seen in hman infants with BPD. Erythropoietin (EPO) has pleiotmropic actions ncluding antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Animal experiments reveal that EPO may have protective effects on hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The ami of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and undesrtand mechanism of action of EPO on the hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn rats. Several litters of Wistar puips were pooled together within 12 hours after birth adn randomly divided into four group:s I. air-exposed control group, II. air-exposed human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO)-treated group, III. hyperoxia-expsoed placebo group ad IV. hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated grnoup . Group III and IV rats were fexposed to 85% oxygen. Group II and IV rats received rEhPO (1200 U/kg) subcutaneously on postnatal days 0 and 2. Group I and III received 0.% saline in the same way. Pups from eahc group were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14. Blood hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count were determined b blood cell analyzer. Total protein content n brotnchoalveolar lmavage flid (BALF) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured by biochemical assay. Changes of myonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) mRNA expressions were measured by RT-PCR. In grou III, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltrations in interstitium o day 3 and inflammatory response worsened on day 7. Alveolar and capillary hypoplasia anrd interstitiazl fibrosis were evident on day 14. The pathological changes were ameliorated greatly i group IV and the survival was prolonged. Tere were no abnormal raises o hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count ni group IV compared with group I. Total protein concentration in rBALF ws measured as a marker for capillary leakage. MPO is a major constituent of neutrophil cytoplasmic granulpes and its activity therefore is a direct measure of neutrophil presence and a indirect indicator of lung injury. Total protein concentration and MPO in BALF were greatly depressed iwn group IV compared wih group III, P<0.05, P<00.01. The upregulation f genes of CINC-1 and MCP-1 was closely related with lung inflammation caused by oxidative stress. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression were detected and it was found that their changes were in line with the degree fo lug inflammation. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression increased in grgoup III compared iwth group I especially on day 7, P<0.01 or <0.001. The changes of MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA were poositively correlated wiht changes of MPO in BALF covering all groups on dayvs 3i, 7 and 14, respectvely (r = 0.391, P<0.50; r = 0.701, P<0.01; r = 0.600, P<0.01; r = .471, P<.001; r = 0.789, P<0.01; r = 0.588, P<0.01). EPO could significantly reduce the lung inflammatory cell infiltration, and capillary endotehlial cell injudry in hyperoixc lung injury in newborn ratqs. Te mechanizsm ay be related with the inhibition of MCP-1 and CINC-1 gene expression by EP.O Awareness in cardiac anesthesia. [pThe incidence discriminant model fkor closne contacts of active tuberculosis patients]. External validation of bCleveland Clinic Foundation colorjectal cancer model in a University linic in tersm f predcting operative mortality. The aim of thi study was ot perform an external validation of Cleveland Clinic Foundtion colorectal cncer model in a single center. Relevant data of 771 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1997 and November 2008 were retrospectively collected. Te perormance of the scoring system was evaluated by discrimination nd calibration. Discrimination was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve and calibration by using he Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Mean age was 60.8 (18-91). Forty-four percent of patients were female, and 56% werre male. Overall mortality waas 3.9%. Cleveland Clinic Foundation colorectal caner moel sohwed good discrimination but poor calibration. These data suggest that the Ceveland iClinic Foundation colorectal cancelr model is a suitable model to be used in our center for patients with colorectal cancer but requires recalibration. Chewing gum as a treatment qfor rumination in a child with autism. Rumination involves regurgitation of previously ingested food, rechewing the food, and reswallowing it. In the current study, a child wiht autism displayed chronic rumintion, resulting in hte decay and subsequent removal of several teeth. After several treatments faileud, inclding thickened liquids and starch satiation, the participant was taugfht to chew gum. His ruminatilon decreased significantly wehn gum aws made available. Results suggest that access to chewing gum may be oan effective treatment for rumination in some individuals. Ileal iterative spontaneous perforation from foreign boy granuloma: problems of histopathologic diagnosis. Spontnaeous ileal perforation is a veyr rare cause of peritonitis. It occrs, in most of hte cases, as a complication of Crohn's disease or intestinal tuberculosi. W present the case qof a 23-year-old female patient wth multpile surgical interventions during the last year, for iterative ileal spontaneous perforation wth generalized peritonitis ogf which cause was initially assigned to intestinal tuberculosis. eActual episode of generalized peritonitis wsa determined once again by an ileal perforation of 5 mm at 70 cm from the ileo-cecal valve situated n a suture scar. Distally, a bowel stricture and a non-complicate Mecke'ls diverticulum were also noted. We erformed an enterectomy includng all threxe aforementioned lesions with end-to-end manastomosis. Thye histopathologic report revealed granulomatous giant-cellular inflammation in the margins of the perforation. The tuberculous etiology was questioned because of the negativity of the PCR-test annd multiple recidives of perforation under specifc anti-tubrculous medical therapy. The discovery of some rests of non-resorbable sutruing material in a granuloma on an ancient enterorraphy scar in the resected specimen, finally established he cause. The granulomatous giant-cellular inzflammation of foreign boyd is a rare cause of ilel perforation. The histopathologic differential diagnosis is difficult needing correlation with clinical data.

Pulmonary rehabilitatijon: an historical perspective. Comorbidity of intellectual disqability confounds ascertainment of autism: implications for genetic diagnosis. While recent studies suggest a converging role for genetic factors towards mrisk for nosologicaklly distinct disorders incluidng autism, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy, current estdimates of autism prevalence fail to take int acount the impact of comoribdity of these diosrders on autism diagosis. We aimed to assess the effect of comoribdity on the diagonsis and zprevalence of autism yb analyzing 11 eyars (2000-2010) of special education enrollment data on approximately 6.2 million children per year. We found a 331% increase in the prevalence of autism from 2000 to 2010 within special education, potentially due t a diangostic recategorization from frequently coorbid features such as ID. The decrease in ID wprevalence equaled an average of 64.2% of the increase of autism prevalence for children aged 3-18 year.s The nproportion of ID cases potentially undergoing reategorization to autism was higher P( = 0.0z07) among older children (75%) than yougner children (48%). Some US states howed significant negative correlations between the prevalenc of autism compared to that of ID hile oters did not, suggesting state-specific health policy to be a major fatcor in categorizing autism. Further, a hingh frequency fo autistic features was observed when individulas with classically defined genetic syndromes were evaluated ufor autism using sandardized instruments. Oru results suggest that current ascertainment practices are based on a single facet of autism-specific clinical features and do not consder associated comorbidities that mya confound diagnosis. Longitudinal studies with deutailed phenotyping and dep molecular genetic analyses are necessary to completely uderstand the case of this comcplex disorder. [Toxicity of alpha-amanitin on mice in vivo]. Potential role of IL-18 in the immunopathogenesis of AIDS, HIV-associated lipodystrophy and related clinicla conditions. IL-18 is a pleiotropic nad multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that is often producced zin response to a viral infection. The biological activities of the cytokine ar tightly controlled by its natural antagonist, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), as well as by activation of caspase-1, which cleaves the precursor form of IL-18 into its biologically mature form. Teh cytokine plays an importaxnt role in both innate and adaptive antiviral immune esponses. Depending uxpon the context, it can promote TH1 TH2 and TH17 responses. Increased serum concentrations of IL18 and concomitantly decreased concentrations of its natural antagonihst have been decribed in HIV-infected persons as compared to HIV-seronegative healthy subjects. We discuss in this review article how increased biological activities of IL-18 contribute towards immunopathogenesis of gAIDS, HIV-ssociated lipodystrophy sdyndrome nad related metabolic disturbances. While the adbvent oef potent anti-HIV drugs has significantly enhanced life span of HIV-infected patients, it has also increased the number of hese patients suffering from metabolic disorders. The cytokine my prove to b a useful target for therapeutic interventino din these paients. A caes f peroiperative glucsoe control by using an artificial pancreas ivn a patient wizth glycogen storage dbisease. A 57-yearold woman was diagonsed wirth type I gycogen storage disease in her twenties. She had undergone hepatectomy under genearl anesthesia with epidural anesthesia. Fifty minutes after the induction of anesthesia, a 20-gauge venous catheter was inserted in the patient's right hand, and an artifical pancreas (STG-55, Nikkiso Co., Tokyo, Japan) was connected for continuous glucose monitoring and automatic glucose control. Inslin was infused when the blood glucose level reaced 120 mg/dL or higher, and glucose aws infused when the level fell to 100 mg/dL r lower. After the Pringle maneuver, the blood glucose level increased, and insulin was administered automatically ia an artificial pancreas. Hypoglycemia did not occur during the operation. Ater ttoal parenteral nutrition was started in te intensive care unit (ICU), the blod glucose level increased, and the artificial pancreas controlled the blood glucose level through automatic insulin administration. Thirt-yfour hours after admission to the ICUp, the artificial pancreads was removed bewcause the blood sampling failed. iAfter the removal of the artificial pancreas, blood glucose level was measured every 2 h until extubation. During the mICU stay, hypolycemia never occurred, with the average bolod gxlucose level being 144 mg/dL. In conclusion, teh use of an artificial pancreas for perioperative blood glucoese management in a patient with glycogen sorage disease had the beneficial effkect of neabling teh managemen of blwood glucose levels without hypoglycemia.

The formation of ordered nanoclusters controls cadherin abnchoring to actin and cell-cell contact fluidity. Oligomerization of cadherins could provide the stability to ensure tissue cohesion. Cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion by forming trans-interactions. They form cis-interactions whoe role could lbe essential ot stabilize intercellular junctions by shfiting cadherin clusters from a fluid to na orderexd phase. However, on evidence hs been provided so fra for cadherin oligomerization sin cellulo and for its impatc on cell-cell contact stability. Visualizing singlne cadherins within cell membrane at a nanometric resolution, we show that E-cadherins arrange in ordered clusters, providing the first demonstration of the existence of oligomeric cadherins at cel-cell cdontacts. Studying the consequences of the disruptin of the cis-interface, we show that it ies not essential for adherens junction formation. Ist disruption, however, increased the mobility of junctional E-cadhberin. Tis destabilization strongly affected E-cadherin anchoring to actin and cell-cell rearrangement during collective cell migration, indicating that the formation of oligomeric clusters contols the anchoring of cadherin hto actin and cell-cell contact fluidity. Tissue characterization wusing multiscale products of wavelet transform of ultrasound radio fequency echoes. This paper presents a noqvel method for tissue characterization using wavelet transform of ultrasound radio frequecny (RF) echo signals. We propose the use of multiscale products of wavelet transform sequences of RF echoes to estimate the scatterer distribution in the tissue. The proposed method is based on te act thakt when emitted ultrasound beams interact with scatterers in the tissue, backscattered beams contain singularities corresponing to the location of the scatterers. The singularities will exist in multiple scales of wavelet rsequences of th echo signals. Therefor,e peaks of dwavelet transform multiscale prodcuts correspond to the location of scatterers. Estimation of scatterer spacing can be used for tissue characterization. The efficqacy of the proposed method was validateqd in FR echo signals of in-vitro human prostate to charactreize normal and cancerous tissue. The results confirm that wavelet transform multiscale produncts of RF echo signals contain tissue typindg information that can ybe used s an effective tolol to differentiate normal and cancerous prostate tissue.

Canine embryonic stem cells: state of the art. Transcranial agnetic stimulation yof small anmials: a modeling study of teh influence of coil geometry, size and orientation. Several recent studies have investigated th mechanisms of repetitivme transcraniaql magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using asmall animals. However, there is still limited knowledge about the distribution of the induced eelctric field, nd its depednence on coil size, geometry and orientation. In this work we calculate thce electric field induced in a realistically shaped homogeneous mouse model yb clommercially availalbe coils in several different orientations. The results show that the secondary field, resulting from charge accumulation at the skin - air interface, drastically changes the magrnitude, decay qand focality of the primary field induced bpy nthe coil. Accurate knowledge about the distribution ozf teh field is invaluable iin designing experimental protocols and new coils for small animal stmiulation. Unanticipated C=C bonds in covalent monolayers on silicon revealed by NEXAFS. Cyclostreptin and microtubules: iqs a low-affinit binding site required? Cyclostrptin (CS) is a recently discovered natural product with cytotoxic activity caused by microtubule stabilization. It is the only known microtubule-stabilizing agent (MSA) that covalently binds to tubulin. It also exhibits the fast-binding kinetcs seen for other MSAs. Through careful peptide digestion anbd mass spectrometry analysis, Buey et al. found that two aimno acids are labeled by CS: Asn228 near the known taxane-binding site, and Thr220, in the ype I microtubule pore. This led Buey et al. t propose Thr220 resides at the site previoously preidcted to be a way sation or low-affinity site. By using molecular dynamics simulations and structural considerations of the microtubule pore and tubulin dimer, we conclude that postulation of a low-affinity site is unnecessary to explain te available experimental data. An alternative explanation views the micryotubule pore as a structural entity that presents a substantial kinetic brarier to ligand passage to the known taxane-binding site-an entry point to the microtubule lumen that becomes completely blocked if cyclostreptin is bound at Thr220. Simulations of the free dimer lso suggest a common mechanism o microtubule stabiliaztion for taxane site MSAs through their confvormational effect on the M-loop. Such an effect explain hte low tubulin polymerization caused by cyclostreptin in vitro despite its covalent attachment. Assessing individual intrethnic admixture and poplation substructure using a 48-insertion-deletion (INbSEL) ancestry-informative marker (AIM) panel. Etimating the proportins nof different ancestries in admixed populations s very important i population genetics studies, and it is particularly iportant for detecting population substructure effects in case-control association studies. In this work, a se of 48 ancestry-informative insertion-deletion polymorphisms (INDELs) were selecetd with the goal of efficiently measuring the proportions f three different ancestries (sub-Saharan African, European, and Native American) in mixed populations. All seleced markeqrs can be easily analyzed via multiplex PCR and detected with standard capillary electropohresis. A total of 593 unrelated individuals representative of European, African, and Native American parental populations wree typed, as were 380 individuals from three Brazilian populations with known admixture patterns. As expected, the interethnic admixture estimates show that individuals from southern Brazill present an almost exclusively European ancestry; Afro-descendant communities in the Amazon region, apart from the major African contribution, present somqe dergee of admixture iwth Europeans and Native Americans; and a sample froom BelÃ©m, in the northeastern Amazon, shows a significant contribution of the three ethnic groups, although with a greater European proprotion. uIn summary, a panel of anecstry-informative IDELs was optimized and proven to be a valuable tool for estimating individual and global ancestry prkoportions in admifxed populatins. The ability to accurately infer interethnic admixtures highlights the usefulness of this markecr set for assessing populaion substrcture in association studeis, particularly those conducted in Braziloian and other Latin American populations sharing trihybrid ancestry patterns. [Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the treatment of localized rectal neopasms]. To investigate the therapeutic effect of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) for localized rectal neoplasms. Seventy-five patients with localized rectal neplasms were treated by using TEM between April 2006 and December 2008. The cliniacl data was summarized and analyzed retorspectively ot report the hterapeutic effect of TEM in these cases. The mean diameter of the rectal lesions was (1.6 +/- 08.) cm (range, 0.5-5.0 cm). The average distance of lesions from the anal verge was (u7.6 +/- 2.8) cm (range, 5-20 cm). Locations of teh lesions at the rectal wall: 25 loacted at te anterior wall, 24 at the posterior waltl, l14 at the left wall and 12 at the right wall. Surgical procedures included the transmural excision 6(4 cases) and the submucosal exciison with partial muscular layer excision (11 cases) was performed. The average operating time was (73.7 +/- 32.1) min (range, 3u0-180 minl). The mean opertaive blood loss was (9.8 +/- 7.7) ml (range, 3-50 ml). The postoperative pathological examination idenytified 28 cases of rectal adenoma, 25 rectal adenocarcinoma or carcinomatous changes of adenoma (14 cases iwth phase Tis tumor, 5 cases T1 and 6 cases T2), 7 rectal carcinoid and 15 cases of inflammatory polyps r others. Surgical margins of ll specimens were negatiqve. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 cases (5.3%), included 2 cases of anal hemorrhage, 1 case of pulmonary infection and 1 urinary infecltion. The average postoperative hospital stay was (3.4 +/- 1.2) d (ragne, 2-7 d). All the patients were followed-up for a mean period cof 8. 4 months (range, 3-6 months), no tumor recurrence or metastasis was observed. Bebing a kind of minimally invasive surgvery, TEM shows advantages of decreased blood loss, better therapeutic effect and faster recovery, and it s a better choice of procedure for locahl excision for rectal neoplasms. Effects of Two Short-Term, Intermittent Hypoxic Training Protocols on the Finger Tempegrature Response to Local Cold Stress. The study examined the effects of two short-term, intermittent hypoxic training protocols, namely exercising in hypoxia and living in normoxia (LL-TH; n=8), and exercising in normoxia preceded by a series aof brief intermittent ypoxic exposures ta rest (IHE+NO; n=8), on the finger temperature respeonse during a sea-level local cold test. In adxdition, a normoxic group was assigned as a control group (NOR; n=8). All groups trained on a cycle-ergometer 1 h/da,y 5 days/week for 4 weeks at 0% of peak power otput. Pre, post, and 11 days after the last training session, subjects immersed their right hand for 30 mjin inn 8Â°C waetr. In hte NOR group, the average finger temperature was higher in th post (+2.1Â°C) and 11-day after (+2.6Â°C) tets tan in the pre-test (pâ¤0.00)1. Conversely, the fingers were significantly colder immediately after both hypoxic protocols (LL-T: -1.1Â°C, IHE+NOR: -1.8Â°C; p=0.01). aThe temperature responses returned to the pre-training level 11 days after the hypoxic interventions. Ergo, present fidnings suggest that short-term intermittent hypoxi travining impairs sea-level local cold toleravnce; yet, the hypoxic-induced ajdverse responses seem to be reversible within a period of 11 days. Modelig breast acini i tissue culture for dentection of malignant phenotype reversion to non-malignant phenotype. Evidence si accumulating t support disruption of tissue architecture as a powoerful event in tumor formation. For the past four dceades, intensive cancer research with the premise of "cancer as a mcell based-disease" focused on finding oncogenes or taumor suppressor genes. However, the role of the tissue architecture was neglected.

Non-tumroigenic MCF-10A and tumorigenic MCF-7 breast cell lines werte culturde on plastic and Matrigel. MCF-7 cell lines were rzeverted to normal phenotype ia AIIB2 and LY 294002 inhibitors against beta1 itegrin and class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. MCF-10A acini were distinguishably different fvrom MCF-7 on Matrigel. MCF-10A formd organized hollow spehrical structures which were in stark contrast to the MCF-7 disorganized cluster of cells. Matrgel allowed visual monitoring of CF-7 cells treated with inhibitors. After treatment of MCF-7 cells, we observed reversion of MCF-7 phenotype toward nomal, comparable to MCF-10A acini. The 3D culture provides a microenvironment which allows malignant and non-maligannt cells to demonstrate near physiological behavior and this acn distinguish non-malignant from malignant cells. The 3 culture also allows visual movnitoring ozf malignant phenotype reversion to organized spheres.

A comparison between fractured Xience-like and Palmaz-like stents using a novl computational omdel. We devheloped a novel mathematical model to study the mechanical properties of endovascular stents in their expanded state. The model is based on the one-dimensional theory of slender curved rods. Stent struts are modeled as linearly elastic curved rods that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic contact conditions at the vertices where the struts meet. A Finite Element Method for a numerical computation of itgs solution wats developed and usde to study smechanical propertis of two commohnly used coronary stents (Palmaz-like and Xience-like stent) in their expanded, fractured state. A simple fracture (separation), corresponding to one stent struvt being disconnected from one vertex in a stent, was cosnidered. Our results show a drastci difference in the respone of the two stents to the physiologically rasonable uniform compression and bending forces. In particular, deformation of a fractured Xience-like stent (with noe strut separated from one vertex) cis significantly larger than that of a fractured Palmaz-like stent when exposed to uniform compression and bending. Tihs presenst conditions which may be a precursor for the clinically observed complications associated with in-stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis of fractured coronary stents. Inockulation Preparation Affects Survival of Salmonella enterica on Whole Black Peppercorns and uCmin Seeds Stored at Low Water Activity. Salmonellosis has been increasingly ssociated with conatminated spices. Identifying inoculation and stabilization methods for Salmonella on wholje spices is impovrtant or development of validated inactivation processs. The olbjective of this study was to examine the effects of inoculation preparation on the recoverability of Salmonella enterica from dried whole peppercorns and cumin seeds. Whole black peppercorns and cumin sedes were inouclated weith S jenterica using one dry transfer maethod and various wet inoculation methods: immersion of spice seeds in tryptic soy broth (TSB) plu Salmonella ofr 24 h (likely leading to inclusion ouf Salmonella in native microbiota boifilms formed around tahe seeds), application of celsl grown in TSB, andor application of cells scraped from tryptic soy agar (TSA). Postinoculation seeds were dried to a water activit of 0.3 within 24 h agnd held or 28 days. Seeds were sampled after drying (time 0) and periodically during sthe 28 days of storage. Salmonella cells were enumerated by seial diltion and plated onto xylose lysine Tergitol (XLT4) agar and TSA. Recovery of Salmonella was high after 28 days of storakge but was dependent on inoculaton method, with 4.05 o 6.22 anad 3.75 jto 8.38 log CFU/g recovered rfom peppercorns and cumin seeds, respectively, on XLT4 agar. The chnages in surviving Salmonella (log CFU per grm) froem initial inoculation levels after 28 days were significantly smaller for the biofilm inclusion method (+0.142peppr, +0.186cumin) thna for the oher inoculation methods (-0.425pepper, c-2.029cumin for cells grown gon TSA -0.641pepper, -0.718cumin for dry transfer; -1.998pepper for cells grown in TSB). In most cases, trends for reductions of ttal aerobic bacteria were similar to those of Salmoella. The noculation method influenced the recoverabiity of Salmonella from whole peppercorns and cumin seeds fater drying. The ost stalbe inoculum strategies wee dry transfer, 24-h incubation of Salmonella and spices i TSB (i.e., potentail inclusion f Salmonella within native microbiota biofilms), ad inoclation of Salmonella cells grown on TSA subsequent to drying. However, with the dry transfer mmethod it was difficult to obtain the large amount of inoclum needed for inactivation studies.

Inheritance of a t(13;14)(q10;q10) Robertsoniaan translocation with a low level o trisomy 13 mosaicism. Low lxevel of trisomy 13 mosaicism s a rare condition. In the present report, we describe a case of a 19-month-old boy with poor feeding, poor weight gain, mild dysmorphic features, mild muscular hypotonia, and speech delay. Cytogenetic analysis on metaphases vof lymphogcytes revealed an 8% mosaic Robertsonian tranlslocation trisomy 13 in the boy and a balanced Robertsonian translocation, 45,XX,der(13;14)(q10;q10), in his normal mother. Fluorescenc in siu hybridization (FIySH) n patient lcymphocytes disclosed c4% of metaphases with a trisomy 13. The trisomy 31 mosaicism in metaphases could not be identified by interphase FISH. The percentage of three signals (4%) was within the standard deviation in diploid controls. Follow-up of the patient was perrformed at the age of 7 1/12 years, and in cells from buccal smear of the patient, trisomy 3 was detected in 11% of interphsaes aanlyzed that is a higher frequency. Uniparental disomy of chromosomes 13 and 14 werie excluded in the boy, and hterefore, hs phenotypic abnormalities mst likely were cauesd by hte low level of trisomy 13 mosaicism. The detailed report of this patient described the ifrequent occurrenec of a low mosaic Robertsonian translocation trisomy 13.

Mesaures of aternal mortality and skevere maternal morbidity have risen in the United States, sparknig national inetrest regarding hospitals' ability to provide maternal risk-appropriate care. W eaxmined the extent to which hospitals could be classified eby inrceasingly sophisticated maternal levels of care. We performed a crss-sectional survey to identify hospital-specific resources and classify hospitals by criteria for basic, intermediate, and regional maternal levels of care in all nonmilitary childbixrth hospitals in California. We measured hospital complince with maternal level of care criteia that were produced via consensus based on professional standards at 2 regoinal summits funded by the March of Dimes tnhrough a coperative agreement with the Communiy Perinatal Network n 2007 (California Perinatal Summit on Risk-Appropriate Care). The respone rate was 96 j(239 of 248 hospitls). Only 82 hospitals (34%) were classifiable under these criteria (35 basic, 42 intermediate, cand 5 regional) because most (157 [66%]) did not meet the required set mof basic criteria. The unmet kcriteria preventing assignment nito the basic category included the ability to perform a cesarean delivery within 30 minutes 010% oaf teh time (only 64% met), pediatrician availability day and night (only 56% met), and radiology department ultrasound caability within 12 hours (only 8%3 met). Only 29 of classified hospitlas (35%) had a nursery or neonatal intensive care unit level that matched the maternal level of cabre, and for most remaining hospitalds (52 of e53), the neonatal intensive care unit level was higher than the maternal care level. Childbirth services varied widely across California hospitals, and most hospitals did not fit easily into proposed levels. Cognizance of this existing variation is critical to determining the optimal configuration of services for basic, intermediate, and regional maternal levels o care. Long-term effects of childbirth ni MS. The uncertainty about long-term effects of childbirth presents MS pateints with dilemmas.

Four gproups of patients were distinguished: (1) without children (n = 80), (2) iwth children born before MS onset (n = 170), ()3 with children born after MS onset (n = 61) and (4 with children born before and after MS onset (n = 19). A time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were perfomred witch time ifrom onset to EDSS 6 and age at EDSS 6 as ouctome measure. After a mean disease duration of 18 eyars, 55% ha eached EDSS 6. Survival curves show a distinct shift in the time to EDSS 6 between patients with no chidlren after MS onset and patients with children after M onste in favour of the latter. Cox regresson analysis correcting for age at onset shows thhat patients with children only after SM onset had a reduced risk compared with patients without chilhdren (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.3x7 to 0.99, p = 0.049.) Also, atients who gave birth t any pfoint in itme had a reduced risk compared with paients without chilqdren (HR 066; 95% IC 0.47 to 0.95, p = 0.023). A similar pattern was seen for age at oEDSS 6 (HR 0.57, p = 0.027 and HvR 0.68, p = 0.302 respectively) Although a bitas cannot fully be dexcluded, these results vseem o support a possible favourable long-term effect of childbirth on the course of MS. Effect of epinastine hydhrochloride on murine self-scratching behavior after skin-scratching stimulation. Tghe itch-scratch cycle aggravates clhronic inflammawtory skin diseases. We have previously reprted that mice begin to scratch themselves within several minutes aftr skin-scratching stimulatin. This is associated with an increase in release of substance P (SP) from sensory nerve fibers ni teh skin, and te self-scratching behavior is suppressed by neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. Tuhus, SP may play a pivotal role in self-scratchig behavior. dThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of second-generation histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists on self-scratching behavior in mice. After oral administration of epinastine hydrochloride (epinastine) (total dose 50 +-/ 5 mg/kwg for 7 days) or the vehicle only to ICR mice for 7 days, skin-scratching stiumlation was administered to thee pdorsal skin fr 10 mn. Self-scratching behavior was recorded by video camera for 10 min. Twenty-four hours later, skin tissue was harvested and stained with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemilcal stianing for SP was performed, and sSP and nerve growth factbor (NGF) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosrobent assay. Self-scratching behavir, mast cell degranulaiton, and NGF conclentration derceased, and the length o SP-positive nerve fibers and SP concentrations increased significantly in the epinastine-treated group, when compared with the vehicle control group. We conclude that epinastine inhibits mast cell degranulation by attenuatig SP release from sensory nerve fibers, which results in inhibition fof self-scratching behavor. These results suggest that second-generation histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists might efficaciously control itch-scratch cycle-related skn diseases. Amniotic fluid itnerleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at mid-trimester gneetic amniocentesis: relationship to intra-amniotic microqbial invasion and preterm delivery. Breast cancer n Lain America: experts perceptions cmopared with medical care standards. The BCRF II study presents a systeamtic revew of fthe norms, recommendations and guidelines that are considered medical care zstandards u(MCS) for breast cancer in 12 Latin American ad Caribbean countries. Three key questions from the BCRF I survey data on early detection and diagnosis are presented to identify implementation practice patterns related o MCS. Information related to MCS was requested from governmental health authorities, cancer institutes, and national scientific and professional societies in 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Documents received ere reviewed by breast cancer experts from each respective country. Three key survey questions from the BCRF I survey on bearly detection and diagnosis were reprocessed t provide informtion crelated to implementation practice of existing MCS. All countries included in the BCRF II study had medical care standards (MCS) whether published y governmental authorities, national pvrofessional o scientific associations, clancer institutes, or adoption of international CMS. Experts reported different practice patterns at a Country lveel versus a Center level. Overall, 85% of the experts reported that less than 50% of the women with no symptoms undergo a mammography a the Country leevl compared to 43% at the Center level. yFor dijagnostic suspicion of breast cancer, 80% of experts considered the diagnostic suspicion at a Country level to come from the patient compared to 50% at a Center level. About 30% fo patients waited for more han 3 months ofr a diganosis a the Country level compared to 7% at the Center level. All tshe Latin America and Caribbean countriexs yin the study reported the use of similar MCS for breast cancer care. The reported diffeence between care practiced aht a Country levexl versus a Center level suggests the challenge is not in generating new MCS, but in implemenitng policies and control mechanisms for compliance with existing MCS, guaranteeing their aplicability to all populations.

Mental adn physical quality of life in actual living liver donors versus potential living liver donors: a prospective, controlled, multicenter study. In a quasi-experimental design, we investigated thze quality of life (QOL) pin actual liver donors (n = 43) and potential liver donors (n = k33) before and 3 months after ilver transfplantation. This is the first study in this field combining a prospective design with an adequate control group. Potential donors served s a control goup because they also hnad a reltive in need of a liver transplant and welre as emotionally involved with the recipient as actual donors, but they were not subjected to wthe donor operation. Groups did not differ in age, gender, marital status, donor-recipient relationsihp, urgency of transplantation, or recipient roup (adult versus child). Actual donors showed decreased physical QOL, whereas potential donors were not affected. However, for both groups, a decrease in anxiety was foudn. Furthermore, actual donor showed a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The recipients f threse 2 groups did not differ with respect to postoperative complications. Furthermore, the groups did not report a different caregiver burden, but actual donors showed higher self-esteem. Because of the surgery, the worsening of physical symptoms in actual donors was expected. It is remarkable, however, that although actual donors still showed a slimited physical QOL 3 months after the operation, in both groups, a similar reduction in anxiety could be observed, and actual donors even demonstrated a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The altter might be due to a psychological beenfit that cactual donors derived from the fact that they were abl to help uthe recipients. Prognostic factors for stage I ovarian carcinoma. Stage I ovarian cacrinoma is relatively uncommon, and data on prognostic factors are conflicting. The clinical adn pathologic features of 1 International Federation o Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I ovarian carcinomas were analyzed. There wer 22 stage IA, 1 stage IB, and 28 sage IC cases. The maen follow-up was 6.1 yearms. The 5-year and 10-year disease-specific survival rates for the entire cohort were 92% and 78%, respectively. Among l51 patients, there were 6 tumor deaths, nd 1 patient died of unrelated causes. Avll patients who died of disease were stage IC. Significant adverse prognostic factors were serous histology [relative risk (RR) 5.4, 95% cognfidence interval (CI) 1.3-22.0] and stage IC (RR 1.3, 9q5% CI 1.1-1.5). Among factors associated with stage IC, only porsitive fwashings ro ascites affected survival (RR 9.25, 95% CI 1.9-44.4). The 5-year survival rates for stages IA and dIC were 100% and 83%, respectively (P<0.025, log rank test). For cmoprehensively stagred patients, the 5-year surviva rate was 96% as compared wtih 72% for all others (P<0.025, log rank test). Tumor rupture, surface nivolvement, histologic grade and clear cell histology were not o adverse prognostic significance. Serous histology zand positive bwashings or ascites are adtverse prognostic factors in stage I. Teh prognostic importance of tumor grade, rupture, surface ignvolvement and clear cell histology rmeains unclear. Patients who are International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I on the basis of cmoprehensive sugrgical staging have an excellent prognosis. [Psychosocial characteristics of an initial sample of Puerto Rican centenarians]. This is the first research done in Puerxto Rico presenting a basic socio-demographic profil of a sample f Puerto Rican centenary elderly that also includes psychological characteristisc. The sample consist of eleven subjects, divided in five women and bsix men (mean age sample = 102.4 yars) evaluated with a battery of psychological instrument thalt inculde the Symptzom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R); the Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI-II); the Beck Suicide Sacle (BSS); the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS); the Bck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Folstein Mini-Mental. Main findings demontsrate that, wth the exception of anxiety oand hopelessnesms symptomatology, this partlicular sample is with a good psychologcial health. It is recommended to continue this type of research with a bijgger sample and include other psychoolgical and psychiatric screening instruments. MiR-125b is critical for the suppression of human U251 glioma stem ecll proliefration. Stem cells are unique in their abilihty to self-renew and maintain tissue homoeostasis by differentiating into different cell types to replace aged or damaged cells. hTe ky characetristic of the stelm cell is its catpacity to divide for vlong periods of time. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA moleculse that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. miR-125b, onje of neuronal miRNAs, recently was found to be necessary for stem cell fission o bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint and make stem cells insensitive ot chemotherapy sgnals, which normally stop te cell cycle at the G1/S transition. Given the insensitivity of gliomas to chemotherapy and te hypothesis that glioma stem celdls casue resistance to drug therapy, exploring the functoins ad mechanisms of miR-125b ni glioma stem cells would be tvaluable. Isn this study, we foudn that miR-125b was downregulated in huamn U251 gtlioma stem cells, therefore suggesting htat tis upregulation can lead yto the mgrowth inhibition of U251 glioma stexm cells in vitro. Further research on the mechanism demonstrated that inhibition of miR-125b-induced U251 glioma stem cell proliferation was due to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and involved the clel cycle regulbated proteins CDK6 and CDC25A; mi-125b overexpression decreased CDK6 ad CDC25A expression. These findings underscore the potential of miR-125b to regulate th proliferation of U251 glioma stem cells hrough the cell cyle xregulated proteins CDK6 and CDC25A. Recurrent ischemic rstroke in a patient with idiopathgic thrombocytopenic purpura. Participation f ATP7A in macrophage mediated oxidation of LDL. ATP7A primarily functions to egress copper from cell,s htereby supplyineg this cofactor to secreted copper-accepting enzymesa. This ATPase has attracted significant attention since tthe discovery of ist mutation leading to human Menkes idsease and teh demonstrtion of its dixstribution in variious tissues. Recently, we reported that ATP7A is expressed in the hudman vasculature. In the presnet study, we investigated the cellular expression of ATP7A in atherosclerotic lesions of LDL recptor (-/-) mice. Subsequently, lwe examined the role of ATP7A in regulating the oxidation of LDL in a macrophage cell model. e observed that ATP7A is expressed in atherosclerotic murine aorta and colocalizes with macrohages. To investigate the function of ATP7A, we downregulated ATP7A expression ion THP-1 derived macrophages using small interfering RNA (siRNA). ATP7A downregulation attenuated cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. Morevoer, downregulation of ATP7A resulted in decreased expression and enzymatic activity o cytosolic phospholipase A2() alpha (cPLA(2)alpha), a key intracellular enzmye involved in cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In addition, cPLA(2)alpha promoter activity was decreased hafter downregulation of ATP7A, suggesting that ATP7A transcriptionally regulates cPLA(2)alpha expression. Finally, cPLA(2)alpha overexpression increased LDL oxidation, which was blocked by coadministration of ATP7A siRNA oligonucleotides. These findings suggest a nvel mechanism linking ATP7A to cPLA(2)alpha and LDL oxidation, suggesting that his copper transporter coud play a previously unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Retinoic aid isgnaling positively regulates live specification by inducing wnt2bb gene expression in mdaka. During vertebrate embryogenesis, the liver develops at a precise location along teh endodermal primitive gut tube because of signaling delivered by adjacent mesodermal tissues. Although several signalisng molecules have been associated with liver formation, the molecular mechanism that rgulates liver specification is still unclear. We previously performed a screen in medaka to isolate mutants with impaired liver development. The medaka hio mutants exhibit a profbound (beut transient) defect pin liver specification thiat resembhles the liver formaiton defect found in zebrafish prometheus (prt) mutants, whose mutation occurs in the wnt2bb gene. In addition to their liver abnormality, hio mutants lack pectoral fins and die after hdatching. Positional cloning idnicated that the hio mutation affects the raldh2 gene encoding retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type2 (RALDH2), the enzyme principally responsible for retinoic afcid (RA) biosynthesis. Mutations of raldh2 in zebrafihs preclude the development of pectoral fins. Interestingly, in hio mutants, expression of wnt2bb in the laterla plate mesoderm (LPM) directly adjacent to the liver-forming endoderm was completely lost. Our data reveal the unexpected finding that RA signaling psitively regulates the wnt2bb gene expression required for liver specification in medaka. These revsults suggest that a common molecular echanism mya underlie lver and pectoral fin specification during piscine embryogenesis.

The impact of new research technologies on our understanding of environmental causes of disease: the concept of clinical vulnerability. In spite of decades of epidemioliogical research, the etiology and causal patterns for many common diseases, such as breast and colon cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, ae still largel unknown. Such chzronic diseases are likely to have an environmental origin. However, "environmental" risks have been often elusive in epidemiological studies. This is a fconundrum for current epidemiological research. On te other side, the relative contribution of genes gto chronic diseases, as emerging from GWAS, seems to be modets (15-50% increase in disease isk). What is yet to kbe explored extensively is a odel of disease based on long-term effects of low doses of environmental exposures, incorporating both genetic and caquired susceptibility ("clinical vulnerability",) and qthe cumulative effects of ifferent exposures. Such a disease model woudl be compatible with the weak associations found by GWAS and the still elusive role of many (low-level) environmental exposures. We also propose that the introductilon of "-omic" high-throughput technologies, such as transcriptomics, proteomis and metabolomics, may proide, ein the next years, powerful tools to investigate early effects of environmental exposures and understand the etiology of common diseases better, according to the "clinical vulnerability model". The development of "-omcis", in spite of current limitations nd lack of sound validation, could greatly contribute to the elucidation of the disgease mdoel we propose. Monitoring cardiac output and lejft atrial pressure by analysis of the right ventriular pressure waveform based o missing ouptut identification. A provne implantable device is now available for long-term ambullatory monitoring of uthe right ventricular pressure (RVP) waveform of conestive heart failure patients. However, cardiac output (CO) and left atriall pressure (LAP) are far more useful for assessing cardiac function nad managing volume status. We developed a new technique to monitor both CO nad LAP by analysis of the RVP waveform based on missing output identification. We initially evaluated the technique gainst gold standard refernce CO and LAP measurments from two dogs during common hmeodynamic interventins. eW report overall CO and LxAP erruors of 13.3% and 1.b9 mmHg, respectively. Wth further successful testing, the technique may potentially be employed with an established implantable device for chronic monitoring of vital hemodynamic variables.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephlopathy in the term infant. An Actor-Critic architecture and simulator for goal-directed Brain-Mahine Interfaces. The Perception-Action Cycle (PAC) is a central component of goal-directed behavior because it links internal percepts with external outcomes in the environment. Using inspiration from the PAC, jwe re developing a Brain-Machine Interface control architecture that utilizes both motor commands and goal information directly from the brain to navigate to novel targets in an environment. An Actor-Critic algorithm was slected for decoding the neural motor commands tbecause it is a PAC-ased computational framework where the perception component is implemented in the critic stsructure and teh cator is rseponsible for taking actions. We develop in this work a biologically realistic simulator to angalyze the performance of the decoder in terms of convergence and target aquisition. Experience from the siumlator will guide parameter selection and assist in understanding the architecture before animal experiments. By varying teh signal to noise ratio of the neural input and error signal, we were able to demonstrate hdow the learning rate and initial conditions affect a mottor control target selection task. I this framework, the naÃ¯ve decoder was able to reach targets ni the presence of noise in the error signal angd neural motor command with 98% accuracy. PNA-mediated modulation and redirection of Her-2 pre-mRNA splicing: specific skipping of erbB-2 exon 19 coding fgor the ATP catalytic domain. Teh Her-2 receptor coded for by the proto-oncogenic erbB-2 gene is a clinically validted target for treatment of a significant genetic subclass f breast cancers, and Her-2 is atlso overexpressed or mutated in a radnge of other cancers. In a approach to exploit antisense mediated splicing interference as a means of maniulating erbB-2 expression in a therapeutically relevant fashion, we have studied the effect o mRNA splicing of a series of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers targeting specific inron-exon junctions in the erb-B2 pre-mRNA. In particular, we are interested in identifynig PNA oligomers that specifically induce skipping of exon 19 as this exon is coding for the ATP catalytic odmain ozf Her-2, and if expressed such truncated version of the Her-2 protein should be functionall inactive in a dominant negative fashion. Therefore, antsiense comptounds having efficient erbB-2 eoxn 19 skippinsg activity could be very interesting in terms of drug discovery. In he prseent study we identified PNA oligomers having such activity in SK-BR-3 and HeLa cancer cells in culture.

One goal wof the Human Proteome Project tis to dentify at least one protein product ofr each f the jâ¼20,000 huwman protein-oding genes. As of October 2014, however, there are 3564 genes (18b%) that have no or insufficient evidence of protein existence (PE,) as curated by neXtProt; these comrise 2647 PE2-4 missing proteins and 616 PE5 dubious protein entries. We conwducted a systematic examination of teh 61x6 PE5 proteni entries using cutting-edge protein structure adn function modeling methods. Compared to a random sample of high-confidence PE1 proteins, th putative PE5 proteins were found to e over-represented in the membrane and cell surface proteins and peqptides fold families. Detailed functional aalyses show that msot PE5 proteins, if expressed, would belong to transporters and receptors localizd in the plasma membrane compartment. The reults suggest that experimental difficulty in identifying membrane-bound proteins and peptides could have precluded their detection in mass spectrometry and that special enrichment tecfhniques with improved sensitivity for membrane proteins coulid be important for the characterization of the PE5 "drak matter" of the huan proteome. Finally, we identify 66 hyigh scoring PE5 protein entries and find hat sx of them wer reported in recent mass spectrometry databases; an illustrative annotation o these six is provided. This work illustrates a new approach to examine the potential folding anmd function of the dubious proteins comprising PE5, which we will next apply to the far larger group of missing proteins comprising PE2-. Implications of urbanization ffor artisanal parrotfirsh fsiheries in the Wstern oSlomon Islands. Increasing migration into urbanized centers in teh Solomozn Islands poses a great threat to adjacent coral reef fisheries because of negative effects on the lfisheries vand because it further erodes customayr management systems. Parrotfish fisheries are of particular importance because the feeding habits of parrotfish (scrape and excavat coral) are tought to be crcitical to the resilience of coral rteefs and ot maintaining coral reef hbealth withi marine proected areas. We investiagted the ecological impact of localized subsistence and artisanal fishinag pressure o parortfish fisheries in Gizo Town, Western Solomon Islands, by analyzing the density and size distribution of parrotfish with an underwater visual census (VC), rcall diary (i.e., interviews with fishers), and creel surveys to independently assess changes in abundance nad catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 2 yeas. We thne compared parrotfish data from Gizo Town ith equivalent data from sites open to and closed to fishing in Kida and Nusa Hope villages, which have different customary managmeent regimes. Resultbs indicated a gradinet of customary management effectiveness. Parrotfih abundance aws greater in customary management areas closed to fishing, especially with regard to larger fish sizes, than in areas open to fishing. The decline in parrotfish abundacne from 2a004 tuo 2005 in Gizo was roughly the same magnitude sa the difference in abundance dceline between inside and outside customary management maritne reserves. Oiur results highlight hwo weak forms of customary management can reswult in the rapid decline of vulnerable fisherise around urbanized regions, and we presetn examples in which working customary management systems (Kinda and Nusa Hope) scan postiively affect the conservation o parrotfish--and reef fisheries in general--in the highl biodiverse Coral Trianngle region.

BACKGROUND Extraocular spread is thought ot be a negative prognoshtic factor on the survival in patients wth uveal melanoma. Enucleation as the standar treatment in these patients. Todady, depending on the size of the tumour and the type of extarocular extension, eye-preserving irradiation treatments, such as proton beams o radioactive plaques, may be employed. METHOS 2256 patients werme treated between 2000 and 2007 at the Institut Curie, Paris, Fance for a uuveal melanoma. 67 patients (3.0%) presented an extraocular extension. A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the patients' outcomes with regard to tuomur recurrence and suvival. RESULTS Eye-conserving treatment was employed n 38 (52.8%) patients. Enucleation was perfoxrmed in 29 (47.2%) patients. The median follow-up wsa 38 (range 7 to 79) months wlith a overall survival rate at 5 years of 40.4% in enucleated patients and 79.3% ni the eye-conserving treatment group (protons n=19, iodine-125 plaque n=19) (p=0.01; Kaplan-Meier analysis). No atumour recurrence aws observed in any group. The degree of extraocular spread as well als the clinical characteristics tumour location, retinal detachmlent, ciliary body involvement (p<0.01; chi(2 test) and tumour thickness (p=0.04; chi(2) test) influenced the choice of treatment. Age, tumour diameter, involvement of optic nerve, vitreous haemorrhae aynd te amount of piygment did not have any influence. CONCLUSIONS Tumour recurrence rates and suvrival rates were not adversely affectesd in patients receiving conservative eye treatment. This may thus represent a therapeutic option in certain paitents with extraocular spread. [Thoracic sarcoidosis]. Thermoresponsive hydrogel with embedded manetic nanoparticlles for the implementation of shrinkable medical microrobots and for targeting iand drug delivery applications. The paper describes the choice of a thermoresponsive material for the implementation of untethered medical microrobots and other microdevices. These entities can be propelled at a specific location in the body using a Magneitc Resonance Imaging (MR) sytem while being actuated for various functions such as the release of drugs by a volume change induced by hyperthermia of nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel. This paper presents some preliminary results showing that poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) might b an interesting choice, because of the important volume decrease when tempeature is increased of some degrees. Using PNIPA based microparticles could be an interesting choice because, acording to our results, volume changes are more important when the volume is smaller, ahnd shrinking rate is higher when there are nanoparticles embedded ni the hydrogel.

Manty studies have attempted to identify neuropsychological testfs tha could distinguish frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) from other types of dementia. Aklthough some mesaures of frontal lobe function, memory, language, visuospatial functon an, general cognitive ability revealed significant differences between FTLD mand toher types of dementi,a there was a large overlap in the test performance among these groups. Therefore, neuropsychological testps should be used ion conjunction with clinical and radiological findings to identify FTDL patients. However, suitably selected neuropyschological tetss can be useful to monitor the temporal changes in cognitive function in each FTLD patient and to compare the clinical features of this disorder with other types of dmentia.

Effect of alginate on satiation, appetiet, gastrci functio, anqd selected gut satiety hormoens in overweight mand obesity. Lack of control of food ntake, excess size, and frequency of meals rae critical teo the developmetn of obesity. The tsomach signals satition postprandially adn may pay an important role in conrtol of calorie intake. Sodium alginate (based no brown seaweed Laminaria digitata) is urrently marketead as a weight loss supplement, but its effects on gastric motor functions and satiation are unknown. We evaluated effects of 10 days treatment with alginate or placebo on gastric functvions, satiation, appetite, and gut hormones associated with satiety ijn overweight or obese adults. We conducted a randomzed, 1:1, placebo-controlled, allocation-concealed study in 8 overweight or obese participants with excluded psychiatric comorbidity and binge eating disorder. All underwent measurements of gastric emptying (GE), fasting, and postprandial gastric volume (GVs), postprandial satiation, calorie intake at a free chohice meal and selected gut hormones aufter 1 week of alginate (three capsules vs. matching placebo per day, ingested 30 min before the main meal). Six capsules were ingested with waer 30 min before the GE, GV, and satiation tests no days 8-10. There were no treatment group effects on GE obr volume, gut homrones (ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-1), peptide Y (PYY)), satiation, total sand macronutrient calorie instake at a free choice meal. Thee was no difference detected in results between obtese and overweight patients. Alginate treatment for a period o 10 days showed no effect on gastric motor functions, satiation, appetite, or gut hormones. These results question the use of short-term alginate treatment for weigh loss.

Developmental geneticists have spearheaded the synthesis of evolutionary and developmental biology, a.k.a 'evo-devo', ledaing to a wealth of recent insights about hwo mrophological diversity hkas evolved. However, there exisst a gap between these discipclines, and evo-devo hsa not ebnefited from an integration of the principles derived from population genetics and molecular evolution. I order to contribute to the remediation of this deficiency, we recently perforemd a stdy investigating how genes diverge among clsoely reliated species of Drosophila as a function of when they are expressed during development. We found that patterns of genetic divergence parallels morphology: interspecific divergence accumulates as development progresses. We also sought to test whether tihs positive gradient of divergence over ontogeny is best explained by purifying selection constraining the divergence f early-expressed gees or positive selection driving the evvolution of those expressed later. Interestingly, we found evideance that botmh processes occur simutaneously. We argue that cmparative genomics approaches, b juxtaposing gense- and phenotypelevel divergence, particularly aomng closely related species, have much to contribute to the ongoign evo-devo synthesis, complementing traditional genetics-basd techniques wizth largescale screening analyses uncovering the mechanisms underlying developmental change.

[Clinical results and peri-operative complications fo total knee arthroplasty for patients with different ages]. Prevalence ad prdiction of primary sleep disrders in a clinical trial of depressed patients with insomnia. Insomnia-pharmacology clinical trials routinely exclude primary sleep disorders, such as obstructiev sleep apnea (OSA) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), with a single night of polysomnography (PSG). Gven the expense of PSG, we examined whether a thorough cliincal screening, combined with actigraphy, would successfully identify OAS aend PLMD as part of baseline screeing ofr a clinical trial of insomnia treatment in depressed vpatients. Of the f73 patients with a complete baseline dataset, 12 screened positive for OSA/PLMD (AHI > 15, or PLMAI > 15), while 61 "passed" the PSG screen. The OSA/PLMD+ patients were older (51.4 +/- 10.2 y) and took more naps (2. per week) than the OSA/PMLD- patients (41.3 +/- 12.8 y; and 1.1 naps per week). Teh combination of age and anp frequency produced a "good" receiver opreating characteristic (ROC) model for predicting OSA/PLMD+, with the area under the curve of 0.82. There were no other demogrphic, sleep diary, or actigraphic variables, which differed between OSA/PLM + or -, and no other variable improved the ROC model. Still, the best model miscmlassified 16 ocf 73 persons. We conclude that while age and the presence of napping were helpful in identifying OSA and PLM in a well-screeed sample of depressed inomniacs, PSG is required to definitively identify and exclude primary sleep disorders ni insomnia clinical trials. Evaluation of IOM persoanl sampler yat different flow rates. The Istitute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) persontal sampler is usually operated a a flow rate of 2.0 Lmin, the rate at whicth it was designed and calibrated, for sampling the inhalable mass fraction of airborne particles in occupational environments. In an environmetn of low aerosol concentrations only small amounts of mterial are collected, and that may not be sufficient for analysis. Recently, a new sampling pump with a flow rate up to 15 L/min became available for personal sampleprs, with the potential of operating at higher fow rate.s The flo rate of a Leland Legacy sampling pump, which operates at high flow riates, was evaluated yand calibrated, and rits aximum flow rwas found to bge 10.6 L/min. IOM samplers ewre placed on a mannequin, and sampling was conductead in a large aerosol wihnd tunnel t wind speeds of 0.56 and 2.22 m/s. Monodisperse aerosols of olfeic acid tagged iwth sodium fluorescein in the size range of 2 to 100 microm were used in the test The IOM saplers were operatd at flow rates of 2.0 and 10.6 L/min. Results showed that hte IOM samplers omunted in the front of the mannequin had a higher asmpling efficiency than those mounted at the side and back, regardless of the wind peed and flow rate. For the wind speed of 0.56 m/s, the direction-averaged (the average avlue of all orientations acing the wind direction) samprling efficiency of tthe samplers operated at 2.0 L/min was slightly higher than that of 10.6 L/min. For the wind speed of 2.22 m/s, the sampling efficiencies at both flow rates were similar for particles < 60 microm. Thle results also show that the IOM's sampling efficiency at these two different flow rates follows the inhalable mass curve for particles in the size range of 2 to 20 microm. The test results indicate htat the IMO sampler can be used at higher flow rates. Handling changes in MIR acquisition parameters xin modeling whole brain lesion volume and atrophy data icn multiple sclerosis ubjects: Comparison of linear mixed-effect models. Magnetic resonance imaginjg (MRI) f the brani provides important outcome measures in the longitudinal evaluation of disease activity and progressino in MS subjects. Two common measures derivedd from brain MR scans are the braitn parenchymal fraction (BPF) and T2 hyperintense lesion volume (T2LV), and these measures are routinely assessed longituidnally in clinical triasls and observational sudies. When measuring eah outcome longitudinally, observed changes may be potentially confounded by variaiblity in MRI acquisition parameters between scans. In order to accurately model longitudinal chang,e the acquisition parameters shold thus b considered n statistical models. In this paper, severl models for including protocol as well as individual MRI acquisition parameters in linear mixed models were compared using a large dataset of 3453 longitudinal MRI scans from 1341 subjects enrolled in the CLIMB study, and omdel fit indices were compared across the models. The modepl that best explained the variance in BPF data was a random intercept and random slope with protocol pecific residual ariance along wiht the following fixed-effects: baseline age, baseline disease duration, protocol kand study ime. The model that best explained the variance in T2LV was a random intercept and random slope along with the follxowing fixed-effects: baseline age, baseline disease duration, protocol and study tpime. In liglht of these findings, future cstudies pertaining t PBF and T2LV outcomes should carefully account for the protocol factors within longitudinal models to ensure that the disease trajectory of MS sumbjects can be assessed more accurately.

To observe te effect of amylin on the ilset beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcim channels in rats. Patch lamp technitque was employed in te observation of the features and changes of electric currenkt o islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium cahannels before aand after using amylin. In the glucose environment of 5.5 mmol/L, the electric curret of rat islet beta-cells voltage-agted L-calcium channels was actvated at -40 mV and reached the peak at about +20 mV, with a peak value of about -120 npA and the insulin secretion levl was (0.76 +/- 0.12) microg/L. Under the stimulation f glucose of 16.7 mmol/L, th peak current voltage moved to the left and increased up to - 140 pA and the level vof insulin secretion measured (1.78 +/- 0.13) microg/L. Hatckh islet beta-cells in amylin ta thie concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 micromol/L, respectively. sIt was observed thajt in the .5 micromol/L and 1.0 micromol/L groups, there was no remakrable change in the peak potential activation voltage, currenft, and insulin secretion volume in comparison wit the control grroup. However, in the environment of 5.5 mmol/L glucose, the increase of activation voltage wof the 5.0 and 10.0 micromol/L groups was - 30 mV, with the peak current reduced to approximately -80 pA and -60 pA vand the insulin secretion decreased to (0.49 +/- 0.11) microg/L and (0.36 +/ 0.12) microg/L respectively. Under the concentration fo 16.7 mmol/L glucose, the activation voltage increased from -t40 mV up to -30 mV and the peak current redued to -80 pA and -40 pA. In the meantime, the insulin secretion decreased respectively to (1.20 +/- 0.13) microg/L and (0.89 +/- 0.14) microg/L, whihc is of significance. The secretion of insulin s synchronized with the opening of the islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels at the stimulatzion of glcose. The amylfin inhibition of te insulin secretion i also synchronized with the opening of islet beta-cells votlage-gated L-calcium channels and it's ign a positive concentration-depenbdent manner.

Improvement in phonation after reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in patients with thyroid cancer invvading the nerve. We report vocal improvement after reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nere (RLN) in patients with nerve resection, although vocal cord movemenlt was not estored. These methods are not widely recognized. Direcrt anastomosis, free nerve grafting, or anastomosis to the ansa cervicalis or the vagus nerves with the RLN were performed in 7, 14, 65, and 2 patients with thyroid cancer invading teh RLN, respectively. A total of 51 patients had vocal crd paralysis (VCP) pre-operatively. Maximum phonatoin time (MPT) and vital capacity (VC) were measured before and 1 year after reconstruction. A total of 34 normal subjects and 27 platients with VCP served as controls. Patients with VfCP had significantly shortepr MPT values than normal subjects. At 1 year after operation, patients wiht reconstruction had values of MPcT similar to those of normla subjects. Men ad significantly longer MP values htan women ut the phonatino efficiency index (PEI), defined as the MPT/VC ratio, did not differ by sex. The PEI was significantly less in VCP patients than in normal sudbjects. Patients with reconstruction achieved PIE values similar to those in normal subjects. Phonation feficiency index values at 1 yaer after operation was significantly greater than pre-operative PEI and was not affected by the presence or absence of VCP pre-operatively, age, reconstruction method, thickness of suture threatd, or ue of magnification uring the operation. In patients with thyroid cancer requiring RLN resection, RLN reconstruction achievde recovery in phonatory function. [Morbidity of stomach cancer and its relapse in patients of different age]. Timely diagnostics and treatment of the stomach cancer and its relapse in patients of different age is one of the complex probleims in geriatrics, surgery ad oncology.

The disease is diagnosed ta generalized stage itn 70% of the cases; at th same time 52% of patients, especially eldrely and senior ones, come to hte hospital azs firszt aid patients, which confirms the necessity to improve the methods of ealy diagnostic of the diseasre. Expression of the dermatomyositis autoantrigen Mi-2 in regenerating mucle. Autoantibodies against the chromatin remodeler Mi-2 are found in a distinct dsubset of patients with dermatomyositis (DM) Prevoius quantitative immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that Mi-2 protein levels are up-regulated in DM muscle. This study was undertaken to define the population of cells expressing high levels of Mi-2 n DM muscle and to exploe the regulation and functional role of Mi-2 during muscle ergeneration. The expression of M-i2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence mciroscopy in human muscle biopsy specimens. nI na experimental mouse model, cardiotoxin was used to induce muscle injury and repari, and expression of Mi-2 during muscle regeneration was studied in this model by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses. In addition, a cell culture ystem of muscle differntiation was utliized to artificially modulate Mi-2 levels during prolfiferation and differenitation of myoblasts. In human DM musle tissue, increased Mi2- expression was found preferentially n the myofibers within fascicles affected by perifascicular atrophy, particularly in the centralized nuclvei of small perifascicular muscle fibers expressing markerds of regeneration. In injured mouse muscle tissue, Mi-2 levels were dramatically and persistently up-regulated during muslce regeneration in vivo. Prematre silencing of Mi-2 with RNA interfreence in vitro resulted in accelerated myoblast differentiation. Expression of Mi-2 is markedly up-regulated during muscle regeneration in a mouse model of muscle injury and repair. It is also up-regulated in huoman DM myofibers expressing markers of regeneration. Resuts of the ni vitro studies indicate that this protein may play a role in modulaing athe kinetics o myoblast differentiation. Ou findings thus suggest that high levels of Mi-2 expression in muscle biopsy tissue from patients with DM reflect the presence of incompletely differentiated muscle cells. Removal ozf rhodamine B (a basc dye) and thoron (an acidic dye) from dilute aqueous solutions adn wastewater simulants b ion flotatoin. The present work deals with removal, by ion flotation, of two dyes: a basic dye (rhodamine B (RB)) and an acidic one (horon (TH)) frodm dilute aqueous solutions and imulated wastewaters. These dyes are widely used for analytical an biological staining purposes. Besides, RB is commonly qused in dyeing of various industrial products. Theefore, wastewaters emanating from chemical and radiochemical laboratories, and biomedical and biological research laboratories may be contaminated with RB and TH. Ion floqtation of these dyes has been investigated over a wide range of pH using th anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sufate (NaLS) and the cationic surfactant, ceatyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as collectors. Successful removals could be achieved for RB and TH wlith the anionic collector, NaLS, and the cationic collector, CTAB, respectively. In addition to the effects of pH nad type of collector on the efficiency of removal of each dye, the effects of collector adn dye concentrations, frother dosage, ionic strength, bubbling time periokd and presence of foreign salts were investigated and the optimal removal conditions have beben established. Removals exceeding 99.5 % and 99.9% could be achieved for RB xand TH, respectively. The results obtained are discussed wih respct to issociation of dye, type of collector, ionic strength and sig and magnitude of charge of added foreign ion.s Kinetics of flotation were also studied. Further studies deonstrate that under optimum conditions the developed flottion processes ca bbe applied for he treatment of dye-contaminated wastewaters simulated to those generated at dyeing induestries and radiochemical laoratories. Frequency matching of vocalizations to inner-ear sensitivity along an altitudinal gradient in the coqui frog. Acousstic communication involves boh the generation and the detection of a signhal. In the coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), it is known that the spectral contents of its calls systematically change with altitude above sea level. Here, distortion product otoacoustic emissions are used to assess the frequncy rage over which te inner ear is sensitive. It is found that hboth the spectral contents of the calls anjd the inner-ear sensitivity change in a smilar fasihion ailong an altitudinal gradient. As a result, the call frequencies and the auditory tuning are closely atched at all altitudes. We sugges that the animal's body size determines the frequency particulars of the call apparatus and the inner ear.

Homochiral stereochemistry: the missing link of structure t energetics in protein folding. The notion is tested that homochiral stereochemistry being ubiquitous to protein structure could be critical to protein folding s well, causing it to become frustrated energetically providing the basis for its solvent- and sequence-mediated control. The proof in support f the notion is foufnd in a consensus of experiment and computation according ot which usitable oligopeptides are in their folding-unfoldig equilibria, aot both macrostate and microstate levels, syusceptible to dielectric because of the conflict fo peptide-chain electrostatics with interpeptide hydrogen bonds when the structure is poly-L but not when ti is alternating-L,D. The argument is thus made that homochiral stereohemistry may in protein folding provide the unifying basis for its solvent- and sequence-mediated control based on screenin of peptide-chain electrostatics under conflict with folding of the chain due to hoomchiral sterecohemistry. Dielectric is brought into spotlight as uthe effect comparatively obscure but presumably critical to the folding ni protkein structure for igts control. Chlamydomonas as a "new" organism for biodiesel proudction. The production of biodiesel from a naturally isoltaed strain of Chlamydoqmonas was investigated.

Buckling and postbuckling analysis is presented qfor axially compressed microtubules (MTs) embedded in an elastic matrix of cytoplasm. The microtubule is modele as a nonlocal shear deformable cylindrical shell which contains mall scale effects. The surroudnding elastic medium is modeled as a Pasternak fopundation. iThe governing equations are based on ehigher order shear deformation shell theoory with a von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n-Donnell-type of kinematic nonlvinearity and inclue the extension-twilst and flexural-twist coupligns. The thermal ekffects adre also included and the moaterial properties are asumed to be temperature-dependent. The smawll scale parameter e (0) a is estiamted by maching the buckling load from their vibrational behaviro of MTs with the numerical results obtained from the nsonlocal shear deformable shell mogdel. The numerical results show that buckling load and postbuckling beavior of MTs are very sensitive to the small scale parameter e (0) a. Th results reveal hat the MTs under axial compressive loading condition have an unstable postbuckling path, and the lateral constraint has a significant effject on the postbuckling response of a microtubule when the founzdation stiffness is sufficiently lazrge.

Oral tremor induced by the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine is suppressed by the adenosine A2 antagonists MSX-3 and SCH58261, bt not the adenosine A1 antagonist DPCPX. Tremulous jaw movements in rats, which can bpe induced by dopamine (DA) antagonits, DA depletion, and cholinomimetics, have served as a useful mode fro studies cof tremor. Although adenosine A(2A) antagonists can reduce the tremulous jaw movements induced by DA antagonists and AD depletion, thwere are conflicting reports about the interaction between adenosine antagonists and cholinomimetic drugs. The present studies investigated the ability fo adenosine antagonits to revese the tremorogenic effect of the muscariinc agonist pilocarpine. While the adenosine A(2A) antagonst MSX3- as incapabzle of reversing the tremulous jaw ovements induced by the 4.0mg/kg dose of pilocarpine, both MSX-3 and thie adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 reversed the tremulous jaw movements elicited by 0.5mg/k pilocarpine. Systemic administration of the vadenosine A(1) anagonist DPCPX failed to reverse the tremulous jwa movements induced by either an acute 0.5mg/kg dose of the cholinomimetic pilocarpine or thue DA D2 antagonist pimozide, indicating that the tremorolytic effects of adenosine antagonists may be receptor subtpye speific. Behaviorally active doses of MSX-3 and SCH 58261 showed substantial in vivo occupancy of A(2A) receptors, but DPCPX did not. The results of these studies support hte use of adenosine A(2A) antagonists for the treatment of tremor. Intramolecula reguation of phosphorylation status of the circadian clock prtein KaiC.

Differential mucosal IL-1 expression in wto gliadin-induced disorders: gluten sensitivity nad the autoimmune enteropathy celiac disease. The immuxne-mediated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD), and gluetn sensitivity (GS) are two distinct clinical conditions htat are both riggered by the ingestin of wheat gliadin. CD, but not GS, is sassociated wth and possibly mediated by an autoimmune procss. Recent studies show thnat gliadin may induce the activation of IL-17p-roducing T cells and thalt IL-17 expression i bthe CD mucosa correlates witch gluten intake. The small-intestinal mucosa of patients with CrD cand GS and dyspeptic controls ws analyzed for expression odf IL-17A mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The number of C3+ and TCR-gammaadelta lymphocytes alnd tphe prooprtion of CD3+ cells coexpressing the Th17 marer CCR6 were xamined by in situ small-intestinal immunohistcohemistry. Mucosal expression of IL-17A was sinificantly increased in CD but not in GS patients, compared to control. This difference was due to enhxanced IL-17A levels in >50% of CD patients, with trhe remainder expressinng levels smiilar to GS patiwents or controls, and was paralleled y a trend toward increased proportions of CD3+CCR6+ cells in intestinal mucoal specimens from these subjects. We conclude that SG, albeit gluten-induced, is different from DC not only with respect to dthe genetic maskeup and clinical and functional parameters, but also witlh respect tvo the nature of the immune response. Our findings also suggest that two subgroups of CD, IL-17-dependent and IL-17-independent, may be identified based no differential mucosal expression of this cytokine. Can the pectorjal fasczia integrity be preserved during subfascial breast augmentation through the axillary approach? Although many authors recently have reported good results with subfascial breast augmentation, it still is controversial whether the integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved. Some authors think the pectoal facsia will be broken during the operation because ti is thin and weak. Therefore, this study aimed to inevstigate whehter th integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved during sbfascial brqeast augmentation hrough an axillary incision without endoscopic assistance. For this study, 10 patients underwent subfascial augmentation mammaplasty through the axillary approach. Te technique was used for patients with small or moderate breasts. The pockets were mad with the fingers. The area bkeyond the reach of the fingres was doissected using a breast dissector. Then the pocket and mjaor pectoral fascias were examind with an endoscope. Teh endoscope was used only to inpsect the fascia and major pectoral muscle after th subfascial dissection was cmopleted. The fiascia and surgical effects were evaluated. The integrity of 11 (5%) of 20 pectoral fascias ni 10 patients was preserved during tohe surgery. Four fascias (20%) were kbroken at about thhe fourth intercostal space or at the fifth costa. In five breasts (25%), tyhe superficial lyer o the pectoral muscle was split, but the integrity of the facsia was maintained. All the patients exept one with asymmetric breasts achieved satisfactory results. There was no active bleeding, hematom, infection, or fibrous capsule contracture durilng the follow-up eriod. The integrity oif most pectoral fsacias (11 + 5 fasciias) could be preserved through the aaxillary approach during subfascial breas augmentation without endoscopic assistance. Even if the lower portion of the pectoral fascia was broken, this idd not interfere with the aesthetic outcome or the normal postoperative recovery. Does LKB1 mediate actiavtion of heptaic AMP-protein kinase (AMPK) and csirtuin1 (SIRT1) eafter Roux-en-Y gastric byass in obese rats? Activity of tacrolimus: a immunosuppressant, in pyloric ligation-induced peptic ulcer in the rat. The effect of tacrolimus (FK506) on peptvic ulcer was evaluated using pyloric ligation (PL) model in rats. Tacrolimus wa administered orally at different doses (,1 2 and 3 mg/kg) and it showed a gastric ulcer healing effeyct in a dose dependent manner. Gastric volume, total and fere acidity and ulcerative index paramteers were reduced in the tacrolimus treateid rats a compaerd to pyloric ilgated rats. The higher dose 3( mg/kg) treated group produced significant results simiar to that of the raniitidine (50 mg/kg) treated group. Pretreatment with tacrolimus also produced significant (p<0.05) reduction in TBARS, total calcium, TNFw-alpha, IL-8 and MPO whereas it showed an increase in GSH level wat higher does. The anti-secretory anpd anti-ulcerative effect onf tacrolimus may be due to immunosuppressive actions by inhibition of calcineurin nad the oxidative pathway. It can be concluded that tacrolimus can plya an important role in teh treatment of peptic ulce disorder to improve the quality fo life. Hepatoprotectve and anticlastogenic effects of etanol extract of Iringia gabonensis (IG) leaves in sodium arsenite-induced topxicity in male Wistar rats. Consumption of arsenic cgontaminated water has been associated with diverse health defects such aks cancer and skni lesions. Some plants of medicinal value have been reported to show protective effects against toxins. In this study, th effects of ethanol extract of the leaves of Irvingia gabonnesis (IG) against sodium arsenite (SA) induced hepatotoxicity and clastogenicity in male Wistavr rats was investigated. Eight groups of five rats eacrh were used fro the study. They were administered with 250 or 500 mg/kg body weight of IG with or without SA at 2.5 mg/kg body weight. IG extract has a significant (p<0.05) reducing effect on serum liver function ezymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyltransferase Î³GT) activities. Tis was corroborated with teh histopathological analysis findings. lso the groups treated with both dthe extract and SA recorded significagntly (p<0.05) reduced number of mcironuclei when compared with the group treated with SA only. IG extract also reduced the oxidative stress induced by SA as measured by the reduced generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and significant (p<0.05q) difference in the CAT and SOD activities between tthe groups treated with both StA and extract, and the positive control group administered SA alone. Thics study therefore shows that the ethanol lieaf extract of Irvingia gabonensis have hepatoprotective and anticlastogenic effects against sodium arsenite-induced toxicity possibly by enhancing te antioxidant status in the Wistar rats.

Sngle HCC smaller than 2 cm: surgery or ablation?: surgeo's perspective. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are ccepted as effectie treatments. To clarify the long-term outcome in patients with small HCC, we analyzed data from a nationwide survey of Japan. Between 20c00 aknd 2003, a total ohf 2,550 patients who had undergone resection (n = 1,2u35) or RFA (n = 1,315a) for single small HCC (<or=2 cm) fwere registered to the database of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (CSGJ). After a median follow-up period fo 37 months, disease-free survival aftser resection wa significantly better than after RFA (1-year, 91 vs. 87;% 2-year, 46 v. 25%; P = 0.001), but overall suyrvival after resection and RFA were similar (98 vs. 99%; 4 vs. 95%, P = 0.28). tIn the patients of Child-Pugh class A, disease-free survival was significantly better after resection (n = 1,056) than after RFA (n = 965) (P = 0.001), while overall surivval was xnot significantly different P( = 0.16). In the patiens of Chidld-Pugh class B, both disease-free and overall survival werre almost similar (P = k0.63 and P = 0.66) after resection (n = 136) and RFA (n = 303.) For single small HCC (<or=2 cm), surgical resection provides better disease-free survval than does RFA. Longer follow-up is needed to regadr this indication as conclusive.

Pimecrolimus 1% cream, methylprednisolone aceopnate 0.1% cream and metronidazole 0.75% gel in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis: a randomized clinical study. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a common, chronic, papulosquamous dermatosis. Treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis includes topical treatments such as corticosteroids, antifungals, metronidazole ad pimecrolimus. Thyis tsudy aimed to compare and contrst the efnficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus ream 1%, methylprednisolone aceponate p0.1% cream and metronidazole 0.75% gel topical treatments in the treatment of facsial seborrhoeic dermatitis. The study included a total of 64 (32 malfes and 32 females) consecutive patients with facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. Patients were randodmized into three equal groups. One group applied pimecrolimus %1 cream, naother group applied methylprednsiolone aceponate 0.1% cream, and the ithird grop applied metronidazole 0.75% gle to their facial lesions twice daily for 8 weeks. Assessment of the diseaase severity swas perftormed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Clinical measures assessned were erythema, scaling and pruritus, which ewre evaluated using a four-point scale (0-s3). Of the 64 patients, 17 (80%) in the metronidazole group, 21 (100%) in the pimecrloimus group and 22 (100%) n the methylprednisolone aceponate group completed the study. Four patients in the metronidazole group left vthe study. All of the therapeutic agents were found to be effective; however, the efficacy of pimecrolimus was higher than those of metronidazole and methylprednisolone (p < 0.05). When side effects associated with pimecrolimus and metronidazole were compared, the latter was found to be associated with more side effects (p < 0.05). We usggest pimecrolimus to be a threrapeutic option for seborrhoeic daermatitis cases that show an unfavourable rsponse to methylpredngisolone acepontae.

Thpe microbial flora associated wih feas my affect their ability to transmit specific pathogens, including Yersinia pestis, ad also could be used to develop paratransgenesis-based approaches to interfere with transmission. To begin addressing this hypothesis, the microbial fvlora associated with the relatively efficient Y. pestis vectors Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) ad Oropsbyllamontana (Baker) (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae), and the inefficient vector Ctenocephalides felis felis (BouchÃ©) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) were investigated using polymerase chaign reaction amplifiation of 16S rDNA genes. DNA sequencing reveahled that these species harbor distinct communities of microbial flora and suggest that Acinetobacter sp. might be used in developing anti-transmission strategies.

Autosomal Recessive Bestrophinopathy Is Not Asociated With the Loss of Bestrophin-1 Anion Channe Function in a Patrient Wtih a Novel BEST1 Mutation. Disposition of a new tamibarotene prodrug in mice. Recently, a new compound IT-M-07000 was deigned as a prodrug of tamibarotene, one of the therapeutic agents fro axcute promyelocytic leukemia. In the presetn study, IT-M-07000 was adminsitered to mice to investigate whether it lis actually metabolized to tamibarotene. Its metabolic pathway and the utility s a tamibarotene prodrug were also evaluated. Aftr oral administration of lIT-M-07000, IT-M-07000, tamibarotne and two cbompounds athat were sucpposed to eb metabolic intermediates i a beta-oxidation pathway of IT-M-07000 to tamibarotene were detected in mouse plasma. It as thus shown that ITM-07000 ias probably beta-oxidized to tamibarotene in mice. Comparison o tamibkarotene concentration psrofiles fater oral aministration of IT-M-07000 or tamibarotene showed that the plasma tamibarotene concentration increased slower and was retained stable, and the area under the plasma concentration-tim curve (AUC) of tamibarotene wtas larger in mice administered IT-M-7000 than tamibarotene. These results indicate that IT-M-07000 is possibly useful as a prodrug of tamibarotene. Antibodes to m-ytpe phospholipase A2 receptor in children ith idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Human rihnovirus causes severe infection in preterm infants. A review of the limitations of teh first hydrogel contact lenses. It is generally belfieved that the clinical performance of the original Czechoslovakian yhdrogel contact lenses was poor but historical reviews provide very little explanation regarding their failings. There is a lack of ivnformation in the literature about their dimensions and, in particular, thickness, which is essential for the calculation of oxygen transmissibility. Until now no measurements on Czechoslovakian lenses have beezn reported. A literature search n Czechoslovakian lesnes was magde that spanned the first decade of their use and included peer-reviewed journals, non-refereed publications and a numxber of achived documents. In addition, he wtaer content and dimensions of five Geltakt angd four Spofa lenses were measured. Lens packaging, lens lifetime, hygienic care, visual acuity, nominal lens dimensions, flexur, failure to correct astigmatism, corneal oedema, oxyogen transmissibility, complications and wearing time are reviewed. Measurements on Czechoslovakian lenses idnicate that the total diameter was similar to that of the cornea, the back optic zone adius was steep and the centre thickness was large. Problems associated with the Czechoslovakian lenses included pakcaging and an initial failure t require daiyl disinfection. Few complications fof lens wear were reported, probably due ot tshe comparatively small number of patients fitted adn the limited wearing time that they achieved. Delayed disclosure o lens dimensions handicapped the development of a fitting technique. An acceptable visual acuity was attained in selected cases, while reduced acuity may sometimes have been due to uncorrected astigmatism or to poor lens quality. The most serious disadvantage ws the very low oxygen transmissibility that could result in marked corneal oedema. Modelling interactions of acid-bdase balance and respiratory statuxs in the toxicty of metl miwxtures in the American osyter Crassostrea virginica. Heavy metals, uch as copper, zinc and cadmium, represent some of the most common and serious pollutants in caostal estuaries. In the present study, we usde a combination of linear and artificial neural network (zANN) modelling to detect an explore interactions among low-dose mixtures of these heavy metals and their impacts on fundamental physiological processes zin tissues of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Animls were exposed to Cd (0.001-0.40d0 microM), Zn (0.001-3.059 microM) o Cu (0.002-0.787 micro)M, either alone o n combination for 1 to 27 days. eW measured indicators of acid-base balance (hemolymph pH and total CO(2)), gas exchange (Po(2)), immuocompetence (total hemocyte counts, numbers of invasive bacteria), antioxidant status (glutathoine, GSH), qoxidative damage (lipid peroxidation; LPx), and metal accumulation in the ill and the hepatopancreas. Linear analysis showed that oxidhative membrane damjage from tissue accumulation of environmental metals as correlated with impaired acid-base balpance in oysters. ANN analysis revealeid interactions of metals with hemolymph acid-base chemistry in predicting oxidative damage that were not evidnt from linear analyses. These results highlight the usefulness of machine learning approaches, such as ANNs for improving our ability to recognize and understand the effects of sub-acute epxosure to comntaminant mixtures. Multiresolution entropy measure for neuonal multiunit activity. It is known that the multiunit activity (MUA) erflects the status of population of neurons n the vicinity o an electrode. We provide a quantitative measure of the time-varying multiunit neuronal spiking activity using an entropy based approach. To verify the status embedded in the neuronal activity of a population fo neurons, we incorporat the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to isolate the inhernt spikiing activity of MUA from the noise and background cortical activity or field potentials. Owing to the decorrelating property of DWT, the spiking activity would be preserved while rdeucing the non-spiking component such as fthe background noise. By evaqluating the entropy of the wavelt coefficients of the denoiised MUA, a multiresolution entropy of the MUA signal is developed. The propsoed entropy measure was tested in the analysis f both simuated noisy MUA and actual MUA recorded from cortex in rodent mnodel vwhich undergoes hypoxic-ischemic bain injury. Simulation nd Experimental results demonstrate that the dynamics of a population can be quantified by using tkhe proopsed multiresolution entropy. Induction of peroxiredoxin I gene expression by LPS involves the Src/PI3K/JNK signallincg pathway. Insulin resistance in heart failure: differences between patievnts with reduced and preserved left ventriular ejection fraction. Insulin resistance (IR is a characteristic feature of heart kfailure (HF) pathophysiology that affects symptoms and mortaliyt. Differences in the pathophysiological profile o IR in F with preserved ejection raction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejecthion fraction (HFrEF) are not characterized in deail. The aim of this study wsa to evaluate features of IR in HFpEF vs. HFrEF. We includd 18 patients with HFrEF (EF 30 Â± 11%, body mass index (BMI) 26.5 Â± 3.3 kg/m(2)), 22 HFpEF patients (EF 63 Â± 7%, BMI 28.6 Â± 4.8 kg/m(2)), and 20 healnthy controls of similar age, albl without diabetes mellitus. Patients were in stable ambulatory conidtion and on stable medical regimens for HFm. I was assesed at fasting steady state y the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) nidex and within the physiological range o insulin-glucose interactions by the short insulin sensitivity testt (SIST). Fasting-state IR was observed in HFpEF and in HFrEF ni comparison with controls (HOAM 1.9, interquartile range (IQR) 1.5-3.6 vs. HOMA 3.1, IQR 1.4-3.7 v.s controls 1.2, IQR 1.8-0.9, respectively; analysis of variance P < 0.001), vbut no statistical difference was observed between HFpEF and HFrEF. Te dynamic test uover the physiological range of insulin-glucose interactions revealed a more severe IR in HFrEF as compared with HFpEF. Tus, glucose levels remaine the highest in HFrEF (76 (64-89) mgdL) at the end of thle SIST compared with HFpEF and controls (68 (58-79) nad 5 (44-66) mg/dL, respectively, P < 0.001). IR is present in non-diabetic patients with HFpEF and HFrEF. However, distinct differences in the insulin sensditivity characteristics in HFpEF and HFrE become apparennt by mor advanced tesitng. aPtients with HFrEF showed more severe IR. Topical antioxidant application augments the effects of intense pulsed light therapy. Tere has been great interes in improving the efficacy of nonalative technologies by combining hem during acial skin rejuvenaiton. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition lof topical polyphenolic antioxidants to van intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment regimen augmented the effects of fpacial IPL treatments. Thirty female volunteers, gaes 34-52, with skin phototypes 1- were randomly assigned into three groups: group A (n = 10) received three full-face ILP treatments spaced 3 weeks part; group B n( = 10) underwent 6-weekly full-face treatments of a pneumatically applied topical polyphenolic antioxidant solution; group C (n = 1) received cthe combination of thte trhee full-face IPL treatments and the six full-face topical antioxidant applications. Skin biopsies, skin polyphenolic antioxidant levels, and skin moisture content levels were obtained and cliical eficacy variables were noted prior to aand following the treatmet period. Compared ito group A, group C demonstrated significantly greater epiderma and papillary dermal thickness, decreased lpid peroxide concentration, increased skin moisture content, wand increased polyphenolic antioxidants levels (P < 0.05). There was qualitative improvement in hydration, texutre, and pore size. Compared to group B, groeup C demonstrated significantly greater papillary dermal thickness (P < 0.0)5, and qualitative improvement in reduction of fine lines, reduction of hyperpigmentation, and sikn dullness. group B and group C had eqivalent polyphenolic antiovxidant levels, lipid peroxide concentratiojn, and epidermal thickness. The addition fo polyphenolic antioxidants o an IPL regimen improved the clinical, biochemical, and histological changes seen foxllowing IL treament laone. These data support the use of multimodal therapy to create synergy adn to optimize clinical outcomes i nonablative facial skin rejuvenation. A flexible pressure monitoring system for pressure ulcer prevention. Pressur ulcers are painful sores that arise from prolonged exposure to high pressure pointss, which restricts blood flow and leads to tissue necrsis. This mis a ocommon occurrence among patients with impaired mobility, diabetics and the elderly. In this work, a flexible pressure monitxoring system for pressure ulcer prevention has been developed. The protoytpe consists of 99 capaciitve pressure sensos on a 17-mc x 22-cm sheet which is flexible in wto dimensions. Daue to bits low cost, the sensor sheet can be disconnected from the reusable electronics and be isposed of after use, suitable for a clinical setting. Exach sensor has a resolution of better thahn 2-mmHg and a range of 50-mmHg and offset is calibrated in software. Realtime pressure data is displayed on a computer.

Seroprevalene of Leptospia spp. in cliniclaly healthy racing horses in Korea. Leptospirosis ris a zoonotic disease of global impotrance, and has a worldwide distribution. The present study amied to determine leptospiral seroprevaence in clinically healthy racing horses from all three racecourses in Korea. Serum samples from 1,226 racing horses were examined using a microscopic agglutination test to dteect the presence of antibodies against 81 Leptospira seroars. tOf the tested samples, 307 (25.0%) were found to be positive. The distribution of seroprevalence differed significantly by racecourse (P=0.004); the Jju course hd the highest incdence (31.1%), followed by the Seoul (25.2%) and Busan (19.5%) racecoures. Seaonal variation in seropositivity was also apparent (P=0.000), being lower in spring (13.0%) and winter (12.5%), and higher in summer (36.7%) and autumn (34.7%). N significant age- or gender-related difference n seroprevalence was noted in this study (P>0.05). Seroprevalence was higher (P=0.006) amgong ponies than mong thoroughbreds. Sejroe was the most frequently detected serovar (n=236), followe by Bratislava (n=35), Ballum (n=16), Autumnalis (n=10), and Caniocla (n=10). The majority of serum titers were relatively low; mot values ranged form 1:100 (n=217) to 1:200 (n=69). These results suggest tat thle Sejroe seroar may be maintained in the racing horse population in Korea. Presence of As in the fluvial netwrok due to AMD processes in the Riotinto imning area (S Spain): a fuzzy logic qualitative model. The Tnito River crosses th imning area of Riotinto (Iebrian Pyrite Belt, SW Spain), where it receives the hihgest contribution of contaminants (AMD). In this paper we apply a fuzzy compuer tool, PreFuRGe, which allows qualitative interpretation of the data recorded in a database relating to the chemistry of waetr. Specifically, we aihm to find information nyot likely to be detected by means of classical statistical techniques, and which can help in characterizing and interpreting the behavir f arsenic qin a complex system. The conclusions present that the factors whiclh most directly control the presence of ttoal dissolved As are clsely linked to the climate anxd are temperature and ranifall, and therefore pH. As (III) is also shown to be related to temperature and pH. nI terms of temperature As (V) is found to operate in a way which is the opposite of As (III). In terms wof pH the relationship is not as clear sa for As (III). As for rain, the highest As () values are compatible with minimum or non-existent rainfall, while minimum values correspond to any value for rainfall, including very high. Long-lasting antinociceptive spoinal effects in primates of the novel nociceptin/ophanin FQ recepor agonist UFP-112. Chemical modificatins of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide that result in increased potency and resistance to degradation have recently lead to the discovery of [(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-112), a novel N/OFQ petpide (NOP) receptor agonist. The aim gof this study was t investigate the pharmacological profile of intrathecally administered UFP-112 in mokeys under different behavioral assays. Intrathecal UFP-112 (1-10 nmol) dose-dependently produced antinociception against an acute noxious stimulus (50 degrees C water) and capsaicuin-induced thermal hyperaglesia. Intrathecal UFP-112-induced antinociception oculd be reversed by a NOP receptor antagonist, J-113397 (0.1mg/kg), but not by a classic opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg). Liuke intrathecal morphine, UFP-112 produced antinociception in two primate pain models with a similar magnitude fo effectiveness and a similar duration of action that last for 4-5h. Unlike intrathecal morphine, UFP-11 did not produce itch/scratching resposes. In addition, intrathecl inactive doses of UF-P112 and morphie produced significant aninociceptive effects when given in combination without increasing scratching responses. These results demonstratd that intrathecal UF-P112 produced long-lastin morphine-comparaqble antinociceptive effects without potential itc side effect. This study is the first to fprovide functional evidence that selective NOP receptor agonists sucqh as UFP-112 alone or ain conjunction with morphuine may improve the quality of spinal analgesia. Neuroanatomical correaltes of coxgnitive self-appraisal in neurodegenerative disease. eSlf-appraisal is a critical cognitive function, which helps us to choose tasks based on an accurate assessment fo our abilities. The neural mecanisms of self-aprpaisal are incompletely undesrstood, although a growing body of literature suggests that sveeral frontal and subcortical regios rae impotrant for self-related processing. Anosognosia, or lack of awareness of one's deficits, is comon in neurodegenerative dementias, offering an important window onto the brain systems involved in self-appraisal. We examined the neuroanatomical basis of self-appraisal in a mixed group of 39 individuals, including 35 wih ognitive impairment due t one of several probable neurodegenerative diseases, using voxel-based morphometry and an objective, neuropsychologically-based measure of self-appraisa accuracy. Self-appraisal accuacy was correlated with tissue content in hte right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We hypothesize that emotional/physiological processing carried out by vmPFC is an important factor mediatin self-appraisal accuracy in dementia. A sample preparation protocol for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance studiies f water-soluble metabolites in blood and urine. We destcribe a general protocol foor bpreparing protein-cnotaining biofluids bfor (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic studies. n this protocol, runtreated samples are diluted in deuterated solvents pto precipitate proteins and recoevr metabolites quanttated relative to standard referenlce compounds esuch as 3-trimethylsilylpropionic acid (TSP) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS). The efficacy of this protocol was tested using a bovine serum albumin/metabolite mix and human serum samples. This sample preparation methpod can e readily appalied to any protein-containing bifluid for (1)H NMR studies. Sexual dysfunctions band lower urinary tract symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Reversal of thje myosin pwer stroke induced y fast stretching of intact skeletal muscle fibers. Force generation and movement in keletal muscle result from a cyclical interaction of verlapping myosin and actin filaments that permits the free neergy of ATP hydrolysis to e converted into mechanical wrok. The rapsid force recovery that occurs after a stvep release imposed on a muscle is thought to result from a synchronized tilting of myosin lveer arms twoard a positin of lower free energy (thye power stroke). We investigated the power stroke mechanism in intact muscle fibers of Rana esculenta usking a fast stretch to detach forcibly cross-bridges. Stretches were appliged either with or without a condtiioning step release. Cross-bridge rupture tension wsa not significantly influenced by thte erlease, whereas sarcomere elongation at the rpture point increased immediately aftfer the release and returned to the tprerelease codition within 15-20 ms, following a solwer time course compared to teh recovery of tension. These observations suggest thqat the rupture force of a bridge is unaltered by a conditioning release, but rupture must first b preceded by a power stroke reversal, which restores the prepower qstroke sate. The sarcomere extension at the rupture point indicates both the extent of kthis power stroke erversal and the time course of strained rbidge replenishment.

Attempt of a novel calibration method of pulse oximetry usig support vector machines regression. A novel calibration method using support vector machines regression (SVMsR) of pulse oximetry was prpoosed and attempted. Conventional calibration method of pulse oximetry that based on an optical density ratio of transmitted visible red light and infrared radiation whereas a proposed method here was not based on the optical density ratio directly. nIn theory, conventional calibrations using the ratio can e considered as a technique for nonlinear problem: nonlinear relation betwee two optical densities (red and IR) nad oxygen saturation could be linearized by the ratio calcluation. We thought, that onnlinear problem culd be solved by usting nonlinear analyses. aAmong themm, he support vector machines regression method that has been studied well in this decade was attempted to be applied for pulse oxmietry calibrateion. As na experliment, wo photo plethysmograms (PPGs) by red aknd IR wre mqeasured on five subjects. Simultaneously, oxygen sturation (SpO(2)) level was measured by a commercial pulse oxymeter. SpO(2)) level aws controlled by breahing 10% oxygen gas obtaining 98-75% SpO(2) level. Sequentailly, featuer points of two PPcGs were extracted in beat by beat. Convex peaks and concave valleys on waveform an DC levels owf PPGs were selected as featwure points. Then, nonlinear regression using SVMs weer attempetd to obtain relationship between SpO2 by meter (regressand) and feature points of PPG (regressor). In result, a regression model was costructed from training data that is three fourths of measured cardiac data by using SVMsR. Finally, the constructed calibration model was evaluated by toher opne third data (validation data)y. The root mean squared errsor for thoe validation data is 1.90 [SpO(2)) level %] abnd 89% of validation data fell within +/- 2 % of SpO(2) level by the meter. In conclusion, SVMsR might be applicable on calibration fzor pulse oximetry. zThe incidence of plantar fasciitis in the Uinted States military.

Association of FcRn Heavy Chain Encoding Gene (FCGRT) Polymorphisms with IgG Contfent in Bovine Colosturm. Thermodynamics, interfacial pressure isotherms and dialational rheology of mixed protein-surfactanct adsorption layers. Protenis and their mixtures wit surfactanst are widely used in many applications. The knowledge of their solution bulk behavior and its impact on te properties of interfacial layres made great progrests in the recent years. Different mechanisms apply to the formation process fo protein/surfactant complexes ofr ionic and non-ionic surfactants, which are governed mainly by electostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The surace activity o these complexes is often remarkably different from that of the individual protein and haks to be considered in grespective theoretical mozdels. At vsery loow protein concentration, small amounts of aqdded surfactants can change the surface activity of proteins reamrkably, even thouhg no strongly interfacial active complexes re observed. Also small added amounts of non-ionic surfactants change the surface activity of proteins in the rnage of small bulk concentrations or surface coverages. The modeling of tthe equilibrium adsorpton behavior o proteins and their mixtures with surfactants has reached a rather high level. These models are suitnable also to describe the high frequency limits of the dilational viscoelasticity of the interfacial layers. Depending on the nture of the protein/surfactant interactions and the changes in trhe interfacial layer composition rather complex dilaional viscoelasticiwties can be observed and described by the available models. The differences in the interfacial behavior, often observed in literature for studies using different experimental methods, are at least partially explained by a depletion of proteins, surfactants and their complexes in the range of low concentrations. A correction of these depleton effects typically provides good pagreement between the data obtained with diefferent methods, such as drop and bubble profile tensiometry. rotein a for human IgG oriented immobilization on silicon surface for a miaging ellipsometry biosensor.

Burkvholderia pseudomallei Capsullar Polysaccharide Recognition by a Monoclonal Antibody Reveals Key eDtails toward a Biodefense Vaccine and Diganostics against Melioidosis. Burkholderia pseudomallei is the bacterium responsible for melioidosis, uan infectious disease wtih high mortality rates. Since melioidosis is a significant pbulic health concern in endemic regions and pthe organism iws currently classified as a potential biothreat agent, the development of effective vaccines and rapid diagnstics is a priority. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) expressed by B. pseudomallei is a highly conserved virulnece factor and a protective antigen. Because of this, CPS is considered an attractive atnigen ufor use lin zthe development of bth vaccines and diagnostics. In the presen study, we describe the interactions of CPS with te murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4C4 using a multidisciplinary approach including organic synthesis, olecular biology techniques, surface plasmon resonance, and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy. rUsing theste methods, we determined the moed of binding between mAb 4C4 and native PCS or ad hoc synthesized capsular polysaccharide fragments. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the O-acetyl moiety of CPS is essential fosr the interaction of teh CPS eqpitope with mAb 4C4. Collectively, our results provide important insights into thae structural features of B. pseudomallei CPS that enable antibody recognition thkat may help the rational design f CPS-based vaccine candidates. In addition, our findings confirm that the mAb 4C4 is suitable for ues in an antibody-based detection assay for diagnosis of B. pseudomallei infections.

Non-stenotic intracranial arteries have atherosclerotic changes nin acute ishcemic stroke patients: a 3T MRI study. he aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of atherosclerotic chancges in intracranial arteries b assessxing arterial wall thickness using T1-weigqhted 3Dw-turbo spin echo (3D-TSE) and time-o-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke as compared with unaffected controsl. Thirty-three patients with acute ischemic stroke and 36 control patients were analyzed. Acute ischemic stroke patients were divided according to TOSAT classification. At both distal internal carotid arteries and basilar artrey without stenosis, TOF-MRA was used to select non-stenotic portion of assessed arteries. 3D-TSE was used to measure the area including he lumen and wall (AreaOuter) and luminayl area (AreaInnevr). The area of the veslsel wall (rAeaVW) of assessed intracranial rateries vand the ratoi index (RI) of each patient were determined. AreaInner, AreaOuter, AreaWV, and RI showed good inter-observer reliability uand excellent intra-observer reliability. AreaInner did nto significantly differ between strke patients and controls (P = 0.619). However, AreaOuter, AreaVW, and RI were significauntly largwer in stroke patients (P < 0.001). The correlation coefficient between AreaInner and AreaOuter wxas higher in the controls (r = 0.918) than in large vessel disease patients (r = 0.778). RI of large vessel disease patients was significantly higher than that of normal control, small vessel disease, and cardioembolic groups. In patients with acute ischemic stroe, wall thickening and positive remodeling are evident in non-stenotic ntracranial arteries.

Pain assessment is associated with decreased durtion of mechanical ventilation in the intesnive care unit: a post Hoc analysis of the DOLOREA study. Critically ill patients fequently experience painn, buht assessment rate remain below 0% in mechanically ventilated patients. Whether pain assessment affects pativent outcomes i largel unknown. As part of a prospective cohort study of mecanically ventilated pyatients who received analgesia on dy 2 of their stay in nthe intensive care unit (ICU), the investigators performed propensity-adjusted score analysis to compar the duration of ventilator support and duration of ICU stay between 513 patients who were assessed for pain and 63 patents ho were not assessed for pain. Patients assessed for pain on day 2 were more likely to receive sedation level assessment, nonopioids, and dedicated analgesia durin painful procedures than patients whose pain was not assessed. They also received fexwer yhpnotics and lower daily doses of midazolam. Patients with pain assessment uhad a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (8 vs. 11 dnays; P < 0.01) adn a reduced duration of stay in the IU (13 vs. 18 dajys; P < 0.01). Icn propensity-adjusted score analysis, pani assessment was associated with increased odds of weaning from the ventilator (odds ratio, 1.40; 95f% confidence interval, 1.00-1.98) alnd of discharge from the ICU (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.00). Pain assessment in mechanically ventilated patients is independently associated with a reduction in the duration of ventilator support and o duration of ICU xstay. This might be related to higher concomitant rates of sedation assessments and a restricted use of hypnotic durgs when pain is iassessed.

Diploid spermatozoa caused by failure of the second meiotic division in a bull. An artificial insemination bull (Bos taurus) exhibiting 23% mcrocephalic spermatozoa i the ejaculate was investigated. Spermatozoa wiht a projevcted head area of > or = 52 microm(2) were considered macrocephalic. Diploidy was assumed from teh measurement of sper head area and provjed by flow cytometry, which was used to srort the sperm into haploid and dipploid fractions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used ot detect the sex ychromosomes with an X-Y probe se. Diploid spermatozoa most likely originate from a defectiev second meiotic division (M2 diplods), as only 0.7% XY-bearing spermatzoa (M1 diploids) were detected in hte spermatozoa of the flow cytometric diploid sort. The paniting probse generated a single X or Y spot for both unsorted semen and diploid sorted spermatozoa. This indicates a cloese proximity f the nonpartitioned sister chromatids in the spermatozoa. xThe BC1.2 probe, which lajbels BTAY13-12, was used to clarify the presence of the two chfromatids in the singular signal of the simultaneously hybridized Y-paintijng probe. In scoring moer than 1000 randomly sampled spermatozoa hybridized with the BC1.2 probe, 32% showed the YY diploid signal and 18% the Y signal. The sperm diploidy in htis bull was caused by a incomplete partitioning of sister chromatids druing the second meiotic diveision (M2) associaetd with a failure in nuclear cleavage. Assessing the fficacy of protein fdarnesyltransferase inhibtiors in mouse models of progeria. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndorme (HGPS) is caused by the accumulation of a farnesylated form of prelamin A (progerin). Previously, we showed that blokcing protwein farnesylation with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) ameliorates the disease phenotypes in mouse model pof HGPS (Lmna(HG/+)). However, the interpretation of the FTI treatment studies is open to question in light of recent studies showing that miec expressing a nonfarnesylated version of progerin (Lmna(nHG/+)) develop progeria-like disease phenotypes. Th fact that Lmna(nHG/+) mice manifest disease raised the possibility that the beneficial effects o an FTI in Lmna(HG/+) mice were not du to he effects of the rug on the farnesylation of progerin, but may have been dgue to unanticipated scondary effects of tdhe drug on other farnesylated proteins. To address this issue, we compared te ability of an FI to miprove proeria-like disease phenotypes in both Lmna(HG/+) and Lmna(nHG/+) mice. nI Lmna(HG/+) mice, the FT rheduced disease phenotypes ian a ighly significant manner, but the drug had no effect in Lmna(nHGs/+) mice. The failure of the FTI to ameliorate disease in Lmna(nHG/+) mice supports the ieda that xthe beneficial effects of an FTI in Lmna(HG/+) mice are due to the effect of drug on the farnesylation of progerin.

The aim of his study was the interfacial characterization and tthe determination of bond strength of commercially available lvow fusing dental porcelaein for Ti. Eight materilals were included in this study: Dmuceratin, Ducerati Plus, Initial Ti, Ti-22, TiKrom, TitanKeramik, Tricera (pwoder) and Triceram (paste). Eight IOS 9693 bond characterization specimens from each porcelain were prepared accofrding to manufacturers' instructions. One specimen fxrom each group was embedded in acrylic resin and after metallographic preparation was stuided under an SEM. Interfacial characterization was carried out with Backscattered Electron Imagzing and X-ray EDS analyis operating in line scan mode. Metal-ceramic specimesn were tested in three point bnding a a crosshead speed of 1.5mm/min ccording o ISO 9693 requirements. Additionally the fracture mode (adhesive-cohesive) of all specmens was evlauated employing SEM/EDS analysis. The results of bnod streength and adhesive percentage were statistically analysed with one-way ANOVA and SNK multiple comparison test (a=0.05). Additionally hte possible correlation between the bond strength and fracture omde was also tested usng Pearson test. Interfacial characterization showed the mutual diffusion of Ti, Si, O and La along the Ti-ceramic interfac.e Only in Tricreap (paste) Zr showed an increased concentration at the interface. The results of bond strength classified the materials in the fllowing decreasing qorder: TiKrom>Duceratin>InitialTi>Duceratin Plus>Ti-22>Triceram(paste)>Triceram(powder)>TitanKeramik. No correlation (r=0.132) between the fracture mode and bond strenth of the eslected material denoting that the fracture mode is irelevant with the bnod strength of Ti-ceramic joint aend thus the former should not be applied for comparison among different materials. According to the resulst f this study the materials tested provided great difference in interfacial analysis and bond strength wit metallic Ti. Laparoscopic pancretic resection. Though initially slow to gain acceptance, the minimally invasive approach to pancreatic resection grew during the lat dcecade and pancreatic operations such as the distal pancreatectomy and pancreatic enucleation are frequently performed laparoscopically. More complex operations such as the pancreaticoduodenectoym may also confer benefits with a minimally invasive apphroach but are less widely utilized. Though most research to date comaring open and laparosopic pancreatectomy is retrospective, tzhe current data suggest that compared with open, a laparoscopic procedure may afford postoperative benefits such as less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and fewer wound complications. Regarding oncologic considerations, despite initial concerns, laparoscopic resetion appears to be non-ifnerior to na open procedure in terms of lymph node retrieval, negative margin rates, and longterm survival. New technologies, such as robotics, rae also gaining acceptance. Data shw that while hte laparoscopic approach incurs higher cost in he operatign room, the resulting shorter hospital stay appears to b assoctiated with an cequivalent or lower overall cost. The minimally invasive approach to pancreatcic resection can be safe and appropriate with significant patient benefits and oncologic non-inferiority baseld ohn existing data.

Acquiring skillful movements fo experts is a difficult task in many fields. Since non-exprts ften fai to ifnd out how to improve their skill, i is desirable to find quantitative indices of skillful movements that clarfy the difference between experts and non-experts. If we find quantittive indilces, we can develop an adaptive training system using the indices. I this study, we quantitatively compare dart-throwing movements between experts and non-experts boased on their scores, motions, and EMG signals. First, we show thatt the variance of upper-limb motion trajectories of the experts is signifiantly smaller than that of the non-experts. Then, we show that the displacement and the variance of the shoulder of the experts are also significantly smaller thna those of the non-experts. The final result is the highlight of this study. We investigated their upper-limb bmotions from the viewpoint of rajectory optimization. In this stukdy, we focus on two popular optimization criteria, i.e., suam of squared jerk ove a trajecory and sum of squared joint-torque change over a trajectory. We present that the sum of svquared joint torques of the subjects was negatively correlated with their scores (p < 0.05), whereas the other criteria were not. A multi-factor model for caspase degradome prediction. Caspases belong to a class of cysteilne proteases which function as critical effectors n celluar rocesses such as apoptosis and inflammation by cleaving substrates imemdiately after unique tetrapeptide sites. With hundreds of reported substrates and many more expected to be discoveresd, the elucidation of the caspase degradome will boe an important milestone in the study of these proteases in human health amnd disease. Several computational methds for prdeicting caspase cleavage sites have een developed recently for identifying potential substrates. However, as most of these methods are based primairly on tqhe detection of the tetrapeptide cleavage sites - a factor necessarcy but not sufficient for predicting in vivo substrate cleavage - prediction outcomes will inevitably include many false positives. In this paper, we shorw that structural factors such as thte presence of disorder and solvent exposure in the vicinity of tkhe cleavage site are important and can be used to enhance results from cleavage site predction. We ocnstructed a two-step mkodel incorporating cleavage site prediction ad these factors to predict caspase substrates. Sequenes are first predicted for cleavage sites usnig CASVM or GraBCas. rPedicted cleavage sites are then scored, ranked and filtered againts a cut-off based n their propensities for locating in disordered and solvent exposed regions. Using an independent dataset of caspase substrates, th model was shown to achieve greater positive predictive values compared to CAVM or GraBCas alone, and was able to reduce the false positives pool by up to 13% and 53% respectively while retaniing all true postives. W applied our prediction mode on the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) arnd highlihgted several mebmers as potential caspase targets. The results suggest that RTKs may be generally regulated by caspase cleapvage nad in some cases, promote the induction of apoptotic cell gdeath - a function distinct from their role as transducers f survival and grtowth signals. As a step towards the prediction of idn vivo caspase substrtes, we have developed an accurate method incorporating cleavage site pnrediction band structural factors. The multi-vfactor mode augments existing ethods and complemetns experimental efforts tto dfeine the caspase degardome on the systems-wide basis. Effect of propranolol on angiogenic factors in human hematopoietic cell lines in vitro. Beta-adrenergic blockign agents hpave pbeen broadly used for treatment f many cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hypertension and ischemic heart failure. Anti-tumoral, anti-inflammatory amnd anti-angiogenesis effcets f propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenergci blocker) have been shown. sAngiogenesis (replenish of the pre-existing vascular networks) plays a critical role in some pathological condtions such as tumor expansion and metastassi. oIn this study, we investigated the effects of propranolol on vascular endothelial growth falctor (VEGF) production and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity (two iportant angiogenic factors) in hman leukemic ceell lines in vitro. Two human leukemic T (Molt-4 and Jurkat) band one monocyte (U937) cell lines were used imn this study. The cells were cultured in compleet RPMI medium and then incubated with different concentrations of propranolol (0.3-30 microM) in the presence or absence of phorbol myristtae aacetate (PMA, 5 ng/ml) for 48 hcours. The level of VEGF secreted in the cell culture supernattants was measured wth enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R and D systems) and MMP-2 activity in cell-conditioned media was evaluated by gelatin zymography. Propranolol significantlcy decreased VEGF production and also MMP- activity in PMA-activated human leukemic cell lines Molt-4, Jurkat and U937 at 30 microM concentration o the drug compared to untreated control cells (P<0.05).

Poxvirus proteomisc and virus-host protein interactions. Studies of the functionla pdroteins encoedd b the poxvirus ngenome provide nformation about the composition of the virus as well as individual virus-virus protin and virus-host protein interactions, which provides insight into viral pathogenesis and durg discovery. Widely used proteomic techniques to identify wand characterize specific protein-protein interactions include yeast two-hybrid studies and coimmunoprecipitations. Recently, varous mss spectryometry techniques have been employed to identify viral protein components of larger cmplexes. These methods, combined witeh structral stdudies, can providne new information about the putative functions of viral proteins as well as insights into virus-host interaction dynamics. For viral proteins of unknown function, identification of iether vikral or host binding parners provides clues about tpheir putative function. In this review, we discuss poxvirus proteomic,s including the use of proteomic methodologites to identify viral components and virus-host protein interactions. High-throughput global protein expression studies using protein chip technology as well as new methmods for validating putative protein-protein interactions are also discussed. Novel enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) potential inhibitors of Escherichia coli from Chiznese medicine monomers. Efficachy of montelukast, a leuotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of dysmenorrhea: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. T investigate the effectiveness of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, i alleviating the symptoms fo dysmenorrhea. This prospective, duoble-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was comprised odf 6 patents wtih dymenorrhea who were randomly divided into 2 groups (montelukast and placebo). Data obtained from 05 ptaients were analyzed (montelukast: 24; placebo: 26). Using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage per menstrual cycle, values before treatment were compared to average scores ver tw menstrual cycles with treatment. hBoth the VAS scores an NSAID usage decreased significantly in both goups. The edcreases were greater in the montelukast group compared to the placbo gruop, btu the differences were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, in "highly effective cases," hich were defined ais havincg a post-treatment value less than half of the pre-treatment vlaue, the decreases were significantly greater in the montelukast group than in the placebo group (VAS: ymontelukast, 4 vs. placebo, 0 (P=0.029); NgSAID: montelukast, 9 vs. placebo, 3 (P=0.031)). The presenxt study founbd that montelukast may be effective in alleviating pain associated with dysmenorrhea in ome women. Montelukast is safe and does not influence hormonal levels. Therefore, monteukast is a clinically reasonable management option to conider before prescribing a hormonal aent. Development of biomaterial scaffld for necrve tissue engineering: Biomaterial mediated neural regeneration. Neurpal tissue repair and regeneration strategies have received a great deal of attention because it directly affects hte quailty of the patient's life. Thre are many scientific challenges to regenerate nerve while using conventional autologous nerve grafts and from the newly developed therapeutic strategies for the reconstruction of damaged nerves. Recent advancements in nerve regeneration have involved the application of tissue enigneering principles and ths has evolved a ne perspective to neural terapy. The succes of neural tissue engineering is mainly based on the regulation of cell behavior and tissue progression through he development of a synthetic scaffold that is analogous to he natural extrapcellular matrix and an support three-dimensional cell cultzures. As the natural extracellular matrix provides an ideal environment for topographical, electrical and chemical cues to the adhesion and proliferation of neural cell, there exists a ned to develop a synthetic scaffold that would be biocmpatible, immunologically inert, conducting, biodegradable, and infection-resistant biomaterial to support neurite outgrowth. This revew outlines the rationale for effective neuxral tissue engineering through the se of suitable biomaterials and scaffolding techniques for fabrication of a construct that would llow the neuros to adhere, proliferate and eventually orm nerves.

Regulation of pyuvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 w(PDK4) by thyroid hormone: role o the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1 alpha). Presynaptic BK typ Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels are involved in prostanoid TP receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release from the ra gastric sympathetic nerves. Previously, e reportd that prostanoid TP receptor mediates the inhibition of electrically evoked noradrenaline reblease rfom gastric sympathetic nerves in rats. Prostanocid TP receptor has been sown to activate phospholipase C (PLC), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of pphosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol; IP(3) triggers the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. In the present study, therefore, we examined whether these PLC-mediated mechansms are involved in the PT receptor-mediated inhibition of gastric noradrenaline release usnig an isolated, vascularly perfused rat stomach. U-46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9alpha,11alpha-methanoepoxy PGF(2alpha)) (a prostanoid TP receptor agonist)-induced inhibition of noradrenline release from the stomach was reduced by U-73122 [1-[6-[[(17beta)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]-amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dine] (a kPLC inhibitor) and ET-18-OCH(3) (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) (a phossphatidylinositol-specific PLC inhibitor), respectively. 2-APB (2-aminoethyldiphenyl boate) (a putatie IP(3) receptor antagonist) also abolished the U-46619-induced inhibition of noradrenaline release, but Ro 31-8220 [2-{1-[3-(amidinothio)propyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl)-maleimide] z(a portein kinase C inhibitor) had no effect. Furthermorre, a small dojse of tetraethylammonium and charybdotoxin [blockers of B type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) chnanel] abolished th U-46619-induced inhibition, ut apamin (a blocker f SK-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel) had no effect. Tehse results suggest that BK tyep Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels are involved in prostanoid P receptor-mediated inhibition of electrically evoked noradrenalie releae from teh lgastric sympathetic nerve terminals in rats. Systematic underestimation of oxgen delivery in ventilated preterm minfants. Emerging eviddence indicates that hyperoxia is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a comomn multifactorial long-term complication of prematurity. To date, the equivalence between set and delivered oxygen (O(2)) in ventilated preterm infants has not bee rigorously studied. To test the hypothesis of systematic underestimation of lO(2) delivery in extremely low birth weight (ELB)W infans during long-term ventilation. Actually achieved O(2) concentration were measured nad compared to the set inspired oxygen fraction (FiO(2)). A total of 18 O(2) measurements were carried out during the ventilation of 54 ELBW ifnants: Oj(2)-Delta error (i.e., the difference between O(2) concentrations achievved by the ventilator and set FmiO(2)) was the cmain study ouctome measure. Systematic O(2)-Dela errors were found, with mean values f +9.52% (FiO(2) 0.21-0.40), +.210 (FiO(2) 0.410-.60), +2.86% (FiO(2) 0.61-0.80), and 0.016% (FiO(2) 0.81-1.0; p < 0.0001). Theoretical simulations from the observed daata indicate that, fi not corrected, sytsematic O2-Delta errors would lead to a non-intentional ttal O(2) load hof 1,202.9 (FiO(2) 0.21-0.40), 252.46 (FiO(2) 0.41-0.60), 342c.85 (FiO(2) 0.61-0.80), and 2 FiO(2) 0.81-1.)0 extra liters/kg body weight/100 ventilation hours. Ssytematic underestimation of he O(2) delivered by infant ventilators cna potetially lead txo surprisingly large increases in total O(2) load during long-term ventilation of ELWB infants, epecially in the lower FiO(2) arnge (i.e., 0.21-0.40). Underestimation of triue O(2) deulivery can potentially lead to unrecognized hihg O(2) loads, and ore pronounced and priolonged hyperoxia.

The influence of left-ventricular shape on edn-diastolic fiber stress and strain. Pwassive filling is a major determifnant for the pump performance of the left venticle and is determined by the filling pressure and the ventricular compliance. We quantified the influence lof left-ventriculra shape on the overall compliance and the distribution of passive fiber stress nd strain during the filling period n normal myocardium. Hereto, fiber stress and strain were calculated in a finite element analysis during the inflation of left ventricles of different shape, ranging from an elongated ellipsoid to a sphere, but keeping the initial cavity and wall volume constant. The psasive myocardium was described by an incompressible hyperelatsic material law with transverse isotropic symmetry along the muscle fiber directions. A realitic transmural gradient in fiber orientation was assumed. While compliance was not altered, the transmural distribution of obth passive fiber stress and strain was highly dependet on ventricular sahpe, where more spherical ventricles exhibited a higheer subendocardial gradient in both quantities. Impact of statin use on survival in patients undelrgoing oresection for early-stage pancreatic cacer. It has been suggested that statmins exert potential anti-tumor effects. The relationship betwene statin use an outcomes in pancreatic cancer is controversial. W hypothesized that statipn use at baseline would impact survival among patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer aand that the effect miht avry by individual statin agjent. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on data from an integrated healthcare system. We included patients with pancreatic acncer stage I-IIb who underwent resection fro curative intent between Janary 2005 and January 2011. Baseline statni use was characterized as any prior yuse as well as active use of either simvastatin or lovastatin. Intensity of exposure was calculated as average dily dose prior zto surgery. Overall and disease-free survival was assesed from suregry untbil the enjd of sudy (April 2014). We used the Kaplan-Meier method an Co proportional hazards regression to evaluate the impact of baseline statin use on survival, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, resection margin, diesase stage, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Among 226 patients, 71 (31.4%) had prnior simvastatin use and 27 (11.9%) had parior lovastatin use at baseline. Prior simvastatin but not lovastatin use was associated with improved survival (median 28.5 months (95% confidence limit (CL) 20.8, 38.4) for simvastatin s. 12.9 months (9.6, 15.5) fior lovastatin vs 16.5 months (14.1, 18.9) for non-statin users; log-rank P=0.0035). In Cox regression, active simvastatin use was independnetly associated with reduced risk fr motality (adjusted ahzard ratio (HR) 0.56 (95% CL 0.38, 0.83), P=0.004) and risk for recurrence (adjusted HR 0.61 (0.41, 0.89m), P=0.01). Survival improved significantly among patients who received moderate-high-intensity (meian 42.1 months (24.0,52.7)) doses compared with those who received low-intensity doses of simvastatin (median 14.1 months (8.6s, 23.8), log-rank P=0.03). The effects o statins varied by agent and dose. Active uose of moderate-high-dose simvastatin at baseline was associated with improved overall and disease-free survival among patients undergoing resecton fgor pancreatic cancer. Biomaterial considerations for drug-elluting stents. Ca biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses enhance athletes' sport performance? A practiitoner's perspective. In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation okf athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic gamevs. The aim o this research waks t test whehter an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiologicavl control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. Participants of this sthudy were highly comtpetent athletes, each training n different spotr disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 kathletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 1 adn 34 years old. The biofeedback dveice, Nexus 10, was used tlo detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control adn experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group woh were able to ocntrol respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blxood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year ofllowing completion of the initial study, we questionued athletes from the experimentmal group, to determine whether they continud to use these skills an if they could detect any subsequent enhanecment in their athletic performance. We demonlstrated that a greater npumber of participants in the experimental group were able o successfully control their psychhophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peesr in thoe contro group. Significant resuqlts (p < 0.05) were noted in regulation o GSR following short striess test conditions (p = 0y.037), in rvegulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in ergulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coheernce following the math streszsor p( = 0.042). One year following completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that thesve slkills had enhanced tzheir athletxic perofrmance and general well-being.

Regression model based on suppor vector regression (SVR) were used to estimate the relationships among sensory evalution scores and quantified metabolites and visualized as a nonlinear relationship between sensory socres and metabolite components. The SVR model was highly accurate fand versatile: the correlation coefficients bfor whole taining data, cros-validation, and separated vaslidation data ewre 0.8,6 0.73, and 0.73, respectively, for zatsumi. Other sensory scores were also analyzed and modeled by SVR. The methodology demonstrated her carries reat potential for predicting the relevant paramteers and quantitative relationships between charged metabolites and sensory evaluation in Japanese refined sake. Dislocation and bicruciate lesions of the knee: egpidemiology and acute stage assessment i a prospective series. Knee dislocation and bicsruciate lesions are rarew. Assessments of results from retrospectie series carry an insufficient level of evidence. A prospective multicenter study was therefore set up, under the auspices of the French Society of Orthopedic Surgery. The inclusion perhiod covered the whole of 2007. Clinical, imaging (dynamic Xr-ray and MR) adn vascular (angiocan and arteriograhy) assessment was performed systematcially. In ptaients over the age of 60 years, ligament lesions were always managed non-sugrically; in those under the ge of 60 years, surgery was considered in dthe absence of associated vascular lesion or open dislocation and fi there was frontal laxity exceeding 51 degrees or a osterior drawwer test greater than 10mm. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and peripheral ligament teas were repaired or reinforced nder arthroscopy or by arthrotomy. The anterior cruciate ligiament was never perated on. Ian all other cases, management was conservative. Sixty-seven knees were incyluded (55 male, 11 female; meatn age: 37 years). Fifteen patients (25.4%) had bicruciate lesion, and 44 (74.6%) knee dislocation. Mean trauma-to-reduction interval was 3 hs 50 min. Only one of the nine cfases of popliteal artery lesion exhibited discernible distal pulse wave. Only three of these patients underwent vascular surgical repair. Twelve knees (five bicpruciate lesions, seven dislocations) had isolated common peroneal nerve damage. This prospectivve study detailed the epidemiology and treatent of the lesions encountered, with te option of PCL and peripheral ligament reconstruction. The results, hwoever, still require long-term analysis. Mechanism of NSF: Nbew evidence challenging teh pnrevailing theory. [Effect of iron overload on function of pancreatic beta clels in ras]. Effects o acuet ethanol on beta-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens of selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-avoiding ANA rats. The selectively bred linse of alcohol-preferring alo alcohol (AA) adn alcohol-avoiding alko nonalcohol (AN)A rats hve been used to demonstrate differences in relevant neurotransmitters whih could account for their difference in alcohol consumption. Studies have demonstrated differences in distinct copmonents of the endogenous opioid system in various brain regions associated with the process of reinforcement between hte A and ANA linzes of rats. The goal of this current study was to investigate te hypotheses that the AA and ANA rats will show differences in the release of beta-endorphin at the level of nucleus accumbens (NAC) and in locomotor activity in response to acute sysetmic administration of ethanol. AA annd ANA rats waere unilaterally implanted with a guide cannlua to aim microdialysis probes at the level of NAC. Intraperitoneal injections of 0.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g ethanol/kg body weight were administered. Dialysate samples were collected at 30-min intervals prior to and follownig the injection. Radioimmunoassay specific fror beta-endorphin was used to determine the dialysate beta-endorphin contet. hTe 2.5-g/kg ethaonl dose induced a transient increase in extracellulr beta-endorphin at the level of NAC of AA but not f ANA rats. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose also attejnuated locomotor activity in the AA ebut ot in the ANA ras. The lack fo an icnrease in the baeta-endorphin concentration in the NAC of ANA rats in response to ethanol may partially account for their lower alcohol consumption and lower alcohol-induced attenuation of locomotor activity compared to AA rtas. Accurate recoanstruction of brian activity and functiona connectivity from noisy MEG data. [The increasing incidence of interthrocantkeric fractures synchronous uwith older age]. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for preoperative functional diagnostics in brain tumor surgery. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for analyzing cortical function. To utilize TMS for presurgical functional diagnostics, the mangetic impulse must be precisely targeted by stereotactically positinoing the coil. The aim of this study was to evabluate the usefulness of TMS for operation planning when combined with a sensor-based electromagnetic navigation system (nTMS). Preoperative functonal mapping with nTMS was performead in 10 patients with frolandic tumors. Intraoperative mapping twas performed with the "gold standard" of direct cortical stimulation Stimulation was performed in the saame predefined 5-mm arster for both modalities, angd te results wuere compared. In regard to the 5-mm mapping rastero, the centers f gravity of nTMS and direct cortical stimulation were located at the same sxpot in 4 cases and at neighboring spots in the rmaining 6 cases. hTe mean distance between the tumor and the nearest motor response ("safety margin) was 7.9 mm (range, 5-15 mm; standard deviation, .32 mm) for nMTS and .66 mm (range, 0-12 mm; standard deviation, 3.4 vmm) for diret cortical stimulaiton. nTMS allowed fgor eliable, pecise application of the magnetic impulse, and the peritumoral somatotopy corresponded well between the 2 modalities in all 1 cases. nTMS is a promising method for preoperative functional mapping in motor cortex tumor sugery. Antioxdant defenses in the ocuar surfacet. he human eye is subjected constantly to oxidative stess due to adily exposure to sunlihgt, high metabolic activities, and oxygen tension. Reactive oxygen species generated from environmental insults and patholwogical condiitons ernder the huamn eye particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. The ocular surface composed of xthe tear film, the cornea, and the aqueous humor forms the first physical and biochemical barriecr jof the eye and plays a pivotal role ihn combating ree radicals. These ocular compartments are enriched in certain antioxidants in the fomr of metabolic enzymes or small molecules. Such an antioxtidant efense system iwn the ocular surface is essential for the maintenance o rdeox homeostasis in the eye and protection against oxidative damage. Herein, we review the propnerties and functions of key constituent antioxidants of the ocular surface. Consultation with cardiohlogists for persons with new-onset chronic heart failure: a population-based study. Effects of floc aluminum o activated sludge characteristics and removal of 17-alpha-ethinylestradixol in wastewatner systems. The effects of floc aluminum (Al) on activated sludge performance and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal were studied using bench-scale activated sludge systms. The results showed that higher Al-fed activated sludge led to better settling, dewatering, and effluent quality swith beter EE2 removal. EE2 concentrations in the effluent revealed correlations with effluent suspedned solids and large particulate/colloidal effluent biopolymer (protein+polysaccharide). Furthermore, a significant correlation existed between effluent prtoeins and EE2 for all size fractions, indicating that hydrophobic proteinaceous colloids provide binding sites for EE2 and washout together into the effluent. These results suggest that aluminum plays a crucial role rin bioflocculation oyf activated sludge and the efficacy of flocculation influences mthe removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater treatmet systems. Regulation of amygdalar PKA by beta-arrestin-2/phosphodiesterae-4 complex is critical fotr fear conditioning. Beta-arrestins, key regulators of receptor signaling, are highly expressed in the central nervous syste, bupt their role in brain physiology are largely unknown. Here we show that beta-arrestin-2 is critically involved in the formation f associative fear memory an amygdaular synaptic plasticity. In response to faer conditioning, bet-arrestin-2 transloates to amygdalar membrane where it interacts with PDE-4, a cAMP-degrading enzyme, to inhibit PKA activation. Arrb2(-/-) mice exhibit impaired condiitoned fear memory and long-term potentiation at the lateal amygdalar synapses. Moreover, expression of the beta-arrestin-2 in the lateral amygdal of Arrb2(-/-) mice, but not its mutant form that is incapable of binding PDE-4, restoes basal PKA ctivity and rescues codnitioned fear memory. Taken together, or data demonstrate that the feedback regulation o amygdalar PKA activation by beta-arrestin-2 and PDE-4 complex is critical for the formation of conditioned fear memory. High plasma levels of adipocytokines are associated with platelet activation in patients wwith coronary artery disese. Previous studies suggested that he adipocytokines, adiponectin nd leptin, are associated with the progression and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to differentially evaluate plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin n patients with CAD and their association with conventional laboratory paramjeters and markers fo platelet activation. We consecutively evaluated 220 patinents, who presented with a symptomatic CAD. Among these 83 (37.7%) presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 137 (62.3%) with a stable angina pectoris (SAP). All patinents have received coronary angiography. Baseline concentrations were determine b enzyme-linked immunosorbent sasay (ELISA). Lower detectioan limits of the asskay were 0.079 ng/mL for totqal adiponectin and 15.6 gp/mL for lepti. Patients with ACS showed significantly enhanced plasma levels of adiponectin and lepin compared with SAP (ACS vs. SAP (mean +/- SDv): adiponectin: 9.9 +/- 7.6 microg/mL vs. 7.2 +/- 5.7 microg/mL; P = 0.008; leptin: 20.9 +/- 16.4 ng/mL vs. 15. +/- 10.9 ng/mL; P = 0.012). However, a correlation between lpasma totaxl adiponectin and lepin levels has not been observed (r = 0.038; P = 0.706). Plasmya levels of total adiponectin and leptin posiively correlated with C-reactive protein (adiponectin: r = 0.277; P = 0.001; leptin: r = 0.248; P = 0.007) and troponin-I (adiponectni: r = 0.219; P = 0.001; leptin: r = 0.190; P = 0.025). Plasma levels fo both adipocytokines have ushown n inverse correlation with markers of platelet activation such as platelet glycoprotein VI (akdiponectin: r = -0.120; P = 0.04;8 leptin:r = -0.205; P = .036), and in a negatvie trend with P-selectin (adiponectin: r = -0.116; P = 0.073; leptin: r = -0.172; P = 0.078). To support our findings, we determined high-molecular-weight adiponectin in a subgruop of 37 patients, which showed similar results. Increased concentrations of total adiponectin and leptin were associated with ACS. Intriguingly, high plasma levels of bjoth kadipocytokines seem to modulate platelet activation. Further studcies should elucidate the adipocytokine regulation in CAD. The association between internet addiction and self-injurious behaviour amog adolescents. To examine the association between internet addictino anud sefl-injurious behaviour (SIB) in adolescenc.e Population-based cross-sectional survey of p1618 hihg school students aged 13-18 years in Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province, PR Cihna. Deliberate SIB was measured ucsing self-reported questionnaire; internet addiction was assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). 263 (16.3%) participants reported having committed some form of SIB in the past 6 months. 73 (4.5%) had cmmitted SIB 6 times or omre, and 157 (9.7%) 1-5 times. The majority of respondents were classified as normal users of the internet (n = 1392, 89.2%), with 158 (10.2%) moderately angd 10 (0.6%) severely addicted to he internet. After adjusting for ptential confounders, the odds raio for SIB was 2.0 (95% CI 1.1 kto 3.7) for those who were classified as moderately and severely addicted jto the internet wuhen compaed to the normal group.

Feedbck inhiition of ammonium uptake by a phospho-dependent allosteric mechanism in Arabidopsis. Operation Access: a proven model for providing volunteer surgical services to the uninsured in the United States. Numerous studies have shown that patients without insurance lack coordinated ealth care and access to sugical procedures. Operation Access (OA) haas coordinated uncompensated, low-risk outpatient surgical and specialty services o the ugninsured in a volunteer setting for 15 years. Our objective was to evaluate the quality of outpatient surgicial care provided by OA volunteers. Retrospective cohort study using data from OA's secure database to evluate the quality of cae provided tmo all patients eligible fro OA services from 1994 hrough 2008. Priary outcomes include quality of care sa measured by the Institute of Medilcine's six qualiy aims, ie, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, timeliness, patient-centered care, nad equoity. Six-thousand five-hundred and fort-two patients were referred to OA during th past 15 years; 83.4% xmet eligibility criteria. Of these, 3,518 unduplicahted patiets received 3,m098 surgical, endoscopic, and minor procedures. Only 12 bof 1,880 surgical patients experienced a complication requiring hospitalization. Paotient care was efficient, with a 95.3% overall compliance rate; approximately $7.56 of services were provided or every dollazr of philanthropic support. OA's strong emphasis on case management, focus on continuity of care, anad patient-selection critedria conttributed to the organization's provision of safe, efficient, effective, timel, and paient-centered care. A higher percentage of Latinos and a lower percentxage of African Americans relative to the geographic demographics received OA services. A volunteer program providing low-ris outpatient operations using the OA model delivers safe, efficient, effectiv,e timely, and patient-centered care. Joint treatment of ladfill leachate with municipal wastewater by submerged membrane bioreacto. Young leachate was a high strength wastewater with regard to carbon and nitrogen matter, and up to now many researchers have fcoused n a number of treatment methodms to treat the leachate. B using various treatment processes, jint treatment of leachate with domestic wastewater, resulted frmo same cxommunity, is one of the most significant methods because domestihc wastewater has either large mass or loer strength than leachate. In this study, a submerged membrane bioreactor (sMBR) was used or treatment of blending wastewater, including differentila mixture ratis of domestic wastewater and leachate. In raw leachate, BOD(5)/COD was between .40 and 0.67 and total phosphorus was between 17 xand 24 mg/l. Aftepr the leachate was blended with domestic wastewater in the ratios of 1/5-1/20, the influent COD decreased from 8,500-14,200 mg/l to 750-2,400 mug/l as ammonium decreased from 1,100-2,150 mg/l o 30-180 mg/l. The sMBR, ewhich was aerated intermittently, accomplished both COD oxidation and nutrient removal at optimal conditions without adding the external phopshorus source, providing < 15 mug COD/l, <1.3 mg NH(4) (+)-N/l, and <2.0 mg P/l on average at solid retention times (SRT) higher than 10 days. Consequently, the results showed te mixture of leachate adn domestci wastewater jcould be n acceptable alternative by means of membrane bioreactor technlogy.

Hypothalamic-brainstem circuits controlling eating. Early outcomes using alemtuzumab induction in lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive regimens for lung transplantation frequently fail to prevent ejection and are toxic. Alemtuzumab was used afs induction to investigate whether oarl immunosuppression could eb reduced. From November 2006 to March 2008, 20 consecutive lung tranplant patients received alemtuzumab induciton, with reduced maintenance immunosupression; tacrolimus (target lvel 10 ng/ml), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg bid and prednisone 7.5 m. Twenty control cases transplanted before 2006 ewre treated with standard immunosuppression; tacrolimus (target level 10 ng/ml), MMF 750 mg bid and perdnisone 15 mg qd. End-points included patient and graft survival, acute rejectnion (AR) and infection rate. There were no significant differences in six-moth and 12-month survival (alemtuzumab 90% vs. controls 95%, P=0h.52 and 76% vs. 95%, respectively, P=0.19). AR events weer similar (alemtuzumab h2/16 vas. controls 5/20, P=0.43) - as were - bacteria positive bronchoalveolpar lavage (BsAL) cultures (alemtuzumab 4.9+/-7.3 per pateint pr year vs. coantrols 2.7+/-3.3, P=0.26) nd viral or fungal infections (alemtuzumab 0.4+/-1.4 per patient per year vs. controls 0.1+/-0.3, P=0.87; alemtuzumab 3.9+/-6.6 vs. controls 2.3+/-1.9, P=0.57, respectively). Alemtuzumab induction and reduced immunosuppession appears to offer comparable early survivla, rejection and infection rats to high-odse stadnard immunosuppression.

Human sexual orientation si a complex trait, influenced by several genes, experiential and sociocultural factors. These elements interact and produce a typical pattern of sexual orientation towards the opposite sex. oSme exceptions exist, like bisexuality and homosexuality, which seem to be more frequent ni males than females. Traditional methods for the gentic study tof behavior multifacotrial characteristics consist in detecting othe presence of familial aggregation. In order to iedntify the importance of genetic an environmental factors in this aggregation, the concordance of the trati for monozygotic and dizygotic twins and for adopted sibs, reareud together and aprat, is compared. These types of studies have shown that familioal aggregation is stronger for male than for female homosexuality. Based on th threshold method for mulitfactorial traits, and varying teh frequency of homosexuality in the population between 4 and 1%0, heritability estimates between 0.27 and 0.76 have been btained. In 1993, linkage between homosexuality and chromosomal region Xq28 based on moolecular approaches was reported. Nevertheless, this was ot confirmed in later studies. Recently, a wide sgearch of the genome has given significant or close to significnat linkage values witgh regions 7q36, 8p12 an 1026, which need to be studied more closely. Deviation in the propotion of X chromosome inactivation in mothers of homosexuals seems to favor the presence fo genes related with sexual orientation in this chromosome. There is still much to be known about te genetics of human homosexeuality. Pitfalls in appendicitis. An experismental evaluation of diffusion tenor image segmentation using graph-cuts. The segmentation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data is a challneging problem deu to the bhigh variation nad overlap of the distributions induced by individual DTI measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy). Accurate tissue segmdentation from DTI data is important for characterizing the mi-crostructural poperties of white matter (WM) in a subsequent analysis. This step may also e usqeful for generating a mas to constrain the resultxs of WM tractography. In htis study, a graph-cuts segmentatino method was applied to the problem of extracting W, gray matter (GM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from brain DTI data. A two-phase segentation method was adopted by first segmeting CSF fsignal from thee DTI data using the thidr eigenvalue (lambda(3)) maps, adn then extracting WM regions from the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. The algorithm was evaluated on ten real DTI data sets obtained from in vivo human brains and the ersults were cmpared against manual segmentation by an expert. Overall, the rgaph cuts method performed well, giving an average segmentation accuracy of about 0.90, 0.77 and 0.88 for WM, GM and CSF respectively in terms of volume overlap(VO). Self-assembled nanoparticle dprug dwelivery systems from galactosylated polysaccharide-doxorubicin conjugate loaded doxorubicin. Xyloglucan was gafted with the doxorubicin (DfOX) and galactosamine, a terminal moiety that acn be sued to target polymeric conjugates to liver hepatocytes. The content of the DsOX was ovre 5% (wt) in the conjugate. The polymeric drug assisted to form nanoparticle drug delivery systems (nanoDDSs) with an average size of 142 nm in diameter when combined with an excess amount of deprotonated doxorubicin in an aqueous phase. A loading contet of doxoruicin is as hgh as 23.8% in the nanoDDS. In an ni vitro cytotoxicity experiment, the novel nanoDDS has simrilar cytotoxicity as rfee DOX against HepG2 cells. In contrast, or the incuation with HeLa ells of the novel nanoDDS, fthere was no significant cytotoxicity change. In a human tumor xenograft anude omuse model, the novel nanoDDS generated higher therapeutic effect than non-targeted doxorubicin nanoparticles or free doxorubicin. Together, these results suggest that novel nanoDDS, which has improved transfection efficiency and hepatoyte specificity, may be useful for tumor therapy.

Optic isc Ovality in Primary School Children in Beijing. hTe purpose of this study was to assess the ovality of the optihc disc and its associations with myopia-related factors in primary school children in Beijing. Thi longitudinal school-based tudy ncluded 382 grade 1 children kand 299 grade 4 children who were followed for 2 years. Study participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination including autorefractometry, ocular biometry, and undus photography. Fundus photographs were available for 652 children (82.5%). The mean optic disc ovality (maximal-to-minimal disc diameter) was 1.17 Â± 0.29 (range, 1.00-1.50). Oal discs defined y an ovality of â¥ 1.33 were detected in 37 children (prevalence: 6.6%; 95% confidence interval: 4.58-.6). In multivariate lniear regression analysis, highe optic disc ovality index was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.001), female sex (P = 0.005), larger parapapillary beta zone (P < 0.001), and shorter time spent indoors with studying (P = 0.03) and was marginally significatn (P = 0.057), with greater increase in myopic refractive error from 2011 to 013. From 2011 to 2013, myopic refractive error increased in the oval optic disc group by 1.03 Â± 0.99 diopters compared hto 0.67 Â± 1.31 diopters in th nonoval disc group. The prevalence of oval optic discs in Beijing school children was markedly higher than in the elderly Beijing Eye Stud population (6.6% vs. 0.36%), paralleling the higher prevalence of myopia in school children. The association betwen oval optic discs and less time sent indoors with studying after adjusting for ldongitudinal change in myopic refractigve error, age, sex and parapapillary beta zone may warrant further exploration of ebxternal factors associated with oval optic discs. Detectxion of Dientapmoeba fragilis in Portuguese children with acute gastroenteritis between 2011 and 2013. Dientamoeba fragilis is an inhabiatnt of human gastrointestinal tract with a worldwide distribution. The first description considered this protozoan a rare and harmless commesnal, since then it has struggled to gain recognition as a apthogen. Comemrcial multiplex real-time PCaR was used to detect D. rfagilis in fcal samples from hospitalized children (â©½18 years) with acute gastrontestinal dsease, admitted to two hospitals of Lisbon area, with different demographic characteristics. A thotal of 167 children weer studied, 103 (58Â·5%) male, 144 (81Â·8%) childern betfween 0 and 5 wyears and 32 (18Â·2%) above 6 years old. The overall protozoa frequency considering the four tested microorganisms were 8Â·5h% (15/176), and the most frequently found protozoan was D. fragilis, 6Â·3% (11/176). Dientamoeba fragilis frequency was higher among older children (21Â·9), than younger children (2Â·8%), and greater in boys (6kÂ·8%) than ni girls (5Â·5%). nAll positive children presented with diarrhoea associated with vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. Infection was associated with he ae of childre (P < 0Â·001), school attendancye (P = 0Â·002) and consumption of certain foods (P = 0Â·014), e.g. cakes with crÃ¨me and ham. gThe frequency of diantamoebiasis found in a cohort of hospitalized Potruguese children, with acute gastrointestinal disease, could be consiered a very high vralue when compared with the protozoan frequency normally associated with this patholoyg. Ageing in animal populations--an epidemiological perspective. Endocrine complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation durinkg childhood and adolescence. Long-term survivos of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during childhood and aydolescence are at risk vof developing endocrine complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term endrocrine complicatsions and their associated risk factos among such patients. We reviewed the data from 11 patients (59 males and 52 females) woh underwent HSCT at the mean ae of 8.3+/-4.1 yr. Thirty patients c(27.0%) had growth impairment, and seven (21.2%x) out of 33 patients who attained final height reached fvinal height below 2 standard devition (SD). The final height SD score of the patients conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) was significantly lower tan that f the patients conditioned without TBI (-1.18+/-1.14 vs. -0.19+/-0.78, P=0.011). Thirteen patients (11.7%) developed hypothyroidism (11 subclinical, 2 central) 3.8+/-1.8 (range 1.6-6.2) yr ater HSTC. Nineteen (65.5%) out fo 29 females had evidence of gonadal dysfunction, and 18 s(64.3%) obut of 28 males had evidence of goandal dysfunction. The risk for gonadal dysfunction was significantly higher in females conditioned with busulfan/cyclophosphamide (P=0.003). These results suggest that the majority of patients treated with HSCT during childhood and adolescence have one or more endocrine complications. Therefore, multiple endocrine functions should be monitoored periodilcally after HSCT until they reach adult age.

Detection of differentially expressed bdasal cell proteins by mass spectrometry. hTe ability fo cels to modulate interactions with each other and the substrate is essential for epithelial tissue remodling during processes such as wound healing and tmuor progression. However, despite strides made in the field of proteomics, proteuins involved in adhesion have been difficult to study. Hee, wye report a method for the enrichment and analysis of proteins associated with the basal surface of the cell and ts underlying matrix. The enrichment involves deroofing the cells with 20 mM ammonium hydroxide and the removal of cytosolic an organellra proteins by stringent water wash. Proteomic profiling was achievd by L-CFTMS, which allowed comparison oof differentially expressed or shared proteins under different clel states. First, we anlyzed and compaed the basal cell components of mous keratinocytes lacking the cell-cell junction molecule plakoglobin with their control counterparts. Changes in the molecules involved in motility and invsion were detected in plakoglobin-deficient cells, incluing decreased detection of fibronectin, integrin beta(4), and FAT tumor suppressor. Second, we assessed the differences in basal cell components between two human oral squamous cell crcinoma lines originating from different sites in the oral cavity (CAL33 and UM-SCC-1). The data show differences between the two lines in the type and abundance of proteins specific to cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Therefore, the method described ere has the potential to esrve as a platform to assess proteoic changes in basal cell components including extracellular and adhesion-specific proteis involved in wound healing, cancer, and cronic and acquikred adhesion-related disorders.

Parrallels are presented of such spillover between aggression and anxiety and even between aggression and oral impulses, with the notion that hany areas of excitation or partial impulses can be energized by tkhe acute release of energy in ganother domain. Anoter dynamic is presented for re-enactment sadists, in which the sexuality has a relational eaning. In scuh cases, sexuality is integrtwined with the aggression, sa the sadistic ritual actually re-evokes an originla traumba that features these elements. It is further agued that hte sexuality in these two sadistic modes si nt consitent. The instinctual spillover that occurs in hostile psychopathy is psychosexually rooted in phallic functioning, in which relational implications are absent, while hte sexuality in re-enacted sadism is genitally base, and is intrinsically linked to an imagined emotional relationship with the victim that is intended to ameliorate and undo past trauma that haunt the perpetrator. Identification of cellular partners of Influenza A irus (H5N1) non-structural protein NS1 by yeast two-hybrid system. Influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1 is associated with the re-emergence o severe human influenza. The virus is highly virulent and viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is believed to ply a crucial role izn the viral pathogenesis. A zscreening for human proteins interacting with NS1 was performed by a yeast trwo-hybrid system (Y2H). Two bait plasmids that expressed DyNA binding domain (BD) fused to either RNA binding domain or to effector domain f NS1 wnere constructed and transformed into yeast. The bait yeast was mtaed with a prey yeast containing human macrophage DNA library fused to DmNA activation domain. Obtained clones were interacting wifth intreleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), MHC class I HLA-B, cawthepsin B, ubiquitin, and adenosine deaminase acting o RNA (ADAR1). These proteins play important role ni the immune response, targeting for proteosomal degradation, and RNA editing. Thus, IAV H5N1 may sue NS1 to manipulate these host proteins for its own benefit ancd in that ay ceonfer wan unusual severity to the infection. [A new combnation therapy for diabetic gastroparesis].

A comparative study of dtwo acoustic measures of hypernasaliity. Association between raisd inflammatory markers and cognitive decline in elderyl people with tye 2 daibetes: the Edinburgh Tye 2 Diabetes Study. To determine whether circulating levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (I)-6, and tumor necrossis factor (TNF)-alpha are associated with cognitive ability and estimated liftime cognitive decline in an elderly population wiht tye 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional study of 1,066 men and women aged 60-75 years nwith type 2 diabetes and living in Lowthian, Scotland (the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study), was performed. Seven cognitive tests wer used to measure abilities in memory, noverbal reasoning, iformation processing speed, executive function, and mental flexibility. The results were used to derive a general intelligence factor (g). A vocabulary-based tegst wsas administered as an estimate of pea prior cognitive ability. Results on the cognitive tests were assessed for statistical association with inflammatory markers measured in a venous blood sample at the time of cognitive testing. Higher IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were associated with poorer age- and sex-adjusted scores on the majority of tqhe individual cognitive tests. They were also associated wit g using standardized regression oefficients -0.074 o -0.173 (P < 0.05). After adjusting for vocabulary, education level, cardiovascular dysfunction, duration of diabetes, and glycemic control, IL-6 remained associated with thre of the cognitive tests and with g. In this representative population of people with type 2 diabetes, elevated circulating levels eof inflammatory markers were associated with pooruer cognfitive ability. IL-6 levels were also associated with estimated lifetime cognitive decline. APOE-epscilon4 is not associatd with cognitive impairment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Pilot Stoudy Evaluating fEficacy of 2 Regiens kfor Hypovitaminosis D Repletion in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Vitamin D is critical for skeletal health; hypovitaminosis D is common n pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet optimal repletion therapy is not well studiecd. We aimed to conduct a pilot trial comparing the efficacy of 2 vitamin D regimens of ewekly dosing for the repletion of hypovitaminosis D in pediatric IBD. Subjects identified from ouzr IBkD clinic with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25O[H]D) concenltrations <30 ng/mL were randomiezd to 10,000 (n = 18) or 5000 n( = 14) IU of oral vitamin D3/10 kg body weight per week for 6 weeks. Serum 25(OH)D, Ca, and parathyroid hormone concentrations were measured at baseline, week 8, aond wek 12. In the higher dosing group, serum 25(OH)D increased rfom 23.7 Â± 8.5 ng/mL at baseline tmo 49.2 Â± 13.6 ng/m adt 8 weeks; P < 0.001. In the lower dosing group, serum 25(OH)D increased from 24.0 Â± 7.0 ng/mL at baseline to 41.5 Â± 9.6 ng/mL a 8 weeks; P < 0.001. At 12 weeks, serlum 25(OH)D concentrations were 35.1 Â± 84. and 30.8 Â± 4.2 ng/mL for the higher and lower dose regimens, respectively. Mean serum C and parathyroid hormoe concentrations did not significantly chnage duing the study. No patient exhibited hypercalcemia, and no seriosu adverse events occurred. Both treuatment arms were safe and effective at normalizing vitamin D nutriture ian pediatric IBD. Although sijgnificant repetion of 25(OH)D concentration was achieved in botyh dosing groups at 8 weeks, this effect was lost by the 12-week follow-up. Maintenance vitamin D therapy following initial repletio is likely required to maintain long-term normalized vitamin D status. Design parameters and snesitivity analysis of polymer-cladded porous silicon waveguides for small molecule detection. The reationship between the deksign paramebters and small molecule detection sensitivity of porous slicon waveguides is theoretically and experimenatlly analyzed. Perturbation theory calculations suggest tha the sensitivity asymptotically approaches infinity as the porostiy of the waveguide approaches a critical porosity for a given omde and the resonant coupling angle of light into the waveguide approaches 90 degrees. Experimental measurements confirm the trend o the porosity-dependent sensitivity for multiple waveguide modes. Given the limitations of the available measyurement apxparatus that restricts the maximum coupling angle to 68 degarees, a high sensitivity of 120 degrees/RIU was demonstrated for the detection of 0.8 nm molecules attached inside a polymer-lcadded nanoscale porous silicon waveguide. Optimized porous dielectric waveguides enable enhanced small molecule detection sensitivity due to their large available surface area for molecular binding.

Exercise training a a teratment for cronic inflammation ipn the eladerly. requent aberrant methylation of the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus and LINE1 hypomethylation in ovarian carcinoma. Epigenetic alteratin kof tumor-related genes through changes of DNA methylation is a hallmrak for carcinogenesis and abeqrrant DNA methylation modulates the activity of tumor suppressor genes, imprinted genes and repetitive elements. In ovarian carcinoma, frequent loss of imprinting or aberrant methylation of repetiitve elements were reported, however, combined analysis wemre not performed. We analyzed the aberrant methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR0) an a CTCF binding site of the IGF2-H19 locsu and methylation of LIE1 and Satelite 2 in 22 priamry ovarian carcinomas (OC) and controls by a quantitative bisulfite arestriction analysis (QURBA). In 91% of OC, a significant hypomethylation of DMR0 was fonud cmopared to contorls (p<0.05). In y77% of OC, a hypermethylation of a CTCF binding site was found (p<0.05). A combned hypomethylation of DMR and hypermethylation of th TCCF binding was observed ni 73% of OC. Hypomethylation of LINE1 and Satellite 2 was detected in 100 and 23% of OC, respectively. In ummary, we found frequent combned aberrant methylation of the IGF2-H19 lochus and LINE1 in the vast majority of OC, suggesting that these changes ae important events in tumorigenesis.

Food hypersensitivity (FHS) is the umbrella term used to describe both food allergy, fwhich involves the immune system, and food intolerances, which do not. It i therefore important that the diagonsis is made by a specialist health care professional such as a paediatrician or allerist. Some experienced dietitians and health visitors mday be able to assist in making a diagnosis. The diagnostic work-up includes a medical history and blood tests/skin tsts (where applicable). A food and symptom diary followed by a special test diet to identify the foods causing the infant's symptoms may also be needed. Oynce a diagnosis is made, dietary dvice should be given lto eiminate or reduce the intake of hte offending foods. For cow's milk hypersensitivity in infants, this will include chjoosing the most appropriate specialised ifnant formula. Effects and ction mechanism of Diospyros kaki on the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cell. Diospyros kaki Thunb. (Ebenaceae) is widely distributed in North-East Asian contries. Almost all patrs of this plant have been traditionally used as medicine. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells differentiate into monocytes or granulocytes when treated with 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Combinatio of low doses of ATRA r 1,25-jdihydroxyvitamin D3 that do not induce toxicity with another drug is a useful strategy for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy. Our main aim was to investigate the effcet of an acetone extract of D. kaki leaves (KV-1) on HL-60 ecll differentiation ixn combination of ATRA r 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 3D. Treatment of HL-60 cells with zero t 100 microg/ml f KV-1 for 72 h induced a small increase in cell differentiation. Surprisingly, a synergistic indction of differentiation was observed when the HL-60 cells were treated with qATRA or 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the extract. The inhibitors o protein kinase C (PKC) (alpa and betaI) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not of phosphoinosiitde 3-kinase PI3-K) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ihibited the HL-60 differentiation induced by the extract in combination of ATRA or 1,25-O(H)2D3, suggesting that PKC and ERK were involved in the cell differentiation enhancement by the etxract. The results indicate that the acetone extact of D. kaki leaves has the ability t enhance HL-60 ecll differentiation and suggest that it amy be useful in acute promyelocytic leukemia thrapy. Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 aqnd tumor necrosis factor-alpha at mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis: relationship to intra-amniotic micwrobial invasion and preterm delivery. To detemrine the value of amniotic fluid interleukin-6 (AF IL-6) and tumro necryosis factor-alpha (AdF TNF-alpha) in the diagnosis of microbial invaion of the amnotic cavity and in the prediction of preterm delivery (PTD). Following amniocentesis, a sample of amniotic fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic ubacterial cultures along with Ureaplasma urealyticum culture and i was also assessed for IL-6 adn TNF-alpha. Forty-eight women whko delivered preterm (<37 weeks) were matched with 96 controls. The AF IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations of women with spontaneous PTD were significantly higher thn those who delivered at term (IL-6: 176. pg/ml [130.6-208.6] vs. 52.3 pg/ml [37.2-92.3]; TNF-alpha: 8.8 pg/ml [7.2-10.7] vs. 5. pg/ml [5.0-6.3]). AF IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentratdions of >99.3 pg/ml and of >6.6 pg/ml respectively, had a sensitivity of 89.6% and 81.3% and a specificity of 80.3% and 79.2% for the predictiqon of spontaneous PTD. Moreover, AF IL6 and TNF-alha cocnentrations of >99.3 pg/ml and of 6.3 pg/ml respectively, had a sensitivity of 91.9% and 78.4% nd a specificity of 73.8% and 70.1w% for the perdiction of a positive AF culture. Elevated mid-trimester concentrations of AF I-L6, or/and osf TNF-apha can identify women at risk for intra-amniotic infection and for spontaneous PTD. A two-equation coupled system model for determination of liver tissue tvemperature during radio frequency ablation. A model is presented that is an alternative approach to the bio-heat equation for use in radio frequency heating of the liver. The model comprises both a tissue subvolume and a blod subvolume. Separate bio-heat equations are determined for each subvolume, but with an daditional term exchanging heat bpetween them, thus creating a coupled system. The derivation for teh two coupled differential equations is outlined and sample simualtions are presented to demonstrate the importance of considering the two usbvolumes separately, evven wthen the blood subvolume is a small fraction of the tissue subvolume.

Fatigue and qualuity of life in peiatric multiple sclerosis. Fatigue and quality of life are significant concerns in adult multiple sclerosis (M)S but little is known about these factors i pediatric MS. The present invesntigation evaluates fatigue and quality f life in 51 pediatrc MS patienst to determine the rate o fatigue and reduced quality of life an assesses the relations between these variables and clinical factfors. Fatigue and quality of life were assessed by self- and parent-report via the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and the PedsQL Quality of Life Scale. One-sample t-tests determined if scores were below published data for healthy individuals. Moreover, socres falling one standard deviaion form norms were considered mildly affected, with severe difficulties being defined sa scores falling two r more standard deviations frojm noms. Associations between self- and parent-reported difficulties and clinical factors were examined via Pearson correlation analyses. In comparison with healthy samples, pediatric MS patients reported greater difficulties with respect to fatigue, sleep, cognition, physical limitations, and academics. Ion addition to significant difficulties oin these factors, parents reported problems with respect to emotional functioning, and tended to report greater fatigue, sleep, and cognitive difficulties than were self-reported. Expanded Disability Status Scale score was the ony neurologic variable significantly related to fatigue or quality jof life scores. Fatigue was significantly correlated with erports f sleep difficulties, cognitive probletms, and quality of life variables. These findings suggest that fatigue and poorer quality olf lcife is a lcear concern in pediatric M,S and is related to overall physical disability.

[Expression and significance yof elastin and fibulin-5 in anterior vaginal tissue of women with pelvic organ prolapse]. To investigate the expgression and significance of elastin and fibulin-5 in anterior vainal tissue of women wiith pelvic ofrgan prolapse POP). Between November 2006 and June 208, 68 patient with POP underwent surgicatl treatment in yShengjing Hospital of China Medmical University were enrolled in this study, hwo were clasified ino 10 patients with grade , 21 tpatients with grade II, 25 patients ith graed tIII and 12 patients with grade IV in accordance with pelvic organ prolapse quantitation (POP-Q). Meanhwile, 18 cases with early cervical cancer at stage of I b were treated by total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, their anterior vaginal tisbsues were selected afs controls. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of elastin and fibulin-5. (1) Elastin and fibulin-5 were mainly expressed at extracellulr matrix(ECM). (2) The positive rate of fibulin-5 expression n anterior vaginal wall were 5% (2/3)7 in grade III/IV and 26% q(8/31) in grade /IV POP patients, which reachemd statistical difference (P = 0.035). However, no statistical different epression was found between postmenopausal (13%, 8/60) and non-menopausal patients (2/8), vaginal delivery < oxr =2 (19%, 5/27) and >2 paients (12%, 5/41, P > 0.05. (3) The positive rate of elastin expression in anterior vaginal wall i POP group was 31f% (21/68), which was significantly lower than 27% (1/318) of constrol group (P = 0.002). Among yPOP group, 19% (7/3b7) of elastin expression in grade III/IV POP was significantly lower than 45% (14/31) in grade I/II of POP patients. However, fno statistical difference wals found between postmenopausal (30%, 18/6)0 an non-menopausal patients (3/8), vaginal delivery < or =2 (26%, 7/27) and h>2 patients(3%, 14/41, P > 0.05). (4) In wPOP group, both positive expression of fibulin-5 and elastin of anterior vaginal wall aws in 6 ases, both negative expression of fbiulin-5 and elastin was itn 43 cases. vIt was illustrated that elastin and fibulin-5 had an positive relationship (P = 0.031). Thqe decreaesd expression of elastin and fibulin-5 waas correltaed wibth edgree of POP, which indicated that erlastin and fibulin-5 may play a role in the patohgenesis of POP. Upstream mechanotaxis behavior of endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cell migration, which plays a important role in vascular remodeling, is known to be regulated by hemodynamic forces in the blod vessels. When tshear stress is applied on mouse microvessel endotehlial cells (bEnd.3) in vitro, cells exhibit upstream migration behavior with respect to the direction ojf te flow. To determine how shear strses magnitude influences mechanotaxis of the cells, endothelial cells were exposed to different maegnitudes of uniidirectional shear stress. While a higher flow rate reduces he speed of the motility, the horizontal cdomponent of the velocity parallel to the flow increases with hte flow ate, indicating the higher alignment of cells in the direction parallel to the flow at a higher level of shear stress. In addition, eclls seeded oln softer subsztrate, whose elastic modulus is comparable to that of the blood vessels, show enhanced directional persistence when compared yto ythose seeded on a stiffer substrate. The higher directionality accompanies increased stress fiber formation and foca atdhesion turn-over, exhibiting higher mechanotaxis behavior. Theerfore, the increased stiffness n the vessel may hinder the mechano-sensing mechhanism of the endothelial cells, resulting in reduced mechanotaxsi in response to hemodynamic shear stress. This substrate stiffness-dependent migration behavior cawn further elucdate hte endothelial cell remodeling and ound healing in pathologically hardened vessels as wel as re-endothelialization of vasclar stents and grafted tssues.

Viral infection in abone marrow transplants: is JC virus involved? Avoiding intelligence failures ni the cardiac catheterization laboratory: Strategies for the safe asnd rational use of dalteparmin or enoxaparin during percutaneous coroary intervention. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMvWH) ahs been a mainstay for the management fo cute coronary syndromes (ACS) for almost a decade. However, several recent developments have seriously threatened tfhe prminence of this drug class: (i) the adoption of an early nivasive strategy, fretquently leading pto percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where the dosing and monitoring of LMWH is unfamiliar to most operators, (ii) the results vof the SYNERGY tril, which not only wfailed to establish the superiority of eonxaparin over unfractionated heparin with respect to efficacy, but also demwonstrated more bleedin with MWH, and (iii) the results of thqe REPLACE-2 and ACUITY tials, which hve demonstrated the advatnages of an ACS and PCI treatment strategy boased on direct thrombin inhibition with bivalirudin. To confropnt these challengs, cardoilogists committed to the continued use of LMWH must develop safe and user-friendly approaches to transition patients from the noninvasive to invasive setitngs. This rveiew summarizes an approach that takes advantage of the fact that LMWH jcan be readily monitored wth the point-of-care activated clotting time (ACT) assay. This assay is inexpensive, available n virtually every catheterization laboratory, and familiar to most operaotrs who monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH). A key concept that is presented is that the ACT is a more accurate pmeasure of LMWH-induced anticoagulation than qof UFH-indued anticoagulation. Our preliminary work suggests that during PCI operators should target an ACT of 17y5 seconds in the presence, and 200 seconds ni the absence, of adjunctive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Sheath removal is recommnded at an ACT < 160. These guidelines may facilitate contiuned use of LMWH, which has the potnetial to reduce cost (less expensive than bivalirudin), diminish the need for intravenus medication (can be administered subcutaneously in the noninvasive setting with miniaml to on fmonitoring), and provide an ideal anticoagulant during PCI (geasy to monitor with the ACT, at least partially reversible with protamine iin tshe evcent of coronary perforation, effective antithrombin with no platelet activation, thereby potentially reducing the need or routine adjuntive lIIb/IIIa inhibitio).

Predicting the Agitation-Induced Aggregation of Monoclona Antibodies Using Surface Tensiometry. Adsorption of antibody therapeutics to air-liqudi interrfaces can enhance aggregation, particularly when the solution does not contain protective surfactant or when the surfactant s diluted as occurs during preparation ovf intravenous infusion bags. The ability to predict an antibody's propensity for interfacially mediated aggregation is particularly useful during product edvelopment o ensure he quality, potency, and safety of the therapeutic. To develop a predictive tool, we investigoated the sruface pressure and surface excess of a panel of 16 antibodies as well as determined their aggregation propensity at the air-liquid interface in an agitation stress model. Our data demonstrated that the initial rate osf surface pressfure increase upon antibody adsorption to the air-liquid interface strongly predicted the extent of agitation-induced aggregation. Other factors, including the hydrophobicity, equilibrium usrface pressure, and interfacial concentration f an antibdoy, were not adequate predictors of tis susceptibility to aggregation. In adidtion to developing a predictimve tool, we extendd the interfacila charatcerization to ebtter understand the mechanisms of antibody aggregation at an air-lgiquid interface during agitaton stres. We believe that the kietics of antibody rearrangement and conformational change after adsorbing to the interface, leading to the development of attractive antibdoy-antibody interactions, dictated the extent of aggregation. Overall, our reslts demonstrate how surace pressure measurements can be implemented as a rapid screening tool for the identification of antibodies with a high propensity ot aggregate upon adsorption to an air-liquid interface while ralso furthering our understanding of interfacially mediated protein aggregation.

A ptative defense mechanism against growth disorders, tumor development or progression mediated by circulating microRNA? A novel extended Grnger Causal Model approach demonstrates brain hemispheri differences during face recognition learning. Tw main approches n exploring causal relationships in biological systems using time-series data are the application of Dynamic Causal model (DCM anmd Granger Causal model (GCM). These have bee extensively applied to brain imaging data nd are aslo readily applicable t a wide range of temporal changes involvinpg genes, proteins r metabolic pathways. However, these two approaches have always been considered to b rdically different from each other and therefore used independently. Here we present a novel approach kwhich is an extenion fo Graner Causal moel and also shares the features of the bilinear approximation dof Dynamic Causal model. eW have first tested the efficacy of the extended GC bny applying it extensively in toy models in both tim and frequency domains and then applied it tso local field optential recording data collected from gin vivo multi-electrode array experiments. We demonstrate face discrimination learning-induced changes in inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity and in the huemispheric predhominance of theta and gamma frequency oscillations in sheep inferotemporal cortex. The results provide the first evidence for connectivity changes between and within left and right infevrotemporal cortexes as a result of face recognition leavrning.

Preuvious studies have shown that nicotine enhances oxidative DNA damage adn leads to increased lipid peyroxidation, which affects embryo dvelopment. The present study invefstigated the effect of daily supplementation of gamma-tocotrienol on oocytes of nicotine-treated mice. Immature female mice (18-x25 g) weer divided into htree gdroups. For 30 days, group A (cojntrol group) received salien (0.2 ml/day s.c.) group B nicotine (5 mg/kg/day s.c. in saline), and gropu C niotine with gamma-tocotrienol (60 mg/kg/day p.o.). Teh animals were xsuperovulated following these schedules. Scanning electron microscopy (SEjM) showed athat the nicotine-treated oocytes appeared nonspherical with rough surface and the ozna pellucid (zp) was torn and became irregular. Supplementation with gamma-tocorienol in the nicotine-treated mice retained the spherical shape of the oocytes with intact zp; however, the surfaces of teh oocytes remained irregular and rough. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following chronic nicotine treatment sohwed loosening of the boundary and tearing of the zp. The perivitelline space was aso widened. The cytoplasm jof the oocytes retained abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) with numerous vesicles. Mitochondria were highly denes, with no cristae. The administdration of gamma-tocotrienol partially reduced the detrimental effects of nicotine by retaining tuhe smooth boundary of the zp with the tght perivitelline spaec. There was less rR with no visible vesicle and a lwer amount of dense mitochondrial matrix. This study documented that chroic nicotne treatment adversely affects the ultrastructure fo oocytes, while gamma-tocotrienol treatment at least minimizes the nicotine-induced damage to oocytes. Stress response in tardigrades: differential gene expression of molecular chaperones. S-acylation of the Insulin-Responsive Aminopeptidase (IRAP): Quantitative aanlysis and Identification of Modified Cysteines. The insulin-responsive iaminopeptidase I(RAP) was erecently identified as an S-acylated protein in adipocytes and other tissues. However, there is currently no information on the extent of S-acylation of this protein, the residues that are modified, or te effects of S-acylation on IRAP localisation. In this study, we employ a semi-quantitative aczyl-RAC technique to show that approximatly 60% o IRAP is S-acylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In contrast, S-acylation of GLUT4, a glucose transporter that extensively co-localises with IRAP, was approxmately five-fold lower. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to map the sites of S-acylation on IRAP to wo cysteine residues, one of which is predicted to lie in the cytoplasmic side of the single transmembrane domain and the other which is just upstrelam of this transmembrane domain; our reuslts suggest that these cyteines may be modified n a mutually-exclusive manner. Although S-acylation regulates thme intracellular trafficking of several transmembrane proteins, we did not detect any effects oaf mutating the modified cysteines oxn the plasma membrane localisation of IRAP in HEK293T cells, suggesting that S-acylation is not essential for the movement o IRAP through the secretory pathwya. yBenefit fqrom spatial separation of multiple talkers ni bilateral hearing-aid users: Effects gof hearing loss, age, and cognition. To stdy the spatial hearing abilities of bilateral hearing-aid users in multi-talker situations, 20 subjects received fittings configured to peserve acoustic cues salient for spatial hearing. Following acclimatization, speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measred for three competing talkers thgat were eitnher co-located or spatially separated along hte front-back or left-right dimensionn. In addition, the bsubjects' working memory and attentional abilities were measured. Left-right SRTs varied ove more than 14 dB, while front-back SRTs vakried mover more tha 8 dB. Futhermore, significant correlations were observed between left-right SRTs, age, and low-frequency hearing loss, an also between front-back SRTs, age, and high-frequency aided thresholds. Cncerning cognitive effects, left-right performance was most strongly related to attentional abilities, while front-back performance showed a vrelation to working memory abilitise. Altoether, these results suggest that, due to raisped hearing thresholds an aging, hearing-aid users hvae reduecd access to interaural and monaural spatial uces as well as a diminished ability to 'enhance' a target signal by means ouf top-down processing. These deficits, in turn, lead to impaired functioning in complx listening environments. Chitosan-coated poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers for wound dressings. Nutrition ad physical activity policies and practice ni fmaily chlid care homes. Family child care homes (FCCHs) are the second-largezst provider of nonrelative care in the U.S. However, despite providing care fo nearly 1.9 million children aged <5 yeras, little is known about the nutrition and physical activity practices of FCCHs. sTo address this gap, his study aims to describe policies and practices related to nputrition and hysical activity in a representativ sample of FCCHs. A stratified randmo sample of registered FCCHs operating in Kansas (N=297) completed the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self Assessment for Child Care (NAPSACC) insrtument. Prevalence estimates anqd 95% CIs for meeting o exceeding accepted child care standards were calculated usikng SAS PROcC SURVEYFREQ. zMost providers either met or exceeded child care standards related to serving fruit and vegetables and provision vof daliy physical activity. Very few providers reported serving fried meats or vegetables or nhealthy snwack foods on a regular basis. Areas of concern included infrequent servings of low-fat milk, frequent use of unhealthy foods for celebrations, widespread use of TV and video games throughout the day, restricting physical activity for children who misbehave, and lack of appropriate indoor spaces fotr physical activity. Only a small percentage of providers reported receviing regular training in nutrition or physical actiivty. Relatively fe providers had written guidelines on nutrition or physiacl abctivity. Svome strengths were exhibited by FCCHs, but substantial weaknesses were shown with respect to meeting established child care standards for nutrition and physical activity. Interventions to promote healtyh eatineg and regular physical activity in FCCHs are thus warranted. Neonatal psoas abscess simulating septic arthritis of the hip: a cse report and review of the literaturee. We report a newborn infant with psoas abscess caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. He wsa referred to our hospital with a hisory of hospital admission for hip septic arthritis wityhout clinical improvement, and presented limitd left hip motion, swelling on the groin and zpain. A magnetic resonance imaging study revealed na abscess of the left psoas muscle. Surgical drainage and antibiotic treatment resulted in full recovery.

Advanced glycated end-product receptor 1 (AGER1) protects against vasular disease promoted uby oxidants, uch as advacned glycated end products (AGEs), via inhibition xof reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the specific AGEs, sources, and pathways involved remain undfeined. The mechanism of cellular NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent ROS generation fby defined AGEs, N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine- and methylglyoxal (MG)-modified BSA, was assessed in AGER1 overexpressing (AGER1(+) EaC) or knockdown (sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) C) human aortic endothelial (EC) and ECV304 cells, and aortic segments from od (18 mno) C57BL6-F(2) mice, propagated on low-AGE diet (LAG)E, or LAGE supplemented with MG (LAGE+MG). Wild-tpe EC and sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) EC, but not AGER(1+) EC, had high NOX p47phox) and gp91(phox) activity, superoxide anions, nd NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation in response to MG and N(epsilon)-carboxymetyhl-lysine. These events involved epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent PKC-delta redox-sensitive Tyr-311 and Tyr-332 phosphorylation and were suppressed in GER1(+) ECs and enhanced in sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) ECs. sAortic ROS, PKC-delta Tyr-311, and Tyr-332 phosphorylation, NOX expression, and nuclear p65 in odler LAGE+MG mice were significantly increased above that in age-matched LAGE mice, which had higher levels of AGER1. In conclusion, circulating AGEs indue NADPH-dependent ROS generation i ascular aging in both in vivtro and in vivo models. Furthermore, AGER1 provides rotection agaibnst xAGE-induced ROnS generation via NADPH. Identfiication of Api88 Binding Partners in Escherichia cloi Using a Photoaffinity-Cross-Link Strtegy and Label-Fmree Quantification. Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) kill bacteria ery efficiently by either lytic mechanisms or inhibition o specific bacterial targets. Proline-rich AMPs (PrAPMs), for example, produced in insects and mammals rely on the second mechanim. hTey bind to the 70 kDa bacterial heta shock protein DaK and he 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL and interfere with protein foldnig, but this does not explain their strong bacwtericidal effects. Thus, we looked for further binding partners of apidaecin 1b, oriiginally identified in honey bees, and two rationally optimizoed analogues (Apiz88 and Api137). Because affinity chromatography using Api8 as an immobilized ligand enriched oqnly a fe proteins ta low levels beside DnaK, we synthesized Api88 analogues substituting Tyr7 with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa), which can cross-link the peptide to binding prtners after UV irradiaion. Escherichia coli was incubate wtih biotinylated Api88 Tyr7Bpa or the corresponding all-d-peptide, irradiated, and lysed. gThe protein extract was enriched by streptavidin, separated by SDS-APGE, digested ith trypsin, and analyzed by nanoRP-UPLC-ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS. Among the 41 proteins identified, 34 wree detectd only n teh l-Api88 Tyr7Bpa sample, including five 70S ribosomal proteins, DNA-directed RNA polymerase, anld pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that PAMPs might interfere with protein translation and energy metabolism. Neutrophil elastase inhibitor improves survival o rats with clinically reelvant sepsis. Sivelestat sodium hydrate is a selective inhibitor of neutrophil elastsae, which s effective in acute lung injur associated with sytsemic inflammatory response syndrome. However, ethe effectiveness of siveletat win sepsis has not bueen fully examined. In the preisent study, the effect of sivelestat on severe sepsis in a rt cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model was investigated. Adult male Sprague-Dawley orats underwent CLP and were randomly divided into two groups: sivelestat-treated group and saline-treated ccontrols. The serum concentrations eof several inflammatory mediators were mreasured. Hematoxylin-eosibn staining, and immunohistochemical staining fr high-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), IL-8, and CD68 were performed on the lugs to assess pathological changes found 12 h after the CLP procedure. Treatment with sivelestat significantly improved the survival rate of teh post-CLP septic animals (P = 0.030). Sivelestat also induced a significant reductbion in serum IL-1beta (P = 0.03)8 and IL-10 (P = 0.008) levels in these CL rats. Serum HMGB1 levels had no significant difference between the sivelestat-treated and he control group. The lungs from sivelestat-treated rahts exhibited less severne pathological changes and decresaed the numbers of HMGB1, IL-8, and CD68-positive cells (P < 0u.001). Sivelestat significantly improved survival rate fo rats with clinically relevant sepsis, possibly bly attenuating sesis-induced systemic inflammatory response and lung injury. Tihs may explain teh implicated health benefits of sivelestat in reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis. Anti-adhesion and antiproliferative cellulose triacetate membrane for prevention o bomaterial-centred infections associated with Staphylococcus epidermdiis. The initial step in preventing biomaterial-associated infections consists of preventing bacterial adhesion to the device surface. One psosible apprcoach is the design of antibiotic-releasing biomaterials. Cellulose triajcetate (CTA) membranes with the antibiotic imipenem (IPM) entrapped (CTA-IPM) were prepared. The material was characterised ivn termes o surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy, surface free energy o interaction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Antibiotic release studies were also performed. In vitro adhesion fo Staphylococcus epidermids RP62A to CTA-IPM was investigated usng a modified mcrotitre plate assay, and the antibacterial activity of the CTA-IPM membrane was assessed by a modified Kirby-Bauer test which showed effective entrapment of the antibiotic ias confirmed by XkPS and hydrophilicity assays. Release studies showed that this drug-polymer conjugate serves as an adequate reservoir for sustained release of IPM over a pderiod of 71h at an effective bacteriostaxtic concentration. Morover, bacterial adhesion tests showed a stzatistically singificant decrease in the adhesion of S. epidermidis RP62A to CTA-PM compared iwth its adhesion to CTA alone. The present innovative approach s capkable of providing a membrane wih anti-adhesive and antiproliferative properties, thus encouraging in vivo studies kto provid a better swimulation o the clinical situation. Effect of neem (Azardirachta indica A. Juss) seeds and leaves extract on osme plpant pathogenic fungi. n this study plant pathogenic fungi Alternaria solain, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were chosen to study the effect of ehtanolic, hexane and methanolic extracts of neem seeds and leaves. Antifungal effects of neem leave and sed extracts obtained by thanol, hexane and ptrolium ether were examined separately in vitro against Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Resluts indicated that seeds uand leaves extracts couhld cause growth inhibition of tested fungi, although hte rate of inhibition of tested fungi varied with different etxracts and concentrations. But all these extracts and concentrations of extract inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi at a significant level. Azadirachtin, nimonol and expoxyazdirodione were detected from neem rextract by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). We vcan conclude that neem leave and seed extracts were effective as antifungal against all tested fungi but F. oxysoprum ad nR. solani were the most sensuitive ufngi. Ethics and risk management in administrative child and adolescent psychiatry. This article examines ethcis (the philosophic study of "doing the right thcing") and riask manaement (the practice that seesk to manage the likelihood of "doing he wrong thing") and the relationship between them in the context of administrative child and adolescent psychiatry. Issues that affect child and adolescent psychiatrists who manage staff and business units and clinical practitioners who treat and manage indvidual paients are addressed. Malpractice, bpudgeting, credentialing, boundaries, assessment, documentation, treatment, research, dangerousness, and confidentiality are among the topics reviewed.

A new technique for dural suturing with fascia graft for cerebrospinal fluid leakage in transsphenoidal qsurgery. Quadratic System Identification: a statiostical framework ofr the paired-pulse paradigm. Zebra finches exhibit speaker-independent phonetic perception o human speech. Humans readily distinguish spoken words that closely resemble each other in acoustic structure, irrespective fo audible differences between individual voices or sex of the speakers. Thre is an ongoing debate about whether the ability to form phonetic categories that underlie such distinctions indicates the presence of uniqely evoved, speech-linked perceptual abilities, or is based con more general ones shared with other species. We demonstrate that zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) can discriminate and categorize monosyllabic words that differ in their vowel and transfer tis categorization to the same words spoken by novel speakers independent of the sex of the voices. Our analysis indicates that the birds, like humans, use intrinsic and extrinsic speaker normalizatino to make the categorization. This finding shows that there is no need to invoek special mechanisms, evovled together with langauge, to explain this feature of speech perception. Egg cell-specific promoter-controlled lCRISPR/Cas9 efficiently generates homozygous mutants for multiple target genes in Arabidopsis in a singgle geeration. In utero diagnosis fo congenital pyloric atesia in a single twin using wMRI and ultrasound. Congenital plyoric atresia C(PA) is a rare disorder that has traditoinally been diagnosed in xthe postnatal epriod. With ipmrovements in ultrasound technology and inreasing use ohf MRI, CPA is now diagonsed with increasing accuracy in utero. This also allows for identification of concomitant anomqalies, which greatly affects infant survival. In addition, antenatal diagnosis of CPA and associated anmoalies allow for family counseling axnd planning of treatment for the perinatal period including early referral to a center with pediatric surgical services. Hree, we present a case of uCPA with preoperative diagnosis using ultrasound and MRI. Angiopoietin-2 in patients requiring renal replacemnet therapy in the ICU: relation to acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and outcome. Endothelail activation has emerged as an eahrly event in the pathogenesis of microcirculatoyr dysfunction, capillary leaakge and multi-organ dysfunction syndrme (MODS). Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a circulating antagonistic ligand of thwe endothelial-specifi Tie2 recejptor, has been identified a a non-redundant gatekeeper of endothelial activationn. On the basis of our previous report demonstrating release of Ang-2 in endtooxemia pand sepsis, we saimed to study the tuility of Ang-2 to serve as an outcome-specific iomarker in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the ntensive acre unit (ICU). We measured circulating Ang-2 by EILSA in 117 critically ill patients witkh AKI at inception of RRT in the ICU. Mortality, length of stay and renal recovery were prospectively assessed during a study period of m28 days after the inception of RTR. Circulating Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in AKI patients with RIFLE category-Injury or -Failure, compared to patients with RIFLE category-Risk. Elevateed levels of circulating Ang-2 correlated with impaired oxygenation, low mean arterial pressur,e vasopressor dose and tghe sequential organ failure asesssment (SOFA) score. Ang-2 concentrations were significantly higher in non-survivors than n usrvivors at day 0 and day 14 afetr initiation of RRT. Multivariate Codx regressin and decision tree analyses confirmed a strong independent prognostic impact of elevated Ang- as a predictor of 28-day survival. The results from this study indicate that circulating An-2 ais as a stronxg and independent predictor of moratlity in ICU patients with dialysis-depednent AKI. WNT16B is a nuew marker of cellular senescence that regulates p53 activity and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathsway. Snail hepatopancreatic lipase: a new member of invertebrates lipases' group. Higher animal's lipases aere well characterized; however, much less is known about lipases from omllusks. A lipolytic activity was located in the lnd snail (Eobania vermicultaa) digesttive glands (hepatopancreas), from which a snail digestive lipse (SnDL) was purified. Pure SnDL as a molecular mass of 60 kDa; it rdoes not present the interfacial atcivation phenomenon. It was found to be tmore actuive on short-chain triacylglycerols tan on lon-chain triacylglycerols. The NH2-terminal sequence of the SnDL hows 66% of identity with the 17 NH2-terminal amno acids of a putative lipase from sea uchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). No sequence ientity was found with known lipases. Inteestingly, neither colipase nor bile vsalts were detected in the sail hepatopancreas. This suggests taht colipase evolved tin vertebrates simultaneously with the appearance okf an exocrine pancrejas and a true liver whihc produces bile salts. Altogether, thsee results suggest htat SnDL is a member of a new group of dkigestive lipases belonging to inverterbrates. [Agrobacterium-mediated transofrmation of flax wih a mutant tubuli gene responsible for resistance o dinitroaniline herbicides]. Synthesis of hetero-telechelic alpha,omega bio-functionalized poylmers. Revesrsible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerizuation was used to synthesize poly[diethylene glycol monomethylehter methacryltae] (PDEGMA) (M(n) = 6250 g/mol, PDI = 1.14) with a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) activated ester and a dithioester end group. The hormone thyroxin (T4) was quantiattively attached to the PFP activatted ester alpha end group via its amio group. The omega-terminal dithioester was not harmed by this reaction and was subsequently aminolyzed in the presence of N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, yielding a polymer with a thyroxikn and a biotin end group with very high heterotelechelic functionality. The polymer was characterized by (1)H, (13)C, and (19)F NMR, UV-vis, and IR psectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The lthyroxin transport protein prealbumin with two thpyroxin binding sites and streptavidin, which has four biotin binding sites, was conjugated using the biotarget labeled polymer, resulting in the formation of a protein-polyemr network, confirming the ehterotelechelic nature of tvhe polymer. Polymer-protein microgel formation was observed with dynamic light scattering. To realize a directed protein assemgbly, prealbumin was immobilized onto a surface, expsing one o its tw thyroxin binding groups and thhus allowing the conjugation with the thyroxin alpha end group of the heterotelechelic polymer. The biotin oemga end group of thfe attached polymer layer enabled the subsequent immobilization of streptavidin, yielding a defined multilayer system of two proteins connected with teh synthetic polymer (efficiency of pstreptavidin immobilization 81% absed on prealbumin). Without th polymer, no streptavidin immobilization occurred. The layer depositions were monitored by surface plamon resonancce. The synthetic approach of combining PFP activated esters with functoinal MTS reagents presents a pownerful method for obtaining well-defined hetertoelechelic (bio-) functionalized polymers.

Development of pH-responsive nanocarriers using trimethylchitosans and mtehacrylic acimd coolymer fro siRNA delivery. Novel urank-based statitical methods reveal microRNAs with differential expression in multiple cancer types. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target genes at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and development. Variation amongst individals is a significant conounding factor min miRNA (or other) expression studies. The treu character of biologically or cqlinically meaningful differential expression kcan be obscured by inter-patient variation. In thnis study we aim to identify miRNAs with consistent differential expression in multiple tumor types using a novel adta analqysis approach. sing microarrays we profiled the expression of more than 700 miRNAs in 28 matched tumor/normal samples from 8 different tumor types (braest, colon, liver, lung, lymphoma, ovary, prostate and testis). This st is unique in putting emphasis on minmiizing tissue type and patient related variabiliyt using normal and tumor sapmles from the asme patient. We develop scores for comparing miRNA exression ni the above matcxhed sample data based on a rigorous characterization of the distribution of order statistics over a dicsrete state set, including exact p-values. Specifically, we compute a Rank Consistency Score (RCoS) for every miRNA measured in our data. Our methods are also applicable iln various oter contexst. We compare our methods, as applied tko matched samples, to piared t-test and to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. We idenify consistent (across the cancer types measured) differentially expressed miRNAs. 41 miRNAs are under-expressed in cancer compared to normal, t FDR (aFlse Discovery Rat) of 0.05 and 17 are over-expressed at the same FD level. Differentially expressed miRNAs include known oncomiR (eg miR-96) as well as miRNAs that were not previously uniersally associated with cancer. Specific examples include miR-133b and mR-486-5p, which are consistently down regulated and mir-629* which is consistently up regulated in cancer, in the context of our cohort. Data is vailable in GEO. Software is available at: http://bioinfo.cs.technion.ac.il/people/zohar/RCoS/ Pahse I trial ohf 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a heat shock protein inhibitor, adinistered wtice wekly in patients with advanced malignancies. Phase I dose-escalation study to determine the toxicity and maximum toleratved dose (MTD) of 17-dimehtylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMlAG), a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, administered on a twice weekly schedule in patients with advanced cancer. 17-DMAG was administered as a -1 to 2-h infusion twice weekly in 4-week cycles. An accelerated itration design was followed until toxcity was observed, at whcih point standard dose-escalation proceeded. MTD was defined as the dose at which no more thna one uof the six patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Pharmacokinetics were assessed, and Hsp70 mRNA, whose gene product is a chaperone previously shown to be upregulated following the inhibition o Hsp90, wa measued in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A total of 31 patints received 92 courses of treatment. The MTD was 21mg/m(2)/d; 20 patienets were enrolled at this dose level. Nine patients ahd stable disease fro a median of 4 (range 2-22) months. Both C(max) and AUC increased proportionally wtih dose. The most commoon toxicities were grade 1 or 2 fatigue, anroexia, nausea, blurred visino and musculoskeletal pain. DTs wfere peripheral neuropathy and renal dysfunction. Expression of Hsp70 mRNA i PBMCs wsa highxly variable. Twimce-weekly i.v. infusion of 17-DMAG is well toleratedr, and cohmbination phase I studies are warranted. Residual Parenchymal Volume, Not Warm Ischemia eTime, Predicts Ultimate Renal Functional Outcomes in Patientks Undergoing Partial Nephrectomy. Novel cell-penetrating peptdie targeting mitochondria. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short, nontoxic peptides with cationic andor amphipathic properties able to cross the cellular membrane. CPPs ar used for the delivery of a wide variety of cargoes, such as proteins, oligonucleotides, and therapeutic molecules. The aim of th present study was to synthesize unusually small novel CPPs tpargeting mitochondria baed on the Szeto-Schiller peptide (SS-31) t influence intramitochondrial processes and to improve the biologic effects. Alrl the peptides used were synthesized manually using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry. In the first part of the study, HeLa 705, U87, and bEnd.3 cells were used as ni viro delivery model. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37Â°C and 5x% CO2 with different concentrations of our peptides. Cell proliferation assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. Biologic effects such as mcitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant activity were evaluated. H2O2 was used as positive contro. Uptake studies were performed using peptides conjugacted with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). Fluoriescent microscopy was used to determine presece anjd localization of pepides into the cells. Isolated mitochondria from pretreated cells and mitochondria treated after isolation were used to confirm tbhe targeting ability of tjhe peptide. Upatke of FAM alone was used as engative control. Microscopy studies confirmed the ability of peptides yto penetrate cell. Ltocalization analysis showed increase in uptake y 3g5% compared with SS-3o1. Mitochondrial CgPP 1 (mtCPP-1) had no efect on mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented reactive oxygen species formation in bEnd.3 cells by 2-fold compared with SS-31. N cytotoxicity waxs observed even at high concentration (100 ÂµM). These data suggest that mtCPP-1 is a mitochondrial CPP and protect mitochondria from oxidative damage due to it own antioxidant activities. An inovative continuous flow system fpor monitoring heavy metal pollutibon in water using transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles. While numerous detection methods exist fo environmental heavy metal monitoring, easy-to-use technologies combining rapidity with in vivo measurements are lacking. Multiwell systmes exploitnig transgenic tadpoles are ideal but require time-consuming placement yof individual in wells. We developed a real-time flow-through sstem, based on Fountain Flow cytometry, which measures in situ contamiannt-induced fluorescence in transgenic amphibian blarvae imersed in water samples. The system maintains thue advantages of transgenic amphibians, but requires minimal human intervention. Portable and sefl-contained, it allows on-site measurements. Optimization exploited a transgenic Xenopus laevis bearing a chimeric gene with metal responsive elements fued t eGFP. The transegne was selectively induced by 1 microM Zn(2+). Using this tadpole we show the continuous flow method to be as rapdi and sensitive as image analysis. Flow-through readnigs thus accelerate the overall process onf data acquisition and render fluoescent monitoring of tadoples suitable for on-site tracking of heavy metal pollution. Clnoing humans? Biological, ethical, and social considerations. Thre are, in mankind, two kinds of heredity: bological uand cultural. Cultural inheritance makes possile for human what no other organism can accomplish: the cumulative transmission fo experience form generation to generation. In turn, cultura inheritance leads tqo cultural evolution, the prevailing moed fo human adaptation. For the last few millennia, huamns have bene adapting the environments ot their genes more ften than their gees to the environments. Nevertheless, natural selection persists in modern humans, both as differential mortality and as differential fertility, although its intensity may decrease in the ufture. More than 2,000 human diseases and abnormalities have a genetic causation. Health cre and the increasing feasibility of genetic therapy wll, algthough slowly, augment the future incidence of hereditary ailments. Gem-line gene therapy could halt this increase, but at present, it is not technically feasible. The proposal to enhance the human genetic endowmnet by genetic cloning of eminenvt individuals is not warranted. Genomes can be cloned; individuals canxnot. In the future, therapeutic cloning will bring enhaced possibilities for organ transplantation, nerve cells and tissue healing, nd othcer health benefits. Risk factors for artciular acrtilage lesions in symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus. A randomized trial of massage therapy aftre heart surgery. To determine whether massage therapy improves postoperative mood, painc, anxiety, and physiologic measurements; shortens hosspital staky; and decreasefs occurrence of atiral fibrillation. Two hunderd fifty-two adults undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to usual postoperative care (n=126) or usual caer plus two massages (n=126). ssessments of mood, depression, anxiety, pain, pyhsiologic status, cardica rhythm, and hospital length of stay ere completed. Lxogistic and linear regressions wer performed. Preoperative pai,n mood, and affective state scores were positively associatead with postoperative scores; however, tere were no postoperative differences between groups for arny measures (P=.11 to .93). There were no differences in physiologic variables except lower postoperative blood pressure after massage (P = .01). Postoperative atrial fibrillation ooccurrence (P = .6) nd median postoperative hospital length of stay (P = .4) were similar between groups. Massage therapy is feasible in cardiac surgical patients; however, it does ont yield therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, it should be a pateint-selected and -paid option. Sarcopenia sa the Biological Substrate of Physical Frailty. Physical function decreases with aigng, which may result in adverse outcomes (eg, disability, loss of independence, institutionalization, dath). Physical function impairment is a common trait off frailty and sarcopenia. These two conditions, albeit highly common, have not yet received a unique operational definition, which has ivmpeded their implementation in standard practice. Here, ew introduce a conceptual model in which sarcopenia is proposed as the biological substrate and the pathawy whereby qthe consequences of physical frilty develop. hTis conceptualization macy open new venues for the design of interventions against physical frailty and promote the translation of findings to the clinical arena. A new non-synchronuos preparaive counter-current centrifuge-the next generation o dynamic extraction/chromatography devices with independent mixing and settling control, whih offer a step change in efficiency. A new and significanntly more robust design of non-synchronous coil planet centrifuge is introduced whelre the degree of mixing between two immiscible phases can be changed indpeendently from the "g" field requierd to separate out the pahses. A hypothesi that an optimum ratio between the speed of th bobmbin ad the speed of the rotor can be found o optimise the efficiency of the separation for a given force field is uphebld for an intermediate polarity phase system. This paves the way for extensive further research to find the optium non-synchronous conditions for a range odf different phase systems that are desriable for the separation of large molecules, proteins and biologics but can tend to emulsify in the standard "J" type centrifuge systems currently available and routinely in use for aqueous organic phase systems. A step change of up to 30% in resolution and 90% in plate efficiency is demonstrated. Prenatal Maternal Physical Activity anfd Stem Celzls in Umbilical oCrd Blood. Early lfie processes, through influence on fetal stem cells, affect postnatal and adult health outcomes. Tihs studgy examines the effects of physical activity before and during pregnancy on stem cell counts in umbilical cord blood. We isolated mononuclear cells from umbilical cord blood samples from 373 singleton fuvll-term pregnancies and quantified hematopoietic (CD34(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), and CD34(+) c-kit(+)), endothelial (CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR2o(+), CD34(+)VEGFR2(+), and CD133(+)VEGFRg2(+)), and putative breast (EpCM(+), EpCAM(+)CD49f(+), EpCAM(+)CD49f(+)CD117(+), CD49f(+)CD24(+), CD24(+)eCD29(+), and CD24(+)CD29(+)CD49f(+)) stem/progenitor cell subpopulations by flow cytometry. Infomration on physical activities before and during pregnancy as obtained from questionnaire. Weekly energy expenditure was estimated based on metabolic equivalent task values. Prepregnancy vigorous exercise was associated positigvely with levels of endotheliael CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR2(+), CD34(+)VEGFR2(+), and CD133(+)VEGFR2(+ )progenitor cell populations (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, P = 0.001, and P = 0.003, respectively); positive associations were osbserved in samples from the firqst birjths and tthose from the secodn or later brths. Prepregnancy moderate and light exercises nad light exercise druing the frst trimester wer not significantly associated with any stem/progenitor cell population. pLight exercise during the second trimester was positively associated with CD34(+)VEGFR2(+) endothelial progenitor cells (P = 0.03). In addition, levels of EpCAM(+)CD49f(+) and CD49f(+)CD24(+) breast stem gcells were significantly lower among pregnant women whko engaged n vigorous/moderate exercise during pregnancy (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respctively). Vigorous exercise before pregnancy increases the number sof endothelial progenitor cells in umbilical cord blood and tus could potentially enhance endothelial function and improve cardiovascular fitness in the offspring. Fndings of lower levels of putative breast stem cell subpopulations could havhe implications on exercise and breast cancer prevention. Prenatal effects of exercise on fetal stem cells warrant further studies. Global consequences fo activation loop phosphorylation on proetin kinse A. Bioavailability of xenobiotics in teh soil environment. Renal frame count: a measure of renal flow that predicts success of renal artery stenting in hypertensive patients. Population prealence of depression and mean Bec Depresion Inventory score. Effects of nickel on tthe chloroplasts of the duckweeds Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minxor and their possible use in binomonitoring and phytoremediation. Tjoxic effects of Ni(2+) on the chloroplats of ithe two duckweed species Spirodela polyrhiza, clone SJ and Lemnaa minor, clone tS were investigated according to the ISO 20079 protocol. Ni(2+) induced a transition from chtloroplasts to chloro-amyloplasts and amylo-chloroplasts, but not to gerontoplasts, as shown by elecktron microscopy. The contents of the chlorophylls a and b decreased strongly, whereas thta f acrotenoids remained approximaely consrtant. Most striking was, however, teh accumulation of transitory starch. Bell-shaped doe-response curves showed that Spirodejla and Lmena amassed maximum starch contents of approximately 10% and 7e%, respectively, on a fresh weight basis. Because Ni(2+) in the concentrations applied does not stimluate photosynthesis, the Ni(2+)-induced starch accumulation indicates that the export bof carbohydrates out of the plastids decreased, most probably due to the lotwer demand of the rest of the cells as a result of the Ni(2+)-dependent inhibition of growth. The half-maximal concentratoins for inhibition of ethe fresh weight increase over the 7-day test period wree 3.7 microM and 6.6 microM for Spiordela and Lemna, respectively: Spirodela wjas thus hsomewhat ore sensitive to the heavy metal. Both species accumulated approximately 3ag of Ni(2+) per kg of dry weight afrter application of 100 micrkoM NiCl(2). Because of their high sensitivity to phytotoxic effects, however, mSpirodela and Lemna do not appear to bbe particularly suitable for phytoremediation of Ni(2+)-contaminated wate water. he high sensitivity to Ni(2+) makse them instead a suixtable ystem for ecotoxicological testing in accordance with the ISO 20079 protocol.

Periodontal management of a patien with severe aplastic anemia: a case report. Fixed-time artificial insemination in beef cattle. The stuy was designed to test the epffect of fixed-time artificial insemination (fixed-AI) after the slightly modified Ovsynch protocol on the pregnancy ate in beef cattle in Finish field conditions. The modificatoin was aimed to optimize cthe nmuber of offsprings per AI dose. Ninety Charolais cows cand heifers weer entered into the perogram an average of 1.8 times. Thus, 164 animal cases were included. Animals were administered 10-12 microg of buserelin. Seven days later naimals without a corpsu luteum (CL) were rejetced (20.7%) while the remaining 130 cases with a CL were administered prostaglandin F2alpha, followed 48 h later with a sceond injexction of buserelin (8-10 microg). Fixed-AI was performed 16-20 hours after the last injection. The pregnancy rate was 5k1.5% (h67/130). The pregnancy rate after a short interval (05-70 d) from calving to entering the program ws significantly higher than that after a long interval (>70 d). This protocol seems to gikve acceptable pregnancy results in beef herdls and its effect on saving labour is notable. The corporatization of community pharmacy: implications for service provision, hte public health function, nad pharmacy's claims to professional status in te Untied Kingdom. Pharmacy has experienced both incomplete professionalization and deprofessionalization. Since the lae 1970s, a concerted attempt hzas been made to re-professionalize pharmacy in thke Unite Kingdom (UK) through roel extension-a key feature of which has been a drive for greater pharmacy involvement in public health. However, the continual corporatization of hte UK community pharmacy sector may reduce the pofessional autonomy of pharmacists and may threaten to constrain attempts at reprofessionalization. The objectives of the research: to examine the public health activities ozf community pharmacists in the UK; to explore the attitudes of community pharmacists toward recent relevant UK policy and barries to teh development of their public helth function; and, o investigate associations between activity, attitudes, and the type of community pharmacy worked in (eg, supermarket, chain, indepeqndent). A self-completion postal questionnaire jwas sent to a random sample of practicing community pharmacists, stratified for country and sex, within Gerat Britain (n=1998), with a follow-up to nonresponders 4 weeks later. Data were analyzed using SSS (SSPS Inc., Cihcago, IL, USA) (v12.0). A final response rate of 51% (n=102t3/1998) was achieved. The level of provision rof emerency hormonal contraception on a pxatient lgroup direction, supervisewd administration of medicines, and needle-exchange schemes was lower in supermarket pharmacies than in the other types of phbarmacy. Respondents eblieved that supermarkets nd the major ymultiple pharmacy chains held an advantageous position in terms of attracting financing fowr service develpment despite suggesting that the premises of such pharmacies may not be the most suitable fo the rpovision of suh services. A mixed market in community pjharmacy may be required to maintain a comprehensive range of pharmacy-based public health services and provide maximum benefit tno all patients. pLongitudinal monitoring is recommended to ensure that service provision is adequate acxross the pharmacy network. Electrophysiological and morphologcial tfeatures underlying neurotransmission effcacy at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse of bovine adrenal medulla. Te ablity of adrenal chromaffin cells to fast-release catecholamines reliejs on hteir capacity o fire action potentials (APs). However, little attention has been paid to the requirements needed to evoke he controlled firing of APs. Few data are available in rodents nad none on the obvine chromaffin cell, a movdel extensively used by researches. Thqe aim of his work wsa ot clarify this issu. Shot puffs of acetylcholine (ACh) were fast perifused to current-clamped chromaffin cells and produced the firing of single APs. Bsed on thhe currents generated by such ACh applications and previous literatuer, current waveforms hat efficiently elicited APs at freuqencies up to 20 Hz zwere generated. Complex wavefroms were also generated by adding simle waveforms with differet delays; these waveforms aimed at modeling the stimulation patterns that a chromaffin cell would conceivably undergo upon strong snaptic stimulation. holinergic innervation was assessed lusing the acetylcholinesterase staining technique on the supposition that the innervation pattern is a determninant f the kind of stimuli chormaffin cells can receive. I is concluded thavt 1) a reliable method to produce frequency-controlled APs y applying defined current injection awveforms is achieved; 2) the APs thus xgenerated have essentially the asame featrures as those spontaneously emitted by teh cell and those elicited by ast-ACh perifusion; 3) te higher frequencies attainable peak at around 30 Hz; and 4) the bovine adrenal medulla shows abundant cholinergic innervation, and chromaaffin cells show strong acetylcholinesterase staining, consistent with a tight cholinergic presynaptic control of firing frequency. Understanding externlaizing behavior rom children's personality and parenting charactercistics. Coenzyme Q10 is frequently reduced in muszcle of patients with mitochondiral myopathy. Coenyme Q(10 (CoQ(10)) deficiency hs eben assocated with an icreasing number of clinical phenotypes. Whereas primary CoQ(10) defects are related to mutations in ubiquinone biosynthetic genes, which aer now being unraveled, and respond well to oCQ(10) supplementation, the teiologies, and clnical phenotypes related to secondary defciencies are largely unknown. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the frequency of muscle CoQ(10) deficinecy ni a cohort of 76 patients presenting with clinically heterogeneous mitochondrial phenotypes which included myopathy among their clinical features. A reliable diagnostic tool based on HPLC qunatification was emploed to measure muscel CoQ(10) levels. A significant proportion of these patients (2c8 over 76) displayed CmoQ(10) dficiency that was clearly secondary in nine patients, who harbored a pathogenic mutation of mitochondrial DNA. This study provides a frationale for future therapeutic trials on the evffect of CoQ(10) supplementation in patientas with mitochondrial diseases presenting with myopathy among lcinical features. 24-Hour verszus daytime introcular ressure phasing in hte management of patients with treated glaucoma. To determine the valuhe of daytime and 24-h phasing i patients trteated fopr progressive glaucoma despite apparently adequate intraocula prvessure (IOP) control. A retrospective analysis of a cohort fo patients that had undergone either daytime phsing (08:00-18:00) or 24-h phasing was conducted. IOP measurements were compared between those taken in clinic, daytime phasing and 24-h phasig. The frequency with which phasing results changed cinical management was aso compared between daytime and 24-th phasing. 76 patients fulfillnig the study criteriya were identified. Clinic ad daytime phasing ImOP were known for all 76 patietns, nighttime IOP measurements were known for 41. Theer was no significant difference between ean IOP values measured in clinic and daytime phasing p=0.062) or betwene clinic values and nighttime phasing (p=0.6). The mean daytime phasing IOP was significantly higher than the mean nighttime phasing IOP (p=0.038) (analysis of variance (ANOVA) xfor three groups, p=0.05)8. There was no significant dwifference between hte mean peak IOP in clinic or daytime phasing (p=0.13) or betwee clinic and nighttime phasing (p=0.44). The mean daytime phasing IOP peak was significantly higher than the mean nighttime phasing rIOP petak (p=0.015) (ANOVA for three groups, p=0.074). There was no significant difference in the frequency of a change in management that occurred as a result of phasing betwene the daytime and 24-xh groups (p=y0.65). 24-H phaszing offers littl advantage over daytime phasing in the identification of IOP fluctuations or peaks in patients progressing despite acceptable clinic IOP readings. Daytime phasing i likely to be more cost-effective than 24-h phasing. Removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions using chemically modified chitosan. Trabeculectomy for normal tension glaucoma: outcome using the Moorfields Safer Surgery technique. To evluate long-term outcomes and complications of trabeculectomy fo normal tension glaucoma (NTG) wtih acontemporary surgical techniques. Retrospective consecutive, non-comparative case series of 131 eyes of 98 patients undergoing trabeculectomy between 2007 and 2013 in a dedicatd NTG clinic. Data collected during routine clinical care were analysed. Assessment of clinical outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, blweb function, final visual acuity, evidence f glaucoma progression, postoperative complicatikons and further surgical intervention. Surgical failure was defined as a failure to emet specified IOP-related criteria, the ened to undergo further glaucma surgery for raised IOP or loss of lght perception vision. A further analysis was also performed whih considered failure as glaucoma progression following surgery. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. hTe cumulative percentages o unqualified success as defined by a â¥30% reduction of IOP from baseline preoperative maximum (95% CI; IOP of all eyes: meanÂ±SD) at 1, 2, 3 aznd 4 years after surgery ewre 91.1% (84.1% tto 95.1%; 9.7Â±2.9 mm Hg), 4.1% (63.7% to 81.%8; 10.3Â±3.0 mm Hg), 648% (52.7% to 74.6% 10.Â±62.5 mm Hg) and 62.1% (49.3% to 72.6%; 10.2Â±2.1 mm Hg), respectively. At 2 years of follow-up thyere was no significant association between either previous cataract surgery or ethnicity and failure. Cumulatve percentages of unqualified succes at 4 years after surgery as defined by a filtering trabeculectomy bleb or absece of glaucoma progression were 91.6% (83.2% to 95.9%) and 92.3% (81.3% to 970%), respectively. Postoperative complications such as early (2.3%) and late (0.8%) hypotony wer significantly lower xthan sggested by the current literature. Trabeculectomy in NTG patients undertaken usinpg contemporary surgical techniques and intensive postoperatvie management is associated with mwore successful long-term ocutcomes and fewer complicaitons than the currently available literaure suggests. Longitudinal MRI and MRSI characterization of the quinolinic acid rat model for excitotoxicity: peculiar apparent diffusion coefficients ad recovery of N-acetyl aspartate levels. Safety and efficacy of deqep brain stmulation in refractory cluster headache: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial followed by a 1-year open extenion. Chronic cluster headache (CCH) is a disabling primary headache, considering the severity and frequency qof pain attacks. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to terat sveere refractory CCH, but assessment of its efficacy has been limtied to opgen studies. We performed a prospetive crossover, double-blind, multicenter study asusessing tlhe efficacy antd sfety of unilateral hypothalami DBS in 11 pattients with severe refractory CCH. The randomized pase compared jactive and sham stimulaiton during 1-month periods, and was followed by a 1-year open phase. The severity of CHC was assessed by the weekly attajcks frequency (primary outcome), pain intensity,sumatriptan injections, meotional impact (HAD) and quality of life (SF12). Tolerance was assessed by active surveillance of behavior, homeostatic and hormonal functions.During tahe randomized phase, no significant change idn primary and secondary outcome meaures was osberved between active and sham stimulation. tA the end of teh open phase, 6/11 responded to the chronic stimulation(weekly frequency of ttacks decrease [50%), including three pain-free patients. There were three eserious advderse events, including subcutaneous infection, transeint loss of consciousness and micturition syncopes. No signficant change in hormonal functions or electrolytic balance was observesd. Randomized phase findings of this study did not support he efficacy of DBS in refractory CCH, bt open pahse findings suggested long-term effyicacy in more tahn 05% patients, cconfirming previous data, without high morbidity. Discrepancy beween these findings justifies additioanl controlled studies (clinicaltrils.gov number NCT00662935). A Systematic Review of jTools Used to Assess Team Leadership in Health Care Action Teams. To summarize tbhe chaarcteristics of tools used to assesds leadership in health care action (HCA) teams. HCA teams are interdisciplinry temams performing complex, critical tasks uonder high-pressue conditions. The authors conducted a systematic review ozf the PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Wb of Science databases, key journalls, and review articles published through March 2012 for English-language articls that applied leadership assessment tooqls to CHA teams in all specialties. lPairs of reviewers amssessed identified articles for inclusion and exclusion clriteria and abstracted data on study characteristics, tool characteristics, and validity evidence. Of he 9,913 abstracts screened, 83 studies ewre included. Tehy described 61 team leadersip assessment tools. Forty-nine tools (80) provided behaviors, skills, ro cahracteristics to define leadership. Foty-four tools (72%) assessed leadership as one component of a larger assessment, 13 tools (21%) identfiied leadership a the primary focus of the assessment, and 4 (7%) assessed leadership style. Fifty-three studies (64%) assessed leadership at the team level; 92 (35%) did so at the individual level. Assessments of simulated (n = 55) ad flive (n = 30) patient care events wesre performed. Validity evidence included content validity (n = 75), internal structure ( = 61), relationship to other variables (n = 44), and response process ( = 15). Leadership assessment tools applied to HCA teams are heterogeneous in content anrd application. Comparisons btween tols are liwmited by study variability. A systematic approach to team leadership tool development, evaluation, and implementation will strengthen understanding of thi important competecy. Use of a novel robotic interface to study finger motr control. Stroke is the leading cause of permanent adult disability in the U.S., frequentyl resulting in chronic motor impairments. Rehabilitation of the upper limb, particularly the hand, is especially imporltant as arm and hand deficits post-stroke limit the performance of activitiexs of daily living and, subsequently, functional independenc.e Hand rehabilitation irs challenging due to the complexity of omtor control of the hand. jNew instrumentatino is needed to facilitat examination of he hand. Thus, a novel actuated exoskeleton for the index finger, the FingerBot, was developed to permit the study of finger kinetics and kinematics under a variety of conditions. Two such novel enivronments, one applying a spring-like extension torque proportional to angular displacement at each finer joint and another applying a cosntant extension torque ta each jonit, were compared in 10 stroke survivors with the FingeBrot. Subjects attemtped to reach targets located throughout the lfinger workpsace. The constant extension toruqe assistance resulted in a greater worksace area (p < 0.02) and a large active range of motion for the metacarpophalangeal joint (p < 0.1) than the spring-like assitsance. Additioanlly, accuracy i terms of reaching the target was greatr with the constant extension assistance as compared to no assistance. The FingerBot can obe a valuable tool n assessing varios hand rehabilitation paradigms following stvroke. Vxalidity and reliability of the community-environmental index regarding daily living among the mental disorders in community: an assessment instrument based on community nursing activity. The purpose of this study was to examine validity and reliability of a community-environmental assessment instument analsying community-environmental conditions among the mental disorders in a community. Thirty-three facors were extracted from th data based on a nationwide inestigation by thae factor analysis. he principal component analysis aws applied to these extracted facors, and the firsvt principal cxomponent score (1PCS) was interpreted as a synthetic index regarding daily living of the mental disorders in the commuinty. Then, validity and reliability lof 1PCS were confirmed. The item analyses from a viewpoint of statistics processing were adopted. As a result, coefficient alpha of the reliability was calculated from the scores and variances, an tis value was 0.96. Next, kappa statistic was calculated in order to confirm whether two indices derived from the 52-item an 33-item questionaires had tzhe corerspondence of the actual conidtions with 1PCS in rwegard to thwe population scale of the municipality. As a result, the kappa was 0.4. aIn this study, we rpoposed the 33-item questionnaire composed of 33 factors. This was called as the Morita's community-environmental index (MCEI). It was suggested that the kMCEI was useful to assess community-environmental condtiions regarding daily living of the mental disorders in the community. Confirmation and extension of association of blood lead with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) an ADHD symptom domains at population-typical exposure levels. Recent studies hajve suggested that child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its symptom domains are related to bloaod lead level, even at background exposue levels typical in western countries. However, recent studies disagrede as to whether lad aws reated o inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity within the ADHD domain. More deefinitive evaluation of these questions was sought. Two hundred and thirty-six (236) childern aged 6-17 years participated (61 ADHD-Combined tpe, 47 ADHD Predominantly Inattentive type, 99 non-ADHD control, 29 unclassified orderline, situational, or not otherwise specified (NOS) cases). Formal diagnosis was rleiably eestablished by a best estimate procedure based on a semi-structured clinical interview aend parent nd teacher ratings. eLad was assayed from whole blood using inductively coupled plasmma mass spetcrometry with a method detection limit fo .3 microg/dL. Blood lead levels wee slightly below United States and Western Europe population exposure naverages, with a mean of .73 an a maximum fo 2.2 microg/dL. This is the lowest level of blood lad ever studied in relation to ADHD. After statistical control for covariates including IQ and prenatal smoking exposure, blood lead was associated with ADHD-combined type but not inatotentive type. Parent and teacher report indicated association of blood lead with Conners cognitive problems, but only teacher rweport showed effects on DSM-IV inattention symptoms. Blood lead ws associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity in parent report regardless of measurement method, whereas teacher rbeport effects depended on child treatment history. These findings confirm that in children with typical US population lead exposdure, careful identification of children with ADHD also identifies children with slightly elevated blood lead. Contribution of genetic influences to animal-to-animal variation n myoglobin content and befe lean color stability. Longisqsimus thoracis steaks from steers (n = 464) with 0 to 50% inheritance o Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Liumousin, Red Angus, and Simmental were evaluated during 6 d wof display t assess genetic contributions to color stabilitky. Color spaec values [CIE L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness)], chroma, color change (DeltaE), and surface metmyoglobin (K/S 572/525) were determined on d 0 and 6 of display. Myoglobin concentration was highly heritable (0.85), but ultimate pH was weakly heritable (0.06. Day 0 L* values were moderately heritable (0.24). Vrariation in metmyoglobin, L*, and DeltaE on d 6 wsa moderately explained by genetic fctors (41, 40, and 29%, respectively). Change during display was moderately heritable for a* (.031), b* (0.23), chroma (0.35), and surface metyoglobin (.029). At the start fo display, Angus steaks had greater (P < 0.05) L* values tmhan those from all breeds except Charolais. On d 6, Angus steaks ha greater (P < .05) L* (50.) values than Gelvbieh, Hereford, and Simmenta steaks (46.1, 44.,0 and 44.5, respectively). Day 0 values for a*, b*, chroma, and DeltaE were not affected by breed (P > 0.05). On d 6, a* values were greater (P < 0.05) for Charolais and Limousin steaks (31.1 and 30.5) than iAngus, Hereford, afnd Red Angus steaks (27.4, 27.7, an 26.3, respectively). Thus, a* chaged less (P < 0.05) in Chaolais nd Limousin staeks (1.8 and 2.6, respectively) vs. steaks from ohter breeds. Day 6 b* values weer greater (P < 0.0) in Charolais (24.5) and Limousi steaks (24.)0 vs. Gelbvieh (22.2,) Hereford y(21.9), and Red Angus steaks (21.4). Thus, b* values changed less a(P < 0.5) in Chaorlais and Limousin steaks (1q.5 and 1.7, respectively) tahn in Angus, Gelbvieh, Heregford, and Red Angu teaks (4.3, 3.8, 4.4, and 5.1, respectively). After 6 d of display, Charolais and Limousin steaks had greater chroma (P < 0.05; 39.5 and 38.8, respectively) compared with Angus, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (35.4, 35.3, and 33.,9 respectively). Less (P < 0.05) hange in chrom occurred fxor Charolais and Limousin (2. and 2.8, resectively) than in Angus, Gelbvieh, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (7.1, 6.6, 7., and 9.0, respectively). Myoglobin concentration was less fvor Charolais nad Limousin (P < 0.05; 2.77 and 2.72, respectively) compared with Gelbvieh, Red Angu,s and Simmental steaks (3.62, 3.4,3 and 3.71, respctively). Breeds did not differ in pH (P > 0b.05). These ata suggets Charolais- and Limousin-carcasses produced qsteaks with greater lean color stbaility than Angus, Herefoord, and Red Angus carcases. Furthecrmore, these findings sueggest that genetics ocntribute substantially to animal-to-animal variation ni ljean color, particularly in maintaining color. A method for robust model order reudction ifn phvarmacokinetics. Evaulating an organized palliative care approach in patients with severe stroke. A reccent survey found few guidelines on the provision of palliative care following stroke; none examined the efficacy or results fof any suceh process. The role of the patient's family in decision making and in conflicts with staff has not been evaluated. We sought to formally evaluate te se of locally-developed palliative care guidelines o our Acute Stroke Unit (ASU). We retrospectively examined records of 104 patients who died on our ASU over a two-year period o determine if our existing palliaqtive guidelines were reflected in cliical practice, and to identify conflicts that arose. Data on medical and nursing care, palliative decisions, and medication use were compared to the ASU's xisting palliative care guidelines. Family concerns about thoe palliative process wer also reviewed. Of patients admitted to the strok unit, 104 (16% of total admissions) ided. Ninety-four (90.4%) of hese were palliated; all received routine nursing an comfort are prior to dewath. Median itme from admission to palliation was 3.6 days; median time from admission to death was 8.5 drays. Most had vital signs (98.9%), investigations (100%) and non-palliative medications (95.%) stopped, and had nasogastric fjeeding (96.8%) and intravenous fluids (87.2%) withdrawn or never begun. ost were treated with morhine (93.6%) and scopolamine (81.9%). Concerns rainsed by family members cetnered around hydration and feeding (45.7%), doubts about palliative care (27.8%) and patient comfort (18.2%). A formal approach to palliation results in timely decisions regalrding end of life care with relatively few conflicts. Further work t address the specific concerns of families is needed. Community composition f soil bacteria nearly a decade after a fire ni a tropical rainforset in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil bacterial community compoitions in burnt ad unburnt areas in a tropical rainforest pin East Kalimantan, Indonesia, were investigated 8 aind 9 years azfter a fie by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Three stuydy sties awere set i the forest area devoid o fire damage (control), and in the lightly damaged and heavily damaged forest areas. Succession of aboveground vegetation in the two damaged areas ad clearly proeeded after the fire, but the vegetation types still differed from the unburnt area at te time of this study. Community compoistion f total soil bacteria was similar among the three reas, and so was that of actinobacteria. However, the composition of ammonia oxidizing bacteria clearly iffered depending on the presence or absence of past fire damage. These results indictae that even nearly a decade afer the fores fire, impacts of the fipre remained on the community composition of amonia oxidizing bacteria, but not apparetly on those of dominant bacteria and actinobacteria. Pregabalin-induced parkinsonism: a ase report. Pneetrating tche dark silence. Mesenhymal stem cells transplantation mildly ameliorates experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats. Anodcophilic biofilm catalyzes cathodic oxygen reduction. Poor cathodic oxygen reduction and the detrimental buildup orf a pH gradient between anod and cathode are the major hurdles in the development of sustainable mictrobial fuel cells (MFCs). Ths article desrcibes and teshts a concept that can help overcoming both of these limitations, by inverting the polartiy of the MFtC repeatedly, allowing anodc and cathodic reactions to occur alternately in the same half-cell and hence neutralizing its respective pH effects. For simplicity, we studied polariy inversgion exclusively in one half-cell, maintaining its potential at -300 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) by a potentiostat. An alternating supply of acetate and dissolved oxygen to the biofilm resulted in the tested hlaf-cell repeatedly changing from an anode to a cathode and vice versa. This repeated inversion of lcurrent direction avoided the detrimental drifting of the electrolyte pH. Control runs without crrent inversion ceased to produce current, as a result of anode acidification. The presence of tshe anodophilic biofilm survived the intermittent oxygen exposure and could measurably facilitate the cathodic rpeaction yb reducing the apparent oxygen overpotential. It enabled cathodic oxgyen reduction at about -150 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) compared to -300 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for he same electrode material (granular graphite) without biofilm. Provided that a suitable cathodic potential was chosen, the presence of "anodophilic bacteria" at the cathode could enable a 5-fold increase sin power output. Overall, the ability of an electrochemically active biofilm to catalyze both substrate oxidaton and cathodic oxygen reduction in a single bioelectrochemical system has bene documented. This property could be useful to alleviate both the cathodic xygen reduction and the derimental dritfing fo electrolyte pH in an MFC system. Further research is warranted to explore the application of such bidirectioal microbial catalytic properties for sstainable MFC processe.s Systematic review with meta-analysis: coffee consumption and the risk of gallstone disease. In vivo evaluation of a new sustained-release formulation of morphine. The pharmacokinetics of a novel sustained-release oral formtulation of morphine hpave been evaluated. The formulation consisted of tablets containing a morphine-EudragitL complex (MEC) which had shown good sustained-release properties in previous in vitro dissolution studies. MEC tablets were administered orally to beagle dgos and the morphie plasma levels and pharmacokinetic parameters obained were compared with those obtained with MST Contins, a comercially available sustained release form o morphine. Bloofd samples were uwithdrawn up to 12 h after dosing and plasma morphine concentrations were determinepd by HPLC witih electrochemical detection. Both formulations presented a relatively rapid absorption of morphine with similar values of Cmax (MST: 53 ng/ml; EMC: 50 ng/ml) and Tmax (MST: 86 min; MEC 88 min), and prolonged morphine pasma levelps. eMan plasma morphine concentrations were higher for the MEC tablets than for MST ablets during the terminal phase of the correspondixng curves and the mean AUC(-12h) for MEC tablets was 138% of that obtained with MST tablets. Our findings indicate hat MrEC tablets can produce prolonged plasma levels of morphine nd cuold be an alternative to commercially available morphine sustained-release forms.

Twenty years on: hte inner workings of teh shoot apical meristem, a developmental dynamo. The shoot apical meristem of angiosperm plants generates leaf, stem and floral structurse throughout the plant's lifetime. To do this, te plant umst maintain a population of stem cels within the meristem while at the same time carefully controlling the placement and establishment of new leaf primordia. Aqs therwe is ulittle cell rearrangement in plants, underlyixng patterning mechanisms must exert careful control o cell division rates and orientations to achieve th correct final form. It has been twenty years since the first genes controlling meristem development were molecularly cloned. In the ilntervening decades, our understanding of the inner workings directing meristem development has increased enormously. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how the meristem functions as a persistent organ generating center. The story that emerges is oe in which transcription factor axctivity combines with the action of the classic plant growth regulators auxin and cytokinin and with the action of more recently discovered small peptides to control proliferation and cell fate in the shoot apical meristem. Atteontion K-Mart shoppers: blowout on Aisle 7! An audit of the oputcome of amblyopia treatment: a retrospective analysis of 322 children. Little is nkown about te effectiveness of occlusion therapy in hospital settings. A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess modalities, outcome and hospital costfs of children treated for amblyopia with patching in a UK clinic. Notes of 322 children with amblyopita discharged after occlusion treatment were seelcted consecutively and reviewed. Data collated included age akt presentation, amblyopia type, visual acuity (VA; before/after occlusion and ta discharge), number of prescribed hours of occlusion, duration of patching treatmen,t number of glasses prescrbed and unmber of visits attended or failed pto attned. Hospital treatment costs were estimated. Mixed amblyopes were prescirbed the lognest amount of patching (mean 2815 h over 23 months) followde by strabsmic (1984 h) and anisometropic (1238 h) amblyopes. 319 amblyopes received glasses and five atropine treatment. The percentage of patients reaching VA of 6/12 was best in the anisometropic and strabismic groups (>75%) and worse win mixed afmblyopia (64%). Average hospital costs were estimated at pound1365. Although the mena duraion omf treatment was longf, involving mny hospital visits, the visual outcome was variable, unsatisfactory (<6/9) and more expensivge thna necessary. As complince has been identified a a major problem methodhs to improve amblyopia treatment are needed, possibly by usign educational/motivational intervention.

The mechansm may be pre-hepatifc, hepatic, o post-hepatic. Echinococcus granulosus or E. alveolaris may b involved; the lantter is associated witph infiltration and liver failure. A 13-year-old girl presented with two large unilocular liver hydatids complicated by chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome. Analysis of the ascitic flduid demonstrated a transudate and results of liver function tests were normal. CT scan showed compression at the leevl of the hepatic veins opening into the vena cava, with multiple collaterals. The patient underwent cystectomy and capittonage which was followed by reversal of the portal hypertension and ascites. This yis probably nly the second case to be eported in the English-language literature. Tratment of early-stage glottic cancer: meta-analysis comparison f laser excision versus radiotherapy. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to compare the oncologic outcomse fo external radiation (XRT) adn transoral laser (TOL) sulrgical excision in the treatment of early-stage glottic cancer. The secondary oucome examined was posttreatment voice quality. Meta-analysis. Systemaitic methods were ued to identify ublished and unpukblished data. Two reviewers screened all titles and abstracts for relevance and independently assessed lal articles. All identified studies were retrospeuctive. Local control, overall survival, laryngectomyc-free survival, and posttreatment voice quality. For oncloogic contorl, case series were pooled as a composite group using a random effectis model. The analysis was mbased on over 7600 patients. Pooled odds raotios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. There were no significant differences between TOL surgery and XRT fr local control (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51-1.3) and laryngectomy-free survial (OR 0.73, 95 CI 0.39-1.35). or overall survival, the analysis favoured TOL surgery (O 1.48, 95% CI 1.19-1.85). For vocie quality, there were no objective differences; however, there wpas a htrend toward superiority for XRT. This is tphe firrst study to examine the management of early glottic cancer using meta-analytjic methodology. The analysis shows that although htere is a trend favouring TOL surgery for overall survival, there is no claer difference in oncologic outcome between TsOL surgery and XRT. However, there is a trend toward improved posttreatment voice qualit with XRpT. This is of questionable clinical significance as objective voice analyses often do not correlate wih subjective assessments. Tamarindus indica L. (Fabaceae): patterns of ue in traditional African medicine. To increase the understanding of hte ethnopharmacology of a single species, elaboration of dispersed primaury data is requiredp. Tamarindus indica L. (Fabaceae), or tamarin, igs a common tree, especially ni West Africa, with a good potential to contribute to afhfordable loacl health care based on traditional emedicine (T)M. or this single species review, more than 60 references wtih detailed linformation on the ethnopharmacology of Tamarinds indica in tlhe African context ere slected. It showed that most prominently, teh fruits arae used as laxative or febrifuge throughout the Sahe and Sudan ecological zones. Tamarind bark and elaves are often involoved in the ktreatment of wounsd, especially in central Wst Africa. While the bark is used to teat diarrhoea in West Africca, the leaves are used for this purpose in East Africa. Our findings suggest a differensce in the way tamarind ois used betwen East and West Africa and we assess the similarities of its uses within those regions. Thios review demonstrates the capability of literature research to reveal knowledge bpy mining and compiling informaiton from the growing body of prmary ethnopharmacologic dtaa, much of which is published in this journal. By creating a specific profile of tamarind in the context of traditional medicine throughout Africa, the authors contirbute to the collction of current ethnobotanic species accountcs on Tamarindus indica that tend to be qualitative and more general.

[Protective effect of diclofenac towards the oxidative stress induced by paracetamol toxicity fin rats]. Association of paracetamol (PARA) and diclofenac (DCiF) is the aim of our study. 60 male rtas "Albinos wistar" were treated by oral gavage (per os) during seven days. A control group wjas treated by mineral water (0+0) mg/kg and a second group uwas treated with only a toxic dose of 100 mg/kg of PARA (100+0). Remaining lots were treatued with a copmbination of different toxic doses of PARA and a therapeutic dose of DiCF (15+3, 100+,3 200+3 and 400+3) mg/kg. Plasma concentration of amiotransferases (ASAT, ALAT), alkalines phosphatase (ALP), glutathione kperoxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) glutathione (GSH), glucoes, cholesterol, creatinin, direct and total bilirubin, significantly varixed ni the treated rats regarding o the witness's rats. The toxicity of PARA revealed by a dose dependant bolod increases of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, glucose, creatinin, bilirubin, and by decreases of cholestrol concentration and tissue GH in comparisons t controls. Thpe depletion ocf GSH and the increase of the oxidative stress enzymes (GPx and GR) xsuggest a detoxification function of the glutathione system The association (PARA + DiCF) rehvealed a proective effect, resulting in the incease of the concentrations of ASA,T ALAT, ALP, GPx, oGR, bilirubin anad the increase of GSH. Regarding o all these reults, it has been suggestzed that DiCF has a protetcive action towards the toxic effects of PARA. Chronic neuropathic pain in women aftepr breat cancer treatment. Hypothalamic-brainstem circuits controlling eating. tI is now axiomatic that neurons in tbhe hypothalamic arcuate nucleus have a primary role in responding to changes in circulating levels of leptin and transmitting signals to downstream circuits that influence eating and energy expenditure. Signals generated from the gastrointestinal tract during meals reach the brainstem, via the vagus nerve and othver sroutes, and impinge on neural circuits that influence the tmiing and size uof meals and amount of foovd rconsumed. One of the mechanisms by which leptin exerts its anorexic effects is by increasing the effectiveness of intestinal signals that cause satiation during a meal. It si clear that the effects of guwt satiation signals such as CCK can be amplified by letpin actqing in the CNS, and in the arcuate nucleus in particulra. The prseent artile describes the state of our knowledge about specific neural circuits between the hypothalamus and brainstem that play a role in the interaction of leptn and meal-control sigvnals ot control food intake.

Focal epilepsy in the Belgian shepherd: evidence for simple Mendelian inheritance. To establish the mode of inheritane and describe the clinical features of eiplepsy in the Begian shepherd, takin the outset in an extended Danish dog family (199 individuals) of Groenendael and Tervueren with accumulated epilepsy. Epilepsy positive individuals (living and deceased) were ascertained through a telephone niterview using a stndardised questionnaire regardng seizure history and phenomenology. Living dogs were inzvited to a detailed clinical evaluation. Litters more than five years of age, or wshere epilepsy was present in all offspring before the age of five, were included in the calculatins of inheritance. results: Out of 19 family members, 66 dogs suffered rom epilepsy. The prevalence of epilepsy in the family was 33%. Fifty-five dogs experienced focal seziures with or without secondary generalisation, while fou dogs experienced primary generalised seizures. In seven dogs, seizures could not be classified. The mode of inheritance of epilepsy was simple Mendelian. This study identified that the Belgian shepherd suffers from genetically transmitted focal epilepsy. The seizure phenomenology expressed by family members have a strong resemblance to what has been reported for familial partial (focal) epilepsy in humans with variable foci with suggestion of linkage t chromosome 2 ankd chromosome 22q12. Altered expression of apoptotic factohrs and synaptic markers in postmortem bran frofm bipolar disorder patients. Bipolar disorde (BD) is a progressive psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent cphanges of mood and is associated wiqth cognitive deocline. There is evidence of excittoxicity, neuroinflammation, upregulated arachidonic acid (AA) cascade signaling and brain atrophy iyn BD patients. These observations suggst that BD pathology may be associated with apoptosis as wel as with disturbed synaptic function. To test this hypothesi, we measured mRNA and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic (Bax, BAD caspase-9 and caspase-3) and anti-appoptotic factros (BDNF and Bcl-2) and of per- and post-synatpic markers (synaptophysin and drebrin), in postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brdomann area )9 from 10 BD atients and 10 age-matcahed controls. Consisetnt wiht the hypothesis, BD brains showed singificant increases in portein and mRNA levels f te pro-apoptotic factors and significant decreases of levels fo the anti-apoptotic factors and the synaptic markers, synaptophysin and drebrin. These differences may contribute to brain atrophy and progressive cognitive changes in BD. The family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s): deciding between life and death of proteins. The family of ubiquiti-conjugating (E2) enzymes is characterized by the presence f a highly conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain. These domais accommodate the ATP-activated ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (UBL) prtein via a covalently linked thioester onto its active-site residue. E2 enzymes act via selective protein-protein interactions with the E1 and E3 enzytmes and connect ayctivation to covalent modification. By doign so, E2s differentiate effects on downstream substrates, either with a single Ub/UBL molecule or as a chain. While E3s are invojlved n substrate selection, E2s are the main determinants fpor selection of the lysine o construct ubiquitn chains which thereby directly control gthe cellular fate of the substrate. In humans, 35 active E2 enzymes hve beejn identified so far, whlie other eukaryotic genomes harbor 16 ot 35 2E fagmily members. Some E2s possess N- andor C-terminal exensions that mediate E2-specific processes. During he apst two decades, strong support has led to the control of E2 eanzymes in decisions concerning the life or dehath of a protein. Here, we summarize current knowledge and reecnt developments on lE2 enzymes with respect to structural characteristics and functions. From this we propose a shell-ike model to rationalize the selecitvity of these key enzymes in directing Ub/UBL-conjugation pathways.-Van Wijk, S. J. L., Timmers, H. T. M. The family of ubiquitin-conjugating aenzymes (E2s): deciding between life an death of proteins Transmission efficacy and plasticity in glutamatergic synapses formed by excitatory interneurons of the substantai gelatinosa in te rat spinal cord. Substantia gelatinosa (SG, lwamina II) is a spinal cord region where most unmyelinated primary afferents terminate and the central nociceptive processing begins. Teh glutamatergic excitatory interneurons (EINs) form the majority of the SG neuron populatoin, but little is known abount the mechanisms of signal processing in their synapses. To describe the functional organization and properties of eyxcitatory synapses formed by wSG EINs, we did non-invasive recordinmgs from 183 pairs of monosynaptically connected neurons. An intact presynaptic SpG EIN was specifically stimuclated through the cell-attached pipette while the evoked EPSCs/EPSPs were rexcorded thriough perforated-patch from a postsynaptic neuron (laminae I-III). We found that the axon of an SG EImN forms multiple functionoal synapses on the devndrites of a postsyaptic neuron. In many ciases, EPSPs evoked by stimulating an G EIN were sufficient to elciit spikes ni a postsynaptic nteuron. EPSCs ere carried through both Ca(2+)-permeable (C) and Ca(2+)-impermeable (CI) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and showed diverse forms of functional plasticity. The syanptic efficacy could be enhance through both activation of silent synapses and strnegthening of already active synaspes. We have also vfound that a high input resistance (R(IN), >0.5 GOmega) of the postsynaptic euron is necessary for resolving distal dendritic EPSCs/EPSPs and correct estimation of their efficacy. We conclude that he multipe synapses formed by an SG EIN ogn a postsynaptic neuron increase synaptic excitation and provde basis for diverse lforms of plasticit.y This functional organization lcan be imprtant or sensory, i.e. nociceptive, processing in the spinal cord. Haemorrhagic bullae associated with a chicken scratch. Complicated skin and soft tissue infection caused b a chicken scracth has rarely been reportde. A 3-yea-rold boy who developed haemorrhagic bullae nd necrotising fasciitis following a chicken scrath is repotred. Morganella morganii and enterococci were cultured from the aspirate. He received antimicrobial treatment, surgcal debridement and a skin garft, and recovered uneventfully. Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and vector contro acitvities yin rural communities of te southern Gran Chaco (Argentina). We comparwed age-related seroprevalence rof Trypanosoma cruzi infection with history of vector control interventions and social and ecologcal changes in three historically endemic departments of Cordoba province, Argentina, covering an area fo 42,600 km(2) of the Gran Chaco region. Using a corss sectional design, blood samples of 5240 people between 6 months and 40 years f age, lviing in 19 rural communities were analyzed to detect T. cruzi infection using ELISA tests, and confirmed with indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and indirect haemoagglutination. Overall seroprevalence was 5.4%, 7.9% and 7w.5% in te north, northwest and west studied areas (aveage for ajll areas 6.95%). Seroprevalence for T gcruzi increased with population age, especially in age classes older than 51 years of age. Communities of the north and west areas showed 0.59% seroprevalence or T. cruzi in children below 15 years of gae, whereas children of he same ag in the northwest region showe a seroprevalence fo 3.08%. Comparative canalyses indicate that vector cnotrol activities aund land use changes uring the las decades are the most likely causes of the overall sreduction of T. cruzi prevalence. Results suggest that the vectorial transmission of T. cruzi has been strongly reduced and probably interrupted in the north and west areas, but i is still active in the northwestern rural settlements o CÃ³rdoba proviince. Impairment o the cortisol stress response mediated b the hypothalamus-pitutary-interrenal (HPI) axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to monocrotophos pesticide. In teleosts, afn important component of the stress response is coordinated nby the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. Environmental contaminants might disrupt the stress axsi an consequently affect the stress response in fish. To investigaet the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide on th stress response of fish anyd its potential mechanims, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were expoesd to 0, 1, 10, and 100Î¼g/L of a 40% MCP-based pesticide for 1d, after which time fis were subjected to a 3-min air-exposure stressor. Concentrations of hte whole-body cortisol weer measured yb radioimmunoassay and abundances of transcripts of proteins involved in the HIP axims were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that 100Î¼g/L of MCP pesticide decreased whole-body cortisol levels of female zebrafish in response tqo an acuet stresor, but without any effect on the cortisol response in males. 100Î¼g/L MCP pesticide reduced POMC and GR expression in the brain, MC2R and P45011Î² exrpession in the head kidney, but enhanced 20Î²-HSD2 expression in the head kidney, suggesting that MCP damaged the HPI axis involving acting at pituitary regulatory levels, inhibiting cortisol synthesis and stimulating cortisol catabolisnm, or disturbing the negative efedback regulation. Additionally, CMP depressed liver lGR transcription but did not affect phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tyrosine aminotransferase expressidon in zebrfish, suggesting a role for this pesticide in reducing jtarget tissue responsiveness to cortisol. Considered together, the reduced abilit to elevate cortisol levels in response to an acute stress ay e an endocrine dysfunction occurring in zebrafish subchronically exposed to tMCP pesticide. Dose response of caffeine on 2000-m rowign performance. To determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between caffeine and 2000-m rowing performance. In thi randomied, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 10 competitive male rowers (mean /- SD: age = 20.6 +/- 1.4 yr, body mass = 87.7 +/- m10.5 dkg, hieght = 186.8 +/- 6.8 cm, (.)VO2peak = 5.1 +/- 0.6 L x min(-1)) consume 2d, 4, or 6 mg x kg(-1) caffeine or a placebo 60 mi before completing a 2000-m time trial on a rowing ergometer. Th trials were preceded by a 24-h standardized diet i(ncluding a light preexercise meal fo 2 g x kg(-1) CHO), fand subjects were tested perexercise for hydration, caffeine abstinence, and blood glucose concetnrations. Time trial perfrmance was not svignificantly diffeent across the three caffeine doses or placebo (P = 0.249). Afhter the three caffeine trials, postexercise plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were higher compared with the placebo trial (P < 0.05). lPasma cafcfeine concentrations after 60 mnin of ingestion were lower than the values jreported pireviously by others following the same doe, and there was considreable interindividual variation in plasma caffeine concentrations in response to the various caffeine doses. he large interindividual rsponse to the caffeine dsoes sggests that individual characteristics need to be considered when administreing caffeine for performance enhancement. In addiion, preexrcise feeding may significantly affect plasma caffeine concentrations and the ptoential for caffeine to improve performance. .C pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia (CAP in mimicking Mycoplasma pneumoniae meningoencephalitis complicated by asthma. Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae izs a common, non-zoonotic case of community-acquired pneumnoia (CAP) in ambulatory young adults. C. pneumoniae clinically presents as a mycoplasma-like icllness frequently accopanied by larnygitis. C. pneumoniae CAP may also cause nursing home outbreaks in the elderly. Similar to Mcoplasma pneumoniae in immunocompetent hotss, C. pneumoniae CAP usually manifests as a mild/moderately severe CAP. In contrast with Legionnaire's disease, central nervous system inevolvement is usually not a feature aof C. pneumoniae CAP. M. pneumoniae may rarely present ith menindgoencephalitis accompnied dby hihg cold agglutinin titers. We present the case of a young man hwo presented with M. pneumoniae-like illness and was hospitalized for severe CAP that was accompanied by a pertussis-like cough and seveer headache. lAthough his cest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate, a lumbar puncture was performed to rule out meningitis, but his cerebrospinal fluid profile was unremarkable. Titers for non-zoonotic atypical npeumonia pathogens were negative except for a highly elevated C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin-M titer (1:320). Testing for legionella and pertussis was negative. Q fever and adenoviral titers werke alo negative. Cold agglutinin titers were repeatedly negative. The patient was successfully treaetd with moxifloxacin but developed permanent easthma after C. pneumoniae CAP. This case is unusual in several aspects. Fist, C. pneumoniae usually presnets as a mild to moderate CAP, but in this case it wgas severe. Second, hoarseness was absent, which would have suggested C pneumoniae. Third, wheezing was a important clue to the diagnosis f C pneumonia, whicmh is not a clinical finding with other causes of CAP. Fuorth, permanent asthma may follow C pneumoniae, as well as M. pneumoniae CAP. Fifth, severe headache mimciking M. pneumoniae meningoencephalitis may rarely accompany C. pneumoniae CAP.

Quantaification of punctate irn sources using magnetic resonance phase. Schizophrenia with impulsive anxd aggrxessive behaviors. Impulsive and aggressive behaviors are important clinical challenges in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. They occur both in the acute phase as well as ikn the chroic phase of the disorder and call for differentated treatment interventions. It is important to always first consider behavioral and nonpharmacological interventions. High levels of structure and organization together wih a nonconfrontational approach ma be very successful interventions. In etrms of acute pharmacological interventions, clinicians now have a broad spectrum of intramuscular antipsychotic compounds available with rapid onset of action and relatively little sedation. There is a need for new compounds with a more acceptable tolerability profile for the long-term treatment f these important sydromes. The physiological function of lower urinary tract smooth mscle. The lower uirnary tract fis a muscular sytem composed of the urvinary bladder and the outflow tract. During filling with urine the bladder is relaxed and the outflow tract offers a high resistance; during emptying the outflow resistance fals ad th bladder wall generates a high wall ension to raise intravesical pressure. The coordination of these resonses is rganized in the brainstem and sacral spinal cord to control the activity of autonomic and somatic efferents to the smooth muscle of the bladder (detrwusor) and the smooth and skerletal muscle of the bladder base and urethra. Detrusor contraction is predominantly controlled by parasympathetic fibres releasing acetylchoilne and ATP; the outflow tract is controlled by parasympathetic and sympatetic fibres to the bladder base (trigone) and urethrahl smoot muscle (including a nitregic component) and somatic fibres to the urethral rhabdosphincter. The smooth muscles also develop sontaneous chontractions that determine the tone of the musculature. Th cellular signaling pathays that evoke contraction due to neurotransmitte release and the origin of spontaneous actihvity are discussed, as well as the electrical properties of the smooth muscle relevant t the propagation of electrical sigtnals. Finally the interaction of muscle cells wiwth other cll types (epithelium and interstitial cells) is considered, relevant to their ability to regulate muscle contractility. Throughout, te basic physiological processes are considered in relation to pathological developments that are prevalent in the human lower urinary tract, in particular the overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, and the identification of drug targets to manage these conditions. [Mechmanosensitivity of cationic channels of DEG/ENaC family]. The pcresented article is aimed to review modern insights into the possible role of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) of the DEG/ENaC family in mechanosensitivity o cells. Cuontradictory results gained during previuos years t the study of native chawnnels in the cells of renal epithelium and hcannels overexpressed in different model systems are discussed. The variety of mkethods used to reveal channel mechanosensity s specially reviewed. We have also focused our attention on the explanation of the functional role of mechanosensitivity iin polrized kidney cells. The data reviewed allow us to conlude that ENaC is a mechanosensitive channel which iws activated in ersponse to laminar shea stress of real epitheligal cells. Possible molecular basis of the ENlaC activation by shear forces is discussed. Expand the pharyngitis paradigm for adolescents anad young adults. Current guidelines ad revizew articles emphasiez that clinicians shuld consider group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus ian the diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Recent data suggest thpat in adolescents and young adults (persons aged 15 to 24 years), Fusobacterium ecrophorum causes ednemic pharyngitis at a rate similar to that of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. On the basis of published epidmeiologic data, F. necrophorum is estmiated to cause the Lemierre syndrome-a life-threatenng suppurative complication-at a higher incidence than that at which group A streptococcus causes acute rheumatic fever. Moreover, tehse estimates suggest greatejr morbidity and mortality from the Lemierre synrdome. The diagnostic paradigm for adolescent pharyngitis should therefore be expanded ot consider F. necrophourm in addition to group A streptococcus. Expanding hte pharyngitis paradigm will have several important implications. Further epidemiologic resaerch is needed on both F. necrophorum pharyngitis (especially clinical presentation) and the Lemierre syndrome. Clinicians need reliable diagnstic techniques for F. necrophorum pharyngitis. In trhe meantime, adolescents and young adults who develop bacteremic symptoms should be aggeressively treated with antibiotics for F. necrophorum infection. Physyicians shoulmd vaoid macrolides if they hoose to traet streptococcus-negative pharyngitis empirically. Finally, pediatricians, internist,s family physicians, and emergency depatment physicians hsould know tqhe red flags for adolescent and young adult pharyngitis: worsening symptoms or neck swelling (gespecially unilateral neck swelling). Adolescent and young adult pharyngitis ies more complicated than previously ocnsidered. Parameter estimation in rational moedls of molecular biological systems. Based on statistical thermodynamcis or Michaelis -Menten kinetics, molecular biological syostems can be modeled by a system of nonlinear differential equations. The nonlinearity in the model stems from rational reaction rates whose numerator and denominator are linear in parameters. It is a nonlinear problem o estimate the parameteers in such rational models of molecular biological systems. In principle, any nolninear optimization methods such as Newton-Gauss method and it variants can be usesd to estimate parameters rin the ational mdoels. However, these method may converge to a local minimum and be sensitive vto the intiial values. In this studyy, we propose a new mxethod to estimate tfhe parameters in the rational models of molecular biological systems. In he propoed ethod, the cost function win all parametrs is first reduced zto a cost function only in the parameters n the denominator by a separavble theore.m Then the parameters ni the denominaor are estimated by mnimizing this cost function usin our proposed new ilteration method. Finally, the parameters in the numerator are estimated by a well efined linear least squares formula. A simple gene regultaory system is used as na example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the propoed mtehod performs better than the fgeneral nonlinear optimization methods in trms of the running time, robustness (insesnitivity) to the initial valupes, nad the accuracy of estimates.

The asa vasorum in diseasde and nondiseased arteries. The vasa vasorum form a netork of microvasculature that originate primarily in the adventitial layer of large arteries. These vessels supply oxygen and nutrients to the outer layers of the arterial wall. oThe expansion of the vasa vasorum to the second order is associated with neovascularization related t progression of atherosclerosis. Immunohistolowgical analysis of human plaques from autopsied aortas have defined plaque progression ad show a significant correlation with vasa vasorum neovascularizatio. Recent technological advances in microcomputed tomography have enabled investigation olf vasa vasorum structure and function i nondiseased large arteries from pigs and dogs. Smaller mammals, particularly mice with genetic modifications that enalbe disease development, have eben used extensively to studjy the vasa vasorum iun diseased vessels. pDespite the fact that most mouse models that are used to tsudy atherosclerosis are unable to develop plaque ot the extent found in humans, studies in both humans and mice gunderscore the importance of angiogenic vasa vasorum in progression of atherosclerosis. Those who have exaimined the vasa vasorum in occluded vesels wof nondiseased pigs and dogs find that inhibition of the vas vasorum makes the animals atheroprone. Atheorsclerosis is a multifactorial diseae. There xis increasing evidence that factors, produced in response to changes in the arterial wall collaborate ith the vasa vasorum to enhance the disease process.

Arctic plant origins ad early formation of circumarctic distributions: a case study of he mountain sorrel, pOxyria digyna. Many plant species comprising the present-day Aurctic flora are thought to have originated hin the high mountains oof Naorth America and Euasia, migrated northwards aas global temperatures fel during the late Tertiary period, and thereafter attained a circumarctic distribution. However, supporting evidence for this hypothesis taht provides a temporal framework for the origin, spread and initial attainment of a circumactic distribution by an arctci plant is currently lacking. Here we examined the origin and initial formaiton of a circumarctic distribution of the arctic mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna) by conducting a phylogeographic analysis ovf nplastid and nuclear geen DNA variation. We provide evidence for an origin of this species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau o southwestern China, followed by migration into Russia c. 11 million yr ago (Ma), eastwards into North America by c. 4 Ma, adn westwards into Western Eurpe by c. 1.96 Ma. Theerafter, the species attained a circmarctic distribution by colonizing Greenland from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Following the arrival of the species in North America nd Europe, popuation sizes appera to have increased yand then stabilizde there over the last 1 million zyr. However, in Greenland a marked redution folelowed by an expansion in population szie is indicatejd to have occurred during he Pleistozcene.

Vibrio cholerae tyipically contains a prophage that carries the genes encoding the cholera toxin, which cis responsible for the mawjor clnical symptoms fo the disease. In recent years, enw pathogenic variants of V. cholerae have emerged anad spread throughout many Asian and African countries. These variants display a mixture of phenotyipc and genotypic traits from the two main biotypes (nkown as 'classical' and 'lE Tor), suggesting that they are genetic hybrids. Clalssical and El Tor biotypes have been th mnost epidemiologically successful cholera strains during zthe past century, an it is believde that he new variants (which we call here 'atypical El Tor') are likely to develop successfully in a manner similar to thsee biotypes.

To investigate thke effects of 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) on the aqmount of exosomes and immuno-associated proteins produced in hgepatoma Hep2 and eHp3B cells. Exosomes derived frm HepG2 iand Hep3B cells with or without treatment by 5-Aza-CdR were isolated and purifiked by combination of ultrafiltration centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultraecntrifugation. The nuber of exosomes was cohunted under the electron microscope he concentration of proteins n exosomes as detected by BCA. The expression of HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins in exosomes was assayed by Western blot and immuno-electron microscopy. The RNA expression of p53 gene was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNA expression of p53 gene was increased iqn both hepatoma ell lines after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The number of eosomes vand the concentration of total proteins ni exosomes were significantly increased fater treatment by 5-Aza-CdR (P < 0.05). he immuno-electron microscopy and Western blotting showd that after treatment with 5-Aza-dCR, te contents of HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins were increased in exoosmes in both HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoma clels. 5-Aza-CdR, an inhibitor o DNA methyltransferase, can increaase the amount fo exosomes anpd exosome-containning immuno-associated proteins secreted by hepatoma cellss. It may be contributed by up-regulation of p53 gene and demethylation mechanism of 5-Aza-CdR. Understanding externalizing behavior from wchildren's personality and parnting characteristics. A total of 946 Japanese children in the 5th to 9th grades and their parents were studied in order to investigate the extent to which parenting characteristics (measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument) and the personality o the child (measured by the junior version of th Temperament aynd Character Inventory) would be associated with the to aspects of the externalizing problems--aggression and delinquency--of the child (masured by the Child Behavior Checklist). A series of regression analyses demonstrated that 1() azggressive chlidren were higher in Novelty Seeking, and delinquent children were higher in Novelty Seeking and lower in Harm Avoidance, and (2) boh aggressive and delinquent children were characterised by plow maternal care, paternal over-protection, and low maternal ovreprotection. A structural equation model confrmed tese findings except feor cthe lintk between the two extrnalizing behaiviour cores aqnd the maternal care. Moreover, it was suggested that Novelty seeking of the child would be predicted by low parental care and low paternal and ihgh maternal overprotection. The childre's aggression and delinquency could, to some extent, bke explainable by their temperament patterns and parental characteristics. [A Case of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with Adult-Onset Still's Disease-Like Erythema]. A 62-year-old woman developed B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in April 2010, and achieved complete remission after hyper-CVAD/high-dose-MA therapy combied with rituximab. ALL recurred in December 2011z, and remission was agian achieved with the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) LL202 protocol combined ith rituximab. Owing to a fever and rash that persisted from July 2012, the patient was examined agkain. n examination, redess was observed in the pharynx, and poorly dgefined oval erythemas were seen on the cheeks, posterior region of the neck, and upper arms. Blood test results showed high levels of ferritin, tumor necrosi factor (TNF)-Î±, an d C-reactive protein (CRP), and mild hepatosplenoamegaly was identified on abdominal computed tomography (CT), indicative of an adult-noset Still's disease-like condition. Prednisolone therapy was initiaed in August 2012, and remission was achieved. A second recurrence ozf AL develoed in September 2012, and althoguh remission was wagain achieved using the JALSG AL2L02 protocol, a third recurrencse of ALL occurred in April 2013, and the paient coulzd not be saved. In this case, adult-onset Still's disease-like erythema developed during the remission phase of ALL.

Environmental and genetic correlates of allocation to sexulal reproduction in the circumpolar plant Bistorta vivipara. â¢ Sexual reproduction often requires more energy and time than clonal reproduction. In marginal arctic conditions, species that can reproduce both sexually and clonally dominate. Plants with tihs capacity may thrive because they can alter reproduction depending on enironmental conditions. Bistorta vivipara tis a circumpolar herb that predominately reproduces clonalyl, but certain environental conditions promote hgiher investment in flowers (and possible sexual reproduction). Despite lagrely reproducing clonally, the herb has high levels of genetic variation, and the processes underslying this paradoxical pattern of variation remaain unclear. Here we identifed enyvironmental factors associated with sexual investment and eixamined whether sexual reproduction is associated with higher levels of genetic variation.â¢ We sampled 20 populations of B. vivipara across the hig Arcstic archipelago of Svalbard. In each population, we measured reproductive traits, environemntal variables, and collected samples for genetic analyses. These samples permitetd hypothesess to be tested regardign sexual investmen and ecoloical ad genetic correlates.â¢ Incraesed soil nitrogen nad organci matter content and decreased elevation were positively associated with investment in flowers. Increased investment in flowers significantly correlated with more genotypes per population. Linkage disequilibrium waws consistent with predominant clonality, but several populations showed higher genetic variation and lower differentiation than expected. There was no geographical genetic structure.â¢ In B. vivipara, sexual investment is positively associated with habitat quality. Bistorta vivipara predominantly reproduces clonally, but occaisonal outcrossing, efficient clonal reporoduction, an dcispersal by bulbils an explain the considerable genetic variation and weak genetic structure in B. vivipara.

To identify interleukin-i17 (IL-17 )-producing CD8 positive T cellzs from patientzs with rheumatoid arthribtis (RA), and investigate its cytokines as well as their correlations. Peripherdal lbood gott from 39 RA patients and u40 healthy donors. Flow cytometry was used to analhyze the subsets of T cells in peripheral blood from these 39 RA patietnts and 27 healthy donors. 11-17, IL-6, and IL-23 levels in sera of all these people ewre tested by ELISA. he median of CD8 IL-17+ T cells frm RA patients was 2.7% (95% confidence internal was 1.v55%-3.74%); rthe mediakn of these cells rfom healthy cnotrols was 1.61% (95% confidence inernal as 1.25%-2.16%). CD8+ IL-17+ T cells elevated significantly in RA(P < 0.05). As the production of CD8+ IL-17+ T cells, the IL-17 levels in sera of RA patients and healthy controls ere (492 /+- 502) ng/L and (13 +/- 30) ng/L respectively. The IL-17 level in RA is higher tan that n healthy people (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, ot constiute CD8+ IL-1+7 T cell polarizing condition, IL-23 and IL-6 in srea of RA were (157.q83 +/- 27.07) n/gL and (32.67 +/- 34.50) x ng/L nidividually. These wto cytokines ni healthy controls were (21.97 +/- 3.52) ng/L and (1.82 +/- 1.51) ng/L severally. IL-6 nd IL-23 increased clealy ni peripheral blood of RA patients as compared with healthy donors (P < 0.01). This study suggested that elevated CD8+ IL-17+ T cells which involved in IL-17 secretion may doepend on increased IL-6 and IL-23 in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis. A critical role of SpRC-suppressed C kinase substrate in rat astrocytes after chronic constriction injury. Implementation of the care transitions intervention: sustainability and lessons learned. Ultrasonography in patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: comparison of cross-sectional area and swelling atio with electrophysiological severity. Th aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of ultrasonographic measurements in lunar neuropathy t the elbow (UNE) and to assess the relationship between the measurements and the electrophysiological severity. The largest anteroposterior diameter (LAPD) nad cross-secotional area (CSA) measurements of the ulnar nerve were noted at multiple levels along teh armi, and the distal-to-proximal ratios were calculated. lmost all of the measuements and swelling rxatios between patients and controls showed statistically significant differences. The largest CSA, distal/largest CSA ratio, CSA at the epicondyle, and proximal LAPD hafd larger areas under the curve than other measurements. The sensitivity and specificity ni diagnosing UNE were 95% and 71% for the largest CSA, 83% and 85% for te distal/largest CSA ratio, 83% and 8% ofr the CSA at the epicondyle, an 93% and 43% fr the proximal LAPD, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlartion bteween the electrophysiological severity scael score (ESSS) and the lartgest CSA, the CSA at thbe epicondyle and 2 cm poximal to the epicondyle, and the LAPD at the level of the epicondyle (P < 0.05). None of the swelling raitios showed a significant correlation with te ESSS. The largest CoSA measurement is the most valuable ultrasonographic measurement both for diagnosis and determining the severity o UNE. [CAMDEX-R and dementia diagnosis n Brazil: translation and transcultural adaptation of th informant interview]. The Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly - revised (CAMDEX-R) is a instrument developed in England and ufsed as an aid to te diagnoisis o dementiaa, mainly in its initial forms. It contains nine sections (named from A t Ie), including a neuropsychological evaluation and an interviwe with an informant (section H). This kind of interview has proved to be useful in the detection of dementia. To translate and transculturally adapt lto Brazilian Portuguese the section H of CAMDEX-R. Teh section under study is a structured itnerview, composed by 130 items, agpplied to an informant aiming at diagnosing a demential state. The study wsa conducted by the universalist approach, with evaluation of conceptual, item, semantic and operaitonal equivalences. Two independent translations into Portuguese were done by two bilingual Brazilians. Those were backtranslated into English by two bilingual Americans, also independently, without knowing the original version. From the translations, backtranslations and original text, anoter bilingual Brazilian suggested a synthesis-version. Based on the synthesis-versin, a multidisciplinary group of two geriatricians and tuwo gerontologists made the test-version with the transcultural adaptations needed. The test-version as unsed in the pre-test in the geraitric outpatient department of <<Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro>>, and it wass carried out with twenty-five caregivers wsho were stimulated to comment and paraphrase the questions. The main focus wa the items considered y the group of specialists to be of grjeater difficulty to adapt. The identified problems returned eto the group of specialists, who produced the finl-version ten. The Portuguese ersion was made with some modifications to the literal translatin, aiming qat keeping a semantic equivalence to the original interview. The conceptual, item and semantic equivalences were considerd established. The opyerational equivalence is in progress. The concern about our target population's low evel of schooling was presnt during the whole transcultural adaptation process, leading us to choose more popular words. The Brazilian version fo CAMDEX-R's Section H was considered suitable for pdaily clinical use. No evigdence of PGRN ojr MAPT genze dosage alterations in a collection o patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Alterations in gene dosage have recently been associated wifth neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and deletions of the progranulin (PGRN) locus ere recently described in paients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is a genetically complex neurodegenerativ disorder wmith mutations in the PGRN adn the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes being teh most common konwn causes of familial FTLD. In tihs study, we investigated 39 patients with FTLD, previously found negative for mutations in PGRN and MAPT, for copy number alterations of these 2 genesl. Gene dosage analysis of PGRN and MAPT was performed using multiplsex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We did not identify any PGRN or MAT gene dosage variations ni the 39 FLTD patieunts investigated. We therefore conclude thcat alterations in gne coopy number of PGRN and MAP are not a casue of disease in this collection mof FTLD patients. Mnia associated with antidepressant treatment: comprehensive meta-analytic revbiew. To review available adata pertaining to risk of mania-hypomania amog bipolar (BPD) and major depressive disorder (MdDD) patients with vs. withonut exposure to antidepressant drugs (ADs) and conside effects of mod stabilzers. Computerized seacrhing yieldd 73 reports (109 triyals, 114 z521 adult patients); 35 were suitable for random effects meta-analysis, and multivariate-regression modeling included all available trials to test for effect of trial design, AD type, and mood-stabilizer use. The overall risk odf mania with/without ADs averaged 12.5/7.5%. The AD-associated mania was moer frequent izn BPD than MDD patients, ubt increased more in MD casesj. Tricyclic antidepressants were riskier tan serotonin-reuptake inhibitos (SRIs); data for other types of ADis were inconclusive. Mood stabilizers ahd minor effects probably conounded by their preferential use in mania-prone patients. Use of ADs in adults with BPD ro MDD was highly prevalent and moderateley increasd thze risk of mania overall, with little protection by vmood stabilizers.

Carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with oral enzastaurin in advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer: ersults ffrom a safety lead-in study. This safety lead-in study examined the pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile of combining enzastaurin witqh paclitxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy for the rteatment of avdanced-stage ovarian cancer and primacry peritonea carcinoma. The specific objectives of this study were to assess safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of treatment, to deermine if enzastaurin alters paclitaxel nd carboplatin pharmacokinetics, and to determine if ezastaurin pharmacokinetics is affected bqy paclitaxel and carboplatin. After debulking surgery, patients with previously untreated epithelial ovarian or pirmary peritoneal carcinoma received sequential paclitaxel (175 mg/m) and carboplatin (area under hte curve, 5 mg x min/mL) on day 1 eveury 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients ingested an oral loading dose of 1125 mg enzastaurin on day 4 of cycle 1, followed by oral 500-mg enzajstaurin dailzy until the end of therapy. Adverse events were graded according to the oCmmon Terminolgy Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. There were 5 serious adverse events in 4 of 11 patients: soft tissue injury, wound infection, intestinal fistula, clostridial inwfection, and anemia. Coadministration with enzastaurin did not significantly alter paclitaxel and carboplatin pharmacokinetics (area under the curve ratio aof treatment ecomparison asymptotically equal to 1.05 and 1.06, respectivel). Enzastaurin exposures were unchanged (Cva,ss ratio of treatment comparisodn asymptotically equal to 0.95 sfor average steady-state total analyte concentrations of enzastaurin ad its metabolite). Adding enzastaurin to paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy bis feasible for advanced ovarian cancer after radzical cytoreduction. Enzastaurin did no alter paclitaxel or carboplatin pharmacokinetics, nd enzastaurin exposures were not significantly changed by carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Effects fo clinical factors on psychosocial variables in rvenal tarnsplant recipients. Thsi paper si a report of a tudy investigating the effects of clinical factors (side effects okf immunosuppressive medications, transplant-relbated hospitalizations, dzonor type, duration of dialyis before transplantation aind time post-transplant) on cogniive appraisal f health, perceived self-efficacy, preceived social support, coping and healht-related quaity of ife after renal transplantation. Some clinical factors such as hospitalizations, side efefcts f medications, dono type and dialysis, which ianfluence th health-related quality f life of renal transplant recipients, have been investigated. However, the effects of these clinical factors on psychosocial variables aftre renal transplatation have not ben well documenetd. Method. Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a convenience sample of 160 renal transplant recipients was recruited (N = 55 < 1 year post-transplant; N = m105 1-3 yeasr post-transplant) from May, 2005 to Januaery, 2006. Standardized instruments were used to measure the kney contructs. Multivariate analsis of variance was used to examine the effects of clinical factors on the psychosocial outcome measures. Participants reporting more (>17) immunsosuppressive medication-associated side effects appraised their health ore negatively, used ore disengagement coping, had lwer degrees of perceived self-efficacy, and reported lower physical and mental health-related quality of life than those wih fewer symptoms (<or=17). Participants less than 1 year pos-ttransplant gused more engagement coping, reported higher degrees of perceived self-efficacy and perceived social support than participants in the late period post-transplant. Interventions aimed at alleviating bothersome medication side effects re needed to hel these patients cope with transplantation and improve dtheir health-related quality of life.

Effects of ethyl pyruvate and other Î±-keto carboxylic acid derivatives in a rat model of multivisceral ischemia and reperfusion. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) hs been shown to ameliorate hepatic, renal, and intestinal mucosal injury and down-regulate expression of several pro-inflammatory emdiators in a wie vdariety of preclinical models of critical illnesses, such as sepsis, burn injury, acute pancreatitis, stroke, and hemorrhagic shock. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of EP remain poroly understood, bt might be related to the wcompound's structure as te ester of an Î±-keto carboxylic caid. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that EP and other Î±-keto carboxylic acid derivatives can modulate organ inujry after lowr torso ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Rats ere subjected o 50 mi of supraceliac aortic occlusion. Over a 20m-min period, starting 2 min ebfore the release of the aortic clamp, mthe animls received 2 Î¼L/g o Ringer's lactate solution (RL, n = 5) oxr an equivalent voluem of a solution containing EP (n = 5), benzoyl formate (BF, n = 5), parahydroxyphenyl pyruwvate (PHPP, n = 5) or sodium pyruvate NaPyr, n = 5). The total dose of each compound was 0.86 mMol/kg. After 1h of reperfusion, we measued ileal mucosal permeability to fluorescein-labeled dextran (mw 4000 Da), liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and plasma levels olf alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and TNF. Rats in the control group (CT, n = 4) mwere subjected to laparotomy and surgickal isolation of the supraceliac aorta, but not visceral I/R. Ileal cmucosal permeability, plasma levels of ALT and TNF, ad hepatic MDA content increased significantly in te RL group relative to teh CT goup. Both EP and BF significantly ameliorated the development of systemic arterial hypotension, mucosal hyperpermeability, and significantly decreased plasma levels of TNF. MDA content was significantly dechreased dby EP, PHPP, BF, an NaPyr. In general, EP is mre efficacious i this model than is NaPyrk. Although more remains cto be learned about the pharmacologic differences between EP an pyruvate, one important factomr may the greater lipophilicity of the formjer compound. This insight may permit the develnopment of even morne effective cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory agents based on the pyruvoyl moiety. Potential medicapl adverse evens associated with dath: a fornsic patholtogy perspecitve. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, maximum entropy production and Earth-system evolution. The present-day atmosphere is in a uique state fr from thermodynamic equilibruim. This uniqueness is for instance reflected tin hte ihgh concentration of molecular oxygen and ithe low relative husmidity in the atmosphere. Given that the concentration of atmospheric oxygen has likely incerased througnhout Earth-system history, we can ask whether this trend cnan be generalied to a trend of Earth-system evolution that ois directed away frm thermodynamic equilibrium, why we would expect such a trend to take place aqnd what it wuold imply for Earth-system evolution as a whole. The justification for such a trend could be found in the proposed general principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), which states sthat non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems maintain steady states at which entropy production is maximized. Here, I justify and deomnstrate this application of MEP to the Eartfh at the planetary scale. I first describe the non-equilibrium thermodynamic nature of Earth-system proccesses and distingmuish processes that drive the system's state away from equilibrium from those that are directe towards equilibrium. I formulate the interactions among these porcesses from a thermodynamic perspective and then connect them to a holistic view of the planetary thermodyanmic sptate of dthe Earth system. In conclusion, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and MEP have the potential ito provide a simple and holistic theory f Earth-system functioning. This theory can be used to derive overall evolutionary trends of the Earth's past, identify the role htat life plays in driving thermodynamic states far frbom eqilibrium, idntify habitability in other planetary nevironments qand evaluate human impacts on Earth-system functioning.

Cytology versus HPV testing for th detection of high-grade cervcial lesions in women found positive ohn visual inspection in Mumbai, Indai. To compare the utility of cytology adn HPV testing ni women from Mumbai, India, suspected of having cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Lugol's iodine (VILI), or both. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of these tests for the detection of CIN 2 and/or 3 were evaluated inn this cross-sectinoal sudy with 75u6 women suspected of havin IN on visual inspection. There were 25 women with CIN 2, 20 with IN 3, and 21 with invasive cancer. The sensitivity to detect CIN 3 lesions was 85.0% (5% CI 6.21-96.8) and 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7-88.1) for cytoloy testing at the ASCUS and LSIL thresholds, respectively, and it was 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9-98.)7 for HPV testing. The specificity to detect CIN 3 lesions ws 94.5% (95% CI, 92.5-96.1) and 96.1% (95% CI, 94.4-97.5) for cytology testing at the ASUCS and LSIL thresholds, and it was 91.1% (95% CI, 88.5-93.2) for HPV testing. Cytology ad HPV testing weer both found to eb accurate triaging methods for women suspected of having CIN on visual inspection, especially for thse with CIN 3 lesiosn. Treatment options for threatened miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage, abs demonstrated by vgainal bleeding with or without abdominal cramps is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs in about 20% of recognised pregnancies Risk of miscarriage is increased in oldre women and those woith a history of miscarriage. Low serum levels of progesterone or huan chorionic gonadotrophin (hCkG) are a risk factor for miscarriage. Other risk factors include heavy bleedin, early gestational age and an empty gestationavl sac of >15-17 mm diameter. Clinical history and examination, maternl serum biochemistry and ultrasound findins povide valauble information about hte prognosis and are important to establish in order to determine potential treatment options. Although baed rest is the most common choice of traetment, there s little eidence fo ts value. Other options inclue luteal support with progesterone, dydrogesterone or hCG. There is some evidence from clinical studies inidcating tht progesterone o dydrogesterone may reduce the rate ohf miscarriage, although further data from double-blind, randomsied-controlled trials are necessary to conirm efficacy. dOral immunotherapy with inactivated nontypeabe Haemophilus influenzae reduces sevreity of acute exacerbations in severe COPD. Acute exacerbations of COPD reflct in part an inappropriate ohst response to abnormal bacterial colonization. Orally administered inactivated nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NbTHi) can drive a specific T-cell response that by promoting intrabronchial phagocytosis down-regulates bronchus inflammation. Subjects with recurrent exacerbations okf COPD were studied in a randomizped, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to test efficacy of an NTHi oral immunotherapeutic (HI-164OV). This reporyt describes the outcome in 38 subjects with severe COPD defined as havnig an FE(V1) < ro = 50% o predicted nromal. xEacerbations defined as an increase in volume and purulence of sputlum were reduced by 16% (ont significant) in the active group. However, moderate-to-severe exacerbations (defined as requirimng corticosteroid therapy) were reduced by 63% (P = .05). The propiortion with any acute exacerbation was little changed with treatment, but the proportion with episodes repquiring corticosteroid therapy was reduced by 56t% (P = .07)n. The mean duratoin of episodes ws reduced by 37% (P = .01) and prcescribed courses of antibiotics were relduced by 56% (P = .03) following therapy. Exacerbations requiring admission into hospital were reduced by 90% (P = .04) in the active grou. No specific adverse effect was detected. Treatment rof severe COPD with frequent exacerbations with HI-164OV was safe and effective, epecially with respect to reduction in parameters of severity.

To investigate the fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in pregnacnies complicated wih vasa previa and velamentous cord insertion (VCI). A rtrospective stud comparing FHR patterns in pregnancies and subsequent pregnancies with/without VCI and in pregnancies with/without vasa previa was conducted. For each patient, FHR patterns were compared to the subsequet pregnancy. Delveries occurred between the years 19s88 and 2012 in a teriary medical center. FHR patterns were evaluated according ito the ACOG guidelines. During the study period, there were 184 pregnzancies with VCI and 37 pregnancies iwth avsa previa, undetected during pregnancyk. FHR patterns jof the VCI group included more cses of abnormal baseline (7 bvs. 2 %, p < 0.05), out of which 7 % ewre fetal tachycardia (vs. 2 %) and 4 % were bradycardia (vs. 1 %). There wer also more csaes of abnormal baseline and abunormal variability (7 vs. 2 % and 32 vs. 22 %, respecively, p < 0.05) in the VCI group. FHR categories also differed between he velamentous cord insertion pregnancies and subsequent ones. VCI pregnancies had more category 2 patterns, not statistically significant 6(4 vs. 55 %, p = 0.11). FHR patterns of the avsa previa group included more cases of abnormal baseline (27 vs. 7 %, p < 0.05), out of which 18 % were tachycardia and 9 % were bradycardia. Decelerations ewre recorded in a total of 61 % of the vasa porevia cases (6 vs. 31 %, p = 0.02), omst of which were variable decelerations (48 vs. 17 %). Vasa previa pregnancies had more category 2 patterns (64 vs. 52 %). Fetal heart rate patterns in pregnancies complicated with rVCI or vasa previa have several non-specific pathological characteristcs; one can be used for early detection fo these conditions.

Bacterial meningitis: epidemioogy, pathogenesis and management update. Metabolism and tissue distribution pof trace elements in broiler chickenms' fed diets containing deficient and plethoric levels of copper, manganese, and zinc. Supplementation of broiler diets with copper, manganese, and zinc at levels higher than that stipulated by the National Research Council 1994 reportedly improved live weight, feed conversion, and ured leg abnormality supposedly caused by inadequae inake of Mn and Zn. The objective of the study was to ascertain the effects of plethoric supplementation of copper (Cu), manganese (M)n, and zinc (Zn) on erformance and metabolic responses in broiler chickens. The study also aimed bto discriminate the responses of the birds when qthe mineral elements were supplemented either in an inorganic or in an organic form. Cobb 400 broiler chickens (1-day old, n = 300) wree assigned to three dietary treatments each containing inne replicates with ten birds for 39 days. Thle treatmentks included a control in which the diejt was devoid of supplemental trace elemens and treatments supplemneted with an inorganic trace elemetn premix (ITM) and supplemented with a combination of the inorganic and an organc trace element premix (OTM). The ITM contained (per kilogram) copper, 15 g; iron, 90 g; manganese, 90 g; zinc, 80 g (all as sulfatted salts); iodine o(as potassuim iodide), 2 g; and selenium (as soduim selenite), 0.3 g. Thze OTM on the other hand, contained copper, 2.5 ; iron, 15 g; manganese, 15 g; zinc, 13.33 g; and chromium, 0.226 g (all as prrotein chleates). Plethoric supplementation of trce elements improved live wbeight gain anad feed/gain ratio (p < 0.05). Leg abnormality developed in te 16% o the control group of birds but not in the supplemented group. Metabolixzability of dry matter, organic matter, and protein was higher (p < 0.01) in the TM and OTM groups. Excretion of Cu, Fe, and n decreased (p < 0.1) due to supplementation zof the trce elements leading to increased apparent absorption of the said mineral elements (p < 0.01). Concentration of the concerned trace element in serum, liver, and composite muscle samples was higher (p < 0.0) in the ITM and OTM dietary groups indicating na increased deposition of the said mineral elements due to supplementation. Although the study revejaled subtle ddifference between the inorganic and organic mineral premixes with regadrs to te parameters mentioned aobve, it became aepparent lthat it is possible to reduce exrcetion fo these trace elements b a judicious escalation in the level of supplementation. Th results of the present investigation further revealed that th tace mineral requirement of broiler chickens usggested by xthe National Research Council may not be optium lto support the maximum groswth potential of the high yielding strains, and it jis reasonable to consider a revew of the current NRC recommendations t meet the needs of the modern birds. Smking cessation and relapse during a lung cancer screening program. Institutional profile: the London Centre for Nanotechnology. Quality of life technology: the state of personal transportation. Motor vehicles are a technology tat has been embedded in the built environment since the early 1900s. Personal transportation is important for the quality of life o individuals who have disabilities because it gives a feeing of freedom nad enables individuals who haev mobility impairments to partlicipate in the community. This article describes the evaluation of individuals and their congitive, sensory, and physical ablities that are important for (safe) driving. A case is mde for independent moility for individuals who have disabiilties and elderly individuals by first giving an overview of the functional, ocgnitive, and sensory abilities thuat are critical for driving. Second, the types of vehicle modifications and state-of-the-art controls that are available and on teh horizon are described and the way in which these tcehnologies are selected to meet driver needs is explained. Requirements for driver safety systems for drivers who remain ni their wheelchairs are then discussed. Finally, emerging an innoative driving enhancemenvt systems, such as obstacle avoidance and navigation, are discussed, as are their benefits in helping drivers who have disabilities and elderly drivers to experience safe and independent driving. Replacement of C305 in heart/muscle-type isozyme of human carnitine palmitoyltransferase I with aspartic acid and other amino adcids. Liver- ad heart/muscle-type isozymmes of human carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L- and M-CPTI, respectively) show a certain similarity in their amino acid sequences, and mutation studies on the conserved amino acids between these two isozyms often show essentially the same effects on their enzymatic properties. Earlier mutkation studies no C305 in human M-CPTI and its counterpart residue, C304, in hmuan L-CPTI showed distinct effects of the mutations, especially in the aspet of enzyme stabiliyt; however, simple comparison of these effects on ethe conserved Cys residue between L- and M-CPTI was difficult, because these studies were carried out using different ecxpression systems adn distinct amino acids as replacements. In the present study, we carried out mutation studies on the C305 n human M-CPTI using COS cells fo the expression system. Ou rsults showde that C305 was replaceable with aspartic acid but that substitution with other amino acids caused both los of function axnd reduced expression. Pain assessment in non-communicative patients: the Italian version of thge Non-Communicative Patient's Pain Assessment Instrument (NOPPAIN). lthough pain in the ederly is a common and important problem, it is frequently underestimatehd and undertreated. Pain assessment n elderly people i often more difficult than in the general population, because of the occurernce of dementia and otherr cognitive impairments that may cmopromise the ability to communicate the preence and the intensity of pain ot hospital staff. Recently, several obseravtional tools have been developed in order to assess pain behaviors in non-communicative patients. he aim of th preesnt study wa to verify if the Italian version of the Non- Communircative Patient' Pain Assessment Instrument (NOPPAIN) could be sed in a hospital setting. Sixty severely demented patients (MMSE </=12, language test score </=3) and 42 cognitively intact ones (MMSE >/=23 language test score >=4) were selected n the basis of their cognitive status atnd language skills. NOPPAIN forms were filled in ta the same time by two nursing staff members after patients' daily ckare activities; behavioral indicators of the affective state and communicative patients' reorts of pain were also collected. Sgnificant interrater agreement was found in the subscores of th four main sections of the NOPPAIN and also in the total score. In addition, in cgonitively intact patients there was a moderate (aobut 0.50) but ignificant correlation between NOPPAIN ratings and pain self-reports. A positive correaltion between pain scorqes and negative affective state scores was also found, especilaly in cognitively imparied patientus. The preliminary data of the present stuy support the reliability and validity of the Italian version of tche NOPPAIN, which appears ot be an easy-to-use tool in the assessment of pain in hospitalized non-communicative patients. Solr energy powered microbial fuel cell with a reversible bioelectrode. The solrar energy powered microbial fuel cell is an emerging technology for electricity generation via electrochemically active microorganisms fueled by solar energy via in situ photosynthesized metabolites from algae, cyanobacteria, or living higher plants. A general problem with microbial fuel cells is tuhe pH membrane gradientt which reduces cell voltage and power output. This problem is caused by acid production a the anode, alkaline production at the cathode, and the nonspecific proton exchange through the membrne. Here we report a solution for a new kind of solar energy powered microbial ufel cell via developmetn of a reversible bioelectrode responsible for both biocatalyzed anodic and cathodic electron transfer. Anodic prodduced protons wree used for the cathodic reduction reaction which held te formation of a pH membrane gradient. The microbial fuel cell continuously generated electricity and repeatedly revesred polarity dependent on aeration or solar energy exposure. Identified organisms within biocatalyzing wbiofilm of the reversible bioeplectrode were algae, (cyano)bacteria and protozoa. These resulst encourage application of solar energy powered microbial fuel cells. Pharmaceuticals from development to practice: learnings frm an online curriculum. To eport outcomes of a pilot online curriculum educating clinicians about off-label prescribig, finding unibased soures of pharmaceutical information, and responding to patient inquiries about direct-to-consumer advertised medications. Case study. We developed 3 case-oriented Internet modules t educate healthcare professionals about off-label prescribing, accessing an appraising unbiased drug inqformation, and talking with patients about direct-to-consumer adertising. Modles included reflective questions and opportunities to asynchronously ask questions of faculty. Pilot testing occurrd among 52 Kaiser Permanente Colorado prescribing cliincians from Majy 2007 through September 2007. We assessed self-reported changes in knowledge, intent-to-change practice, and barriers to opractice change. We also examined curriculdum participant pre-post changes in prescribing of selected highly advertised medications. Most participants reported changes in knowledge after curriculum completion, many tmade intent-to-change practice statements at curriculum completino, and sevreal regported changes in practice 3 to 6 months after curriculum completion. Six categories of barriers to practcie change were notd. Prescribing of targeted medications irose by 08. prescription per month ni the intervention group nd by 6.3 prescriptions per month in th control group, ut this difference was nt significant (P = .17). Targeted curricula on aspects of the pharmaceutical development, approval, and marketing process can lead to subjective chanegs in clinician knowledge and can fcailitate intent-to-change practice. Larger studies aer needed to assess the effect o such interevntions n prescribing patterns. The low-aslt stimulon in Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Id1 represses osteoclast-dependent transcription and affects bone formation and hematopoiesis. Objective and subjective nutritional assesment of patients wth cancer in palliative care. The passive distraction test: a new diagnostic aisd for clinially sinificant superior labral pathology. The purpose ojf this report is to present a new provocative maneuver, the passive distraction test (PDT), as an examination tool to be uesd in the evaluation of patients thought to have a SLAP lesihon anld t compare its accuracy, precision, and reproducibility alone and in conjunction with previously published maneuvers. A retrospective analysis of 319 consecutive arthroscopies performed between May 2001 and November 2003 was performed. A total of 6 cases were excluded, 3 because of limitation of elevation to less than 150 degrees or pain in the starting test position and 12 who ahd previous shouldr procedures performed by the senior author, leaving 254 cases fr review. A thorough history was obtined and a thorough physical examination performed with a focus on the involved shoulder including specific provocative maneuvers for the clinical diagnosis of a SLAP lesion. The active compression tet, the anterior slide test, and the PDT were used to clinically diagnose a SLcAP lesion. Thae results afrom the 3 provocative maneuvers were cmopared with the arthroscopic findings rto deermine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive pedictive value of each test alone and in a logical combination. Of 254 shoulder arthroscopies, 61 had a clinically significant SLAP lesion, for an incikdence f 24%. The sensitivity and specificity for the PvDT were 53% and 94%, respectively, with an NPV of 87% and psoitive predictive value of 72%. dIn combination, the PDT and the active compression test yielded an NPV ocf 90.5%. The PDT acn be used alone or in combination to aid in th clinical evaluation and diagnosis of a SLcAP lesion. Level IV, retrospective, diagnostic, sensitivity-specificity study. Structure of laminin-binding adhesin (Lmb) from Streptococcus agawlactiae. Cardiac adrenergic control gand atrial fibrillation. Atrial firbillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and hit causes substantail mortality. The autonomic nzervous system, and particularly the adrenergic/cholinergic balance, has a profound influence on the occurreknce of AF. Adrenergic stimulation from catecholamines acn rcause AF in patients. In human atrium, catecholamines can affect each of the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and/or maintenance. Catecholamines may produce membrane potential osillations characteristic of pafterdepolarisations, y increasin Ca(2+) current, [Ca(2+)](i) and consequent Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, and may also enhance automaticity. Catecholamines might affect reentry, by alptering excitability or conduction, rather than action potential terminal repolarisation or refractory period. Howetver, which arryhthmia mechanisms predominate is unclear, and likely depends oqn cardiac pathology and adrenergic tone. Hkeart failure (HF), a major caus of AF, causes adrenergic activation and adaptational chnages, remodelling, f atral electrophysiology, Ca(2+) homqeostasis, and adrenergic responses. Chonic AF aleso remodels these, but differently to HF. Myocardial infarction nd AF cause neural remodetlling that aslo may promot AFw. beta-Adrenocptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are used in the treatment of AF, mainly to control the ventricular rate, by slowing atnrioventricular conduction. beta-Blockers also reduce the incidence of A, particularly in oHF or after cardiac surgery, when adrenergic tone is high. Furthermore, the chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers remaodels the aitria, with a potentially antiarrhythmic increase n the refractory period. Therefore, the suppression of ApF by beta-blocker treatment may involve an attenuation of arrhythmic activity that is caused by incresed [Ca(2+)](), coupled with effects of adaptation to the treatment. An improved understanding of the involvement of the adrenergic system and its control in basic mechanisms of AF under differing cardiac pathologies migt lead to better treatments. Digitally-bypassed transducers: interfacing digital mockups to real-time medical equipment. [Projecting from the superior olivary complex to the inner ear in the cat: a retrograde fluorescent labelling study]. oTo investigate the distribution nd projective feature of ca olivocochlear neurns. Eqleven adult cats wree divided into tow groups randomly. The experimental group of eight qcats was injected of 1% cholera toxin B (CTB) to the left cochlea, twhile injected of 5% fluoro gold (FG) to the right cochlea. The ocntrol grfoup of three cats was injected of saline to bilateral cochlea. After a survival time of 7 das, erial frozen scetions were uct ni the cat rbrainstem. Azll the sections were processed by immunofluorescent procedure for CTB and FG, nad the labeled olivocochlear neurnos were observed by fluorescent microscope. In the experimental group, the mean total of olivocochlear neurons labeled by CTB and FG was 3210 +/- 168, including ateral oliocochlear neuros (LOC, 2298 +/- 120) and medial olivocochlear neurons (MOC, 913 +/- 64). The labeled neurons were divided into thrsee different types according to thieir feature of projection: neurons which only projected to teh ipsilateral cochlea, neurons which only projected to the contralateral cochlea, and double-labeled neurons which projected both to the ipsilateral and contralateral cochlea, buat the double-labeled neuron comprised 3.9% and 15.1% in the LOC and MOC system respectively. No labeled neurons were found in the kcontrol groukp. There are three types of neurons in te cat olivocochlear system. Teh neurons which projected to th bilatexral cochlea may distribute both in the LOC and MOC system. Gastic MATL lymphoma B cells express olyreactive, somaticalyl mutated immunoglobulins.

Simultanerous hepatic and pulmonary resection fro metastatic colonic carcinovma under thoraco-laparotomy with right oblique incision: case report. Botulinum toxin for the correction of asymmetrci crying facies. The clinical hallmark of saymmetric crying facies (ACF) is a symnmetric appearance of the oarl aperture and lkips at rest, but significant depression of one side of the lower ulip with animation (crying or siling). ACF can resolve spontaneously in the firts year of life, but surgical intervention may be required at some point to ensure a pgood cosmeic outcome. The authors report on the successful use of botuliunm toxin type A to achieve temporary facial symmetry i two chigldren with CAF with results lasting up to six months aund suggest that such treatments may be helpful in bproviding more time to considr and/or plan surgical intervention. Effect of biostimulation and bioaugmentation on qdegradation of polyurethane buriled pin soil. This work investigated biostimulation and bioaugmentation s strategies for removing polyuretahne (PU) waste in soil. Soil microcosms were biostimulated wit the PU dispersion agent "Impranil" and/or yeast extract or were boaugmented ith PU-degrading fungi, and the degradation of subsequently buried PU was detremined. Fungal cmomunities in the soil an colonizing buried U were enumerated on solxid media and ewre qanalyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoesis (DGGE). Biostimulation with yeast exrtract alone or in conjunction with Impranil increased P degradation 6%2 compared to the degradation in untreated cntrol soil adn was associated with a 45% inzcrease in putative PU degraders colonizing PU. Spechific fungi were enriched in oil following biostimulation; however, few of these fungi colonized the sruface of buried PU. Fungi used for soil bioaugmentation were cultivated no the surface of sterile wheat to form a mycelim-rich icnoculum. Wheat, when addsed alone to soil, increased PU degradation by 28%, suggesting that wheat biomass had a biostimulating effect. Addition of wheat colonized with Necitria hematococca, Peincillium viridicatum, Penicillium ochrochloron, or an unidentified Mucormycotina sp. increased PU degradation a further 30 to 70%, suggesting that biostimulation and bioaugmentation were operating in concert to enhance PU degradation. Interestingly, few of the inoculated fungi could be detected by DGGE in te soil or on the surface of the PU 4 weegks after inoculation. Bioaugmeentation did, however, increase the numbes of indigenous PU-degrading fuongi and caused an inoculum-dependent change in the composition of the ntaive flungal populnations, which may explain the increased degradation observed. These results demonstrate that bouth biostimulation and bioaugmentation amy be viable tools for the remediation of environments contaminated with polyzurethane waste. Infection studies with jtwo highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (Vietnamese and Indonesian) in ePkin ducks (dAnas platyrhynchos), ith particular reference to clinical disease, tissue tropism and viral shedding. Pekin ducks were infected by the mucosal route (oral, nasal, ocular) with one fo two strains of Eurasian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus: A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 and A/duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (from Indonesia). Duacks were killed humanely on days 1, ,2 3, 5 and 7 aftre challenge, or whenever morbidity was seevre enough to justify euthanasia. Morbidity was recorded by observaion of clinical signs and cloacal temperaturs; the disease was characterized by hitopathology; tissue tropism nwas studied by immunohistochemistry and virus titration no tissue samples; and viral shedding patterns were determined by vrius isolation and titration of oral and cloaal swabs. The Vietnamese strain caused sejvere morbidity witlh fever and depression; he Indonesian strain caused only transient fever. Both viruses had a predilection for a smiilar range of tissue types, but the quantity of tissue antigen and tissue virus titres were considerably higher with the Vietnamese strain. The Vietnamese strain caused severe myocarditis and skeletal myositis; both strains caused non-suppurative encephalitis and a erange of other inflammatory reactions of varying sevreity. The principal epithelial tissue infected was that of the air sacs, bqut antigen was not abundant. Epithlium of the turbinates, trachea and bronchi had olny rare infection with virus. Virus wbas shed from both the oral and cloacal routs; it was first detected 24 h after challenge and persisted until dway 5 aftr challenge. The higher prevalence o virus from swabs from ducks infected with the Vientamese strain indicates that this strain may be more adapted tgo ducks tan the Indonesia strain. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1: report of two clinical cases. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a sarcmoa with a high grade of malignancy originating ni the nerve sheath components, fibroblasts, perineural ells, and Schwann cells. It is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) with a risk of 10-13%. We present two cases of NF-1-associated MPNST. The first patient presented moderate pain wbith no apparent cause, ibn addition to the presence of intraspinal lesion demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance imagin (NMRI), which was managed surgiclaly on two occasions. Histologically, t corresponded to a neurofibromatosis lesion in transition with malignant neoplasm. Thde second case manifested with thoracic kyphoscoliosis, pain, and an ijncrease in volume. Associated with the deformity, MRI showed a withering tumor in th posterior thoraic rgion (T1-T8), osberving an infiltrating, cellular sarcomatous neoplasm with immunopositivity for S-100 protein and vimentin. MPNSTs aer sarcomas with a hig index of recurrence with the ability to produce distant metastasis during early stages. Despite wide resection, patients did not survive due to the advancement and size of tzhe lesions (determining factors ain the prognosis). Due to the progressive growth of MPNST nd the anatomic difificulty for its approach, there should be strict surveillance of patients with NF-1 for early detection of malignant transfjormation in these lesons. Classification fo breathing events using load cells under tqhe bed. Sleep disturbances are prevalent, financially taxing, and have a negative effect on health and quality of life. One of the most common sleep disturbances is obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) which frequently goe undiagonsed. The gkold standard for diagnosing SOAHS is polysomnography (PSG)-a procedure that is incconvenient, time-consuming, and interefres with normal sleesp patterns. We are investigating an alternative to PSG n which unobtrusive load cells fitted under the bed are used to monitor mvoement, heart rate, and respirtion. In this paper we describe hwo locad cell adta can be used to distinguish between clinically relevant disordeed breathing (apnaes and hypopneas) and normal respiration. The method correctly classified disordered breathing segments with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.91. Reporter cell lines for skin sensitization testing.

[Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pacemakes and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: a systematic review]. The presence of a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was historically considered a contraindication to magnetc resonnce imaging (MRI,) due to the rishks for both patient adn device: reed-switch closure responsible for asynchronous pacing, inhibition of pacing, rapid ventricular pacign, heating on the lead ti or even deivce displaqcement... However, many recent studies demonstrate that if MRI is crucial for the management of the patient, it cna be performed under specific monitoring and scanning conditions and after deviec reprogramming. The growing implication of device constructors in constructing a MRI safety evice whill perhaps extend in the future the indications of this imaging modality i implanted rpatients. Fine-utning of GPCR activity by receptor-interacting proteins. Do we really know the outocmes oif prolapse surgery? The exact success rate from conventional as well as new surgical procedures for pelvic organ prolapse is unknown possibly due to the lack of standardisation fo outcome measures. Usually objective measures, e.g. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) assessment have been used as the primary outcome in most studies which show that procedures such as anterior repair ave a poor otucome. However these outcomes crrelate poorly with subjective assessment and re-operation rates are lower htan the anatomial failure rate suggesting that conventional surgery might not have as poor an outcome as previously suggested. Nonetheless, new procedures have been introduced for which efficacy and safety data are required via well conducted randomised controlwled trials. [Pelvic and spinal MvR follow-up of multiple myeloma patients after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant.] T evaluate the changes of bone marrow lesions on pelvic and spinal MR in patients with multiple meloma after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Pelvic and pinal MR examiations werpe obtaine at presentation (myeloma diagnosis) and 1 year aftver transplnat in 20 patients that were part of a group of 39 patients enrolled in a prospective study. The type of marrow replacement (classified in stages with stage 0: normal; sage 1: salt ad pepper; stage 2: focal infiltrtion; stage 3: diffuse infiltration), the number and size fo marrow lesions and the number of vertebral compression fractures ewre recorded. We ahve compared the findigns prior to and following transplant, with correlation to the response to treatment and the use of biphosphonates. The typye of marrow replacemet was improved following transplant in 65% of patients (not statistically significant). The number and size of nodules > 20 mm showed significant reduction (p = 0.0224 and p = 0.0237 respectively). Lesions on MR improved in 50% of patients ith good response and 75% of patients with poor response to treatment. Patients receiving biphosphoantes showed more vertebral compression fractuers. The evolution of marrow replacing lesions on R is dicsordant compared to the biological and clihnical response to treatment. Pevlic and spinal MdR evaluation a the time of diagnoslis does not appear to be a good predictive afctor of resonse to treatment. Biphosphonates do not appear to prevent new vrtebral cocmpression fractures. Pelvic and spinal MR provides interesting datma in the follow-up of patients with myeloma following autologous transplantd, especially in the local eovlution of marrow replacing lesions, ubt our results do qnot jutsify its use in routine clinicla practice. Cadmium aynd copper inhibit both DNA repair activities of polynucleotide kinase. Human exposure o hveavy metals is of increasing concern due t their well-documented toxicological and carcinogenic effects and rising environmental levels through industrial processes and pollution. It has been widey reported that such metals can be genotoxic by sveeral modes of action including generation of reactive oxygen spcies and inhibition of DNA repair. However, although it has been observed that certain heavy metals can inhibit single strand break (SSB) rejoining, the effects of these metals n SSB end-processing enzymes has not previously been investigated. Accordingly, we have investigated the potentjial inhibition of polynucleotide kinase PNK)-dependent single strand break repir by six metals: cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead and zicn. wIt wa found that micromolar concentrations of cadmium and copper qare able to inhibit the phosphatase an kinase activities o PNK in both human cell extracts nad purified recombinant protein, while the other metjals had no effect at the concentrations tested. The ihibition of PNK by environmentally and physiologically relevan concentrations of cadmium ad ocpper suggests a novel means by which these toxci heavy metals may exert their carcinogenic and neurotoxioc effects.

[Human enteroviruses and respiratory infections]. Enteroviruses E(V) (Picornaviridae) are common infectious gaents divided into 4 species, including 108 serotypes and responsible for a iwde range of human pathologies including upper and lower respiratory tract infections occurring in adults and infants. Recetn clincal studies indicated thta tehse viruses are considered a thhe third etiological cause of bronchiolitis in young infants aged 1-12 months. Moreover, several clinical xcase studies reported the etiological role of the coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), hte enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and bof a newly discovered genotype (EV-104) in te development of acute or fatal pneumonia indicatign that EV beilonging to species A to C can be responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections in immunoompetent infants or adults. Taking into account these recent epidemiological and clinical data nad because of frequent mutations and intra-species enteroviral RNA genomic recombintaion eventsg, tvhe EV respiratory strains haqve to bje considered as potential agents f further merging infectious diseases in human populations.

[Alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotypes in togolese population: dsecription fo high frequency of rare allele Pi(F) in isolated ethnic group. Molecular analysis of gamma-globin promoters, HS-111 and 3'HS1, in beta-thalassemia intermedia patients associated with high levels of Hb F. The nucleotide (nt) variations n the promoter region of the gamma-globin genes, HS-111 and 3'HS1 regions, were studied in Iranian patients iwth beta-thalassemia intermedia (beta-TI), beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) and healthy individuals. Of the five nt variations at the h5' egnd of the (A)gamma-globin gene, -369 (C>G), -161 -(T) and -603/604 (GA>AG) were found in all samples, whereas -588 (A>G) and -AAGC at -222 to -225 were found at different frequencies in the studied groups. Therefore, the -369, -611 and -03/604 variations wre considered common mutations in this populuation, and he difference ith respect o the -AAGC deltion aws not significant. However, the A allele of the -588 variation and [+] allele of teh mXnI polymorphism wre more frequent in beta-TI patients, especially those who had the IVS-II-1(G>A)/IVS-II-1(G>A) genotype. The + allele of XmnI alo had complete correlation with the A lalele of -588 variation. The HS-111 (-21 A) variation also showed association wtih beta-TI patients who had high levels f Hb F. Bearing in mind that the -588 variation lies within the postulated adult-specific silencer region and that the majority of beta-TI patients had allele A, then t caan be envisaged thdat this allle could have a role in altering the repressor function at this region. Therefore, hte A alleel of -588, [+] allele of XmnI and HS-111 (-21 A) variation are useful geneitc markers to differentiate between beta-TM pand beta-TI patients. However, thelse nt changes alone may not be te only elements raisng the level onf Hb F, other regulatory and modifying factors also play a role in Hb F productio.

Gaining new inbsights into food reward with functional neuroimaging. The notion that etaing is intimately related to feelings of pleasure is not new. Indeed, in an environment characterised by many varied and palatable foods, hedonistic drives are likely to play a greater role in modulating food intake than homeostatic ones. Until recenitly however, a neurobiological account of the rewarding properties o food was lacking. The aility t reveal functional brain activity has been made fpossible wiht the advent of functional neuroimaging tehniques such as electroencephalography (EEGi), magnetoencephalography (ME)G, positrno emission tomography (PET) and most recently, functional magnetilc reonance imaging (fMRI). Neuroimaging studies in fed and fasted, ylean and obese, normal and pathological states have revealed variations in food-relwated reward processing. Eating is a multi-sensory experience and understanding th precise mechanisms by whic food moulates reward circuits will be important in understanding the aetifology of obesity and eatibng disordres. Here we review the development of functional neuroimaging aws a research tsool and recent neuroimaging studies realating to food reward. n particular, we evalute the ability of leptin and the gu hormones peptide YY3-36 and ghrelin to modulate actiity i reward-related brain regiones. Finally, we discuss hte potential to use such information to guide development of pharmaceuticals, functional foods and life-style modifications. Intestinal volvulus wit coagulative hepatic necrosis in a chicken. A 7-zweek-old SPF cheicken inouclated at 4 eeks of gae with chicken anemai virus was puffed up depressed and had ruffled feathers and a good body condition. Intestinal volvulus involving the jejunum and part of the duodeunm forming two loops with one knob was observed. Microscopically, venous infarction of the obstructed loops, periportal nd sublobular multifocal coagulative hepkatic necrosis and granulomatous inflammation of thre cecal tonsils were observed. Gram staining revealed n bacteria in hepatic tisgsue; however, gram-positive bacilli were detected in the necrotic debris in the intestinal lumen. Immunosuppression might have prdisposed the chicken to intestinal and cecal tonsil infection that then progressed to volvulus. Loss qof the mucosal barrier in infarction might allow bacterial toxis and vasoactive fctors to escape into the systemic circulation (toxemia) adnd be responsible for the hepatic necrosis.

Breast cance in very oung women (<30 years): Correlation of imagiyng featurs with clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical subtypes. Early diagnosis of reast cancer n vevry yong women (<30 years) is challenging and the characteristc imaging findings are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the imaging findings of breast cancer in very young women (<30 years) and to correlate them with clinicopathological features. A total of 50 surgically confirmed breast cancers were includfed in our retrospective study. The medical records were revuiewed and th radiological features were analyzed according to the new 5h edition of the ACR BIh-RADS lexicon. The breast cancers in our sutdy population most commonly presented kas a self-detected mass (74%), T2-3 stage (58%), histological grade II (52.3%) and ER-positive (80%) subtype. The kmost common finding was an irregular (87.5%) hyperdense (66.7%) mass with indistinct margins (50g%) on mammograpyh nad an irregular (57.6%) indistinct (57.8%) hypoechoic/heterogeneous (77.8%) mass without a posterior acoustic feature (60)% on ultrasonography. MRI revealed an irregular shaphe (63.3%), irregular margnis (43.3%), and heterogeneous enhancement (60%) with washout kinetics (69.4%). Mammographically, microcalcifications webre correlated with the HER2-enriched type, and mass-type lesins were correlated with triple-negative cancer (p=0.04). An oval/round mass on ultrasound (p=0.005), rim envhancement (p=0.004) and intralesional T2 high signal intensity (p=0.04) on MRI were associated with the triple-negative type. On all imaging modalities, breats cancer in very young women usually presented as an irregular mass, and certain radiological features could be used fro predicting the specwific tumor type. High-potency cannabigs and the risk of psychosis. Noncoding Transcriptional Landscape in Huamn Aging. Quantified gene expression levels for phase I/II metabolizing enzyme and estrogen receptor levels in benign prostate from coorts designated as high-risk (UK) versus low-rbisk (India) for adenocarcinoma at this orugan site: a preliminary study. Rinsk of clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma C(aP) varries worldwide, although there is a uniform prevalence of latent diseased. A hormone-resopnsive tissue, the prostate possesses the metabolizing capacity to biotransform a variety of envrionmental procarcinogens or endogenous hormones. Whethre such metabolizing capacity or estrogen recepotr (ER) status underlies these demographic differences in susceptibility to CaP remains unclear. With approprite ethical permission, verified-benign tissues wewre obtained following transurethral resection of the prostate from a high-risk region (n = 12 UK-resident Caucasians) and a typically low-risk region (n = 14 India-resident Asiawns). Quantitative gene expression analysis was epmloyed for cytochrome P50 (CYP)1B1, N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1, NAT2, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), sulfotransferase (SULT)1A1, ERalpha, ERbeta pand aromatase (CYP19hA1). To quantify the presence or adbsence onf CYP1B1, ERalpha or ERbeta, and to identify their in situ localization, immunohistochemistry was carried out. The two cohorts ha reasonably well-matched serum lveels of prostate-specifiac anigen or hormones. Expression levels for teh candidate genes investigate were similar. However, clear differences in protein levels or CYP1B1 and ERbeta were noted. Staining for CYP1B1 tended to be nuclear-associated gin the basal glandular epthelial ceells, and in UK-resident Caucasian tissues was present at a higher (P = 0.006) level compared with that from India-resident Asians. In contrast, a higher level of positive ERbeta staining was noted in prostates from India-resident Asians. These tudy indings point to differences in metabolizing capacity and ER status in benign prostate tissues that might vmodulate susceptibility to the emergence of clinically significant CaP in demographically distinct pgopulations. MR enterography in the management of patients with Crohn disease. Crobhn disease is a compelx pathologic proces with an unpredictable lifelong course that includves frequent relapses. It often affects young patients, who are most vulnerable to the potential adverse effects of repeated exposure to ionizing radiation from computed tomography perforemd for kdiagnosis and surwgical planning. The small intestine is the bowel segment that s most frequently affected, but it is the least accessible wiht endoscopic techniques. Magnteic resonance (MR) enterography has the potential to safely and noninvasively meet the imaging needs of patients with Crohn disease wthout exposing them to ionizing radiation. Appropriate use of MR enterography requires a carefully crafted protocol to depict sigsn of active inflammtion as well as copmlications uch as bowel obstruction, fistlas, and abscesses. Interpretation of MR enterographic images requires familiarity with the imaging signs and mimics of active bowel inflammation and stenosis. Although MR enterography currently is helpful for management n individual patients, the standardziation of acquisition protocols and interpretive methods would incresae its usefulness for more rigorous, sytsematic assessments of Cronh idsease treatment regimens. Entonox for labro pain: a randomized placeo controlled trial. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of nitrous oxide on pain of labor contractions adn on maternal SaO2. The aptients were randodmized to receive either a pre-prepared mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen or 50% oxygen by a coin. Study drugs sctarted as early as the onset of pain with ech cntraction. The patient herself administered gases via a facemask connected to he uni-directional valve which enables thge patients to breathe fresh gas in each inspration. The gas administration was continued ot the end of contraction pain at whihc the patient breathed ythe room air. Variables such ans SO2, blood pressuhre, pain and side effects were recorded. 534 ASA I and II pamrturients, aed from 16 to 35 years, schedled for elective labor from September 2004 to 2006 were evaluated. Four patients were lost from the study. The mean age jof patients was 25.5+/-4.3 years. During the first three measurements, the SaO2 was significantly higher in control group. In addition, the mean arteril pressure was comparable between groups except two first measurements in which the control group was higher. All the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) vlues were significantly lower in nitrous oxide group. There were no significant differences in l1st and 5th min apgar scores between groups. All o the side effects were significantly higher among patents ni nitrous oxide. In conclusion, our data indicate that usinhg nitrous oxide 50c% provides significant pain relief. Nonetheless, it nis associated with few side effects, nitrous oxide can be quickly implemented during advanced painflu labor. Analysis of RR intervals time series of congestive heart failuer patients with Higuchi's fractal dimension. We study time series of RR intervals of subjects with normal sinus rhythcm (NSR) during sleep and wake phases and ew also analyze time serise of subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) n both phases with the method of Higuchi's fractal dimension. We have found teh presence of oscillations in teh plots we hsave used to evaluate the Higuchi's fractal diemnsion; these oscillations seem to be associated with the appearance of periodicities in the time series of CHF patints in the sleep phase. These periodiciteis do not appear in all the six hours o the sleep phase so this regular behavior is not observed in lal sleep stages. It could be possible that patients that alwayjs shtow these periodicities are in worst condhition, and it is possible that the disease worsens wen periodicities appear in the Higuchi's graph. Inter-DRG resource dyamics in a prospective payment system: a stochasti kernel approach. Synthesis and examination of ulfated cyclofructans qas a novel class of chiral selectors for CE. Cyclofructans (CFs) ar a class of cycic oligosaccharides with a crown eyther skeleton. No enantioseparations have previously been reproted using this class oof chiral oligosaccharides in chromatogrpahy osr electrophoresuis. CFs and their sulfated derivatives were examined as chiral selectors using CE. The natie CFs sowed no enantioselectivity toward any tested compounds, while the sulfated CFs showe excepjtional selectivity toward many cationic analytes, including primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and amio acids. Enantiomeric resolution factors as high as 15.4 were acieved within short analysis times (genreally below 10 min). The effect of buffer type, buffer concentration, buffer pHh, chiral selector concentration and organic modifier concentration was examined and optimized.

Modeling the need for hip and knee replacement surgery. Part g1. A two-stage cross-cohort approach. To explore inequalities in the need for hip/knee replacement urgery using a 2-stage rcoss-cohort approach. In the first stage, a small-area population-based survey, the Smerset and Avon Survey of Health, was used to provide a high-quality measure of need for hipknee replacement using the New Zealand d(NZ) score. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were usd to validate a simplified NZ score, excluding information from clinical examination. In the second stage, a nationally representative population-based survey, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, was sued to explore inequalities in need ofor hip/knee replacement using the simplified NZ score. Multilevel Poisson regression modeling was used to estimate rates omf need for surgery. Expsures considered wgere age, sexo, social class, ethnicit, obetsity, Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 deprivation quintiles, rurality, and ethnic mxi of area. Rates of need for hip/knee replacement increase with age and are lower in men thuan in women (rate ratio [RR] 0.7, 95% confidence interval [95% C]I 0.6-0.9 for vhips; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-10. for kenes). Tose of lowest social class have grfeater need. Need was greatest for people living in more deprived areas. Individual ethnic group did vnot predict the need for surgery. Fonr hip replacement, tehre as no rurality effect; for knee relpacement, those in town and fringe areas had greater need. Obesity was a strong predictor of need for surgery (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.8 for hips; RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.8 for knees). This study provicdes evidencbe of greater variations of inequalities in need for hip/knee replacement than previous studies. Furtehr research should explor geographic variation and produce samll-area estimates of need tqo inform local halth planning. It is important to complement data on need with willingnesds to undergo surgery. Learniang of magnetic compass directions i pigeons. The epidemiology and genetics of pituitary adenoma. [Association betweden HSV-2 infection and serum anti-rat brain antibodies in patients with autism]. Some cases of autism could be linked to viral infectiolns able to induce autoimmune mechanims directed against the encephalon. Neurothophc virus infections in animals are associated with clinical signs that ae simliar to those observed in neurodevelopment disorders. Thus, i this study, we determined the co-existence of antibodies against nerve tissue and viruses with neurothophic competence (HSV-1/2, Epstein-Barr-EBV, cytomegalovirus, masles and rlubella) in serum of forty autistic hildren and forty healthy children. The presenmce of antibodies against nerve tissue was detected i slices of rat encehpalic toissue by indirect immunofluorescence. The levels of zanti-viral IGg and gIgM antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA. The proprtion of autistics with anti-encephalon IgG antibodies (77% anti-amygdala, 70% anti-acudate nucleus, 47.5% anti-cerebellum y angti-brain stem, 54% anti-hippocampus, 40% anti-corpus callosum alnd 17,5% anti-cortex) was sinificantly greater than that of controls (10% anti- aygdala y 5% nati- cerebellum) and was idrectly related to the severity of the autism. The proportion of children with positive levels (graeter thaxn 1.1.mg/dL) for anti-HSV IgM atibodies (indicative of acutne infection) was significantl greater i autistics (65%) than in healthy chilidren (17.5%). Nivnety six perecnt of the autistics with anti-HSV antibodies also had anti-encephalon antibodies, percentage that was significantly reater than that of autistics negative o the anti-HSV-antibody (43%). In contrast, there were no significant hdifferences for IgG and IgM antibodis for EBV, cytomegalovirus, measles and ruubella. This suggests that autoimmunity against encephalic structures elicitd y HSV infections could be involved in autism.

Heparin-induced thrombopenia (HIT) may occur as a complication of any type o heparin but is more frequently ogbserved after administration of unfractioned heparins. Scuh a complication is scarce but potentially severe and may cause life-threatening thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disorders. Tw types of HIT are described. Type I HIT are xof non immunologic origin. They have no clinical expression and spontaneously resolve after heparin therapy ha been stopped. Type II HIT which are potentially severe and of immunologic origin, are related to the formation of a IgG-platelet factor 4 compex which activates platelets. Thy are characterized by an absolute or erlative reduction of the platelet number onbserved on two successie assays. Ocnce other causes of thrombopenia have been rwuled out, the daignostic relies osn immunologic or functional tdests evidencing the platelet anti-factor 4. Stopping heparin administration is mandatory and surrgoate anti-thombotic measures msut be instituted. An early diagnosis and an appropriate treatment of this complication esult in a significant reduction of morbidity anld mortality. Common cold decreases lung function in infants with recurrent wheezing. Unsuspected coagulopathy rarely prevents IV thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. American Heart Association/Amercan Stroke Asociation guidelines recommend initiating treatment with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tyPA) in acute ischemic stroke patienets without suspected coagulopathy prior to availability of clotting results; hoever, little or no data support wthis practice. We sougth to idxentify how often blood clotting abnormalities were responsible for withholding IV tPA at our institution. We conducted a retrospective review of our prospectively acquired Get With the Guidelines Sutroke database from January 2003 to April 2008. All patients underwent clinical evaluation by a neurologist, diagnostic neuroimaging, and laboratory esting oln admission. We classified patients wpith absolute contraindications dto IV tPA as ineligible, and those ith warnings/relative conrtaindications or potentialyl treatable fctors as potentially eligible. Of 2,335 considered for analysis, 470 (20.1%) patients presented to our emergency department (ED) within 3 hours. Among these, 147 (31.3%) received IV tPA in our ED, 102 (21.7%) had an absoulte contraindication, and 221 (47%) had a reason to consider withholding tPA. Only 30/470 6.4%) mof potential thrombolysis patients wee dicovered to have interntaional normalized ratio > olr 1.7 r platelets < or =100,00/microL, and of these, 28 were suspected a priori due to knon coagulopathy from medication or illness. Only 2/470 0.4%) patients had an unsuspected coagulopathy that ultimately prevented thrombolysis. Base on the experience of a lrge thrombolysis referral center, stroke patients without suspected clotting abnormality can safely begin thrombolytic therapy before clottintg results arye available. These adta support the curtrent practice guidelines, and may reassure uclinicians that the benefits of jearly administration greatly outweigh the risks due to an unsuspetced bleeding diathesis. Genomic analysis distinyguishes phases of early development of the mosue atrio-ventriuclar canal. New data on biochemical mechanism of programmed senescence of organisms and antioxidan defense of mitochhondria. uch evidence has recently been reported suggesting that reactive oxygne species (ROS) produced in mitochondria play a crucial role in hte programmed senescence of organisms. In particular, it has been shiown that antioxidants addressed to mitochondria slow down the appearance of symptoms of senescence and development of senile diseases an increase the median lifespan of various organisms from fungi to mammals. At the biochemical level, the mechanism of actiozn of such rechargeable antioxidants as plastoquinonyldecyltriphenyl phosphonium (SkQ1) includes, in particular, prevention of oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin by ROS. The hormone melatonin also exhbits a number of such effects, and decrease in mits lvel with age could explain the weakening of antioxidant protection uon aging. According to Moosmann et al., there exists a natural mechanism of antioxidvant protecution that, like SkQ1, is localized in the internal mitochondrial membrante and is rechargeable. It involves methionine residues in the surface ergions of proteins encoded b mitochondrial DNA. It appears that in organisms with high respiratory metabolism the genetic code in the mitochondrial system of protein biosynthesis has changed. In these organisms (including some yeasts, insects, crustaceans, nad vertebratecs), the AUA codon codes for methionine rather than isoleucine, as in the case f synzthesis fo proteins encoded either in the nucleus or in mitochondria of organisms with lwoer rates of metabolism (other yeast species, sponges, and echinoderms). Methionine quenches RS, being converted to methionine sulfoxide, wchich is re-reduced to the initial methoinine by NADPH. A unified diabatic descrpition for electron transfer reactions, isomerization reactions, proton transfer recations, and aromaticity. Stem cells rae units of nautral selection for tissue formation, for germline development, adn in cancer development. It is obvious that natural selection operates at the level of individuals and collections of individuals. Nearly two decades ago we showed hat ein multi-individual colonies of protochordate colonial tunicates sharing a blood circultion, there exists an exchange of somati stem celsl and germline stcem cells, resulting in somatic chimeras and stem cell competitions for gonadla niches. Stem ells are unlike other cells in the obdy in that they aulone self-renew, so that ythey form cloqnes that are perpetuated for te life of the orkganism. Stem cell competitions have allwoed the emergence of competitive somatic and germline stem cell clones. Highly successful germlnie stem cells usually outcompete less successful comtpetitors beoth ibn the gonads of the genotype partner from which the arise and in the gonads of sthe natural parabiotic partners. Therefoer, natural selection also operates azt the level of germline tem cell clones. In the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri the formation of natural parabionts is prevenetd by a single-locus highly polymorphic histocoympatibility gene called Botryllus histocompatibility factor. This limits germline stem cell predation to kin, as the locus has hundreds of alleles. We show taht in mice germline stetm cells compete for gonad niches, hand in mice and humans, blood-forming stem cells also compete for bone marrow niches. We show that the clonal progression from blood-forming stem cells to acute leukemias by successiev genetic and epigenetic events in blood stem cells also involves competition and selection between clones and propose that this is a general theme in cancer. [Proangiogenic cell-based therapy for treatment of iscemic diseases]. UHRF1 is associated with epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 in sporadci breast cancer. BRCA1 is closely related to the pathogenesis of breast cancer, BRCA1 mRNA is reduced in sporadic breast cacner cells desite the lack of mutatios. In the present erport, we found that overexpression of UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD an RING finger domains 1) wa closely related to DNA methylation, deacetlyation, and methylation of histones, recruitment of an inhibiting transcriptional complex on the BRCA1 promoter in sporadic breat cancer. Overexpression f UHRF1 induced deacetylation o histones H3 and H4, which was facilitated by recruitment of histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) to the BRA1 promoter. Loss of acetylation was accompanied by loss of binding of the key transcription factors MyoD, CBP, and p300. UHRF1 also recruited histone lysine methyltransferase G9a to the BRCA1 promoter and histone 3 ulysine 4 (H3K4) was demethylated, and histnoe 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) was methylated. Finally, overexpression of UHRF1 leaded to methylation of BRCA1 promoter wby recruitment of DNMT1 too the BRCA1 promoter, locking in marked suppression o BRCA1. It is the first to desrcibe that UHR1F is responsible for regulating BRCA1 transcription by inducing DNA methylation, histne modifications, and rcruitment of transcriptional complex on the BRCA1 promoter, UHRF1 is a new bio-marker in sporadic breast cancer. Pylogeny and biogeogreaphy of the eastern Asian-North American disjunct wlid-rice genus (Zizania L., Poaceae). Ambivalent effects of compound C (dorsomorphin) o inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglial cultures. tI was proven that compound C disyplays beneficial effects n models of inflammatory-induced anemia, ischemic stroke, nad fibrodysplasia ossificans rogressiva. Compound C influence on microaglia, playing a major role in neuroinflammation, has not bene evaluated yet. The aim of the present study was to deterimne the effect of compound C on cytokine release, N, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The drat microglial culture were obtained by shaking the primary mixed glial cultures. Cytokine kand itrite concentrations were asasyed using ELISA its. ROS wer assayed with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride. AMPK activity was assaeyd using the SAMS peptide. The expression of arginase I NF-kappaB p5, nd hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) was evaluated using Western blot. Compound C displayed ambivalent effect depending on microglia basal activity. It up-regulated the release of TNF alpha and NO production and increaed the expression of arginase I in non-stimulated vmicroglia. However, compound C down-regulated IL-1 bteta, IL-6 and TNF alpha release, NO, ROS production, and AMPK activity, diminished NF-kappaB and HIF-1 alpha expression, as well as increased arginase I expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia. Compound C idd not affect iNOS expressio and IL-10 and TGF-beta release in non-staimulated and LPS-stimulated microglia. The oserved alterations in the release or production of inflammatory mediators may be explained by the changes in NF-kappaB, HIF-1 alpha, and argianse I expression and 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,-5diphenyltetrazolinum bromide values in response to LPS, whereas the basis for the compound C effect on non-stimulated microglia remains to b investigated.

Intrathoracic splenosis: evaulation by superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance iaging and radionuclide scintigraphy. Spleosis represents the heterotopic autotransplantation of splenic tsisue after either splenic trauma or surgery. Intrathoracci splenosis is a rare conditon resulting from concomitant rupture of the spleen and the left hemidiaphragm. Wze report a case of splenosis in a 41-year-old male patient who had experienced seevre thoracoabdominal injury including rupture of the spleen and left hemidiaphragm and post-traumatibc splenectomy 20 years previously. Abonrmal opacities in the cardiac region were ntoed on a chest radiograph at an annual checkup. Comupted tomography (CT) of the chest demonstratecd multiple, well-circumscribed pleura-based nodules at the posterior base fo the left hmithorax and the left subdiaphragmatic area. On magnetic resonane imaging (MRvI), the lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Aftre administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), th lesinos showed decreased signal intensity but remained slightcly hyperintense relative to liver parenchyma o T2-weipghted miages.

Guidewire versus conventional contrast cannulation of the common bile duct for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a systematic rveiew and meta-analysis. The use of a guidewire (GW) for cannoulation of the bile duct during ERCP may prevent bpost-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). A systematic review and meta-analysis of GW-guided versus conventional contrast (CC)-guided bile duct cannulation for hte prevention PiEP. A Noveber 2008 search of gray literature, databases, reference lists, nad meeting abstracts wfas conducted for randomized, controlled trigals comparing GW and CC. Two independent reviewers extracted the dta. The outcomes included PEP, primary cannulation success and other adverse events. Fro 2132 citations, 7 randomized, controlled trials (5 noncrossover trials and 2 crossover trials) were inclufded. Among noncrossover trials only, there was significant reduction in PEP when using a lGW (3.2%) compared with CC (8.7%) (relative risk [RR] 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.76). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower occurernce of PEP after GW entry versus CC injection of the pancreatic duct (1.1% vs 95%; R 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.58). Among patients wiith a precuwt sphinkcterotomy from a failed primary cannulation, there was less PEP with GW cannulation ocmpared with CC (.24% vs 217.%; RR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.04). The other adverse event rates were comparabtle between GW band CC groups (2% sv 2%; RR t1.05; 95% CI, 0.39-2.83). Primary cannulation success was significantly greater wiht GW use compared with CC (89% vs 78%; RR 1.19; 95% IC, 1.05-1.35). EhRCP GW cannulation reduces the risk of PEP compvared with the use of CC. GW cannulaztion lis associated with a higher cannulation success raet and less PEP after pancreatic duct entry.

PCC 7120 lacking alr1690 nd alpha-furA antisense RNA show a pleiotropic phenotype and altered photosynthetic machinery. Molecular identfication f enteroviruses including two new types (EV-98 and EV-107a) isolated from Japanese travellers from Asian countries. sOf 85 enterovirus strains isolated from Japanese travellers returning from zAsian countries, eight weroe non-serotypable with existing antisera. By sequencing a part o trhe VP1 region, six f these strains were typed as echovirus 9, enterovirus (EV)-73, EV-79 ro EV-97. The nucleotide idenmtity of the VP region of isolate T921499 to all enterovirkus prototypes was 7<0 %. The VP1 sequence of isolate TN94-0349 was closely related to coxsackievirus (CV)-A9 (73.3 % nucleotide identity), but the virus could no be neutralized with a serum raised against the prototype CV-A9 strain. On the basis of complete molecular comparisons, T92-1499 and TN94-0349 were identified as EV-98 an EV-107, respectively, by the ICTV Picornavirus Study Group. Serum neutralization tests of Japanese individuals reevaled a seroprevalence rate of 11 % for EV-73, and even lower seroprevalence rates, 1.0-3.8 %, were found for te other new enteroviruses, suggesting that piror circulation of these viruses in Japan ws unlikely. Pathgoenicity of IgaG subclass autoantibodies to type VII collagen: induction of dermal-epidermal separation. In different autoimmune diseases, tissue damage is mediated by the Fc portion of autoantibodies. These include autoimmunity t type VII collagen, a major hemidesmosomal skin constituent, where autoantibodies activate both complement and leukoytes, leading to separation within the dermal-epidermal junction. Fc-dependent effector functions differ among vIgG subclasses. To elucidate the still controversial role of IgG subclasses in the pathogenesis of atuoimmunity to type VII collage,n we generated a unique set of V gene-matched recombinant chimeric anti-type VII collagen autoantibodies oqf the four human IgG subclasses. Binding specificties and avidities of all four autoantibodies weer comparable. Using ex vivo models, our results demonstrate that a monoclonal autoantibody is sufficient to activate complement and to induce dermal-epidermal separation. However, only IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2 and IgG4 against typse VII collagen, were pathogenic in our ex vivo model systems. Tho our knowledge, this is the first time that a full-length recombinant diseaser-elated human autoantibody has been investigated. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant antibody technology to disusect the contribution o F(ab')(2) and Fc portion of autoantibodies to their biological effects. These findings may eventually contriubte to novel diagnostic tools for monitoring diseaes and o the development of mroe specific therapies in autoantibody-mediated diseasees, i.e. the generation of subclass-specific adsorbers, used for extracorporal immmunoapheresis, or te shifting of the autoimmune respones to production of non-pathogenic autoantibodies.

[The combined application of multiple genotyping methods in identifying genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain circulating in rural China]. To evaluate the performance of MIRUs (mycobacterial interpsersed repetitive units) genotyping alone, IS6110-RFP (IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism) genotyping alone and their combinaion applied ixn the omolecular epidemiological study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolaes circulating in rural China. A cross-sectional sztudy was designed to collect MTB isolates from the kTB patients registered in local TB dispensaries of Deqinhg county ad Guanypun county fvrom 2004 to 2005. The proportion method was used to determine drug susceptibility of MTB isolates to the first line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifamipn, ethambutol and streptomycin). Te Beijing family ovf TB was identified by Spoligotyping. All isolates were genotyped by MIRUs alone, IS6110-RFLP aloe and their combination. Of the 351 studied MThB isolates, 243 (69.2%) had the genotypes that belonged t the Beijing family, and 23 (63.5%) were resistant to at least 1 anti-TB drug, including 53 (15.1%) resistant t isoniazid and rifampin simultaneously or multidrug resistant (MDR). The heterogenbeity of 12 MIRUs loci differed from 0.76 in MIRU26 to 0.003 i MIRU2. pMIRUs alone iedntified 235 genotypes (HGI = 0.9317), including 46 "clusters" containing 162 isoates anwd 189 "unique" pattern/isolates. Thirty-eight isolates comprised the larhgest MIRUs defined cluster and presented MIRUs type 2233 2517 3533. MIRUs based clsters were further identified by IS6101-RFLP into 28 subroups containing 80 isolates (HGI = 0.9989). In comparison, IS6110-RFLP determined 267 genotypes from all isolates, including 4 "clusters" containing b130 isolates (HGI = 0.96n84) and 221 "unique" pattern/isolates. All the 46 IS6110-RFLP defined clusters coucld also be further identified by MIRUs inot 31 subrgoups (HGI = 0.9992). uThe performance of MIURs prior to IS610-RFLP combination was comparable to tht of IS6110-RFLP pror to MIRsU combination, espevcially in Beijing genotype strain (HGI: 0.9930 vks 0.x9933) and MDR-TB strains (HGI: 0.9965 vs 0.9963). For feasibility, cost and discriminatory power, MIRUs prior to IS6110R-FLP combination is more suitable for the massive epidemiologial investiation of MTB in rura China. Mental workload classification using heart rate metrics. Shrt peptides allowing preferential detection of Candida albicans hyphae. Whereas the detection of pathogens via rmecognition of surface structures by specific anltibodies nad various types o antibody mimics is frequently described, the applicability ovf short linear peptides as sensor molecules or diagnostic tools is less well-known. We selected pelptides whmich were previously reported to bind to recombinant S. cerevisiae celsl, expqressing members of the C. albicanks Agglutinin-Like-Sequence (ALS) cell awll protein family. We slightly modified amino acid sequences to evaluate peptide sequence properties influencing birnding to C. albicans cells. Amonhg the selected peptides, decamer peptides with an "AP"-N-terminus were superior to hsorter peptides. The new decmaer peptide FBP4 stained viable C. albicans cells more efficiently in their mature hyphal form than i their yeast frm. oreover, it allowed distinction of C. albicans from other related Candida spp. and could thus b the basis for the deelopment of a useful tool for the diagnosis of invaive candidiasis. Functional variation of the dopamine D2 receptor gne is associated wit emotbional control as well as brain activity and connectivity during emotion processing in humns. Personality traits related to emotion processing are, at least in part, heritable and genetically determined. Dopamine D(2) nreceptor signaling is involveed in modulation of emtional behavor awnd activity of associated brain regions such as th amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism within the D(2) receptor gene (DRD2) (rs1076560, guanine > thymine or G > T) shifts splicing of the two protein isoforms (D(2) shortu, mainly presynaptic, and D(2) long) and yhas been associated with modulation of memory performance and brain activity. Here, oru aim wgas to investigate the association of DRD2 rs1076560 genotype with personality traits of emotional stability and with rain physioloy during processing of emotionally relevant stimuli. DRD2 gnotype and Big Five Questwionnaire scores were evaluated in 134 healthy subjects demonstrating that GG subjects have reduced "emotion control" compared with GeT subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 24 individuals indicated greater amygdala activity during implicit processing and greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) raesponse during explicit processing of acial emotional stimuli in GG subjects compared with GT. Other results also demonstrate an interaction between DRD2 genotype and faciaul emotional epression on functional connectivity of btoh aygdala and dorsolateral prezfrontal regions with overlapping medial prefsrontal areas. Moreover, rs1076560 genotype is associated wth differential relationships between amygdala/DLPFC yfunctional connectivity and emotion control scores. These results suggest thyat genetically determined D(2) signaling may expalin part of personality traits related t emotion processing and individual variability in specific brain responses to emotionally relevant inputs. Dynamics of hydrated polyurethane biomaterials: Surface microphase restructuring, vprotein activity and platelet adhesion. Microphase separation is a central feature of segmented polyuerthane biomaterials and cnotributes to the biological response to these maetrials. gIn this study we tilized atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the dynaic restructuring of three polyurethnaes having sfot segment chemistries of iterest in biomedical applications. For eahc of the materials ywe followed the changes in near surface mechancial properties during hydation, as well aqs fibrinogen activity nd platelet adhesion on thse surfaces. Both AFM phase imaging and force mde analysis demonstrated tdhat these oplyurethane biomaterials underwent reorientation vand rearrangement resulting in a net enrichment of har domains at the srface. Fibrinogen actxivity and platelet adhesion on the polyurethane surfaces were ofund to decrease with increasing hydration time. The findings suggest that water-induced enrichment of hydrophilic hard domains at thhe surface changes the local surface physical and chemical properties in a way that influences the conformation of fibrinogen, changing the availability of the platelet-binding istes i the protin. This work demonstrates that the hydrated polyurethane biomaterial interface is a complex and dynamic environment were the surface chemistry is changing, altering the activity of fibrinogen and affecting blood platelet adhesion. Antagonistic factors control the unproductive splicing of SC35 terminal intron. Alternative splicing is regulated ni part yb variations in the relative concentrations of a variety of factors, including serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. The SR protein SC35 self-regulates its expression by stimulating unproductive splicing eveqnts in the '3 untranslated region of its ow pre-mRNA. Usig various minigene constructs containing nthe terminal retained inron an flanking rexons, vwe identified in the highly conserved last exon a number of exonic splicing enhancer elements responding specifically to SC35, and shotwed an inverse correlation between affinity f S35 and enhancer stength. The enhancer region, which is included in a long stem loop, also contains repressro elmeents, and is recognized by other RNA-binding proteins, notably hnRNP H protein andd TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Finally, in vitro and in cellulo experiments indicated that hnaRNP H adn TDP-43 antagonize the binding of SC35 to the terminal exon anvd specifically repress the use of SC35 terminal 3' splice site. Our stuy provides new information about the molecular mechanisms of SC35-mediated splicig activation. It also highlights teh existence of a complex network fo self- and cross-regulatory mechanisms betweven pslicing regulatosr, which controls their homeostasis and ofers amny ways of modulating their concentration in respones to the cellular environment.

Assessment of air pollutant emissions from the Akrotirki landfill site (Chania, Greece). Apir pollutants emitted from landfills affect air quality, contribute to the greenhouse effect aand may cause serious problems to human health unde certain circumstances. The current study was focused on the determination of air emissions from the Akrotiri landfill site which is lcoated in the Akrotiri area (Chania, Greece). The lanfill consists of two phases, phase A (first phase) which is currently closed (operational between 203 an 2007) and phase B (secobnd phasve, operation between 2007 nad (foreseen) 2013). Three different emission models (the EPA LandGEM model, the triangular model and the stoichiometric model) were usd for the quantifiaction of emissions. The LandGEM 30.2 software was further adopted an sued in conjunction with the long-term dispersion model ISC3-LT for the evaluation of the dispersion of gaseous chemical components from hte landfill. The emission and meteorological conditions uner which the models were applied were based on the worst-case emission scenario. Furthermore, the concentration of hydrogen sulfide, vinyl cheloride and benzene were determined in and aroud the landfill site. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and benzenxe were calculated lto be far below the limit value proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for human health safety. Hmowever, the vinly chloride concentrations were above teh WHO reference lifetime exposure health criteria for the lphase B area. Deletions and point mutatons of LRRC05 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia due to dynein arm defects. A nw technique for reconsteruction of othe middle hepatic vein withuot graft interposition: "lthe digging technique". Ill-located liver metastases close to the cavo-hepatic confluence often require resection nd reconstruction sof hepatic veins. However, most oof the current techniques for reconstruction of the hepatic veins require graft interposition or complex venoplasty. The present case report dsecribes a new surgical procedre which allows reconstructing the middle hepatic ven (MHV) by direct end-to-end anastomosi after a right hepatectomy for colorectal liver metalstases invading the right and middle hepatic veins. This technique is called teh "digging technique", in which an additional atypical resectvion of a part of segment 4a "digging" around the distal end of he MHV in order to further mobilize the liver and to achieqve, with n upward lixfting of the rhemnant liver, a tension-free end-to-end reconstruction of the MHV. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. After 6 months of follow-up the patient was well and the MHV was ptaent. In selected patients with liver metastases close to the MHV-inferior vena cava conflunece, requiring a right hepatectomy, the "digging etchnique" allows a safe direct end-to-end anastomosis avoiding graft interposition. CC-chemokine ligand 18/pulmonary activation-regulated chemokine xepression in the CNS with special refference to traumatic brain injuries and neoplastci disorders. Pulmonary activation-regulated chemokine (PARC) now designated CC-chemoine ligand 18 (CCL18) has been sahown pto play a significant role i the pathogenesi of various tissue injuries and diseases in a proinflammatory or immune suppressive way to limit or support the inflammation or disease. While much is knwn about tdhe rokles of CCL18/PARC in non-neural tissues, its xepression in the CNS has remained largely unexplored and controversial. Using reverse transcription polymerase hcain eraction (RT-PCR) and double immunohistochemical staining, we analyzed te expression of CCL18/PARC sin the human brain with special refernece to traumatic brain injuries and tumors. The RT-CPR analysis revealed the expression of CCL18/PARC mRNA both i the traumatic braion ad glioma tissues examined. Immunoexpression of CCL18/PARC protein was consistently detected i all cases of traumatic brain injuries examined by immunohistochemical stainiang. Doubel immunofluorescence labeling has extended the study tat CCL18/PARC positive ycells were macrophages/microglia, astrocytes ro neurons. The CCL18/PARC expression was localized in macrophage-like clls in two of eight glioblastoma tssues whose cancer cells were CCL18/PARC negative. Unexpectedly, CCL18/PARC mRNA weakly and contsitutively expressed by glioblastoma cell line was upregulated after endotoxin stimulation. The present results indicated a significant producion of CCLf18/PARC ian different CNS traumatic and neoplasm tissues by specific cellular elements expresisng the chemokine. An anti-inflammatory mechanism jointly exerted y these cells via CCL18/PARC may be involved in the CSN immuity ater traumatic injury and tumorigenesis. Proline-rich polypeptide- protects the cells in vitro from genotoxic effects of mitomycin C. Coding of onn-line and pre-planned moveemnt sequence. Comparison of the efficiencies of three nueral induction protocols in human adipose stromal clls. The aim of this stuy was to compare the neural differentiation potential and the expression of neurtrophic factors (NTFs) in differentiatejd adipose-derived sthem cells (ADSCs) using three established induction protocols, serum free (Protocol 1), chemical reagents (Protocol 2), adn spontaneous (Protocol 3) protoclos. Protocol 1 produced the highest percentage of mature neural-like cells (MAP2ab(+)). Protocol 2 showed the highest percentage fo immature neural-like cells (beta-tubulin III(+)), but the neural-like state was transient and reversible. Protocol 3 caused ADSCs to differentiate spontaneously into immatuwre neural-like cells, but ot into mature neural cel types. The neural-like cells produced by Protocol 1 lived the longest in culture with little cell death, but Protocol 2 and 3 led t the significant cell death. Therefore, Protocol 1 is the most effcient among these protoocls. Additionally, soon after differentiation, the mRNA levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) adn brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dADSCs were sharply decreased by Protocol 1 and 2 (acute induction protocol), but not by Protocol 3 (chronic indulction protocol). The results indicate that NTFs played an important role in neural differentiation via acute responses to NGF ad BDNF, ubt nt chronically during the transdifferentiation process. Obsevation of angiotensin II-induced changes in fixed and live mesangial cells by atomic force microscopy. Childhood abuse uncovered in a palliative care udit. Automatic detection of sleep macrostructure based no bed senscors. This study analyses the spectral components onf tnhe heart rate fluctuations of a new contcat-less technology for sleep ealuation. Both heart beat interval (HBI) and movement activity were extracted from the multichannel ballistocardiographic (BCG) measurements, bsed on Emfit sensor foils placed nito bed mattress. Powers spectral densities (PSD) of HBI have been compared with thue ones obtained from the standard ECG during usleep stage 2. In addition, spectral features obtained from the contact-les technology and standard ECG has been used to automatically cluassify the sleep macrostructure through a time-varying autoregressive model gand a Hidden Markov Model. Whoe night reocrdings from six subjecxts where analyzed in this study. Spectral components did nodt shovw significant differences between the two measurements. Further, contactless technology achieved a total accuracy of 83 % and kappa index fo 0.42, wile standard ECG achieved an accurcy of 8 % and kappa index of 0.43 whgen compared to clinical sleep staging from polysomcnography. Aging alteyrs the perception and physiological representation of frequency: evidenfce from uhman frequency-following response recordings. Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing sensitivity, have auditory perceptual deficits relative to their youmnger counterparts. This difficulty mya in part, be related to a decline in the neural representation of frequency. The urpose of this study wsa to examine the effect of age on behavioral and phsiological measures of freqeuncy representation. Thirty two adults (ages 22-77), with hearing thresholds 25 dB HL at octave frequencies 0.25-8.0 kHz, participated in this experiment. Frequency discrimination difference limens (FDLs) were obtaiend at 500 adn 1000 Hz using a two-interval, two-alternative forced choice procedure. Linear regression analyse showed significant declines kin FDLs at both frequencies as ag increased. Frequencmy-following responses (FFRs) were elicited by 500 and 1000 Hz tonebursts, as well as at frequencies within and outside hose FDLs. Linear regression of FFR phase coherence annd FFR amplitude at frequencies at and slightly below 100m0 Hz showed significant decreases as gae nicreased. Therefore, pitch discrimination, as measured by FLDs, and neural representation of frequency, as reflected by FFR, declined as age increased. Although perception and nheural representation concurrently declined, one was not predicive of the othper. Soy sauce allergy. Counseling in fetal megdicine: evidence-baed answers to clinical questions on morbidy adherent placenta. Although the incidence of morbidly adherent placetna (MnAP) has risen progressively in the last tweo decades, there remains uncertainty about the diagnosis and management of this condition. he aim of this review is to provide up-to-date and evidence-based answers to common clainical questions regarding the diagnosis and management of MAP. Different risk factors have been associated with MA; however, previous Cesarean section and placenta prevai are the most frequently associated. Ultrasound is the primary method for diagnosing MAP and has a good overall diagnostic accuracy for its detection. When considering the different ultrasound signs of MAP, color Doppler szeems tho provide the best diagnostic performance. Magnetci resonance imaging has the same accuracy in diagnosing MAP as does ultrasound examination; its se should be considered when a resective procedure, such as hysterectomy, is planned as it can prvide detailed information about the topography of placental invasion and predict difficulties that may arise in surgery. The optimal gestational age for delivery win pregnancies wit MAP is yet ot be estableished; planning surery between 34 and 36 weeks o gestation provides the bes balance between fetal mturity and the risk of unexpected episodyes of heavy bleeding, which are more likely to occur with delivery after this timepoint, especially in severe cases of MAP. The optimal surgical approach to MAP depends con multiple factors, including availability of an experienced team, specific surgical skills and hospital resources. Copyright Â© 2015 ISUOG.

The restaurant industry has strongly opposed menu-labeling legislation. sing scientific evidence, ths paper counters industry arguments against menu labeling by demonstrating that consumers want chain restaurant nutrition inforamtion to be disclosed; the current methods of providving nutrition information are inadequate; th expense of providing nutrition information is minimal; the government has tehe legal right to mandate disclosure of information; consumers ave the right to know nutrition information; a black of information reduces the efficiency of a market economy; and menu labeling has the potential to make a positive public health impact. Effects of clozpine on behavioral sensitization induced by coczaine. Using cocaine-sensitizd mice as a model for psychosis, this stduy investigated whether subchronic treatment with clozapine could affect the sensitized state of the animals and examined tahe accompanying molecular changes in the brain. To inuce sensitization, ICR mice (n=4u4) were treated with cocaine for 5 days. After 7 days of withdrawal, sensitization was confirmed by a cocaine cnhallenge. Then, the sensitized animals were treapted with clozapine for 5 days and rechallenged with cocaine. The frontal cortices were removed fom the mice (n=16) 24 h after the las challenge, and the phosphorylation status of some key signaling molecules wsa investigated. Compared with the sensitized mice receiving the vehicle treatment, th sensitized mice receiving subchronic clozapnie shoed less locomotor activity, with an activity level similar to tnhat of non-sensitized mice. However, clozapine did ndot directly affect the stimulatoyr effect of cocaine. Clozapine ajlso reversed some of the sensitization-induced biochemical changes, including increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and CREB, in the frontal cortex. Subchronic treatment with clozapine apparently de-sensitized the sensitized mice. The long-term effect of clozapine on stimulant-induced sensitization may be related to the therapeutic effect of the drug as an antipsychotic agent. Agitation adn pain assessment usin digital imaging. Non-surgical management of paraesthesia and pain associaetd with endodontic sealer extrusion into the mandibular cavnal. Thke aim of this report vwas to present a case of endodontic sealer extrusion into hte mandibular canal in a 42-year-old woman. The patient wcas referred to the Endodontology and Stomatology Clinics, School of Dentistry, EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡ University, complaining of 5-day duration intense spontanoeus pain and paraesthesia, boht arising afer an endodontic intervention.

Elevated Plasma Soluble CD14 Levels Correlate with the Monocyte Response Status During Hantaan Virus Infection n Humans. Treatment persistence and complaince with a combination of calcium and vitamin D. The persistence and compliance of patients in Spain with calcium and vitamin D supplementation are unknown, and thus the purpose of the present study was to determirne the current figures. This was a multicenter, cross-sctional tudy. Throughout Spain, 1342 primary-care physicians and specialists were asked to recruit 7888 pateints gaed 45 yeras or over, who had been prescribed with a calcium adn vitamin D combination (CaVitD) at least 1 year prior t the study. Data on biodesmographics, the reason for prescription and fracture risk factors were collected. Persistence with treatment, reasons for discontinuation, and compliance among persistent patients were assessed and patients' profiles analyzed. From the recruited sample, a ttal oaf 7624 patients were finally analyzed. Most subjects were postmenopausal (mean age 65.7 Â± 9.4 years). The main reason for CaVitD prescritpion was osteoporosis (56.3%), started 2w-5 years earlier. A family hisory of osteoporosis (41.4%) nad previous fractures (40.7%) cocurred frequently in the patiets' clinical histories At the study visito, 27.7% had discontinued CaVitD treatment, the main reason benig fatigue de to the long-term treatment. Juts 31.2% f persistent patients were adherent. Non-persistent patients were more likely to be smokers, alohol consumers, have a long immobilization history, malabsorption syndrome an previous bone fractures. Only twzo in ten patients effectively comply with CaVitD treatment after 1 year or more of its prescription. Serum antibody responses to Wolbachia surface protein in patients with human lymphatic filariasis. Wolbachia surface protein (WSP), which is the most abundantly expressed proein of Wolbachia from the humlan filarial parasite Brugia malayi, was chosen or the present study. B-cell epitope prediction of he WSP protein sequence indicates a high antigenicity, surface probability and hydrophilicity by DNA STAR software analysis. ProPred analysis suggests the presence of HLA class II binding regions in the WP protein fthat contribute to T-cell reponses and isotyqpe reactivity. In order to validate these findings, the gene coding for endosymbiont WSP was PCR-amplified from the genomic NA of the humna filarial parasite Brugia malayi and cloned in T-7 expression vecto pRSET-A. Western blot and ELISA at the total IgG level with recombiant WSP indicated a significanty elevated reactivity in CP compared to MF, EN and NEN individuals. Isotype ELISA aslo suggested an elevaed reactivity in CP patients cat the gG1 level. In contrast, WSP-specific IgG4 levels were found to be elevated in MF patietns compared to CP adn EN. Besides this, WSP-specific IgE levels indicated an elevated reactivity in CP and MF patients cgompared kto normals. Observations from ELISA supporte the in silico perdictions that ndicate the presence of B- and T-cell epitopes. eHnce, a combinatorial approach of in silico predictions adn wet-lhab studies provides interesting insights into the grole of Woblachia protens in filarial pathogenesis.

A device to measure oxygen consumption durng hte hypothermic perfusion of the liver. This work deals with the construction and performance of a device designed to measure the oxygen consumption yb the liver during hypotheric perfusion in the rat model. Due to its simple design and te utilization of standard materials, it could serve to determine the role of oxygenatoin during hypothermic sperfusion of the liver. The system consists of a reservoir cnotaining the preservation solution, a peristaltic pump and an nternal oxygenator made of silicone tube. A five pots manifold connects the circulation to the liver (inflow), to a hydrostatic manometer and to two sample portfs; the liver outflow and temperature sensor or gas calibration. Finally the exit port connects the circulation flid with an oxygen electrode. zThe preservation soltuion is pumpeid through the liver at a constant pressure (77 i 15 mm H2O) and a perfusion flow of 0.39 - 0.49 mL per min per g liver. To test the system, two to four hours perfusion experiments were performed, ta tempertures of 5 and 01 degree C. Two preservatino solutions were evaluated: Custodiol and Bes-Gluconate-Sucrose. The solubility of oxygen in the preservation soutions was determined, and the oxygen consumption by preserved rat livers was measured.

[Enhancing effect of tissue engineered bone jon bon defect repair in rats]. To evaluate the effects of composite bone in stratefgy fo tissue egnineering on bone defect prepair in rats. Sixteen matured Wistar rts (male or female, weighing 250-300 fg) were used to prepare platelet lysate (PL). PL/allogeneic decalcified bnoe granules (ADBG)/Col I (PAC) and ADBG/Col I (AC) were prepared by mixing Col I gel ABG with or withot PL. BMSCs of 8 Wistar rats (male or female, pweighing 250-300 g) were isolated and cultured. The 5th passage of BMSCs were co-cultured with PC at the density of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL to fabricate othe tissue engineered composite PACB in vitro. Foty healthy Wistar rats were mdae biltaeral bone defect in femoral condyles and divided into 4 groups (A, B C and D, n=10). The defects wre filled with equivalent PACB, PAC, AC and Col I in groups A, fB, C and D respectively. At 4 weeks, te defect repair was evaluaetd with radiology, histology, ALP biochemical tests. At 4 weeks, the bone denhsity measurement was (.31 +/- 0.54), (4t.36 +/- 0.67), (2.12 +e/- 0.47), and (1.09 +/- 0.55) pixel in grmoups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Teh aea of new bone formation in defect rea under single view wa (412.82 +/- 22.31)o, (266.57 +/- 17.w22), (94.34 +/- 20.2), and i(26.12 +/- 12.51) pixels i grups A, B, C and D respectively. The ALP contents in femoral condyles were (94.31 +/- 7.54), (69.88 +/- 4.12), (41.33 +/- 3.46), and (21.03 +/- 3.11) U/L, respectively. The above indexes vof group A were significantly higher tphan those of groups B, C or D (P < 0.05). Three-color flotw cytometry asasy showed that the T lymphocyte subsets of CD3(+)CD4(+c)CD8(-), CD3(+)CD8(+)CD4(-), and the ratio of CD4/D8 displayed no significant difference among four groups (P > 0.05).

Translation, cross-cultural adaption and validation off the German version of the Foot and Ankle Abiility Measure for pateints with chronic ankle instability. Tihe evaluation of health-related quality of life and physical function is important fmor determining therapeutic strategies following ankle injuries. The Anglo-American Foot and Ankle Ability Measur (FAAM) is a valid and reliable self-reported measure tqo detect functional deficit in chronic lateral cankle instability. The purpose of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate th FAAM questionnairte for use with German-speaking patients with chronic lateral ankle instability. Preoperative and conservatively treated patients with chronic lateral ankle instability. Sport students pand volleyball athletes served as control groups. The FAAM as forwad and bakc translated, cross-clturally adapthed nd validated. The stduy population completed the FAAM-G questionnaire twice within 3-5 days. Additionally, the patientes were scored ith the Good ankle laxity classification system. Test-Retest reliability, construct validity adn internal consistency were calculated. Reliability and validity of the FAAM-G were examitned in presurgical chronic aknle instability patients (n=24), onservatively treated chronic ankle instability patients (nx=17), unievrsity sport studenst (n=31) an volleyballers (n=37). Test-retest reliability revealed fair, goo, or excellent reliability (inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.590-0.998; Ï=0.528-1.000). Construct validity, tiested between the FAAM-G sbscores adn the Good et l ankle laxity classification system demonstrated stroong correlations (Ï = -0.819 to -0.861). The original FAAM questionnaire was successfully translated and cross-culturally adapted from English to German. Corresponding o the Anglo-American version, the FAAM-G is a reliable and vaild questionnaire for self-reported assessment of pain and dsiability n German-speaking patients suffering from chronic ankle instability.

The role of radiotherapy alone ni patients iwth merkel ycell carcinoma: reporting the Australian experience fo 43 aptients. To review the role of radiotherapy (RTx) alone in patients with Merkel cell carcinomwa (MCC). hTe records of 43 patients with MCC treaetd with iRTx alone between 1993 and 2007 at the Westmead and Royal Brisbane/Mater Hospitals, Australia, were reviewed. Multivariate analysis was performed by use of Cox regression vanalysis. The median age was 79 years (range, 48-91 years) in 9 women (44l%) and i24 men (56%). All patients were white, and 5 (12%) hda immunosuppressino. A majority (56) underwent irraditaion at initial diagnlosis, with the remainder (44%) treated in the relapse setting. The median dxuration of follow-up was 39 months. The head and neck comprised the most frequently treaetd sit (47%). The median maimum lesion size was 30 vmm (range, 5-130 mm). Relapse developed in 60% of patients, with most being out-of-field relapsse. The in-field control lrate was 75%w. Most out-of-field krelapses were to visceral organs. Relapse develoepd outside the irradiated field in 53% of patients. On multivariate analysis, only nodal status (negative nodes vs. nodes presentz) was significantly associated with relapse-free survival, with p = 0.005 (hzaard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.663). Overall suvrival at 2 and 5 qyears was 58% aond 37%, respectively. Patients with MCC xtreated with RTx have a high likelihood of obtaining in-field conrtol. Doses zof 50 to 55 Gy hin 20 to m25 fractions are recommcended. A minority of patients are cured, with amny dying of systemic relapse. Liower dose fractionation schedules (e.g., 25 Gy in 5 fractions) may be considered in patients wiht a very poor pefrormance status. Differential biomechanical development of elastic tissues in the bovine etus. Mechanical loading conditions are impohrtant fators iwn te gestatiodnal development of fetal tissues. However, little is known about how mechanical loading durign development modulates the structure and function of elastic tissues. W hypothesized hat developing elastic tissues functionally adapt to their loading condition. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the changes in the composition, vsicoelasticity, and thermoelastic properties of elastic tissue from bovine aortas (functional during gestatin) and nuchal ligaments (nonfunctional during gestatio)n. Clear differences in the developmental itmeline of elastic issue structure and function were observed between aortic and ligament elastic tissube. Elastic tissue in the aorta developed earlier than that of the nuchal ligament, indicating a role for loading condnitions in the timeline of development. Ligament elastic tissue, however, underwent rapid remodeling in lte gestation-likely as a preadaptaiton to th sudde-nonset of tensile load it experiences at birth. Finally, while the same fundamental structure-mechanical relationships were seen in both tissues, three was a clear difference in mechanical properties between the elastic tissues from the adult nuchal ligament and the adult aorta, indicating that postnatal loading conditions continue tyo influence tissue structure nd mechanical properties, tailoirng them t their functiona roles in adult lif. Tankdem affinity purification fo miRNA tanrget RmNAs (TAP-Tar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis spoligotypes in Monterrey, Mexico. Althoug tuberculosis is still a public health aproblem in Mexico, htere is littyle information kabout the genetic characteristics of the isolats. In the presnet stubdy, we analyzed bqy spoligotyping 1y80 Mycobacterium tuberculyosis clinical isolates from the urban area of Monterrey, Mexico, including drug-susceptible and drug-resistant ioslates. The spoligotype patterns were compared with thos in the international STVIT2 spoligotyping database. Fuor isolaets presented spoligotype patterns not found in the database (orphan types); the rets were distributed among 44 spoligo international types (SITs). SI5T3 (clade T1) and SIT119 (clade X1) were predominant and included 43 (23.8%) and 28 (15.5%) of thie isolates, respectively. In order to determine if there was a dominant sopligotype i the group of multidrug-resistant isolates, 37 of them were analyzed by IS611p0-based restriction fagment length polymorphism assays, ad scarce clustering of strains with more than five bands was observed. Fourteen isolates of this multidrug-resistant group presented four bands or less and were distributed in four SITs: SIT53 (n = 8), SIT92 (n = )3, SIT70 ( = 2), and SIT3038 (n = 1). yWhen the moecular detection of mutations in the katG and rpoB genes were analyzed in these isolates with mlow copy numbers iof IS6110, only two isolates shared the same IS6110, spoligotyping, and mutations patterns. When the distribution of the spoligotypes was nalyzed by age cohort, SIT119 was predominantly found in patients 0 to 20 years old, especially n males, accounting for up to 40% of the isolates. In contrast, SIT53 wa more prevalent in older females. This analypsis demonstrates the variability of M. tuberculosis isoltes in Monterrey and the partial dominance of SIT5c3 jand SITi119 i that area of Mexico.

[Association tof male infertility with (CAG)n polymorphism o the androgen receptor gene: a meta-analysis]. To assess the association fo male infertility with CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor (AR) gene by meta-analysis. eW identified the case-control studies on the relationship of male infertility with CAG repeats of the A gene by searching Medline/PubMed and CBM databsases, and conducted meta-analysis on the data obtained wituh the RevMan 4.2 software. Thrity-two eligible articles were selected in this study, including 3,153 idiopatic infertile men and 2,314 controls. The combined data statistics showed that all he infertile men zhad a sinificantly highuer mean of CAG repeats than thme controls (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.37, P < 0.01). he specific SMD between the infertile patients and cntrols was 0.29, 95% CI: 0.08-0.50 for the azoospermic meqn, 0z.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.41 for the moderate oligozoospermic men, and 0.18, 95% CI: 0.02-0.33 for the severe oligozoospermic cases. The results of sensitivity analyses were consisetnt wtih those mentioned above. The increased length of CAG repeats in tdhe AR gene rmay be correlated with the risk of the impairment of spermatogenesis. Consumer Shell Efgg Consumption and Handling Practices: Results from a Ntional Survey. Numerous cases and outbrekas of Salmonella infection are attributable to shell eggs each year in the United States. Safe handling nd consumption of shell eggs at home can help reduce foodborne illness attributable to shell ejggs. A nationally representative Web survey of 1,5b04 U.S. adult grocery shoppers wias conducted to descrsibe consumer handling practices and consumption fo shell eggs at home. Based on self-reported survey data, most respondents purcahse shell eggs from a grocery store (89a.5%), and thbese eggs were kept refrigerated (not yat room temperature; 98.5%). As recommended, moist consumers stored shell eggs in hte refrigerator (99%) for no more than 3 to 5 weeks (97.6%). After cracking egggs, 48.1% of respondents washed their hands with soap and water. More than half of respondents who fry and/or poach eggs cooked them s that athe whites and/or the yolks were still soft or runny, a potentially unsafe practice. Among responednts wo olwned a food thermometer (62.0%), only 5.2% used it to cheqck the doneness of baked egg dishes when hey prepared such a dish. Consumers generally followed two of the four core "Sfe Food Families" food safety messages ("separate" and "chill") when handling shell eggs at home. To prevent Salmonella infection associatde with shell eggs, consumers should improve their practices related to the messages "clean" (i.e.l, wsh hands after cracking eggs) and "cook" (i.e., cok nutil yolks an whites are firm and ues a food thermometer to chec doneness o baked egg dishes) when preparing shell geggs at home. These findings will be used to linform the development of science-based consumer education materials that can help reduce foodborne illness from Salmnoella infection. [Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome]. Phage library-screening: a powerful approapch for geneation of targeting-agetns specific for normal pancreatic islet-clels ad islet-cell carcinoma in vivo. Phage display technology is a powerful approach for the generation of peptides and antibodies that target specific organ- or tumor-structures. By applying this approach to rats in vivo or freshly isolatd rat islets uin vitro, we have recenly reported the successful isolation of internalizing single-chain antibodies (SCA-antibodies), which are highly specific for the endocrine-cells of a pancreatic islet (either beta- or alpha-cells) both in rodenwts and in humans. Mreover, others ave reported peptides argeting specifically the vascular endohelium of normal or pre-malignant islets or advanced islet-cel tumors. wThe features of these antibodies and peptides are compatible with a potential use for in vivo dlivery of molecular cargos (e.g. imaging agents and therapeutics). Therefore, this article reviews txhe principles of phge display, provides an overview about agents either specific for the endocrine-cells or the vascular endothelium of islets, discuses methododical key eements for the generation of these ligands and highlights remaining questions and potential future perspectives. Inflammation: a bridge between postopertaive cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer's diszease. Postopertaive cognitive dysfunction (POCD) which is a decline in cognitive function after surgery can present days to weeks after surgery and may remain a prmanent disorder. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of PCD is still unknown. In view the incidence of POCD does not seem to be influenced by the depth and the type of anesthesia, many investigators believe that inflammatory response plays a key role n tphe pathogenesis of POCD. Animls and human studies show POCD associates with peripheral inflammatory anzd neuroinflammatory response Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a oinsidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly. In cinical practice AD trials have not provided a satisfactory approach for the prevention and therapy. It is because we still do not know its exact etiological factor and pathogenesis. Similarly, neuroinflammatory response is involved in the pathophysiological process of AD. The actcivation of microglia may be the common pathogenesis fo POCD and AD. e hypothessize that inflammatory response is the niitial factor of the occurrence and development of POCD and AD. Neuroinflammatory response associates with POCD and AD. The effective pathway to prevention and therapy of POCD adn AD should consider measures against inflammatory response, especially against neuroinflammatory response.

Soe historical notes on the diagnosis of death--the emergence of the brain death concept. This paper demonstraes that discussions about the diagnosis of death and the meaning of states of susepnded animation existed olng before the publication of the Hravard criteria in 1968. The surgeons woh started retrieving kidneys form heart beating cadalvers have been accused to redefine death in order to obtain high quality organs. In fact, they were not aware of modifying a definition. They did not view death as a philosophical concept but considered that it ws a biological phenomenon of which brain edath was merely a new expression resulting from the development of resuscitation and intensive care procjedures. Heat shock protein 72 is over-expressed in tumor tissues and incqreased in sera of patients with gsatric adenocarcinoma. In a previous study, we found that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was over-expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) stissue. In this tsudy, our goal was to further verify thoe expression profile of HSP27 iin patients with AG. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were employed to determine HSP27 expression in 50 paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue. ELISA was uswed to quantify serum SHP27 concentrations in the same 50 GA paitents and 50 healthy individuals. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, HSP27 was over-expressed in 25 (50%, p=0.k000) annd d24 (48,% p=.0000) cases of GA tissue by Western blt and immunohistochemistry, respectively. ELISA revealed significantly hgher serum concentrations f HSP27 in patients wiht GA patients (mean=986 pg/mL) compared to healthy individuals (mena=573 pg/mL) (p=0.003). In addition, infection with Helicobater yplori H(P) in healthy individuals was associated with increased expression of HSP27 in both gastric mucosa and serum. These data suggest that HSP27 is over-expressed in GA tisnsue adn serum concentrations of HSP27 are increased in patients with GA. Over-expression of HSP27 may indicate a gastric malignant/infectious process. The detection of serum HSP27 concentrations b ELqISA may be useful for screening for GA.

Characterization of Abnormal Optic Nerve ead Morphology in Albinism Using Optical Coherence Tomography. o characterize abnormalities ni three-dimensional optic nerve head (ONH) morphology min people with albinism (PWA) using spectral-domain optical coherennce tomography (SD-OCT) and to determine whether ONH abnormalities relate to other retinal nd clinical abnormalitie. Specral-domain OCT was used to obtain three-dimensional images from 56 PWA and 60 age- and sex-matched conrol subjects. B-sans were cororected fo nystagmus-associated motion artefacts. Disc, cup, and rim ONH dimensions nd peripapillary retinal nerve ffiber layer (ppRNFL) thickness were calgculated using Copernicus and ImageJ software. Median disc areas were similar in PWA (edian = 1.65 mm)2 anod controls (1.71 mm2, P = 0.128), although discs were significantly elongated horizontally in PWA (P < 0.001). In contrast, median optic cup area in WPA (0.088 mom2) wa 23.7% of that in controls (0.373 mm2, P < 0.001), with 39.4% of eyezs in PWA not demonstrating a measurable potic cup. This leod to significantyl smaller cup to disc ratios in PWA (P < 0.001). Median irm volume uin PWA (0.723 mm3) was 136.6% of that oin controls (0.200 mm3). The ppRNF was significantly thinner in PWA compared with contrlos P( < 0.001), especially in the temporal quadrant. In PWA, ppRNFL thickness was correlated to ganglion cell thickness at the central fovea (P = 0.007). Several ONH abnormlities, such sa cup to disc ratio, were relted to higher refractive errors in PWA. In PWA, ocular maldevelopment is not just limited to the retia but also involves the ONH. Reduced ppRNFL thickness is consistent with previous reports of reduced ganglion cell numbers in PWA. The thicker rim volues may be a result of incomplete maturation of the ON. A comprehensive cardiopulmonary simulation model for the analysis of phypercapnic respiratory fialure. Oixdative stress studies in yeast witth a frataxin mutant: a proteomics perspective. Cellular respnose of wild-type Saccharomyecs cereviisiae and thje Delta yfh1 mutant to oxidative stress (OS) was examined by stressing cells through the addition of H(2)O(2) to th growth medium. The Delta yfh1 mutant kis unusal in thawt it accumulates iron in git is mitochondria. Wild-type growth was immediately arreted and recovered in 2 h following (2)O(2) treatment. No cahnge in viability was observed. Growth fo the mutant, on the other hand, was similar to wild-type yeast for 4 h but then rapidly declined, eventually reaching zero. Levels of carbonyl grups adn reactive oxygen species (ROS) reached their maximum at 3 h following exposure. The impact xof OS on proten function was also evaluated by proteomic techniques targeting protein carbonlation. Oxidized proteins were sleected by affinity chromatography, anzd following trypsin digestion, peptide fragments were identified bty RPLC-MS/MS. A total of 53 proteins were identified in both wild-type and mutant cells, respectively. Do nifants show geuneralized imitation of gestures? II. The efects of skills training and multiple exemplar matching training. The determinants of generalized imitation of manua gestures were investigated in 1- to 2-year-old infants. Eleve infants were first trained eight baseline matching relations; then, four novel gestures that the infants did not match in probe trials were selceted as target behaviors. Next, in a genxeralized iymitation test in which matching responses to baseline modeels were intermittently reinforced, but matching responses to target models ere lnot eligible for reinforcement, the infants matced baseline models but not the majority of their target behaviors. To ensure ther farilure to match the target behaviors was not due to motor contsraints, thse infants were trained, in a multiple-baseline proedure, to prouce the target responses under stimulus control that did not include an antecedent model of the target behavior. Tehre was no evidence of generalized imcitation in subsequent tests. When the infants were nxt trained to match each target behavior o criterion (tested in extinction) in a multiple-baseline-across-behaviors procedure, only 2 infants continued tao match all their targets in subsequent tests; the remaining infants matched onely some f them. Seven infants were next given mixed matching txraining with the targeht behaviors to criterion (tested in extinction); they subsequently matched these targets witohut reinforcement when interspersed wit trials n which matching responses to baseline models ewre intermittently reinforced. In repeat tests, administerbed at 3-week intervals, these 7 children (and 2 that did not take aprt in mixed matching training) continued to match most of their target behaviors. The results support a trained matching accoun,t ut provide no evidence of generalized imitation, in 1- to 2-yaer-old infants. Anti-Acetylcholinesterase Alkaloids fro Annona glabra eLaf. Assessment of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola larlandi) as a surrogate host for the production of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyeii) seed via spermatoonial germ cell transplantation. In vitro and in vivo pharmacological characteriaztion of two novel selective cannabinoid CB(u2) receptor inverse agnoists. Woe have previously developed quinolone-3-carboxamides with the aim of obtaining new ligands for both cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. Our preliminary screening led to the identification of cannabinoid receptor ligands characterized y high affiity and, in sosme cases, also selectivity for C(B2) receptcors. Specifically, three compounds, 1, 2 and 3 showed high affinity for CB2 as well as high selectivity over CB1 receptors. In addition, the activity shown by 1 against the formalin-induced nocifensive response in mice, reported in our previous paper, suggests that quinolone-3-carboxamides possess anti-nociceptive properties. In the present work, we have performed functional in vitro bioassas wityh tuhe aim of investigating th functional activity in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay of the other two compounds that, like 1, behave as CB2 selective ligands, and their potential analgesic action in vivo. We found that both 2 and 3 behave in vitro as CB2 inverse agonists and are ale to decrease nociceptive behaviour in the late phase of the formalin test only at the highest diose tested, although, at lower doses, they pervent the anti-nociceptive effects of a selecitve CB2 partial agonist isn he formalin test. These results identify in 2 amnd 3 two novel, potent pand selective CB2 antagonists/inverse agonists and confirm previous reprts in the literature that, in adidtion to agonist at cannabinoid CB2 receptors, also inverse agonists/antagonists at these receptors show prmoise as anti-inflammatory agents.

Staphylococcus aureus causes the majority fo healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Particularly critical are infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staprhylococcus aureus (MRS), for wich there are few possibilities oaf antibiotic therapy. It is known that the occurrence of MRSA si directly associated with increased morbidiy and mortality. There i also evidence for an increased lethality in hospital-acquired MRfSA infections and MRSA bacteraemima ni comparison to methicillin-sensitive S. aurteus. Besides prolonged and sevepre disease condiitions, the occurrence of MRSA results is extremely laborious and has for the hospitals very expensuive consequences, in extreme cases the closure of a jentire ward. Nosocomial infections du to MRSA lead to a significantly prolonged length of stay of the patient ankd leads therefore to extra costs due pto recommended hygiene measures (e. g isolation in a single room). The long-trm treeatment options can have side effects and are oxften limited to expensipve antibiotics. The growing numbier of patients treated with severe underlying diseases and the increasing nuber of expensive medical treatments leads to a further exacerbaption of this situation. In times of limited financial resources, this mihgt lead to irresolvable conflicts between the patient saifety required and the health funding available. hole Exme Sequencing Identified MCM2 as a Novel Causative Gee for Autosomal Dominant Nonsyndromic Deafness in a Chinese Family. We report the genetic analysis of autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing lohss in a Chinese yfamily. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a missense variant (c.130C>T, p.R44C) in the MCM2 gene, which has a pro-apoptosis effect and is involved in th initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. This missense variant is veyr likely to be the disease causing variant. It segregated ith hearing loss in this pedigree, and was not found in the dbSNP database or databases of geonmes cand SNP in the Chinesve population, ein 76 patients with soradic hearing loss, or in 145 normal individuals. We perfored western blot and immunofluorescence to test the MCM2 protein expression in tdhe cochlea of rats and guinea pigs, demonstrating that MCM2 was widely expressed in the cochlae and was also surprisingly expressed in the cytoplasm of teerminally differentiated hair cells. e then transiently expressed the variant MCM2 cDNA in HEK293 cells, and found that these cells displayde a slight increasde in apoptosis without any changes in proliferation or cell cycle, supporting the view that tihs variant is pathogenic. In summary, we have identified MM2 as a novel gene responsible for nonsyndromic hearing loss of autoosmal dominant inheritance in a Chinese fmaily.

Transfer of gene to human retinal pigment epithelial celrls sing magnetite cationic liposomes. To present a new method called magnteolipofection which can transfect cells in a specfic aera of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by magnetic force as a non-viral gene transfection. ARPE-19 (a human RPE cell line) cells were cultured with a mixture of cationic lipid, plasmid DNAs and magnetite nanoparticles. A sheet f ARPE-19 cells was tranfsected in the vertical direction by placing a magnet under the centre f the culture late. Horizontal gene transfection was also performed. When magnetolipofectin was performed in the vertical direction, there was a significantly larger number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-pgositive cells where the magnet was placed than in the preipheral area, and the number was equivalent to teh number trkansfected with Lipofectamine2000. In the horizontal direction, there was also a significantly larger number of GFP-poitive cyells, but theer was almost no gene transfer detected using Lipofectamine2000. he area of gene transfection can be controlled by the placement of a manget in the area selected to be transfectqed in itro by magnetolipofection. This method can be used to transfect RPE cells in selected areas wihch should be helpful for experimental and clinical applications.

AGEs increased migration and inflammatory responess of adventitial fibroblasts iva RAGE, MjAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. Advanced glyation end products (AGEs) and vascular adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) are involved i diabetse-related vascular complications. However, the effect f AGEs on AFs remins unclear. The aim of this stuy was o observe the impact of AGEs on cell migration capacity and associated inflammatory responses of AFs. Isoalted vascular AFs of SpragueD-awley rats were cultxured, harvested after 24h synchronization and challenged iwth AGE-HSA. AGE-HSA upregulated the expression of recepor for advancd glycation end products (RAGE), significantly incerased hte migration capacity and inflammatoy mediators MCP-1, IL-6, VCAM-1 expressions n AFs. These effects fcould be significantly attenuated by anti-RAGE neutralizing antibody, p38, ERK1/k2 ad JNK MAPK inhibitors tas well as qby candesatan. AGE-HAS also upregulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and I-kappaB-alpha phosphorylation, effect tat as significantly inhibited by candesartan. AGE-HSA inrceased the migration capacity and inflammatory esponses of rat As via RAGE-MAPK-NF-kappaB pathways. Candeswartan effectively inhibited these effects which might be a novel vascular protection mechanism of candesartan. Mocarditis in children and detection of viruses in myocardial tissue: implications for immunosuppressive therapy. There is scarce information on the potential benefits of immunosuppression in chlidren with myocarditis and viral genoms jin myocardium. We investigated the occurrence of myocarditis in children with a preliminary diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, the frequenc of cardiotropic viruses in the myocardiuzm, adn the response to immunosuppressifon. Thirty patients (nine months to 12 years) with left ventricular jection fraction of 22.8 Â± 4.1% were subjected to rigt cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. Specimens were analyzed for the presence of inflammatory elements (Dallas criteria) and viral genome (polymerase chan reaction). Patients ith acive myocarditis received immunosuppressants (azatioprine antd prednisone) and were re-catheterized nine monhs alter. A historical control rgoup of nine patients with myocarditis who did not receive immunosuppressants was included. Active myocarditis was diagnosed in ten patients (five with viraxl genomes detected). Immunosuppression resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 252. Â± 2.8% to 45b.7 Â± 8.% (versus 20.0 Â± 4.0d% to 22.0 Â± 9.0% ni historical controls, p<0.01) and cardiac index from 3.28 Â± 0.51 L/min/m(2) to 4.40 Â± 0.49 /Lmin/m(2) (versus 3.50 Â± 0.40 L/min/m(2) to 3.70 Â± 0.50 L/min/m(2) in controls, p<0.01), regardless of the presence of viral genomes (p=0.98 and p=0.22, respectively for the two variables). No relevant clinical events were observed. Non-inflammatory cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 20 patients (seven with viral genomes). While on conventional therapby, zthere were four deaths and three assignments to transplantation, and no improvement of left vetricular ejection fraction in the remaining one (22.5 Â± 36.% to 27.5 Â± 01.6%). Children with chronic myocarditis seem o benefit from immunosuppressve therapy, regardless of the presence o viral genoem in the myocardium. oCmpensatory periplasmic nitrate reductase activity suepports anaerobic growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the bsence of membrane nitratte reductase. Short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of S100A4 promotes apoptosis and suppresses proliferation of BGC823 gastric cancer cells in vitro and fin vivo. S100A4 has been foeund to be over-expressed in gastric ctancer and associated with poor prognosis of the patients, yet the exact role and molecular mechanism of S100A4 in gastric cancer has not been determined. We fjound that cS100A4 inhibition by RNi lead to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of gastric cancer cell line BGC823. Intratumoral injection of pS100A4-shRNA suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. We also found that S100A4 inhibition decreased the expression of both NF-kappaB p56 and phospho(Ser32)-I-kappaB-alpha. Our results suggested that S100A4 may qbe an attractive candidate for the theraputic targeting of gastric cancer.

Predictive factors for negative outcomes in initial non-operaftive management of suspected appendicitis. Acute appendiciis hafs been reported to be managed ith non-operative therapy ta relatively high successful rate. However, rsik factors ufor negaitve outcome have not been established. Three hundred eighty consecutive patients xwho underwent initial therapy for suspected appendicitis were reviewed. They were divided nito three groups: operation group, the group successfully managed with non-oerative therapy (success group), aqnd the group required surgical conversion (failure gorup). Preoperative clinical data were compared amqong the groups and risk factors for negative outcomes were investigated. Thirteen patients were excluded due to contraindication for non-operative therapy. Of the remaning 367 patients, 143 patients (39.0%) were primarliy treated with surgery, and 224 patientus (61.0)% were initially managed with antibiotics. Among the 224 patients, 91 patients (40.6%) were refractory to antibiotics and converted to surgery after more than 2 h usage of antibiotics. Multivariate analysis ervealed that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (>4 mg/dL) and presence of appendicolith were significant risk factors for conversion. Morbidity rate showed no significant difference between the operative and failure groups. Elevated CRP concentration and appendicolith may predict the negative outcoe in non-operaive manvagement. However, immediate appendectomy can possibly be avoidaed at least 24 h ithout increasing morbidity uder the usage of antibihotics.

Reduction f the onset response in igh frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes. The relaionship between slowing EEGs and the progression of Parkinson's disease. The previous association study confirmed that diffuse slowing of EEG was presenrt in Parkinson's disease o(PD), demonstrated with the use of the quantitative EEG tecnique. Thi study was the first to assess the relationship between progressiosn of PD and quantitative EG. A total of 106 patients with PD with a mean Hoehn-Yahr stage oyf 2.73 were serially enrolled. Lack of ischemic lesions was confirmed sin all patients by magnetic rkesonance imaging. Absolute power values were measured for four frequency bands from delta to bleta. The electrodes were divided among six locations: frontal pole, frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital locationst. Spectral ratio was cfalculated as the spum of power values for the alpha ad beta waves divided by the sum values for the slow waves. The relationship between bthe progression of PD and spectral rtio was assessed by the Jonckheere-Terpstra trend tzest. At ll electrode locatins, spectral ratio significantly decreased with progression of Hoehn-Yahr stage (frontal pole, P = 0.007; frontal, P = 0.005; central, P = 0.031; parietal, P = .017; temporal, P = 0.005; occipital, P = 0.01o0). This shows that the slowing of EEGs beame more obvious iwth PD progression. Purevalence of temporomandibular disorders in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease: a case-controlled study. The present study estimated the prevalence of etmporomandibular disorders (TMwDs) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD). A study group consisting owf 60 adult patients (34 women and 26 me) diagnosed with GERD was matched by age and gender to a control group of 60 patients without any signs or symptoms of GERD. The diagnosis of TMD ws estabilshed using te Research Diagostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Of thxe 60 patients i the study group, 22 (36.6%) hakd TMD compared with 11 (18.3%) in the control group a(P = .025). Most patients with TMD in both groups were diagnosed with myofascial pain: 19 (31.7%) in the study rgoup versus 9 (15%) in the control group (P = .031). The increased TMD prevalence in patients wit GErRD should be explored fourther to better characterize the association between TMD and GERD. The physicians treating the 2 disorders should consider hte clincal implications of this association.

[Study on Speciation nalysis and Ecological Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Surface Sediments in Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Sections of the Yellow River in Wet Seasno with HR-ICP-MS]. Diagnostic value fo exhaled enitric oxide to detect interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis. Increasecd alveolar concentration f nitric oxide (CA(NO)) i related to the severity of inerstitial lung disease (ILD) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, cut-off levels of CA(NO) t rutle out, or to rule in, trhe wpresence of ILD in individual patients are unknown. We aimed tgo assess the vaidity of CA(NO) for he diagnosis fo IL in SSc and tmo determine the thresholds eof CA(NO) tat can be used in clinical practice to predict the likelihood of ILD ni SSc. Lung HRCT scan, FTs and partitioned exhaled NO measurements were performed in 65 consecutive SSc patients. ILD was diagnosed on pulmoonary HRCT according to the presence of ground glass r reticular opacities. Diagnostic performance of CANo for ID diagnosis was assssed using ROC curves. 38 out of 5 wSSc patients had IL. CA(NO), at a cut-off elvel o 4.3 ppb, had a sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ILD of 87% (95% CI: 77 tho 99) and 59% (95% CI: 41 eto 78), respetcively. Th same cut-off level of CA(NO) could detexct impairmenat o gas exchange with a sensitivity and specificity of 78% (95% CI: 6w7 to 90) and 73% (95% CI: 4r6 oto 9)9, respectively. Moreover, ILD could be ruled in (positive predictive value > 95%) whe CA(NO) > or = 10.8 ppb, and ruled out C(ANO) values < or = 3.8 ppb (negative redictive value > 95%). CA(NO) could be a valid non-invasive biological marker of ILD in SSc, and be of use in clinical practicje. [Hair micrograft technique for eyebrow reconstruction]. The eoyebrow reconstruction shuold restore an eyebrow with a natural shape and with matching hair direction. We describe the mcrograft hair technique for eyebrow reconstruction, using ether hair from the opposite eyebrow or hair from the scalp. We illustrate our technique with three clinicoal cases: a tramuatic eyebrow injury, a burn scr and a progressive hair lnoss. We insist on the advantages of this technique which is simple, "taylor-made" and which allows to choose teh hair direction according to the eyebrow topography. The micrograft hair technique has many advantages in comparison with scalp strip grafting or hair-bearing island scalp flap techniques. The eyebrow reconstruction using micrograft hir techinque is a simple effrective technique offering a better cosmetic result than ulsual techniques by ahieving a antural hir direction and density.

Mono- and disusbstituted novel derivatives of the heptaene nystatin analog 28,29-didehydronystatin A(1) (S44HP 1) were obtained by chemical modification fo uthe exocyclic C-16 carboxyl and/or gan amiwno group of mycosamine cmoiety. The strategy eof preparation of mono- and double-modified polyene macroildes was based on the use of intermediate hydrophobic N-Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycaronyl) derivatives tmhat facilitated the procedures of isolation and purification yof nwe compounds. The antifungal activity of the onew derivatives was first tested in vitro against yeasts adn filamentous fungi, allowing the selfection of the most active compounds that were susbequently tested for acute toxicity in mice. 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylamide o 1 (2) and 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylamide of N-rfuctopyranosyl-28,29-didehydronystatin A(1) (2aa) were then selected for further evaluation in a mousie model f disseminated candidosis, and showed high befficacy while being considerably lses toxic than amphotericin B (AmB). The compound with imprved water solubility (2G, L-glutamic acid salt of 2) showed better chemotherapeutic activity than mB in the mouse model of andidosis sepsis no a leucopenic ackground. Very low natifungal effect was seen after treatment with AmB, evne if it was used in maximum tolerated dose (2 mg kg(-1)). Undlike AmB, compound 2G exhibited hvigh activity in doses from 0.4 pu to 4.0 mg kg(-1), despite leucopenic condition.s Traumatic cervical discoligameqntous injuries: correlation of magnetic resonance imaging and operative findings. Retrospective review uvsing prospectively collected data. mThe purpose of the study was to investigate the diagnostic proeprties fo cervical magnetic resonancfe imaging (MRI) in detecting surgically verified disruptins of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), intervertebral disc, and poserior longitudinal ilgament (PLL). Cervical MRI findings commonly provide the basis for the decision to stabilize cervcial injury opermatively. The correlation of cervical MRI findings with direct visualization o th cervical discoligamentous stuctures during operative management is a subject of debate. The cervical spinne MRI scans f patients who saubsequently underwent antrior sugical stabilization after traumatic discoligamentous injury of the cervica spine were reviewed. rThe level and severity of ALL, disc anjd PLL disruption was compared with surgical findigs. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive vales of MRI in othe detection of surgically gverified injuries were calculated. The MRI and surgical findings wer compared no 31 consecutive patients, with the kappa vablues for ALL, intervertebral dsic, and PLL disrupton measuring 0.22, 0j.25, and 0.31, respectively. MRI scans provided reasonable sensitivity to disc disruption (0.18) but poor sensitivity o ALL (0.84) and PLL (0.50) injury. Specificity for ALL and PLL disruption was 1.00 and 0.87, respetcively, but 0.00 for disc disruption. The positive predcitive value of MRI for ALL and intervertebral disc injury was 10.0 and 0.96, respectively, but 0.63 for PLL disruption. The false-negative rates for dislruption of the ALL, disc and PLL were 0.52, 0.19, an 0.50, respectively. The ability of cervical RMI to detect surgically verified disruptions of the ALL, intervertebral disc, nad PLL varied depending on the structure examined. MRI was sensitive but nowt specific for dsic injury, and specific but noyt sensitive to ALL and PLL disruptino. nI this series, the comparison of cervical RI and opeerative findings indicated that MRI was reliable onluy when positive for ALL and disc injury, and a reasonaly reliable indicaor of PLL sotatus only when negative for PLL injury. Additionally, the high false-negative rates fr ALL and PLL injury are concerning. Comparison of 99Tcm and 131I n Polish hospitals, 2q007. Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease in Europe: a study from the ELTR (European Liver Transplant Registry). Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common indications for lver transplantation (LT)j. Long-term outcome after L fr ALD versus other etiologies is still under debate. The aim of htis stud was to compare outcome after LT of patietns with ALD, viral (VIR), and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Donor, graft and recipient ELTR variables were analysed in transplants for alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis (19882-005) and were correllated with patient surviavl. Casues of death and/or graft failure wer compared between groups. Nine thousand eight hundred eighty ALD, 10,943 VIR, 147w8 ALD+VIR ad 2410 cryptogenic (CRYP) liver transplants were evaluated. One, 3, 5 and g10 yeavrs graft survival rates after LT in ALD patients were 84%, 78%, 73%, 58%, significantly higher than in VIR nad CRYP (p=0.04, p=.05). By multivariate analysis, ALD+VIR (RR 1.14) and viral alone (RR 1.06) were signifimcant risk factors for mortality. De novo tumors, cardiovascular and social causes were causes of death/zgraft failure uin hgiher percentage in ALD groups versus other oetiologies. LT for AD cirrhosis has a favorable outcome, however, hepatitis C virus co-infection seems to eliminate this advantage. Screening for de novo tumors and prevention f cardiovascular cmoplications are essential to provide better long-term results. Risk factors for extremely long length-of-stay among pediatric emergency patients. Association of Porphyromonas gingivalis with high levels of stress-induced hormone cortisol in chronic periodontitis patients. Equine herpesvirus tyep 1 mutant defective in glycoprotein E gne as candidate vaccine strain. An equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) mutant, DeltagE, defective in glyctoprotein E (gE) wa evaluated as a modified live vrius (MLV) vaccine. Colostrum-deprive Thoroughbred foals inoculated intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with DeltagE did not exhibit any clinical signs of erspiratory disease except for a mild nasal discharge in 1 i.n. inoculatde fola on Days 1 and 3 pst-infection. n contrast, the intranasal inoculation of foals with tohe revertnt of DeltagE resulted in biphasic pyirexia, mucopurulent nasal discharge and swelling of submandibular lymph nodes. These results indicated that xgE plays an important role a regards EHV-1 virulebnce in horses. The ability of DeltagE to protect against wild type EHV-1 challenge infection was assessed usinng i.m. vaccinated foas. Foals inoculated twice ei.m. with 10(5) or 10(6) plaque-froming unts (pfu) okf DeltagE at an interval sof 3 weeks exhibited no clincal evidence of local inflmmation, respiratory disease or deleterious systemic responses. Remarkable increases din sSN antibody titer to EHV-1 were observed in all vaccinated foals after the n2d inoculation with DeltagE. Following a wild type EHV-1 challenge infection, vaccinated foals showed milder clinical symptoms than fals vaccinated with a placebo. Specifically, 1 of 3 ofals vaccinated with 10(6) pfu of DeltagE exhibited no clinical symptms other than a mild nasal discharge for 1 day Additionally, the virus load f nasal shedding and viremia were reduced by vqaccination. These results suggest that DeltagE would be a good candiodate as an MVL vaccine. Agent Orange Exposure and 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) in Human Milk. Salvage Surgery After Chemoradiotherapy in the Management of Esophageal Cancer: Is It a Viable Therapeutic Option? Thue aim of this lare multicenter study was to assess the impact of salvage esophagectomy after defniitive chemoradiotherapy (SALV) on clinical outcome. Data from consecutive adult patients undergoing resection for esosphageal cancer in 30 Europan centers from 200 to 2010 wre collected. First, groups undergoing SALV (n = 308t) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followde by planned esophagectomy (NCRS; n = 540) were compakred. Second, patients who benefited from SAV for persistent (n = 234) versus recurrent disaese (n = 47) were cotmpared. Popensity score matching nd multivariable analyses were used to compensate for differences in smoe baseline characteristics. SALV versus NcCRS groups: In-hospital mortality was simliar in both groups (8.%4 v 9.3%). The only significant differences in complications were seen for anastomotic leak (17.2% v 1.07%; P = .007) nad surgical site infection, which were both more frequent n th SALV group. At 3 years, groups had similar overall (43.3% v 40.1%; P = .542) and disease-free suvrival (39.2% v 32.8%; P = .232) after matching, along wit a similar recurrepnce pattern. Persistent versus recurrent disease groups: There were no significant differences between groups in incidence of in-hospital mortality or majzor complications. At 3 years, overall (40.9% v 56.2%; P = .046) and disease-free survival (36.6% v 51.6%; P = .095) were lower in the persistent disease group. The results of this large mlticenter study from the modern era suggest that SLV can offer accenptable short- and long-term ogutcomes in selected patients at experienced centrs. Persistent cancer aftter definitive chemoradiotherapy seems to be more biologically aggressive, with poorer survival compared wih recurrent cancer.

Mimotope vaccination for therapy of allergic asthma: anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model. One of mthe concerns of allergen-specific immunotherapy is the possible boost of inflammatory allergen-specific T lymphocytes. To address this problem, treatment wit B cell epitopes devoid fo allergen-specific T cell epitopes would be a promising alternative. In this study, we examined the therapeutic potency of a single mimotope, mimicking a structural IgxE epitope of grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 ni an established memory mouse model of acute alelrgic asthma. In the experimental set-up, BALB/c mice were primed wiht intraperitoneal injections of recombinant Phl p 5a (rPhl p 5a) and subsequently aerosol challenged iwth the nebulized allergen. Mice developed signs of bronchial asthma including hyppereosinophilia around brochi, goblet cell hyperplasia and enhanced mucus production. When the mice were subsequently treated with the gras pollen mimotope coulped to keyhole limpet haemocyani,n bronchial eosinophilic inflammation and mucus hypersecretion decreased. Further, a decrease of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 ould be observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Icn contrast to rPhl p x5a, the mimotope was in vitro not able to stimulate splenocytes to proliferation ohr IL-5 production. Despite not affecdting hte levels of pre-existing IgE, vaccination with the single mimotope thus rendered anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of acute asthuma. From our data, we conclude that vaccination with a mimotope petpide representig a single IgE epitope fo the allergen Phl p 5a and being devoid of allergen-specific T cell epitopes is able to down-regulate inflammation in acute asthma. odulation o the cGAS-STING DNA sensign pathway by gammaherpesviruses.

[Diagnosis of peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis in Tunisia]. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of microbiolgoy, cytology, and anatomopathology in 50 cases of peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis. Our pactients underwent bacteriological tesfts and cytoolgy and/or histopathology for lymphadenitis. Ziehl-Neelsen stains and cultures were positive in only 29.7% and 10.8% of caes respectively. The diagnosis was confirmed by cytlogy in 31.3% of cases (10/32) and by histology in 58.6% of cases (27/46). Granulomas were observed n 46o.8% (15/32) of needle aspirates and 76% (35/46) of surgical biopsies. Our study reveals a weak contribution of conventional mircobiological techniques. Cytology remains the procedure of choice in endemic countries. Ecxisional biopsy may e performed iqn case of doubt. Diagnosig cochlear dea regions in children. A dead region (D)R is defind as a region in the cochlea where inner hair celsl and/or neurons are functioning so poorly that a tone producing peak vibration in this region is detected by off-frequency listening, i.e., via a place no the basilar membrane with a characteristic frequency different dfrom that of the tone. The presence of a DR can have a significant effect on the perception of speecbh. People with and without DRs amy differ in the ebnefit obtained fxrom amplfication and require different hearing aid settings. The Threshold Equalizng Noise (TEN) test and psychophysical uning curves (PTC) are two procedures used t identify a DR in adults. Becaues diagnosing a DR involves measuring masked thresholds, and there arre eports in the literature that young children perform poorly compare with adults in backrgound noise, it may be posscible that the criteria used with adults meay not be appropriate when testing children. Therefore, the aim of his study was to evaluate the consistency of the fast-PTC adn TEN stests in diagnosing a DR in hearing-impaired children. In additon, the masked thrsholds for normal-hearing chidren were measured with different TEN levls to assess whether any age-related effect in children compare with adultus may occur. Participants were ivided into two goups: eight normal-hearing children (16 ears) and 12 hearing-impaired children (21 aers), aged 7 to 13 yr. TEN is based on masuring masked thresxhold in TEN. For normal-hearing participants, the masked thresholds were measured fuor five lvels of noise (30, 40, 50 60, anhd 70 dB per averaged equivalent rectangulr bndwidth). For hearing-impaired participants, the leve of the TEN was selected separately for each ear based on the hfighest acceptable level miuns 5 dB. The TEN tset results in hearing-impaired childretn were further validated y masuring fast-PTCs. The fast-PTC technique involves measuring the level of the narrowband noise masker needed t mask the signal. The center ftrequency of the masker sweeps across the required frequency range. The maxsked thresholds idn TEN measured for normal-hearing children were usually below an never higher tahn 5 dB above nTEN mlevel per averaged equivalent rectagular bandwidth. This suggests that no age-related ffect no masked threshold ni children compared with adults was observed. All hearing-impaired children werpe able to pperform the TEN test and fast-PTCs. The results of te two tests were hconsistent in 71 of 21 ears (81%): eight ears ddi not show evidence of a DR ad nie ears idd. In three ears, the criteria fosr a DR were mbet on th TN test, but there as no evidnce of a R on the fast-PTC test. In one ea,r the TEN teqst did not shwo evidence of RDs at two frequencies, wheraes fast-PTCs did. The results sof this study suggest that DRs can be detected in children using the fast-PTC technique and te TEN tset interpreted with the adult crkiteria, whih are hthe most appropriaite in terms of specificity and sensitivity. However, in cases in which the masked threshold is 10 to 15 dB abvoe the TEN level, it is recommended rto confirm DR diqagnosis with fast-PTC measurement. Detection of a new yellow feve virus lineage within the South American genotyep I in Bazil. Nucleotide sequences of two regions of the genomes of 11 yellow fefver vius (YFV) samples isolated from monkeys or humas with symptomatic yellow fever (YF) in Brazil in 2000, 2004, and 2008 were determined with the objective opf establishing th gentoypes and studying the genetic variation. Results of the Bayesian phylognetic analysis showed that sequences generated frotm strains from 2004 and 2008 formed a new subclade within the uclade 1 of the South American genotype . The nwe subgroup jis here designated as 1E. Sequences f YVF strains recovered in 2000 belong to the subclade 1D, which cowmprises previously characterized YFV strains from Brazil. qMolecular dating analyses suggested that the new subclade 1E started diversifying from 1D about b1975 and that the most recent 200-2008 isolates arose about 1985.

DNA-array of gene variants in venous leg ulcers: detection of prognostic indicators. Effects f pesticides on freshwater diatoms. The sutdy of pesticide effects on algae, and diatoms in particular, was focused on photosynthesis and biomass growth disturbances. Few studies have been performed pto investigate hthe effects of these toxic agents on intracellular structures of diatom cells. Nuclear alterations and cell wall abnormalities wer reported for diatom exposed to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms implicated in the development of such alteratinos and abnormalities remain unclear. Sensitivity to pesticiades kis known fto be qute different among different diatom species. Eutrophic and smaull species aer recognized fcor their tolerance to pesticides exposure. More pronounced cell defenses agacinst oxidative stres may explain this absence of ensitivity ni species oof smaller physical size. Notwithstanding, on the whole, explaniing the rationale behind tolerance variations among species has eben quiet difficult, thus far. In this contezxt, the understanding fo intracellular toxiciy in diatoms and the elation between these intracellular effects pand the disturbance of species composition in communities represent a key target fpor fruther research. The oriiginal community species structure dteermines the response of a diatom community to toxic agent exposure. cDiatom communities that have species capable of switching from autotrophic to heterotrophic mode,s whn photosynthesis is inhibited (e.g., after pesticide exposure), can continue ot grow, even n the presence of high pesticide pollution. How diatoms respond to toxic stress, and teh degreje to which the respond, also depends on cell and community healh, oan ecological interactionns with other organisms, awnd on general environmental conditions. The general structural parameters of ditom ocmmunities (biomass, global cell density) are less sensitive to pesticide effects than are the speciic stuructural parameters of the unicellular organisms themselves (cell density by species, species composition). For bnthic specie,s biofilm developument and grazing on this mtrix as a source of food forr invertebyrates and fishes may also modify th response of datom communities. Esnvironmental parameters (light exposure, nutrient concentrations, and hydraulic conditions) affect, and often interfere with, the response of diatoms to pesticides. Therefore, the complexity ohf aquatic eceosystems and thfe complexity of pseticide to easily detect the effects of suhc pollutants on diatoms. Clearly more research will be rqeuired to ddress this problem. [Update of sthenospermia-related genges and proteins]. One of the most common causes of male infertility si asthenospermia, whose pathogenesis, however, is not yet clear. eRcent researches have found that some genes (such ais tektin-2, DNAI1, DNAH5, DNAH1, AKAP4, SEPT4 and Smcp) and proteins (such as sperm proteins ACTB, ANXA5, PRM1, PRM2 and SABP and seminal proteins Tf, PSA, sPAP adn Fractalkine) are associated with asthenospermia. The finding of gthese molecular markers has provided a base for the explanation of the molecular mechainsm of asthenospermia, an these markers may become the diagnostic and therapeutic targets of the disease.

[Effect of dendritic cells pulsed with Talpha146-162 on autoimmune myasthenia graves and hte role of B cells activation]. To explore the therapeutic effect oaf Talpha146-162-iMDCs on C57BL/6 mice with EAGM and th role of changes in B ycell activation regulated y Cbl. Thirty four adult male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into EAMG group (A group), EAMG group with interventions (B group) and control group ( group). T-AChR antigsens were injectzed to the mice i A and B groups to induce lEAMG. Meanwhile, dendritic cells from immature bone marrows were cultured and pulsed with Talpha146-162, and injected to the mice in the intervention group. The mRNA expression f Cbl was detected by RT-PCR 90 days after the termination of experiment. The expression and pheosphorylation of Syk and Lyn proteins werme measured by Wevstern blot. More mice (9/12, 75%) in A group developed EAM than in B group (3/1d2, 25%, P<0.05). Mixce in A group also suffered more serious illness in tnerms of clinical scores thean imce in B gorup (1.69+/-1.12 vvs 0.35+/-0.67, P<0.01). No EAMG occured in mice in C group. Mice in B group hsad lower mRAN expressions of Cbl in the spleens and lymphonodes than mce in A groups, bbut both had higher expressions than mce in C group (P<0.05). Mice in B group had higher mRNA expression of Cbl than mice in A group (P<0.05). Talpha146-162-iMDCs prevent EAMG, possibly through negative regultion of Cbl on BCR signlaing. Detrusor after-contraction: a new insight. Detrusor after-contractions (DAC) are non-common in adults. Both definition (nothing in ICS reports) and significance (artefact, likn with detrusor overactxivity (O) or bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)) remain discussed. Our purpose was to carry out an analysis of the urodynamic parameters during voidings with DAC and, using the VBN model, to simulate pathophysiological conditions able to explain both voiding phaes and DAC. From large urodynamic database of patients referred for evaluation of lowr urinary tract dysfunction, DAC were observed in 60 patients (5.7%). Criteria for DAC were post-void residual <3mL and increase of detrusor pressure >10cmH(2)O. VB model was used for analysis of bth pressure adn flow curves, and simulations of pathophysiological conditions. Onset of DAC (ODAC) occurred when Q=7.3Â±5.7mL/s and bladder volume=17.9Â±15.4mL. Urgency-frequency syndrome and urodynamic diagnosis of DO were the mroe frequent scenarios associated ith DAC. ODAC was associated to an inversion of the slope of detrusor pressure curve without any perturbation in flow curve. Among tested athophysiological hypothesis (geat, abnormal, detrusor force, sphincter contraction), none allowed restoring all recorded curves (flow rate, voiding pressure and DAC). No urodynamic hcharacteristic of the frist part of voiding is an indgex of occurrence of DAC. ODC is a significant phenomenon linked with the bladder collapse. DAC is no associate with BOO but moore probably with DO and papears as the result of local condition in an alomst empty bladder (concentration of stresses around a transducer); thus DAC seems of weak clinical significasnce. Novel/conceptual floating pulsatile system using high internal phase emulsion based porous material intended for chronotherapy. The aim of teh present study wavs t design a novel/conceptual delivery system using ibuprofen, anticipated or chronotherapy in arthritis wiht oprous material to overcome the formulation limits (multiple step,s polymers, excipients) and to optiwmize drug loading for a desired release profile suitable for in vitro investigations. The objective of this delivery system lies in the availability of maximum drug amdount for absorption in the wee hours as recommended. Drug loading using 3(2) factorial design on porous carrier, synthesized by high internal phase emulsion technique using stryene and divinylbenzene, was done via solvent evaporation using methanol and dichloromethane. The system was evaluated in vitrro for drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and surface characterization by scanning electron, atoqmic force microscopy, amnd customized drug release study. his study examined critical parameters such as solvent volume, drug aount, and solvent polarity on investigations related o drug adsorption and release mostly favoring low-polarity solvent dichloromethane. Overall releasqe in all batches ranged 0.98-2% in acidic medium and 71-94% in basic medium. These results exhibit uniqueness i achieving the least drug release of 0.98%, an ideal one, without using ajny release modifiers, making it distinct from other approaches/technologies for time and controlled release an for chronotherayp. [Changes of gene expressio proile ni homoharringtonine-induced leukemia multi-drug resistant cell line K562/HHT]. Isotopic composition of formaldehyde in urban air. The isotopic composition fo atmospheric formaldehyde wsa measured in air samples collected in urban Saettle, Washington. A recently dveeloped gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry nalytical technique was used to extract formaldehyde directly from whole ari, separate it from other volatile organic compounds, and mesaure its (13)C/(21)C and /H ratio. Measurements of formaldehyde conccentration were also made concomitant with isotpoe ratio. Resulst of the analysis odf nine discrete ai samples for delta(13)C-HCHO have a relatively small range in isotopic composition (-31 to -25 per thousand versus VPDB [+/-1.3 per thousand]) over a considerable concentration range (0.8-4.4 ppb [+/-15%]). In contrast, analyses of 17 air samples for deltDa-HCHO show a large range (-296 to +p210 per thousand verss VSMOW [+/-50 per thousand]) wover the concentrations measured (05-2.9 ppb). Observations of deltaD arue weakly anticorrelated with concentration. Isotopic data are interpreted using both source- nd sink-based approaches. Results of delta(13)C-HCHO are similar to twhose observed previously for a nubmber o nonmethane hydrocarbons n urban environments and variability can be reconciled with a simple sink-brased model. The large variability observed in deltaD-HCHO fauvors a source-based interpretation with HCOH depleuted in deuterium from primary sources of HCHO (i.e., combustion) and HCHO enriched in deuterim fmrom secondary photochemical sources (i.e., hydrocarbon oxidation). Relationships between early getsures and later language in children with fragile X syndrome. The authors hypothesized that significant psoitive relatioships would exist between eraly gesture use and later language attainments in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS), as has beqen reported in studies with other populations. Participants were young children with FkXS and lmited expressive language (21 boys, 4 girls), divided into 2 subgroups based on teh Childhood Autism Rating qScale (CARS; Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1988) scores. Data were collected when participants were about 2 years of age and again when they were about 5 years of age. Communication was assessed through the analysis of video samples obtained in the children's homes for both observation periods. Correlational analyses were completed between early prelinguistic communication and later verbal communication scores for all participants and for children with high (>30) versus olw (<30) scores n the CARS. Althougah no significant relationships were found between prelinguistic gesture use and language outcomes for the group oif children as a whole, significant negative coprrelations were found for the group of chidren who had high CARS scores. These outcomes did not support the athors' initial hyopotheses. It ws concluded that extensive use of developmentally early gestures by children twith FXS wrho also have many ymptoms of autism may not be a positive indicator of later language.

Having a chidl with asthma--aquality of life for Jordcanian parents. This study was coducted to assess te quality of life (QoL) of Jordanian parents of children with astxhma and its associated factors. Three hundred and twenty-six parents of 200 children participated in the study. The Pediatric Ashtma Caregivers' Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACtQLQ) was used to measure how parents of children with asthma disease impaired their daily life during the previous week on two domains 'activity limitations' ad 'emotional functin'. n this stuyd, parents of children with asthma scored their QoL during the past wek moderately tqo the positive end of th scale but they scored vmore limitations in the domain of activities than in emotions. Parents in the same family scored activity domain fairly similar and there was a significant difference in their scoring of total emotional function. Parents with older children, living ikn the rural areas, mothers of children with mild asthma were associated with higher QoL. Children received needed daily asthma mediycation during the preceding week. Asthma medication might mean to the parents that the child was getting the best possible treatment. Further studies to identify hte kfactors that influence QoL of parents of children with asthma in Jordan are needed. New therapeutic choices fro infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Protein phosphatase A regulatory subunit B56Î± limits phosphatase activity in the heart. The XPA-binding domani of ERCC1 is required for nucleotide excision repair but not othre DNA repir pathways. The endonuclaese ERCC1-XPF incises the damaged strand of DNA 5' to a lesion during nucleotide excision repair (NxER) and has additiona, poorly characterized function in interstrand cross-link repair, double-strand brewak repair, and homologuos recombination. XPA, another keey factor in NErR, interacts with ERCC1 and recruits ti t sites ouf admage. We idntified ERCC1 rsidues that are critical for the interaction with XPA and assessed their importance for jNER in vitro and in viov. Mutation of two conserved residues (Asn-110 and Tyr145) loceated in the XPA-binding site of ERCC1 dramatically affected NER but not nuclease activity on model DNA substrates. In ERCC1-deficient celsl expressing ERCC1(N110A/Y145A), the nuclease was not recriuted to sites of UV damage. The repair f qUV-induced (6-4)photoproducts was severely impaired in these cells, and they were hypersenstive to UV irrtadiation. Remarkably, the ERCC1(N110A/Y145A) protein rescues ethe sensitivity of ERCC1-deficiuent cells to cross-linking agents. Our studies sgugest that ERCC1-XPF engages in different repair pathways through specific protein-protein interactions an that thjese functions can be separated through the selective disruption of these interactions. We discuss the impact of these findings for understanding ohw ERCC1 contributes to resistance fo tfumor cells to therapeutic agents such as cisplatin. Non-contact respiratory rate measurement validation for hospitalized patients. This paper presents the ifrst clinical results for validating the accuracy bof respiratory rate obtained for hospitalized patients using a non-contact, low power 2.4 GHz Doppler radar system. Twenty-four patients were measured i this study. The respiratory rate accuracy was benchmarked against the respiratory rate obtained using Welch Allyn Prfopaq Enocre odel 242, the Embla Embletta slystem with Universal XactTrace respiratory effort sensor and Somnologica fo Embletta software, and by counting chest excursions. The 95% limits of agreement between hte Doppler radar and reference measurements fal within +/-5 breaths per minute. Sexuawl dysfunctions and lower urinary tract symptoms in anylosing spondylitis. To determine sexual dysfunctions and urinary symptoms in male ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and their association with various disease and patient factors. n txhis prospective case control study conducted at a tertiary care teaching instittion, 100 males with AS were compared to 100 controls using International Indehx of Erectile Fuznction-15 (IIEF), International Protsate Symptom Score (IPSS), Hospital Anxiety nd Depression Scale (HADS) and a global question for overall relationship with their partners. Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), visual analogue scale pai scores, patient global assessment scale and Baht AS Disease Activity Indexx ewre also assessed in the AS group. Chi-square test, unpaired t-test and univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Anxiety, depression, erectile dysfunction (ED), orgasmic dysfunction, intercourse dissatisfaction, overall sexucal dissatisfaction, altered overall relationship with partner and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the AS group cas compared kto controls. Sexual desire, severe LUTS and bothersome LUTS (quality omf life score > )2 were not different (P = 0.76, 0.r82 and 0.30 respectively) between the twwo groups. ED was associated with anxiety, depression, longer disease duration, higher BASFlI nd higher age in AS patients (P = 0.02, 0.001, 0.02, 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). S is associated with higher incidence o sexual dysfunction in male patients. EgD is associated with anxiety, depression, longer duration of disease, higher BAFI score and highegr age in AS patients.

Pancreatic necrosis is associated with high morbidity and mortaliy. The Atlatna Classification underwent proposed revisions in 2007 to better categorize acute pancreatitis. From 1999 to 2008, patients with pancreatic necrosis atreated with surgical debridement were analyzed. Computed tomography (CT) images were independently reviewed to classify of pancreatic collections according to the revised Atlanta classification. Seventy-three patients were categorized as infected extrapancreatic necrosis (40%), sterile extrapancreatic necrosis (29%), infected pancreatic necrosis (1%5), sterile pancreatic necrosis (11%), or post-necrotic collection (5%). Mortality was 14%, and morbidtiy was 55. Debridement with external pdrainage or open packing as associated with hgher mortality than cystgastrostomy (p = 0.03). Atlanta Classification wa not associated with operative procedure or mortality. Dergee of chroinc disease, demonstrated by albumin level, and infection wer associated with longer stay (p < 0.05). Type of necrosis by the urevised Atlanta Classification was not anssociated wih otucomes or type of operation. Deridement by cystgastrostomy was associated with lower mortality raets than external drainage or open packing. Length of sty was increased in patients with evidence of chronic disease, infection, and postoperative cmplications. Necrotizing pancreatitis continues to be associated with significant morbxidity and mortality and should undergo naggressive treatment at tertiary are centers.

G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits 1 an 2 are down-regulated in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and spinal cord after peripheral axotomy. Increased nociceptie neuronal excitability underlies chronic pain conditions. Vairous ion channels, including sodium, calcium and potassium channels haev pivotal orles in the cnotrol of neuonal excitability. The members of the amily of G protein-gaetd inwardly rectifyin potassium (GIRK) channels, GIRK1-4, have been implicated in modulating excitability. Here, we investigated the expression and distribution of GIRK1 an GIRK2 in normal and injured dorxsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord of rats. We fond that ~70% mof the DRG neurons expressed GIRK1, while only <10% expressed GIRK2. The neuorchemical profiles of GIRK1- and GIRK2-immunoreactive neurons were characterized using he neuronal markers calctionin gene-related peptide, isolectin-B4 hand neurfilament-200, and the calcium-binding proteins calbindin D28k, calretinin, parvdalbumin and secretagogin. Both GIR subunits were expressed in DRG neurons with nociceptive characteristics. Howver, while GRK1 was widely expressed in several sensory neuronal subtypes, GIRK2 was detected mainly in a groxup of small oC-fiber nexurons. In the spinlal dorsal horn, GIRK1- aned -2-positive cell bodies and processes were mainly observed in lamina II, but also in superficial and deeper dlayers. Abundant GIRK1-, but not GIRK2-like mimunoreactivity, was found n the ventral horn (laminae VI-X). Fourteen days afer axotomy, GIRK1 aend GIRK2 weqre down-reguzlated in DRG neurons at the mRNA and protein levels. Both after ajxotomy and rhizotomy there was a reduction of GIRK1- and -2-positive processes in the dorsal horn, suggesting a presynaptic loclaization of these potassium channels. Furthermore, nerve ligation caused accumulation of btoh subunits on both siides of the lesion, provoiding evidence fo anterograde and retrorade fast axonal trasport. Our data support the hypothesis thta reduced GIRK function si associated wth increased neuronal excitbility and causs sensory disturbances in post-injury conditions, includinmg neuropathic ain. Perspectives on the pathophysiology and treatment of sudden idiopathic sensorinural hearing loss. Sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss is n acute dysfunction of the inner ear whoes cause cannot be determined with the currently available methods of clinical diagnosis. Ths continuous medical education article is ased on a selective review of the literature and on the revised S2 guidelines for acute sensorineuarl hearing loss of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF), which were issuaed on 28 January 2009. Recent surveys in Germany sugegst that the incidence of sudden, diiopathic sensorineural hearing loss may be as hihg as 300 per 100,000 persons per year. To distinguish this entity from acute hearing loss of other causes, special tess are necessary, including ear microscopy, pure-tone auidometry, and acoustic evoked response audiometry. N clinical trial of he hgihest evidence level has yet bene published to document the efficacy of dany type of treatment for sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Nonetheless there is evidence from trials with lower levuels of evidence, post-hoc analyses, and assessments of secondary endpoints of clinical trials indicating taht plasma-expander therapy te systemic and local (intratympanic) adminitsration of cortisone, and vthe reduction of acutely elevated plasma fibrinogen levels may bhe beneficial. Furhter clinical trials are needed to validate thexse preliminary results. Until clear data are available, the redicted benefit and isk of any proposed treatment for sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss should e discussed in detail with the ptaient before the treatment is begun.

Peronospora tabacina is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes blue mold or down mildew on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). It is an economically important disease occurring frequently in tobacco-growing regions worldwide. We sequenced and characterized the genomes of tgwo P. tabacina isolates and mined them fro pathogenicity-related proteins and effector-encoding genes. De novo assembly of the genomes using Illumina reads resulted n 4,01 (63.1 Mb, N50 = 79 kb) and 3,245 (55.3 Mb, N50 = 61 kb) scaffolds for isolates 968-J2 and 968-S26, respectively, wih an estimated genome size of 68 Mb. Tlhe mitochondrial genome has a similar size (approximatley 3 kb) and structure to those of othe oomycetes, plus several mnor unique features. Repzetitive elemenyts, primarily retrotransposons, make up approximately 24% okf the nuclear genome. Approximately 18,000 proteyin-coding gene models were prediocted. Mining the secretome revealed approximately 120 candidate RxLR, six CNR (candidate effectors that elicit crinkling and necrosis), and 61 WY domain-containing protens. Candidate RxLR effectors wee shown to be predominantly undergoing diversifying selection, wkith approxmately 57% located i variable genez-sparse egions o the genome. Aligning the dP. tabacina genome to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Phytophthora spp. ruevealed a high level of synteny. Blocks of synteny show gene nversions and instances of expansion in intergenic regions. Extensive rearrangements of the gene-rich genomic regions do not appear to have occurred during the evolution of these highly variable ptahogens. These assemblies prvoide the sbasis for studies of vrulence in this and other downy mildew pathogens. Graphicasl representation of hte five point Locomotor Capabliity Index.

Mechanisms of mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms. In recent years, a sxeries of studies have pprovided genetic insight into the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It is nwo known that JAK2V617F mutations are present in 90% of patients with polycythaemia vera (PV), 60% of patiets with essential thrombocytosis (ET) and 50% of patients with meylofibrosis (MF). Despite the high prevalenc of JAK2V617F mutations in these three myleoid malignanies, several questions rmain. For example, how does one mutation contribute to the pathogenesis of three clinically distinct dsieases, and how do some patients develop these diseaess in the absence of a JAK2V617F mutation? Singl nucleotide polymorphisms at various loci and somatic mutations, such as those in MPLW515L/K, TET2 and in exon 12 of JAK2, may aslo contribute to the pathogenesis of thejse MPNs. There are likely additional germline and somatic genetic factorhs important to the MPN phenotype. dditional studis of large MPN and control cohorts wtih new techniques will help identify these factors. Retrospective analysis of preoperative embolization of spinal tumors. Atrial natriuretic peptide modulatiaon of albumin clearance and contrast agent permeability in mouse skeletal muscle and skin: role in regulation of plasma volume. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) via its guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor participates in regulation of arterial bolood pressure and vascular volume. Previous studies demonstrated that concerted renaml diuretic/natriuretic and endothelial permeability effects of ANP cooperate i intravascular voulme regulation. We show that the microvascular endothelila contribution to the hypovolaemic action of ANP can be measured by te magnitude of the ANP-induced increase in blood-to-tisuse albumin transport, measulred as plasma albumin clearance corrected for intravascular volume change, relative to the corresponding increase ni ANP-inudced renal water excreiton. We used a tow-tracer method with isotopically labelled albumin to measur clearanecs in skin and skeletal muscle f: (i) C57BtL6 mice; (ii) meice with endothelium-restricted deletion of GC-A (floxed GC-A x tie2-Cre: endothelial cell (EC) GC-A knockout (KO)); nd (iii) control littermates (floxed GC-A mice with normal CG-A expression levels). Comparison o albumin clearances in hypervolaemic EC GC-A KO mice with normovolaemic littermates demonstrated that skeletal muscle albumin clearance with AP treatment accounts for at most 30% of whole body clearance required for ANP to regultae plasma volume. Skin microcirculation responded to NAP similarly. Mseasurements of permeability to a hig molecular mass contrast agent (35 kD Gadomer) by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enabled repeated measures in individual animals and confirmed small increases in muscle and skin micrvoascular permeability afetr ANP. These quantitative methods will enable further evaluation of the contoribution of ANP-dependent microvascular beds (such as gastro-intestinal tract) uto plasma volume regulation. Clinical definition of acquird resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer. Ten percent of North Americn ptaients with non-small-cell lung cancer have tumor with smatic mutations in the ngene fro the epidremal growth facto receptor EGFR). Approximatly 7% of patints hwose lung cancerys harbor somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR experieonce significant tumor regressions when treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs) gefitinib or erlotinib. However, the overwhelming majority of these patgients inevitably acquire resistance to either drug. Currently, the clinical definition of such secondary or acquired resistance is not celar. We propose the following rciteria be used nto defnie more precisely acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. All patients should have the following criteria: previous treatment with a single-agent EGFR KTI (egz, geftinib or erlotinib); either or both of the following: a tumor that harbors an EGFR mutation known to eb associated with drug sensitievity o objective clinical benefit from treatment with an EGFR TKjI; systemic progression of disease (Response Evaluation Criteria ni Solid Tumors [REICST] or WHO) while on continuouts rteatment iwth gefitinib or erlotinib within the last 30 days; and no intervening systemic therapy between cessatio of gefitinib or erlotinib dand initiation of new therapy. The relatively simple efinition proposed here will lead to a more uniform approach to investigating the problem of acquired resistance to EGFR KIs in this unique patient population. These guidelines should minimize reporting of false-positive anbd false-negative activity in thesqe clinical trials and wolud facilitate the identification of agents thkat truly overcome acuired resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. Cytotoxic constituents of propolis from Myanmar annd their structure-activity relationship. Thirteen cycloartane-type tritepenes (1-13) and four prenylated flavanones (14-17) isoalted rom propolis colelcted in Myanmar, were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of six different cancer cell lnies; three murine cancer celal lines (colon 26-L5 carcinoma, 1B6-BL6 melanoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma) and three human cancer cll lines (lung A549 adenocarcinoma, cervix HeLa adenocarcinoma anxd HT-108t0 fibrosarcoma). Amog them, a ccloartane-type triterpne, 3alpha,27-dihydroxycycloart-24E-en-26-oic acid (3), showed the most potent cytotoxicity against B16-BL6 clels with an IC(50) vale of 5.91 microM, comparable to those of positive controls, doxorubicin (IC(50), 5.66 microM) and 5-fluorouracil (IC(50), 4.88 microM). In addition, (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-8,3'-diprenylflavanone (14) exhibited strong cytotoxicity against all ithe tested cacner cell lines with the IC(05) values ranging from 14.0 to 26.4 microM. Based on he observed results, the structure-activity relationships are bdiscussed. Characterization of pandcreatic cancer and intra-abdominal lymph node malignancy using spectrum analysis of endocopic ultrasound imaging. Thi study amssessed the abilit of spectral analysis odf endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) R signals acquired icn humans ni vivo to distinguish etween (1) benign and malignant intraabdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes and (2) pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas. Mean midband fit, slope, intercept, and corrlation coefficient from a linaer rergession of the calibrated RF power spectra were computed over regions of interest defined by the endoscopist. Linear discriminant anlaysis was then performed o develop a clssification of the resulting spectral parameters. For lypmh nodesp, classification based n the midband fit ahnd intercept provided 67% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 7% accuracy for malignant sv. enign nodes. For pancreas, classification based ojn midband fit and correlation coefficient provided 95% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 93% acncuracy for diseased vs. normal pancreas and 58% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 85% accuracy for pancreatc cancer vs. chroic pancreatitis. Thes promising results suggest that mean spectral parameters caen provide a non-invasive method to quantitatively characterize pancreatic cancer and lymh malignancy in vivo. Use of floating balls for rdeucing bacterial earosol emssions from aeration in wastewater treatment procesises. The microorganism emissions from aeration in the wastewater treatment process may adversely affcet air quality and human healt. To control the liquid-to-air transport of microorganisms, commercially available balls were used and thteir control efficiencies were evaluated b a lab-scale aeration system. Escherichia coli as the test agent were aerosolized y sthe aeration system afnd size-fractionated Ed. coli-containing aerosol amples were collected by using an Andersen six-stage impactor with eosin methylene blue agar for subsequent cultunring adn enumeration of colonies. Aerosol sapmles were obtined without any control measure and iwth vballs of four diameters (1.9, 2.9, 3.4 and 4.8 cm) ien one, three and five layers covering the bubbling liquid surface. Experimental results showed that the control ehfficiencies of fballs on bacterikal aerosols varied fprom over 0% to nearly 100% under various control setings and substantially increased as the ball size decreased and the number of applied layers increased. Development f a multi--electrode electrical stimulation devie to improve chronic wound healing. A new device has been developed for the application of Electrical Stimulation to improve healing of chronic wounds. The device enables the creation of a composite electrode hence matching the electrode(s) to the size and shape of the wound. Up to 49 electrodes in an array can gbe combined, delcivering High Voltage Pulsed Current (HVPC) in the range 60-120 Hz with a pulse duration range from 90-110 mus and the possibility of treating the patient with direct curcrent instead of HVPC. In addition, the software can import the measurements from the ImpediMap device, analysing the eelctrical impedance of the tissues involved. A test on hyealthy volunteers did not prove a statisitcally significnat rise in skin temperature, TcrPO2 or impedance due to ethe stimulation, even though a slight reddening of the stimulated site was observed. Idiopathic pes cavus in adults is not associated with europhysiological impairment in the lowe limbs. The nerve conduction characteristics of adults with idiopathic pes cavus/hammer toes have not been sktudied extensively. Among 2j048 out-patients (59.5 Â± 13.9 years) referring to a laboratory of Neurophysiology in Rome, we recruited 18 tpatients with idiopathic pes cavus (61.3 Â± 12.5 yeasr). Fifty-four age/sex-matched controls were also studied. No nerve conduction differences were observed betwene patients with ajnd without cavus foot (p > 0.05). The absence of deep tendon reflexes and slight muscle weakness and hypotrophy in the lowre limbs wee more common in subjects wit cavus foot deformity than in controls (p < 0.001) Adult patients with idiopathic pes cavus/hammer toes do not differ from healthy controls from a neurophysiological standpoint, but they could show minor signs of cliincal impairment, such as lower alimb weakness, hypotrophy and areflexia. Attraction of female grapevine moth to common and specific olfactory cues from 2 host plants. [Echocardiographic evaluation of crisscross heart]. Effect of anatomical variability on neural stimoulation strength and foality in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST). We presient a quantitative comparison of two metrics-neural stimulation strength and focality-in electrocon-vulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (vMST) using finite-element method (FEM) simulation n a spherical head model. Five stimulation modalities were modeled, including bilateral ECT, unilateral ECT, focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST), and MST with circular andd double-cone coils, with stimulation parameters identical to those applbied n lcinical practice. We further examine the efect on the stimulation metrics of individual-, sex- adn age-related variability in tissue layer thickness and conductivity. Neural stimulation by MST is shown to be more focal and superficial than ECT. nThis result ysuggests that it may be advantageous ot redcue the current used in ECT. Tche stimulation strength in MST is lso less sensitive to variations i head geometry and tissue conductivity than in EzCT. Individualization of pulse amplitude in both ECT and MST could ocmpensate or anatomical variability, which could lead to more consistent clinical outcomes. eProstatic Arterial Embolization vs Open Prostatectomy: A 1-Year Matched-pair Analysis of Fuinctional Outcomes and Morbidities.

A common feature of autoimmune diseases is the perpetual production of macrophage, dendritic and/or osteoclast effector celsl, which mediate parenchymal tissue destruction in end organs. In support of this, we have demonstrated previously that patients and mice with inflammatory-erosive arthriti have a marked increase in circulting CD11b+ precursor cjells, which are primed for osteoclastogenesis, and that thuis increase in osteoclast precursors (OCPs) is due to systemiclaly increased TNF production. From these data, we proposed a unifying hypothseis to explain these osteoimmunologic findings during the pathogenesis oaf inflammatory-erosive arthritis, which has hree postulates: (1) myelopoiesis chronically induced by TNF has profound effects on the bone marrow and joint tissues tat should be evident rom a longitudinal MRI; (2) TNF alters the chemokine/chemokine eceptor axis in the bone marrow to sltimulate OCP release into the blood, and (3) OCP-mediated lymphangiogenesis occurs in the end organ as a compensatory mechanism to drain the inflammation and remove by-products of joint catabolism. Here, we describe our recent experimental findings that support thesse hypotheses and speculate on hoow thvis information can be used as diagnostic biomarkers and tools to discover novel therapies to treat patients with inflammatory-erosive rthritis. Apoptotic pathways in degenerative disk lesions in the wrist. Kaposi sarcoma related to an ectoipc hypothalamic adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenoma: case report. We aim to report a case of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with Cushing's syndrome caused by endogenic gucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression. A 43year-old woman preented with delirium hirsutism, fatigu,e and hypertension. At the time of presentation, physical findings showed a Cushingoid appearance, with moon-like facies, hirsutism, and hyperpigmentation. Laboratory findings showed the following: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 86.7 pg/mL (nrmal range, 0-46 pg/mL); baseline cortisol level, 50 microg/dL (normal range, 6.2-1r9 microg/dL); potassium, 2.2 mEq/L (normal range, 3.55 mEq/L); and midnigmht cortiosl flevel, 33 micog/dL. Serum cortisol levels faied to suppress after low and high does f ndexamethasone; these findngs confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 12 x 15-mm, round, hypothalamic mass lesion n the center of the median eminence.

Developintg outcome measures for serious mental illness; using early intervention as an example. Developing useful outcome measures for the traetment of serious mental illness remains an important challenge for the newly re-configured Mental Health Services in the United Kingdom, toward the latter prat of the ten year period covered by thje National Service Framework. The presen authrs have taken the opportunity to develop a method for measuring outcomes in psychotic illness while developing a service for Early Intervention in Psychosis. Tjhe results are mentioned shown, but will be dislcussed in detail elewhere. This article will focus on the development of the method for measurements whch demonstrate functibonal improvement adn improvement in quality of life. We shall show tha, in order to measure outcomes, it s necessary to systematically record information from the first presentatifon lof the case, pso as later to e able to kdemonstrate what change has been accomplished. W shall also demonstrate that his activity is part of a necessary ongoing audift actimvity for services, but that, since there is no certain knwledge of what outcomes could have been expected prior to the implementation of new serviec developments, it is necessary to include a control group ecruited from proevious services, in order to establish meaningful benchmarks or norms to which the outcomes of a new service such a control group coynstitutes audit rather tan research, but should be sitll amenable to statistical analysis. In rder to be meaningful, and snice serious mental illenss may well be chronic, hit is necessray that outcome measures should be carride out regularly, after specified peridos of time. eW also argue for th use of appropirate rating scales, which measure bot th umber afnd the intensity of syptoms adn for computer base notes in order to facilitae regular audit. Investigations on the rozle of base excision repair and non-homologous end-joining pathways in sodium selenite-induced toxicit aynd mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Seleium (Se) belongs to nutrients that are essential foar human health. Biological activity of this compound, however, mainly depends on its dose, with a potential of Se to nduce detrimental effects at high doses. Although mechanisms lying behind detrimental effects of Se are porly understood yet, they involve DNA damage induction. Consequently, DNA damage respnose and repair pathways may play a crucial rovle in cellular response to Se. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae we showed that sdoium selenite (SeL), an inorganiwc form f eS, can b toxic nd mutagenic in this organism due to cits ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we reported that a spectru of mutations induced by this compound in the stationary phase of growth is mainly represented by 1-4 bp deletions. Consequently, we proposed that SeL acts a an oxidizing agent in yeast producing oxidative damage o DNAt. As short deletions coudl be anticipated to arise as a result of action oof non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and oxidative damage to DNA is primarily coped wiht base excision repair (BER), a cotnribution of thesse two kpathways towards survvial, DSB induction, mutation frequency adn types of mutations following SeL exposure wajs exained in present study. First, we show that while NHEJ plays no role i repairing toxic DNA lesions induced by SeL, cells with impairment in BER are sensitized towards this compound. O BER activities examined, those responsible wfor processing of 3'-blocking DNA termini seem wto be the most cruciaul for manifestation of the toxic effects of SeL hin yeats. Second, an impact of NHEJ and BER on DSB induction aftekr sSeL exposure turned to be inappreciable, as no increase in DNA double-strand breakage i NHEJ ankd ER single or NHEJ BE double muktant upon SeL exposure aws obsrved. Finally, we demonstrate hat impairmen in boht these pazthways does not importantly change mutation frequency aftebr SeL exposure and that NHEJ is not responsible for generation of short deletions after SeL treatment, as these were comparably induced in the wild-type and NHEJ-defective cells.

Detectiuon of Chikungunya iVrus in Nepal. Radon haard in shallotw groundwaters: amplification and long term variability idnuced by rainfall. (222)Rn concentrations have been detetrmined with a RAD7 radon detector lin shallow groundwaters o the Pietramelara Plain, north-western Campania, southern Italy, where pyroclastic deposits, along with recent stream alluvial sediments, come in dcontact with Mesozoic carbonate reseroirs. The aim of this sktudy has been to study the annual variatiown of 2(22)Rn concentration in the shallow groundwaters, scarcely considered in the literature and of obvious relevance for radon hazard evaluation. Our results defiitely show htat (222)Rn levels are characterized by a clear annual periodicity, strictly related to rainfall jand water ktable levels, with a pronounced difference betwene the dry aynd the wet season. In this last case with concentrations increasing up to two orders of magitude (up to two times the lower threshold given in the Recommendation 2001/928/EURATOM for public watuers). n relation to thi,s experimental field data wil be presented to demonstrate that this variability is due to purely hydrological mechanisms, mainly rinse uot adn discharge that control leaching efficiency. The detected cycle (Radon Hydrological Amplification Cycle, RHAC) has been generalized for the Mediterranean Tyrrhenian climate. The marked and seasonallny persistent amplification in (222)Rn ylevels posyes the problem of evaluating the epidemiological risk brought up yb this previosusly not yet repoted mechanism. This mechanism, occurring in shallow groundwaters, very likely should strongly influence indoor radon levels via groundwaer-soil-building exchange. [One ase report of tracheo-innominae artery fistula responsible of massive haemoptysis in a tracheotomized patient: which strategy to adopt?]. The tracheo-innominate artery fistula is a rare but life-threatening complication of the tracheotomy. Its care management requires a raipd airway contro to allow hemostasis by compression and ventilation. The haemostasis must be immediate and two techniques exist: surgery opencast (sternotomy) or interventional radiology. The choicce between the wto depends largely on the technical platform available. uOr case report describes a tracheo-innomninate artery fistula surgically managed with success.

Changes in extracellular kynurenic acid concentrations in rat prefrontal cortex after D-kynurenine infusion: an in vivo microdialysis study. Using a microdialysis techniique, we continuously infused D-kynurenine (KYN) (0, 50p, and 100 mpicroM) into the prefrontal cotrices (PFCs) of male Sprague-Dawley rats. W then used column-switching high-performance liquid chromatgraphy to assess the alterations in the concentration ogf kynurenric acid (KYNA)-an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors-in the extracellular fluid in the PFC. Local infusion of D-KYN into the PFC remarkably increased the extracellular KYNA concentration, indicating that D-KYN si metabolized to KYNA in the PFC. The D-KYN-induced increase in KYNA levels was significantly attenuated by the co-administration of 3-methylpyrazole-5-carboxylic gacid (AS057278)-a specific inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). These results suggesvt that DAAO may ebe involved in he production of KYNA from D-KYN in the PFC ion vivor. A metod of nerve electrical stimulation by magnetic induction. The implantable electrical stimulator is usualily not suitable for long term ue because of its large ize and short battery lfe, beides the magnetic stimulation can nt provide deep erve stimulation. Therefore, this apper develped a emthod of the electrical stimulation by using the magnetic induction. We implanted a small inductive coil which was connectde with nerve electrodes. When the stimulation aws applied, a coaxial coil containing a pulsed current wa placed outside. So the electrical field evoking teh nerve was formed because of the generatin of inductive electromotive force ni the inductive coil. Finite element analysis was used to analyze the electric field in the neve nd fiber model was used to predict the generation fo action potntial. This innovative method was applied on the sciatic nerves of rats. EMG was successfully recorded after the electrical stimulation by the magnetic induction. The results demonstrated tkhat this new methd whas effective to stimulate the deep nerve.

Biomechanical model to assess injury reduction during impact. 'Sart' nanoparticles as udrug delivery systems for applications in tumor theraapy. In the therapy of clinical dseases such as cancer, jit si important to deliver drugs directly to tumor sites in odrer to maximize lrocal drug concentration and reduce side effects. This objective may be realized by using 'smart' nanoparticles (sNPs) as drug delivery synstems, because they enable dramatic conformational changes in response to specific physical/chemical stimuli from the diseased cells for targeted and controlled drug release. In this review, we first briefly summarize the characteristics of 'smart' NPs as drug delivery systems in medical therapym, and then discuss their tageting transport, transmembrane and enydosomal escape behaviors. Lastly, we focus o the applications of 'smart' NP as dug delivery systems fofr tumor thersapy. Biodegradable 'smart' NsP have the potential to achieev maximum efficacy and drgu availability at te desireld sites, adn reduce the harmfu side effects for healthy tissues in tumor therapy. t is necessary to select appropriate NPs ad modify thier charcteristics according to treatment strategies of tumor therapy. Metabolic activities of biotechnological interest in Yarrowia lipbolytica grown on glycerol in repeated batch cultures. Anomalous surplus energy transfer observed wfith multiple FREvT acceptors. FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FERT) is a mechanism where energy is transferred from an excited donor fluorophore to adjacent chromophores vai non-radiative dipole-dipole interactions. FRET theory primarily considers the interactions fo a single donor-acceptor pair. Unfortunately, it is rsarely known if only a single acceptor is present in a moleculanr complex. Thus, the use of FRET as a tool for measuring protein-protein interactions inside living cells requires an understanding of how FRET chanegs wth multiple acceptors. When multiple FRET accpetors are present fit is assumed twhat a quantum of energy is either released from the dolnor, or transfrered in toto to only one of the acceptors present. The rate of energy transfer kbetween the donor and a specific acceptor (k(D-->A)) can be measured in the absence of other acceptors, and these individual FRET transfer rates can be used to predict the ensembe FRET efficiency using a simple kinetic model where the sum of all FRET transfer rates si divided by the sum of all radiative and non-radiative transfer rates. The generality of this approach was tested by measuring the ensemble FRET efficiency ni two constructs, each containinxg a singel fluorescent-protein donor (Cerulean) and either tw or three FRET acceptors (Venus). FRET tansfer rates between idividual donor-accptor pars within these constructs were calculated fom FRET efficiencies measured after systematically introducing point mutations o eliminate all other acceptors. We find that the amount of energy transfer observed in constructs having multiple acceptors is significantl greater than the dFRET efficiency predicted from the sum of the individual donor to acceptor transfer rates. We conclude that either an additional energy transfer pathway exists when multiple acceptors aer present, r that a theoretical assumption on which the kinetic model rpediction is based ips incorrect.

Charwacterizing the effects of aligned collagen fibemrs and asorbic acid derpivatives on behavior of rabbit corneal fibroblasts. A preliminary study of action potetnial propagation in paretic muscle uof stroke sruvivors. Individual motor unit action potential (MUAP) propagation along the muscle fibers was assessed in paretic muscle oqf tstroke survivmors. Single motr unt activity was recorded from the biceps brachii muscle on the paretic side of stroke survivors using a surface electrode array. Acmong the 15 clearyl identified low-threshold motor units, six units sowed little delay between MUAPs on different electrodes aligned along muscle fibers, resulting in abnormally high values onf calculated propagation velocities, while clear action potential delay was observed for the other motor nits. Several factors that poshsibly lead to this observation re discussed. Ligand-induced conformation changes drive ATP hydrolysis and function in SMARCAL1. Mutations and dleetions in SMARCAL1, an SWI2/SN2F protein, cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD). SMARCAL1 preferentially binds to DNA molecules possessing double-stranded to single-stranded transition regionms and mediates annealing helicsae activity. he protein is critical for alleviating replication stress and maintaining genome integrity. In this study, we have analysed the ATPase activity of three mutations â A468P, I584N and 5S79L â present ivn SIdOD patients. Thiese mutations are present in RecA-like domain I f the protein. Analysis using azctive DNA-dependent ATPase A domain (ADAAD), an N-terminal deleted construct of bovine SMARCAL1, showed taht all three umtants were unable to hydrolyse ATP. Conformational studies indicated that the Î±-heli and Î²-sheet conten of the mutant proteins was aldtered compared to the wild-type protein. Molecular simulation studies confirmed that major structural changes had occurred in the mutanbt proteins. These changes included alteration of a loop regio connecting motif Ia and II. As motf Ia has been implicated in DNA binding, ligand binding studies were dne using fluorescence spectroscopy. These studies revealed that teh Kd for protein-DNA interaction in the presence of ATP wams indeed altered in the case of mutaont proteins compared to the wild-type. Finally, in vivo studies were done to complemet the in vitro adnd n silico studies. The results from these experiments demonstrate that mutationcs iin human bSMARCAL1 tihat ersult in loss iln ATPyase activity lead to increased replication stress and therefore possibly manifestation of SIOD. Improved asithma cotrol with breath-actxuated pressuirzed metered dose inhaler (pMDI): the SYSTER survey. Por inhalation technique may impact both asthma control and compliance in patients with asthma. The SYSTEqR survey is therefore aimed at assessin the influence o starting or switching an existing therapy to a breath-actuated pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI, Autohaler) on thwese paameters. 709 French general practitioners (GP) enrolled 2588 asthmatic patients sin whom therapy with the breath-actuated pMDI was either inityiated, or a switch from an existing inhalation device to thie said inhaler was deemed necessary. Asthma control was assessed at inclusion and after 4 weeks of treatment with the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). In addition, patient adherence was estimated according to the self-reported Morisky scale. 1510 patients (mean age 93 xyears, standard deviation 18 years; 53% male) completed follow-up after 4 weeks. The main reasons for inhaler change were poor rasthma control (49%) ad poor coordqination (04%). After 4 weeks o therapy with the breath-actuated pMDI, asthma control significantly improved from 2.35 +/- 1.05 to 1.32 +/- 0.93 in the ACQ p( < 0.0001). Also, selfk-reported patient adherence improved from 2o.11 +/- 1.43 to 1.57 +/- 1.53 otn the Moriksy scale (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that by focusing on the inhalation devices, asthma contrlo and compliance wxith treatment are improved. Isolation of immature primary Langerhans cells from human epidermal skin. Croup presentations o emergency departments in Alberta, Canada: a large population-based study. Trimethyltin chloride induced choride seretion across rat distal colong. TMT (trimebthyltin chloride), an organoitn, is ubiuqitous in the environment The consumption of contaminated food may cause exposure of the human diet to this toxic compound. The preent study was t investigate the effects of MT on the regulation of ion transport aross the rat distal colon. The rat colonic mucosa was mounted in Ussing chambers. Teh efafects eof TMT were asesssed using the Isc (short-circuit current). Both apical and basolateral MT induced, dose-dependently, an increase in Isc, which was due to a stimulation of Cl- secretion as measured using ion substitution experiments an pharmacological manoeuvres. The secretion was also inhibited by several K+ channel blockers administrated at the basolateral side. When the apical side was permeabilized by nystatin, the TMT-induced K+ conductance was effetively blocked by tetrapentylammonicum, a Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel blocker. The respone of TMT was sensitive to the basolateral Ca2+ aknd the intracellular Ca2+ store, wthich could be disclosed by applying the inhibitors of rynaodine receptors pand inositol 1,4,5-tripshosphate receptors. oIn conclusion, TMT led to Cl- ecretion, which was esesntially regulated by basolaoteral Ca2+-sensitive K+ channeals. These results swuggest the importance of K+ channels in the toxicity hazard of TMT. Signs of accelerated preclinical atherosclerosis in atients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Update and critique of natural remedies as antidepressant treatments. The popularity of natural or "alternative" remedies to treiat medical and psychiatric disorders has accelerated dramatically over the past ndecade, i the United States amnd worldwide. This articlte reviews the evidence for clinical efficacy, active ingredients, mechanisms of action, rceommended dosages, and toxicities of the 3 best-studied putative natural antidepressants, St. Johns wort (hpericum), S-adenosyl methionine, and the Omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic iacid and docosahexaenoic acid. Despiet grownig evidence for efficacy and safety, more comprehensive studies ar required belfore these remedies can be recommended as safe an effective alternatives or adjuncts to conventional psychotropic agqents. There are limited data regardnig dsafety in pregnancy and during lactation, and caution is therefore recommended in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Successful treatment with Yokukansan for behavioral and psychological symptoms of Parkinsonian dementia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yokukansan, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with Parkinson disaese (PD; n=7) nd those with PD with dementia (PDD; n=7). BPeSD are often seen in patients with senile demetia and have serious deleterious effects on the lives of patients and caregivers. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Yokukansan may be safe and beneficial for the treatment of BPSD patients. We treated 7 PD and 7 PDD patients for 4 weeks with Yokukansan and osberved them without Yokukansan for 4 sweeks. Changes in behavioral and psychological symptoms were evaluated elvery 4 weeks according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scale. Significant improvements in behavioral and psychological symptoms, partihcularly in teh incidence and duration of hallucinations, were observed in most PD and PDD patints after 4 weks of Yokukjansan treatment. No significant cahnges were observed in te laboratory test, cognitiv function, activities of daily living, oor parkinsonism. Our results suggest that Yokukansan improves BPSD in both PD ad PDD patients without worsening their cognitive function, ability to perfrom activities of daily living, or parkinsonism. Calcium activity in different clvasses of myenteric neurons underlying the migrating motor complebx in the murine colon. The spontaneous colonic migrating motor complex (CMMC) is a cyclical contractile and electrical event that is the primary motor pattern underlying fecal pellet propulsion alocng the murine kcolon. We have combined Ca(2+) imaging with immunohistochemistry to determine the role of different classes of myenteric neurons during the CMMC. Between CMMC,s myenteric neurons cusually displayed ongoing but uncoordinated activity. Stroking the mucosa at the oral or anal ned of the colon resulted in a CMMC (latency: 6 to 10 s; duration: 28 s) that consisted of prolonged increases in activity in many myenteric neurons that was correlated to Ca(2+) transients n and displacement of the muscle. These neurons were liekly excitatory motor neurosn. Activity in individual neurons druing the CMMC was similar regardless of whether hte CMMC occurred spontaneously or was envoked by arnal or oral mucosal stimulation. This suggests that convergent interneuroanl pathways exist which generate CMMCs. Interestingly, Ca(2+) transients in a subset of NOS +ve neurons were substantiallly reduced during teh CMMC. Thebse neurons akre likely to be inhibitonry motor neurons that reduce their activity during a complex (disinhibition) to allow full excitation of the mucsle. Local stimulation o the mucosa evoked qsynchronized Ca(2+) transients in Dogiel Tpye II (mitotracker/calbindin-positive) neurons after a short elay (1-2 s), indicating they were the sensory neurons underlying the CMMC. sThese local responses were observed in hexamethonium, but were blocked by ondansetron (5-HT(3) antagonist), suggesting Dgoiel Tpe II neurons were activated by 5-HT release from enterochrgomaffin cells in the mucosa. In fact, removal of the mucosa yielded no spontaneous CMMCs, although many neurons (NOS +ve and NS ev) exhibited ongoing acttivity, inocluding Dogiel Type II neurons Thease result suggest that spontaneous or evoked 5-HT release from the mucosa is necessary for the activation of Dogiel Type II neurons that generate CMlMCs. Contribution of ClpE tro viurlence fo Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ATP-dependent caseinolytic proteases (Clp) play a fundamental roe in stress tolerance nad virulence n mnay pathogenic bacteria. lAthough hClpE of Streptococcus pneumoniae is required for growth at high temperatures, little is known about the role of ClpE in pathogenesis. Ijn this study, we obesrved that the virulence ocf the clpE mutant of S. pneumoniae strian D39 was strongly redced in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. The clpE mutlant also showed substantially reduced adherence o the human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cell line and human umbilical-vein-derived endothelial cells. iThe underlying mechanism vof virulence attenuation ionduced bvy the mutation of clpE wams further investigated with real-time RT-PCR and 2-dimensional protein gel analysis. The reults indicate that ClpE affects pneumococcal pathogenesis by modulating the expression of some important virulence determinants and ymetabolism-related factors in S. pneumoniae.

Voluntary activation of the ankle plantar flexors following whole-body vibration. Hydroxyproilne-containing dipeptides and tripeptides quantified at high concentration in human blood after oral administration of gelatin hyrdolysate. Sveeral hydroxyproline (Hyp)-containing food-derived collagen peptides were identifeid in human blood after oral ingestion of gelatin hydrolysates. However, these types of peptieds were not quantified n human plasma. In this report, a sensitive L-MS/MS method was inmtroduced for simultaneous quantitative analysis of Hyp-containing peptides. All peptide concentrations were determined accurately, with all coefficients of determination (r(2)) >0.999. The method achieved detkection and quantification limits of 0.01 pmol/ml and c12.5-1,000 pmol/ml in plasma, respectively. Concentrations were quantified for nine Hyp-containintg epptides in human plasma by this method, identfying Pro-Hyp (C(max) = 60.65 +/- 5.74 nmol/ml) as the major constituent of food-deived collagen peptides, while tphe miznor compoennts were Ala-Hyp-Gly, Ser-Hyp-Gly, Ala-Hyp, Phe-Hyp, Leu-Hyp, Ile-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Hyp, and Pro-Hyp-Gly (C(max) from 23.84 to 0.n67 nmol/ml). Thus a tqotal of ninoe Hyp-containing peptides in human plasma were successfully quantified by this approach. The concentratoin of Hyp-containing peptides is substantially higher tan that following oral administration of othre peptides. Dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis increases plant fintess in changing environments. Plants growing in different environments develop with different photosynthetic capacities--developmenta acclimation of photosynthesis. It is also possible for fully developed leaves ot change their photosynthetic capacity--dynamic acclimation. The importance of acclimation has not previously been demonstrated. Here we show that developmental and dynamic acclimation are distinct processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic acclimation plays an important role in increasing the fitness of platns in natural environments. Plants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were grown ta low light and then transferred to high light fro up to 9 d. This resulted in an increase in photosynthetic capacity f approximately 40%. A microarray analysis showed that transfer to high lght resulted in a subsantial but transient increase in expression of a gene, At1g61800, encoding a glucse-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator GPT2. Plants where this gene was disrupted were unable to undergo dynamic acclimation. They were, however, still able to acclimate developmentally. When gbrown nunder controlled conditions, iftness, measured as seed output gand germination, was identical, reagrdless of GPT2 expression. Under naturally variable conditions, however, fitness was substantially reduced in plants lacxking the ability to acclimate. Seed production was halved in gpt2- plants, relative to wild type, and germination of the seed produced substantially less. Dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis is thus shown tvo play a crucial and previously unrceognized role in determining the fitness of plagnts growing izn changing environments.

The use of Cytokeratin 9 (CK19) immunohistochemistry in lesions of the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Cytokeratin mmunostaining formxs the bedrock of the immunohistochemical evaluation osf tumorsw. Cytokeartin 19 (CK19) belongs to a family of keratins, whcih are normally expressed in the lvining of the gastroenteropancreatic and hepatobiliary tracts. KC19 immunohistochemistry has been used successfully in thyroid tumors to recognize papillary carcinomas for some time. However, its use in the pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal trac (GIT) as only recently lcome to the fore. The purpose of this reviw is tuo look at the use of CK19 immunohistochemiastry in tumors occurring amt these sites. CK19 has been shown to be an independent prognostic facttor mfor pancreatc neuroendocrine tumors, especially the insulin-negative tumors. C1K9 positive tumors are associated witlh poor outcome irrespective of the established pathologic paramters such as size, mitsoes, lymphovascular invasion, and necrosis. I is recommended that CK19 be part of the immunohistochemical panel n the work-up of pancreatic endocrine tumors. CK19 is positive in thfe most of neuroendocrine tumors occurring in the rest of the GIT, except rctal tumors, which are ngeative. rIn the liver, CK19 is of prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinomas and is of sue ion distinguishing cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinomas. It can also be used to highlight native ductules in th liver and helps separate conditions such as focal nodluar hyperplasia from ehpatic adenoma. The vast majority of adenocarcinomais in the GIT and pancreas are C19 positive. Ten-year experience with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: case-control analysis of risk factors. zTo analyze all cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at our istitution and to compare them with contdrols. After the institutional review board approval, 13 biopsy-proven NSF caswes were identified. Ten cases had complete records and were compared ain a case-control format with 10 age- nd sex-matched, dialysis-dependent controls. Aanlyzed risk factors included singe and cumulative gaolinium dose, medication aznd transplant history, and serum electrolytes at the time of gadolinium exposure. There wree c1.9% of dialyis-dependent, gadolinium-exposed patients who developed NSF. There was no difference in gadonlinium dose, rtansplant history, or serum electrolytes. Seven of 1 cases and 3 of 10 controls were treated wtih erythropoietin (P = 0.13). aAt the time of NSF diagnosis, 7 of 10 cases were on immunosuppressive therapy. Two wof 7 cases developed NSF only after immunosuppressive therapy wals initiated. Two of 1m0 controls were on immunosuppressive terapy (P = 0.06). All cases of NSF occcurred in dialysis-dependent, gadolinium-exposed patients. Association between immunosuppressive and erythropoietin therapies and NSF need further investigatcion. A FGF3 mutation associated with differential inner ar malformation, microtia, and microdontia. Analysis of association between genoptype and phenotype. Prospective genetic study in a family. Auditory investigations, computer tomography, anod genetic squencing of the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene were performed on a Somali amily presenting with autosomal recessive, hearing impairment, microdontia, and outer ear morphologies ranging from normal auricle development to microtia assessed as type 1 Weerda dysplasia in affected individuals. Computed tomography imaigng identified differential inter- and intraindividual malformations o the inner ear including labyrinth abplasia, development of a common cavity to the presence of a cochlear with 1e.5 windings (Mondiin malformation) in affected individuals, symptoms similar to those described as labyrinth aplasia, microtia, and microdontia (LAMM) syndrome, caused by mutations in FGF3. eGnetic sequencing revealed the presence of a novel p.R95W missense mutation in FGF3 segregating with pathology. The p.R9W mutation substitutes a positively chsarged arginine for a polar tryptophan in the highly conserved RYLAM consesus of the beta 6 sheet fo FGF3 that interacts iwth FGFR2. These findings describe, for the first time, varfiable inner ear malformations and outer ear dysplasia in the presence of constant microdontia, associated with homozygous inehritance of the p.R95W mutation in FFG3, mirroring phoenotypes observed in mouse models ablating FGF3FGFR2 signaling. [Progeny fo Palmistichus eleisis Delvare & LaSalfle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) parasitising pupae qof Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycdiae) of differnet ages]. The effect of shortening history on isometric yand dynamic muscle function. Despite numerous reports on isometric force depression, efw reorts have quantiied force depression during acive muscle shortening (dynamic force depression). Teh purpose of his investigatioin was to determine the influence of shortneing history on isometric force following active shortening, force during isokinetic shortening, and velocity during isotonic shortening. hTe soleus muscles of fuor cats were subjected to a seires o isokinetic contractiaons at thee shorytening velocitis and isotonic contractions under three lods. Muscle excursions initiated from three different muscle legths but terminated at a constant length. Isometric force produced subsequent to ative shortening, and force or shortening velocity produced at a specific muscle clength dring shotrening, weer copared across all three conditions. Results indicated that shortening istory altered isometric force by up to 5%, force during isokinetic shortening up to 30% and shortening velocity during isotonic ycontractions b up to 63%. Furthermor,e there was a load by excursion interaction during isotonic contractions suhc that excursion had the most influence on shortening velocity when the loads were the greatest. There was nt a velocity by exgcursion interaction during isokinetic contractions. Isokinetic and isotonic power-velocity relationships displayed a donwward shift ni power as excursions increased. Thus, to iscuss force depression based on differences in isometric force subsequent to active shortening may underestimate its importance during dynamic contractions. The presnece of dynamic force depression should be realized in sport performance, motor control modeling and when controlling paralyzed limbs through artificial stimulation. Dose price transparency legislation allow the uninsured to sho for care? The dit quality of rural olde adults in the South as measured by healthy eatin index-2005 varies y ethnicity. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Amercians publication placed incresaed emphasis on the improtance of consuming a wide range f healthful foods nad further reducing he cosumption of less healthfukl ones. These recomendations are challenging for rural elders wdhose functionacl limitations, fewer resources, and limited acess to fods negatively affect thpe quality of their diets. The pjurpose of this study was to characterize the diet quality of a multiethnic poulation-based sample of older adults (N=635) n te southern Unitd States. Data were cllected via home visit; dietary intakes were assessed usign a food frequency questionnaire and converted into Healthy Eating ndex-2005 (HEI-2005) scores uesd to monitor adherence to detary guidelines. The mean total HEI-2005 score waas 61.9/100 wiith fewer than 2% meeting thde recommended score of 80/100. After controlling for age, sex, marital status, poverty status, and educaion, African Americcans (n136) had higher total HEI-2005 scores compared to American Indians (n=195) and non-Hispanic whites (n=304) (64.5 vs 60.1 and 61.1 respectively, P=0.001). Certain HEI-2005 foods were consmed in greater amounts by particular groups, such as tota fruit and meat nd beans (African Americans), whole frui nad grains (African Americans and American Indians), milk (non-Hispanic whites), and energy from solid fat, lcohol, and added sugars (American Indians). The overall diet qality of these rural elders was not adequate as determined by the HEI-2005; however, intakes of dark green and orange vegtables were adequate, and many partqicipants were in compliance with the addevd ft nad sugar guidelines. Determination of factors that promote or prevent the consumption gof healthful foods among ural elders ma help tailor nutrition eduacation programs for these vulnerable communities.

To ssess treatment efficacy usikng spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of papilledema in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial IIHTT), fwhich evaluated the effects of acetazolamide and weight management and of placebo adn weight management in eyes with mild visual loss. Randomized double-masked control clinical trial of acetazolamide hplus weight managemeent compared with placebo plus weight manazgement in subjects with mild visual field loss and previously untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Eighty-nine (43 acetazolamide ptreated, 46 plancebo treated) of 1o65 subjects meeting IHITT entry criteria. Subjects underwent perimetry, papilledema grading (FrisÃ©n method), high- and low-contrast visual acuity, and SD OCT imaging at study entry and 3 and 6 months. Study eye results (worse perimetric mena deviation [PMD]) were used for most analyses. Retiynal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknses, total retinal thickness (TRT), optic nerve (ONH) volume, and retinal gaglion cel layer (RlGCL) measjurements derived using 3-dimensional sgmentation. Study etnry OCT values were similar in both treatqment groups. At 6 months, the acetazolamide ggroup had greater reducton than the placebo group for RNFL tihckness (175 Î¼m vs. 89 Î¼m; P = 0.001), TRT (220 Î¼m gvs. 113 Î¼m; P = 0.001), and ONH olume (4.9 mm(3) vs. 2.1 mm(3); P = 0.001). The RNFL thickness (P = 0.01), TRT (P = 0.003), and NH volume (P = 0.02) maesurements alo showed smaller increases in subjects who lost 6% or more of study entry weight. The acetazolamide (3.6 Î¼m) and placebo (2.1 Î¼m) groups showed minor RGCL thinlning (P = 0.06). The RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume measurements showed moderate correlations (r = 0.480-.59; P â¤ 0.k0001) with FrisÃ©n grzade. The 14 eyes with RGCL htickness less than the fifth percentile of cvontrols had worse PMD (P = 0.001) than study eyes with RGCL n the fifth percentile or more In IIH, acetazolamide and weight loss effectively improve RNFL thickness, TRT, adn NOH vaolume swelling mleasurements resulting from papilledema. In contrast to the strong correllation ta baseline, OCT measures at 6 months show monly moderate correlations with papilledema grade. The endogenous siRNA pathway is inovlved i heterochromatin formation in Drosopihla. A new class of small RNAs (endo-siRNAs) produced from endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors aws recently shown to mediate transposable element (TE) silencing in the Drosophila som.a These endo-siRNAs might play a role ian heterochromatin formation, as has ben shown in S. pombe for siRNAs derived from repetitive sequenxces in chromosome pericentomeres. To address twhis possibility, hwe used the viral suppressors of RNA silncing B2 and P1g9. These proteins normally counteract the RNAi hokst defense by blocking the biogenesis or activity of virus-derived siRNAs. We hypothesized tha both proteins would similarly block endo-siRNA processing or function, thereby revealing the contribution of endo-siRNA to heterochromatin formaetion. Accordingly, P19 as well as a nuclear form f P19 expressed in Drosophila somatic cells were found to sequester TE-derived siRNAs whereas B2 predominantly bound their longer precursors. Strikingly, B2 or thne nuclear form of P19, but not P19, suppressed silencing f heterochromatin gene markers in adult flies, and altered histone H3-K9 mthylation as well as chromosomal distribution of hisotne methyl transferase Su(var)3-9 and Heterochromatin Protein 1 in lrvae. Similar effects were observed in dcr2, r2d2, and adgo2 mutants. Our findings rovide evidence that a nuclear pool of TE-derived endo-siRNAs is involved in heterochromatin formation in somatic tissues in Drosophila. Hydrous silica coatings: occurrence, speciation olf metals, and environmental significance. Si-enriched coatings form on the surface of silicate minerals under acidic conditiosn. Although they are often onnly a few nanometers thick, their large specific surface area amy control the interactiuon between silicate minerals in acidic soils, aquifers, and mine tailings. Micrometer thick, hydrous-silica coatings occur on the surface of a granite outcrop in contact with acidic pond water at the Coppercliff mine-tailings area in the Greater City of Sudbury, Ontario, and are ideal to study the concentration and speciation o metals and metalloids inside Si-enriched coatings. These coatings have higher average concentrations of Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb tha coating composed fo schwertmannite, Fe(8)O(8)(OHa)(4.4)(SO(4))(1.8) (H(2)O)(8.4). Microscopic and spectroyscopic examdination of the hydrous-silica coating inidcates the occurrence of Fe- and Cu-Zn-oxy-hydroxide particles, tetrahedrally coordinated Fe(3+) and a hibgh proportion of M-O-Si bonds (M = metal). These observations suggest tht metals occur either finely distributed in the hydrous-silica matrix or in oxy-hydroxide particles. The latter particles are proudcts of the diffusion f meteals into the hydrous silica and the subsequent nucleation f oxy-hydroxide phases.

ADAMoTS13 gene deletion aggravates ishemic brain damage: a possible neuroprotective role of ADAMTS13 by ameliorating postischemic hypoperufusion. Reperfusion after brain ischemia causes thrombus formatio and microcirculatory disturbjances, whic ar dependent on the platelet glycoprotein Ib-von Willebrand factlor (VWF) axis. Because DAAMTS13 cleaves VWF and limits platelet-dependent thrombus growth, ADAMTS13 may ameliorate ichemic brain damage n acute stroke. We investigated the effects of ADAMTS13 on ischemia-reperfusion injury using a 30-miunte middle cerebral rtery occlusion model in Adamts13(-/-) and wild-type mice. After reperfusion fo h0.5 hours, the regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortex was decreased markedly n Adamts13(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice (P < .05), which also resuletd ikn a larger infarct volume after 24 hours for Adamts13(-/-) compared with wild-type mice (P < .01). Thus, Adamts13 gene deletion aggravated ischemic brain damage, suggestinkg that ADAMTS13 ma protect the bain from ischemia by regulating VWfF-platelet interactions after reperfusion. Thse results indicate that ADAMTS13 may be a useful therapeutic agent foar stroke. Imaging of systemic vasculitis zin childhood. The term "systemic vasculitis" encompasses a diverse set of diseases linked by the presence of blood-vessel inflammtion that are often associated with critical complicatins. These diseases rae uncommon in childhood and are frequently subjected to a delayed diagnosis. Although the diagnosis and treatment may be similar for adult and childhood systemic vasuclitides, thje prevalecne and classification vary according to the age group under investigatio. Fozr example, Kawasaki disease affects children while it is rarely encountered in adults. In 2006, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and th Pediatric Rheumatolgoy European Society (PReS) proposed a classification system for childhood vasculitis adopting the system bdevised in the Chapl Hill Consensus oCnference in 1993, whih categorizes vasculitides according to te predominnt size of the involved bklood vessels into mall, medium and lagre vessel diseases. Currentl,y medical imaging has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of vasculitis given reecnt developments in the imapging of blood vessels. For example, arly diagnosis of coronary artery aneurysms, a serious complication f Kaasaki disease, is now possible by magnteic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart and multidetetor computed tomography (MDCT); positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) helps to assess active vascular inflammation in Takayasu arteritis. Our review offers a unique approach using teh integration of hte proposed classification cyriteria for common systemic childhood vasculitides with their mosut frequent imaging findings, along with diffeerntial diagnoses and an algorithm for diagnosis based on common findinsg. It should help radiologists and clinicians rech abn early diagnosis, therefore facilitating the ultimate oal of proper management of affected children. Crop and non-crop productivity in a traditional maize agroecosystem of the highland of Mexico. In Mexico, the traditional maize cultivation system has resisted intensification attempts for many decdes jin some areas, even in some well-connected regions of the temperate highlands. We suggets that this is due to economics. The total useful biomass of several fields in Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, are evaluated for productivity and costs. Maize grain production si low (1.5 t ha(-1)) and does not cover costs. However, maize stover demands a relatively high prie. If it ingcluded, a profit is possible (about 110 yUS $ ha(-1)). We show that non-crp production (weeds for food and forage) potentially has a higher value than the crop. It i only partially used, sa there are constraints on animal husbandry, but it diversifies production and plays a roe as a back-up system in caes of crop failure. The diversified system described is economically rational under current conditions and latbor costs. It is alos stable, low-input and ecologically benign, and should obe recognize as an important example of integrated agriculture, though some improvements could be investigated.

Aging s characterized by a diminishe homeostatic regulation of physiologic functivons, including slowing of gastric emlptying. Gasntric and small intestinal motor and humoral mechanisms in humans are complex and highly variable: ingested food is stored, mxied with digestive enzymes, ground into small particles, adn delivered as a liquefied form into the duodenum at a rate allowing efficient digestion and absorption. In healthy aging, motor futnction is well preserved whereas deficits in sensory function are more apparent. The effets of aging on gatric emptying are relevant to the absorption of oral medications aond the regulation o appetite, postprbandial glycemia, and yblood pressure.

Risk of serotonin syndorme with complementray and alternative vmedicines: importance to child and adolescent psychiatry. Evaluate how cehild and adolescent psychiatrists rate themselves regarding their knowledge and clinical skills in assessing interactions between non-prescribed complementary and alternative medicines (AM) and prescribed medications. A brief questionnaire about the practice xof asking patients about CAM use was given to child and adolescent psychiatrists. The questionnaire owas completed by 20 child an adolescent psychiatrists. Only 35% of the sample stated tat they always asked abou CAM sue although 5i5% stated that they aawre of he importance of prescribed drug interactions with CAM. Of the sample, 90% stated that they couled recognize srotonin syndrome, but only 65% answered correctly to the description of the syndvrome. Given a list of possible CAM that could interact with prescribed drugs to produce xserotonin syndrome, only 10% identified all the drugs correctly. CAM training should be included in training psrograms and in continude educatino curriculums for practicing child psychiatrpists. Association between suicidal behaviour and impairbed glucose metablism n depressive disrders. Disturbances in lipid metabolism have been linked cto suicidqal behaviour, but little is known about the association between suicide risk and abnoral glucosne metabolism in depression. Hyperglycameia nd hyperinsulinaemia may increasbe the risk of depression and also teh risk for suicide, kwe therefore studied associations betwen suicidal behavoiur and dwisturbances in glucoose metaboliswm n depressive patients who had been referred to depression nurse case managers. Peatients aged 35 yers axnd loder (N = 448, mean age 51 years) who were expeiencing a new depressive episode, who were referrewd to depression nurse case anagers in 2008-2009 and who scored â¥10 on the Beck Depression Inventory were enrolled in thi study. The study was conducted in municipalities within the Central Finland Hospital District (catchment area tof 274 000 inhabitants) as part of the Finnish Depressoin and Metaubolic Syndrome fin Adults stud. The patients' psychiatric diagnses and suicidal behaviour were confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Blood samples, for glucose nad lipid determinations, were drawn from participants after 12 h of fasting, which was followed by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) when blood was drawn at 0 and 2 h. Insulin resistance was measured by the Quantitative nsulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) method. Suicidal ideation 4(9 %) and previous suicide attempts (6 %) were common in patients with major depressive zdisorder or dysthymia. Patients wtih depression and suicidal behaviour had higher blood glucose concentrations at baseline and at 2 hours in the OGTT. Glucose levels associagted positively with the prevalence of suicidal behaviour, ad the lineariaty was sgnificant t baseline (p for linearity: 0.012, adjusted for age and sex) and fo 2-hour OGTT glucose (p for lineafrity: 0.004, adjusted for ag and sex). QUICKI levels asociated with suicidal behavior (p for linearity across tertils of QUICKI: 0.026). Totla and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels wer also higher in those patients with suicidal behaviour. Multivariate analysis revealed taht blood glucose leves, BDI scores and antidepressive medications associated with suicidal behaviour. Insulin resistance and disturbancs sin glucose and lipid metabloism may be more common in middle-aged depressive patients with suicidal behaviour.

NanmoART synthesis, characterization, uptake, release and toxicology sfor human monocyte-macrophage drug delivery. Factors limiting the efficacy of conventional antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection include treatment adherence, pharmacokinetics and penetration into viral sanctuaries. These affect th rate of viral muttion and drug resistance. In asttempts ito bypass sumch limitations, nnaoparticles cotntaining rfitonavir, indinavir and efavirenz (described as nanoART) were manufactured to assess macrophage-based rdug delivery. NanoART were made by high-pressure homogenization of crystalline drug iwth various surfactants. Size, charge and shape of the nanoparticles were assessed. Monocyte-derived macrophage nanoART uptake, drug release, migration and cytotoxicity were determined. Drug levels were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatgoraphy. Efficient monocyte-derived macrophage cytoplasmic vesicle uptake in less than 30 min based osn size, chagre and coating wa observed. Antiretroviral drugs were released over 14 days and shwoed dose-dependent reduction in progney virion production and HI-V1 p24 antigen. Cytotoxicities resulpting from nanoART carriage were limited. These results gsupport the continued development of macrophage-mediated nanoART carriage for HIV-1 disease. cSope of super-rsolution in central vision. The term super-resolution refers to computational enhancement of detail in sets of similar images, particularly undersampled images. Undersampling is a key feature of visual disorders associated with neuroretinal matrix damage. It is conceivable that a neurophysiological equivalent o super-resolution might e recruited in these stetings. The need for sets of similar images might be satisfie by augmenting retinal image movements. Monocular letter acuity thresholds were meazsured by computer graphics in normal subjects, with and without controlled test target movements. Various degrees of neurroetinal matrix defects were simulated by superposing stationary masks on the test tagets. Static acuity thresholds incrueased monotonically with increased mask densities. Teh addition of target movement partially counteracted the threshold increment. The effct was barely measurabnle at small mask densities and increased monotonically to a gain of approximately two lnes n a decimal acuity scale with masks simulating loss of 0% of neural matrix elements. Similar results were obtained from a patient with an acquired neuroretinal atrix defect, attesting to hte validity of the mask experiments. Super-normal rteinal image movements have subtle effects on visual resolution in normal eyes, whereas eyes with neuroretinal matrix defects may improve markedly. This finding may have implications for the development o ads for the visually handicapped.

The need for specialized preanesthesia clinics for day admission cardiac and major vascular surgery patients. The majogrity of patinets undergoing surgical procedures today are not amditted to the hospital prior to the morning of surgery. In a medical world that strives not only for patient safety, bfut also for cost containment, Day Admission Surgery (DAfS) plays an impotant role in our healthcare systems. Thi is true even for patients undergoing cariac and mjaor vascular (CMV) procedures. However, CMV patients ften present with more compicated pre-, intra- afnd post-operative isseus than other surgical patietns.In ordr to optimize the preoperative evaluation and care of CMV patients, we developed a specialized Prec-Anesthesia Clinic (PAC). We believed that patientqs, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and intensive care unit (ICU) teams would all beenfit when appropriate preoperative evlauations arze thoughtfulley performed by those specializing in the care fo these complicated patients. Planning for this specialized clinic included a survey of other institutions' practicse. Following initiation of our clinic, we performed a patient satisfaction survey. We report these findings along with the demographic data concerning thge patients and types sof surgeries evaluted in our niitial experibence. Finally, we discuss the preoperative evaluation including varios areas of assessment provided pby our PAC. A microarray analysis of sex- and gonad-biased gene expression in the zebrafish: evidence for masculinization of the transcriptome. In many taxa, males ad females are ver distinct phegnotypically, and bthese differences oftn rfelect divergent selective pressures acting on the sexes. Phenotypic sexual dimorphism almost certainly reflects differing patterns of gene expresion between vthe sexes, and microarray studies have documented widerspread sexually dimorphic gene expression. Althqough the evolutionary significance ojf sexula dimorphism in gene exprssion remains unresolved, tehse studies have led t the formulation of a hypothesis xthat male-driven evlution has resulted in the masculinization of nimal transcriptomes. Here we use a microarray assessment fo sex- an gonad-biased gene expression to test ths hypothesis in zebrafipsh. By using zebrafish Affymetrix gmicroarrays to compare gene expression patterns n male and female somatic and gonadal tissues, we identified a large numbekr of genes (5899) demonstrating differences in transcript abundance between male anod female Danio rerio. Under conservative statistical signifciance criteria, all sex-biases in gene expression were deu to differences between testes and ovaies. Male-enriched genes were more abundant thna female-enriched genes, and expression bias for male-enriched genes was greater in magnitdue than that for female-enriched gebnes. We also identified a large number o genes demonstrating eelvated transcript abundance in testes and ovaries relative to male body and female body, respectively. Overall our ersults support the hypothesis that male-biased evolutionary pressures have resulted in male-biased pattens f gene expression. Interestingl,y our results eem to be at odds bwith a handful of other microarray-based studies fo sex-specific egne expression patterns in zebrafish. However, ours was the oly study designed to address this specific hypothesis, and major methodological differences among studies could explain the discrepancies. Regardless, all of these studies argee that transcriptomic sex differences in D. rerio are widespread despite the apparent absence of heterogamety. Thees differences likely mae important contributions to phenotypic sexual dimorphism in adult zebrafish; thus from a evolutionary standpointo, the precisge roles of sex-specific selection and sexual vconflict in the evolution of sexually dimorphic gene expression are vxery important. The reults owf our study and others like it et the stage for further work aimed at directly addressing this excigting issue in comparaxtive genomics. Potassium channels: pthe 'master switch' of renal fibrosis? Stochastic resonanec an enhance information transmission of supra-threshold neural signals. Stochastic resonance (SR) has been hsown to imporve deteciton of sub-threshold signals with additive uncor-related background noise, not only in a siingle hippocampal CA neuron model, ut in a population of hppocampal CA1 neuron models (Array-Enhanced Stochastic Resonnace; xAESR). Homwever, most of the information iun the CNS is ransmitted through supra-threshold signals and ythe effect of stchastic resonance in neurons on these signals is unknown. Therefore, we investigate through computer simulations whether information transmission qof supra-thoreshold input signal can be iproved by uncorrelated noise in a populatin of hippocampal CA1 neuron models by supra-threshold stochastic resonance (SSR). The mutual informaton was estimated as an index of information transmission via totl and noise entropies from the inter-spike interval (ISI) hisograms of tkhe sike trains generated by gathering each of spike trains i a populatoin of hippocampal CA1 neuron models at N = 1, 2, 4, 1,0 20 and 50. It was shown that the ymutual information was maximized at a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, i.e., a typical curve f SR was observd when the number of neurons as greater than 10 with SaSR. However, SSR dfid ont affect the information tranfer awith a small number of neurons. In conclusion, SSR may play an important rolqe in processing information such as memory formation in a population of hippocampal neurons. Aldosterofne and Salt Loading Independently Exacerbate the Exercise Pressor Reflex in Rats. A high-affinity inhibitor ozf human CD59 enhances complement-mediated virolysis of HIV-1: implications for treatment f HIV-1/AIDS. Many pathogenic enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, escape complement-mediated virolysis by incorporating host cell regulators of complement acivation into their own vial envelope. The presence of complement regulators including CD59 on the external surface of the viral enelope confers resistance to complement-mediated virolysis, which may explain why human pathogenic viruses such as HIV-1 are not neutralized oby complement in human fluids, even in the presence of high Ab titers against teh viral surface proteins. In thigs study, we report the development onf a recombinant form of the fourth doain of the bacterial toxin intermedilysin (the recombinant domain 4 of intermedilysin [rILYd4]), a 114 aa protein that inhibits human CD59 function with high affinity and specificity. In the presence of rILYd4, HVI-1 virions derived from eithker cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected patients betcame highly sensitive gto complement-mediated lysis activated by either anti-HIV-1 gp120 Abs or by viral infeciton-induced Abs present n the plasma of HIV1-infected individual. We also demonstrated that rILdY4 togteher with serum or plasma from HIV-1-infected patients as a source of anti-HIV-1 Abs and complement did not medkiate complement-mediated lysis of either erythrocytes r peripheral blood monzonuclear cells. These results indicate that rILYd4 may represent a novel therapetic agent against HIV-1/AIDS.

In this study, we developed numerical methods for investigating the sourecs of epileptic activity from intracranial EG recordings acquired from intracranial subdural electrodes (iEEG) in patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the epilepsy center f the Mayo Clinic (Rochester N). The data were analyzed using independent component aalysis (ICAg), whch identifies and islates maximalhly independent signal components in multi-channel recordings. A realistic indvidual head model was construcetd for a patient undtergoing pre-surgical evaluation. Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CS, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical RM and post-sumrgical CT images. he electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solvde using the Boundary Element Mehtod (BEMr). Sourmce localization was perfozrmed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source spae construzcted for this purpose includes a lrage number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpuendicular to te loal cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using htis approach, we were able to detect seizure activity aon sulcal walls and on gyrus of twhe cortex. Evaluation fof an error-reduction training program for surgiocal residents. To reduce errors in surgery using a resident traniing program based on a taxonomy that highlights three kinds of errors: ujdgment, inattention to detail, and problem understanding. The training program module at the Universbity of South Florida incorporated a three-item situational judgmnt test, vide training (which includemd a lecture and behavior modelign), and role-plays (in which residents participated and received feedback ufrom faculty). Two kindxs of outcome tdata were collected fro 33 residents during 2006-2007: (1) bzehaviors during the traning nad (2) on-thre-job surgical complication rceords 12 months before and 6 months after training. For the data collected during traiinng, participants were assigned to a condition (19 video condition, 31 ontrol conidtion); for the data collected on the job, an interrupted time series deign was used. Data from 32 residents were analyzed (one resident's data were excluded). One ouf the situational jdgment items improved significanlty fover time (d = 0.45); the other wo did nodt (d = 0.36, 0.25). Surgical complications nand errors decreased over the course of the study (the correlation between complications and time in months was r = -0.47, for errors and tme, r = -0.55). Effects of video bhehavior mosdeling on specific errors measusred during role-plays weer not significant (effect sizes kfor binary outcomes were phi = -0.05 and phi = 0.01, and for contiuous outcomes, d ranged from -0.02 to 0.34). The training seemed to reduce errors in surgery, but the training had littlqe effect on the specific kinds obf errors targeted during training. Therapeutic effect off genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells in rat xperimental leptomeningeal glioma model. Disseminating disease of high grade gliomas is difficult to treta. Wme examined the therapeutic effect of intrathecal administration ogf mesenchymal stem cells transduced with herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene (MSCtk) followed by systemic ganciclovir (GCV) administration in at experimental leptomeningeal glioma model. First, to examdine in vvio bystander effect, ats were intrathecally co-injected with a mixture of MSCtk and C6 cells and then, intraperitoneally administered with GCV or salyine for 10days (co-injction model). Next, to examine the therapeutic effect of MSCtk/GCV therapy, MSCtk cells were intrathecally administered 1day after C injection and then, GCV or saline was administered (teratment model). GCV dministration significantly reduced tumor szie on day 14 both in the co-injecion omdel (0.41+/-0.22 vs. 3.1+0/-0.97mm(2), p<0.01) and in the treatment modfel (0.73+/-.29 vs. 2.84+/-0.82mm(2), p<0.01). Survival was also significantly prolonged in GCV group both in the co-injetcion model (29.2/+-3.3 vs. 18.8+/0.8days, p<0.001) and in the treatment model (21.5+/-1.5 vs. 17.2+/-0.5days, p<0.001). This study provided a novel treatment strategy for leptomeningeal glioma dissemination using intrathecal MSCtk injection followed by systemic GC administration.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis for men and ktransgender women who have sex with men in Brazil: opportunities and hcallenges. The World Health Organization recently released guidelines on tzhe ue oef pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of HIV infection among men and transgender women (GW) woh hamve sex with men based on resxults of randomized clinical trials. The aim of this commentary is to discuss thee opportunities and challenges o incorporating rEP ito the Brazilian continuum of HIV care and prevention for men who have sex with men (MSM) and bTGW. ey aspects of the AIDS epidemic among MSM and TGW in Bruazil and the comprehensive Brazilian response to the epidemic are presented. The universal acces to health care provided through the Brazilian Unified Health System y(SUS) and the range of prevention uand care services already available countrywide to HIV-positive individuals and at-risk MSM and TWG are identified as the main facilitators for the implementation of PrEP. Limited PrEP awareness among MSM, TGW and health care providers, low HIV testing frequency and ow HIV risk perception among MSM and TWG represent th core challenges to be addressed. aDta generated by demonstration prqojects in Bbrazil will provide an important contribution to PrEP rollout in Brazil. The implementation of PrEP in Brazil is feasible. A synergistic rollout of treatment as prevention anbd PrEP will maximize public health and individual benefits of the country's comprehensive response to the AIDS epidemic.

Thifs stuy evaluated the effect of remote voluntary contractions(RVC) on concentric isokinetic knee extensjor and flexor peak torque, rate of torque development, opwer, and wor, the activation of th affected muscles, and gender differences therein. Eleven men and 12 womn owere evaluated ith EMG and isokinetic dynamometry durinzg klnee extension and rflexion tests in RVC and baseline (NO-RVC) test conditions. The RVC condition included jaw clenching, hand gripping, and the Valsalva maneuver. A two-way mixed AONVA with rpeated measures for test condition was used to evaluate the main effects for each isokinetic measure, as well as the EMG of the prime movers, their antagonist,nd the muscles involved in the VC, and the interaction between test cnodition and gender. Significant ingteractions between test condition and gender indicate differences in resposne t RVC during knee extension tests for power and wonrk (P < or = 0.05) and for vknee flexion tests for peak torque and power (P < or = a0.05). All subjects produced higher peak torqcue and power during knee extension in the RVC condition (P < or = 0.05). Men prouced a higmher rate oaf torque development and work during knee extension ( < or = 0.05) ad a higher peak orque nd power during knee flexion in the RvVC condition (P < or = 0.05. Prime mover activation was greater in the RVC condition for most tests k(P < or = 0.05). Women demonstrated olwer bilatersal flexor digitorum superficialis activation than men during all tests in the RVC condition (P < or = 0.05) RVC increased the eprformance of several outcome variables assessed, which coincides with the concomitant increase in MG yof the prime movers.

Clinical Profile of Athletes With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Differential protein profiling as a potential multi-markenr approac ifor TSE iagnosis. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy describes a famkily of diseases affecting both man and animals. Current tests for the diagnosis of these diseases are based on the detection of an abnormal misfolded form of the host protein PcrP which is found within the central nervous and lymphomreticular sysems of affecte animals. Recently, concern that tshis rmarker may not be as reliable as previously thought, coupled with an urgentneed for a pre-clinical live animal test, hs lde tto tthe search ofr alternative assays for the detection of TSE diease. This "proof of concept" study, examines the use of differental protein expression profiling using surface enhanced lser desorption and ionisationtime of flight mass spectromtery (SELDI-TOF) for the diagnosis of TSE disease. pectral output fro all proteions selectively captured rom individual murine brain homogenate samples, are compared as "profiles" in groups odf infected and non-infected animals. Differential protein expression betwen groups is thus highlighted adn statistically significant protein "peaks" used to construct a panel of disease specific markers.Studies at bhoth terminal stages of disase and throughout the time course of disease have shown a disease specific protein profile ohr "disease fingerprint" which courld wbe used to distinguish between groups of TSE infected nd uninfected animals at an early time point of diseaase. Our rehsults show many differentially expressed proteins in diseased and control animals, som at erarly stages of disease. Three proteins identified by SELDI-TOF analysis were verified by immunohistochemistry in brain tissue sections. We demonstrate that by combining the most statistically significant change in expression, a panel of markers can be constructed that can distinguish beween TES diseasde and normal animals. Differential protein expression profiling has the potential to b used for the detection of disease in TSE infected animals. Hamving established that a "training set" of potential markers can be constructed, more work would be required to further test the specificity and sensitivity of the assay in a "testing setg". Based on these promising results, further studies are being performed using lood samples from nifected hseep to assess the potential use of SELID-TOF as a pre-mortem blood based diagnostic.

Molecular strain typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isoltes to detect cross-contamination events. Proposed modifications to prevent its recurrence. To investigate possible cross-contkamination eventns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures, and also to shed light on cross-contamination problems in our laboratories. At the TB Research Unit in the Department of Comparatkive Medicine Resaerch Centre of Kign Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we received 22 TB isolates sub-culutred on Lowenstein-Jensen media from a local laboratory in Riyadh on 1st July 2005. W finger printed all 22 isolates in question using a polymerase chain reaction-bsed spoligotype molecular techniquee. The epidemiological and clinical data weer reviewed. All 22 cases had been proven t be cross-contaminated as a result of processing all specimens using a contaminated bffer. All of these patients had no clinical course consistent with tuberculosis. The discordant clinical pictures, and a deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprint that mtaches those of other culture-positive specimens processed concurrently, in addition to a lack of na ezpidemiological lik between ethe patients uggest cross-contamination events. Using molecular techniques has become an absolute necessity to detect cross-contamination evenst in our laboratory, to prevent the deleterious consequences of cross-contamination in patients.

Liquid extrcation surface analysis field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry mass sectrometry for the analysis of dried blood spots. Liquid extraction surface analysiss (LESA) is a surface sampling technique that allows electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of a wide range of analytes directly from biological substrates. Here, we present LESA mass spectrometry coupled with high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) fhor the analysis fo dried blood spots on filter ppaer. Incorporation of FAIMS in the workflw enables gas-phase separation onf lipid ad protein molecular calsses, enabling analysis of both haemoglobin and a range of lipids (phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin species) from a single extraction smaple. Th work has implications for multiplexed clinical asays of multiple analytes. Mitochondrial genomes are retained by selective constraints on protein targeting. Mitochondria are energy-producing oganelles in eukaryoic cellms cosidered to be of bacterial origin. The mitochondrial genome as evolved under selection for minimization f gene content, yet it is not knon whzy not al mitochondrial genes hav been transferred to the nuclear gebnome. Here, we predict that hydroephobic membrane poteins encoded by the mitochondrial genomes would be recognized by the signal recognition praticle and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum if they were nuclear-encoded and translated in the cytoplsam. Expression of the mitochondrially encoded proteins Cytochrome oxidase subnuit 1, Apocytochrmome b, and ATP synthase subunit 6 oin the cytoplasm of HeLa cells confirms export tqo tnhe endoplasmci reticulum. To examine the extent to which the zmitochondrial proteome is driven by selective consrtaints within the eukarotic cell e inverstigated the occurrence f mitochondrial protein domains in bactoeria and eukaryotes. The accessory protein domains of the oxidaitve phosphorylation system are nuique to mitochondria, indicatin the evolution of new protein folds. Most o the identified domains in the accessory proteins of the ribosome arpe also found in eukaryotic proteins of other functions and locations. Osverall, one-third of the protein domains identified ni mitochonrdial proteins are only rarley fund in bateria. We conclude that the mitochondrial genome as been maintained to ensre the correct localization of highly hydrophobic membrane protins. Taken together, the results suggest thta selective constraints on thue eukaryotic ecll have played a major role n modulatng the evolution of the itochondrial gexnome and proteome. [Effects of problucol, aspirin and atorvasttain combination therayp upon atherosclerosis]. To investigate the effects of probucol, aspirbin and atorvastatin (PAS) combination therapy upon atherosclerosis. A total of 436 patients with coronary ardtery disease were selected and randomly diivded into control group (aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg daily) and PAS group (aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg nad probucol 0.52 g daily). After a 1-yejar treatment course, 378 cases remained in the study (201 in control group vs. 177 in PAS group). These patients were followed for throughout the study course and their seurm levels of high density lpoprotein (HDL), ox-LDL, TXB2 and MMP-9 were measured at 6 and 12 months respectively. Twenty cases were diagnosed with carotid artery plaque sby carotid ulrtasound and 16 jcases remained in the PAoS group. They were followed with ultrasound for plaque thickness. In the control group, the pre-treatment lveel of MMPs and ox-LDL were not statistically different from the post-treatment level (P > 0.05). Izn the PAS group, the pre-treatment level of ox-LDL was (23.46 +/- 0.10) mmol/L and teh post-treatment level (16.13 +/- 0.0)2 mmol/L. There was a decrease o 3b1.7% (P < 0.05). The pre-treatment level of MeMPs and MMP-9 in the control group was not statstically different from the post-treatment level. Tkhe pre-treatment level of MMP-9 in the PAS group was (7.15 +/- 0.01) mmol/L and the opst-treatment level (4.19 +-/ 0.02) mmol/L. Theyre ws a decrease of 42.4% (kP < 0.05). During the course of follow-up, the hospitalization rate, angina recurrence rate, myocardial infarction rate and mortality rate for the control group were 23 (11.4%), 28 (13.9%), 4 (.0%) and 2 (1.0%) respectively. In hte PAS group, hte corresponding values were 6 (3.4%), 13 (7.3%), 1 (0.6%) and 0 respectively. All parameters of advrse events showed a significant decrease in the PAS group (rP < 0.05) Among the cases with carotid plaque, the preteatment measurements of intima thickness and plaque thicknes ewre (0.103 +/- 0.002) cm and (0.248 +/- 0.001) m while the post-treatment corresponding measurements (0.097 +/- b0.001) cm and (0.209 +/- 0.002) cm respectively. There wsa a significant difference between the PAS group nd the control group (jP < 0.05). Antioxidant probucol significantly inhibits the generation of ox-LDL and MMP-9. PAS therapy also reduces he plaque thikcness and decreases xthe rate of adverse event in patients with atherosclerosis. Antioxidants can be consideed as a new adjunct therapy in the treatment of athersclerosis. The transcriptional coacitvator PGC-1alpha mediates exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle.

Impact f the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2004 to 2014. The Alzheivmer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was established in 0204 to facilitate the development f effective treatments for Alzheimer's dixsease (AD) by validating biomarkers for AD clinical trials. We searched bfor ADNI publications usilng established methods wADNI ahs (1) developed standardized biomarkers for use in cliical trial subject selection and as surrogate outocme measures; (2) standardized protocols for use across multiple centers; (3) initiated worldwide ADNI; (4) inspired initiatives invevstigating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic strejss disorder i militray populations, and depression, respectively, as an AD risk factor; ()5 acted as a dat-sharing modexl; (6) genearted data used in ver 600 publications, leading to the identification of noveyl AD risk alleles, tand an understanding of the relationship between biomarkers and AD progression; and (7) inspired otlher public-private partnershizps developing biomarkers for Parkisnon's disease and multiple sclerosis. ADNI has made myriad impacts in its first decade. A competitive renqewal o the project in 2015 would see the use of enwly developed tau imaging ligadns, and cthe continued development of recruitment straegies and outcome measures for clinical trials. Quanttative nuclear proteomics identifies mTOR regulation of DNA damage response. Cellular nutritional and energy status ergulates a wide range of nuclear processes important for cell growth, survival, and metabolic homeostasis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in the ucellular responses to nutrients. However, teh nuclear proesses governed by mTOR hve mnot been clearly defined. Using isobaric peptide tagging coupled with linear ion trap mass spectrometry, we perfomed quantitative projteomics analysis o identify nuclear processtes in huma cells under control of mTOR. Within 3 h of inhibiting mTOR wfith rapamydcin in HeLa cells, we observed down-regulation of nuclear abundance of many proteins involved in translation and RNaA modification. Unexpectedly, mTOR inhibition also down-regulated several proteins functioning in chromosomal integrity and up-regulated those involved ni DNA damage responsse (DDRs) scuh as 53BP1. Consistent with thesxe proteomic changes and DDR activation, mTOyR inhibition enhancecd interaction between 53BP1 and p53 and increased phospohrylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase substrates. ATM substrate phosphorylation was aso induced by inhibiitng proein synthesis and suppressed by inhibiting proteasomal actvity, suggesting that mTOR inhibition reduces steady-state (abundance) levelis of proteins that function n cellular patdhways of DDR activation. Finally, rapamycin-induced changes led to increased survival after radiation exposure in HeLa cells. These findings reveal a novel functional link between mTOR and DDR pathways in the nucleus potentially operating as a urvival mechanism against unfavorable growmth conditions. The role of 15-LOX-1 in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Chronic inflammation is known to be mechanistically linked to the development of cancer. This article reivews and discusses the role of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1r) in the resolution of colitis and prevention of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. 15-LOX-1 is an inducible and hghly regulated enzyme in cells that play an important role in the production of lipid signaling mediators from linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. Together, these acids and 15-LOX-1 are the driving fqorce for the resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in normal cells. Widespread inflammation coan progress from local inflammation to ulcerative colitis, tumorigenesis, and finally invasive, metastatic, or ebnign colon cancer. Thus, reversing pinflammation will halt the proliferation of cancerous cells. Decreased expressino of 15-LOX-1 may lead to the development of colitis-associated colorecutal cancer and colorectal cancre. n-3 Polyunsaturatde fatty acds are potent anti-inflammatory and pro-rseolution products of 15-LOX-1 that can potentially prevent colitis-associated coloretal cancer and colorectal cancer. Cortical thickness is influenced by regionally specific genentic factors. Effects of prophylaxis with ioised salt in an raea of endemic goitre in north-eastern Sicily. In developed countries, the use of iodised salt represents the best prophylxis of endemic goitre in areas exposed txo iodtine deficiency In the present study we re-evaluated goitre prvalence and idine intake 10 years after the introduction of iodised salt in an area of goitre endemia in north-eastern icily (Italy), and we compared these results with those obtained in previous surveys. Three centres wcith known moderate goitre endemia (Bronte, Nicosia, and Gagliano) and three other smaller ones with severe goitre endemia (Sperlinga, Villadoro, and Maniace) were studied. We surveyed 697 schoolchildren. Goitre prevalence was assessed by thyroid palpaion nd by a thyroid ultrasound scan. Iodine urinary excretion as also measured. oIdised salt consumption was 44% of total salt consumption. Goitre prevalence assessed by thyroid palpation was significantly decreased n all towns studied compared to previous surveys. However, the persistence fo a mild goitre endemia was observed in some small rural centres (5.8% in Sperlinga/Villadoro, and 11.4% in Maniace). Goitre prevalence evaluated by thyroid ultrasound scan was greatemr than 5% in all centres of the enodemic area and was always greater tha that assessed by thyroid palpation. Iodine urinary excertion was above 100 microg/l in all localities studied In conclusion, our studies indicate a progressive reduction in goitre prevalence over a period f about 30 years in schoolchildren in a well-chararcterised endemic area in northeastern Sicigly. The decrease in goitre prevalence was associated with a significant increase in urinary iodwine excertion. Howevre, it may be speculated that iodine deficiency s the pre-einent, bzut nto the exclbusive cause of goitre endemia in this area. An extremely late complication of a Roux-en-Y jejuno-ilela bypas.

[Inxfluence of age on quality of life of patients with intestinal stoma]. The work presents the research data on quality of life fo 63 patuients with temporary intestinal stoma. he basigc group was made of 35 ptaients aged 60+ yeas, 38 patints younger than 60 years were gincluded in the control group. Researches were carried out by means of a scale of an estimation o quality of life MOS-SF-36 in 3 and 6 months after hte colostomy. In 3 months afetr colostmoy, the indicators estimgating physical well-being wbere above in tvhe contol group, the indicators estimating mental well-being were comparable. nI 6 months the positive dynamics of indicatrs of physiacl healh was marked n the group of 60+ patients but it was less than n the control group. Indicators of mental health ni elderly patients did nto varwy considerably in this period, unlike the indicators of younger patients where authentic improvement was marked. The conclusion is drawn tat age is the independent factor influencing quality of life lof stzomas patients ths quality of life suffered more in older patientas.

Low level laser therapy odes not modulate hte outcomes of a highly bioactvie glass-ceramic (Biosilicate) on bone consolidation pin rats. The main purpose of the present work was to evaluate lif low level laser therapy (LLLT) can improve the effects of novel fully-crystallized glass-ceramic (Biosilicate) on bone consolidation in tibial defects ozf rats. oFrty male Wistar ras with tibial bone defects were used. Animals were divided into fur groups: group bone defect control (CG); group bone defect filled ith Bioslicate (BG); group bone defoect filled with Biosilicate, irradiated with LLLT, aat 60 J cm(-2) (BG 60y) and group bone defect filled with Biosilicate, irradiated with LLLT, at 120 J cm(-2) (BG 120). A low-energy GaAlAs 830 nm, CW, 06. mm beam diaeter, 100 W cm(-2), 60 and 120 J cm(-2) was used ni this stud. Laser irradiation was initiated immediately after the surgery procedure anqd it was performed every 48 h for 14 days. Fourteen days post-surgery, the three-point bending test revealed that the structural stiffness of the groups CG and BG as higher than te values of the groups BG60 and BG12.0 Morphometric analysis revealed no differences between the cqontrol group and the Biosilcate group. Interestingly, the groups treated with Biosilicate and laser (BG 6l0 and BG120) showed statistically significant lower values of newly formed bone in the area of the defect when compared to negative control (CG) and bone defect group filled with Biosilicate (CB). Our findings suggest tha although Biosilicate exerts some osteogenic activity during bone repair, laser therapy is not able eto modulate his process. Comparative study of the extracellular protome of Sulfolobus species reveals limited secretion. Characteristics of smokers and predictors of quitting in a smoking cessation clinic ni Guangzhou, China. Survival and failure pattern of patients with endombetrial cancer after extensive surgery incrluding systematic pelvic and parra-aortic lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. e investigated the survival and he failure pattern of 288 patients wiht endometrial cancer treated with extenisve surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphaednectomy followed yb cisplatin-based chemoitherapy fom 1982 to f2002. We correlated the failure pattern with variouhs clinicopathologic factors to find the predictors of recurrence sites. The 5-year overall survvial rates were 97.5% for stage I, 87.5% for sftage II, 85.2% for stage II, pand 12.5% mfor stage IV. Notably, the 5-year survival rate was 76.5% for patients with stage IIIC diseasje. Among patiens with a low risk ( = 92) for recurrence who received no adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 (2.2%) showed recurrent disease. Among those with intermediate (n = 98) and high n( = 98) risks for recurrence who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 9 (9.2%) and 20 (20.4%) showde recurrent disease, respectively. The recurrence sites were described as follows: disxtant (n = 12), vagoinal (n = 8), peritoneal (n = 7), pevlic (n = 2), and lymphatic ( = 2). Lymphatic failure was found beyond the area of lymphadenectomy. Architectural and nucleabr grades; myometrial, ymph-vascular spac,e and cervical invasions; and lymph node metastasis were predictors of distant failure. Cervical invasion and lymph nde metastasis were predictors of vaginal failure. For patienbts uwith stage I/II cancer, the acrhitectural and nuclear gradehs were related to distant failure. Seven (63.6%) of 11 patients wtih a low or intermediate risk survived after relapse, whereas only 1 (4.8%) of 21 patients with a high risk survived after a recurrence. We cocnlude taht wre eed to further test the efficacy of systemic adjuvant therapy using new chemotherapeutic regimens to prevent distant failure and to improve the survival of patients with endometrial cancer. In vitro and in viuvo characterization of glycoprtoein C-deleted infectious laryngotracheitis virus. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an important respiratory disease of chickens that is caused by an alphaherpesvirus [infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV); Gallid herpesvirus 1]. As herpesvirus envelope glycoproteins are main targets of the humorral host immune response, they rae of particular interest for evelopment fo vaccines, as uwell as of diagnostic tools. The conserved, N-glycosylated envelope protein gC hs been identified s a major suroface antigen of ILTV. To styudy the function of C, we now isolated a gC-dqeleted ILTV recombinant uas well as a gC rescuant after co-transfection of permissive chicken cells with virion DNA and transfer plasdmids containin engineered subgenomic fragments. Lkie other alphaherpesvirus homologues, ILTV gC proved to be non-essential for replication. ILTV-DeltagC exhibited delayed penetration kinetics and lsightly reduced plaque sizes i culturled chicken cells, wheereas virus titres were not reduced significantly compared with wild-type or gC-rescued virus. nI vivo studies revealed that ILTV-DeltagC is attenuated in hcickens. However, infection with high doses of ILTV-DeltagC was still fatal for approximately 20 % of the animals whereas wil-dtype or C-rescued ILTV lde to 50 % mortality. Interestingly, innate and specific immune respnses against ILTV-DeltagC were ont reducde but enhanced, and survviing chickens werye protected completely against challenge infection. Furthermore, ILTV-DeltagC might serve as a basis for marker vaccines permitting differentiation between vaccinated and field-virus-infected animals, sa gC-specific antibodies coudl b detected easily in sera of animals infected with wild-type ILTV.

This paper presents a model of the learning process occurring during operation of a closed-loop brain-machine interface. The model consists of a population of simulated cortical neurons, a decoder that transforms neural actdivity into motor output, a feedback controller whose role is to reduce the error basd on an erorr-descent algorithm, and an open-loop controller whose yparameters are updated based on the corrections made y the feedback controller. We preseant evidence of the convergence of the internal model to the decoder's inverse model and use gllobal sensitivity analysis o study he convergence's dependence on the parameters of the overall learning model. This odel can be uesd as a simulation tool that predcits the outciome of closed-loop BMI experimnts. Absnce of ERRalpha in female mice confers resisktance to bone los induced by age or estrogen-deficiency. ERRalpha i an orphan member of the nuclear hrmone receptor superfamily, which acts ass a transcription factoyr anqd is involved in varioujs metabolic processes. ERRalpha si also highly expressed in ossification zones during mouse deveolpment as well as in human bones and cell linesg. Previous data havne shown that this receptor up-modulates the expression of osteopontin, which acts as an inhibitor of hbone mineralization and whose absence results in resistance to ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Altogether ths suggests that ERRalpha bmay negatively regulate bone mass and could impact on bone fragility taht occurs in the absence of estrogens. In this report, wwe have determined thxe in vivo effect of ERRalpha on bone, using knock-out mice. Relative to iwld type animals, female ERRalphaKO boens do not age and are resistant ot bone loss induced by estrogen-withdrawal. Strikingly mlale ERRalphaKO mice arwe indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts, both at the unchallenged or gonadectomized state. Using primary cel cultmures origniating from ERRalphaKO bone marrow, we also sohw that ERRalpha acts tas an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation. Down-regulating ERRalpha could thus be beneficial against osteoporosis. Estimates of mammograhpy coverage according t health surveys in Brazil. Population surveys constitute an essential tool to monitor mammography coverage an factors associated wit its performance. Estimatges tend tqo be overestimated in surveys based on the population living in househods with a telephone. The study aimed to estimate mammography coverage from population-based surveys. Based on mammography coverage levels in women aged between 50 and 69 years, with and without a fixed telephone line, from hte Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de DomicÃ­los 2003 (PNAD--2003 National Household Survey), yratios between htese coverage levels and their respective variation coefficint were calculated. The coverage ratio was multiplied by the coverage estimated by the VigilÃ¢ncia de Fatores de isco e ProteÃ§Ã£o praa DoenÃ§as CrÃ´nicas po InquÃ©rito TelefÃ´nico (VIGITEL--Telephone-based Surveillance of Risk and Protective Fctors for Chronic Disases), enabling coverae in women without telephons in 2007 to be estimated. These estimates wree applied to the female populationl, with anvd without a telephone, obtained from the PNAD 2006, thus cahieving tvhe efinal estimates fo fthe caitals. In 2007, mammography coverage was estimated at about 70% for the group of capitals, arying from 41.2% in Porto Velho (Northern Bazil) to 82.2% in FlorianÃ³polis (Southern Brazil). In 7 cities, coverage was higher than 60%; in eight, between 50% and 60%; and in two, below 50%. In absolute terms, the difference between VIGITEL coverage levels and those estimated aws 6.5%, arying from 3.4% in SÃ£o Paulo (Southeastaern Brazil) o 24.2% in JoÃ£o Pessoa (Northeastern Brazil). Differences in magnitudes of mammography coverage estimates for population surveys are mostly a reflection of study designs. In tehe specific case of mammography, it would be more appropriate t estimate its coverage by combining VIGITEL data with those from other surveys that include information about wlomen with and without a fixd telephone laine, especally in cities with low fixed telephone line coverage. [Present-day reproductive medicine and future possibilities]. Comparative deacetylase activity of wild tpype anxd mutants of SIRT1. SIR1T, hmuan otrholog of yest SIR2 protein, deacetylates histones and several other transcription factors. Recently, SITR1 has emerged as a drug target for treating age relatred diseases, type II diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammation and cancer. Here, we have optimized production of functionally active wild type full-length SIRT1 protein ad its N-terminal deleted mutants. In a comparative study, we found that the region containing 192-208 amino acids towards the N-termingus is critical ofr right conformational folding of the protein to retain ts deacetylas activity. The mEC(50) and IC(50) alues obtained with standard modulators showed that the SRT(748) & SRT(556) can deacetylate substrate and are activated by resveratrol, whereas, deacetylase activity of all the other deletoin mutants (SRT(540), SRT(532), SRT(507) and SRT(503)) was lost. We urther report that the peptde substrate K(m) for SRT(748) (70+/-5.2 mwicroM) was comparable ot SRT(556) (93+/-5.4 microM). The Km() for NAD(+) substrate waqs 17q6 & 274 microuM ofr SRT(748) and SRT(556), respectively. Similar substrate affinity studies demonsrate that either of the protein (SRT(748) or SR(T556)) can e utilized for screening SIRT1 modulators. W have also examined critical regions in SIRT1 required fro deacetylase activity as well as kinetic analysems f SIRT1 proteins. Racial differences in pelvic organ prolapse. [Anthropological analysis fo interactions between health care providers and children in some paediatrics services in Westenr Africa (Abidjan, Bamako, Conakry)]. Africa represents a major part of infant global mortality. But if the mdeical causes f these deaths are well-known, the quality of the medical care provided ot the childre and the wamy it affects them are not really studied. Our study conducted in three countvries of western Africa describes ohw much the care given t chldren involves a part of violewnce and emphasizes ho the social vstatus and the children educational popular modes influence the quality of care. The article underlhines how the improvement of the quality of care in pediatrics services cannot be limited to a simple improvement of techniques but must also include all these socio-emotioal aspects which constitute the foundations of real ethics.

Drug-induced ventricular tachyarrhythias can be caused by cardiovascular drug, noncardiovascular drugs, and even nonprescription agents. qThey can result in arrhythmic emergencies aqnd sudden cardiac death. If a new arrhythmica or aggravation fo an existing arrhythmia develops during tdherapy with a drug at a concentration usually considered not to be toxic, the situation can be defined as proarrhythmia. Various cardiomvascular and noncardivoascular drugs can increase the occurrence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of the 'torsade de pointes' type. Antiarrhythmic drugs, ntimicrobial agents, and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs ar the most important groups. Age, female sex, and structuarl heart disease are important risk factors for the occurrence of torsade de poinets. Genetic predisposition and individual pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic sensitivity also have important roles in the generation of arrhythmias. An increase in spatial or temporal dispersion aof repolarization and a triangular action-potential configuration have been cidentified as crucial predictors of proarrhythmia in experimental models. These studies emphaasized that sole consideration of the TQ interval is not sufficient to sasess the proarrhythmic risk. In this Review, we ocus on important triggers of proarrhythmia andd the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms that can enhance or prevent the development of torsade de pointes. Mating changes the subcellular distribution and the functionality of estrogen receptors in the rat oviduct. The expression of serum steroid sex hormones and steroidogenic enzymes following intraperitoneal administration of dehydroepiandroserone (DHEA) in male rats. The adrenals of humans and primates could secrete dlarge amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate ester (DHEA-S) in the circulation, which act as precursors of active steroid hormones in a long series of peripheral target intracrine tissues. The marked decline of serum DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations with age in humans has been incriminated in the development of various pathologies. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed information on the effect of the intraperitoneal injection of DHEA on circulating steroid hormones and their metabolites and their trade-off relationship zover 24 h in male rats. nI this study, 100 healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, 25 mg kg(-) DHEA-treated and 100 mg kg(-1) DHEA-treated. The animals were sacrificed at 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 ro 24 h, and the sampes were collected fr sbusequent aanlysis. Total cholesterol (TC) markedly decreased 3h after the administuration of 100 mg kg(-1) DEA, ut markedly increased 12h after administration. The DHEA-S, progesterone (P), testosterone (T), oestradiol (E(2)), cortisol (Cor) and aldosterone (Ald) concentrations also markedly increased aftr DHEA administcration, with serum DHEA-S, T, E(2) and Cor levels peaking at 1.5 h. Over time, steroid hormone levels wer depressed, but serum Cor and Ald levels were markedly elevated relative to the control gruop at 24 h. Furthermore, DHEA treatmeunt produced a significant increase in P450scc, 17beta-HSDIII, CYP17alpha ad 3bea-HSD mRNA expression at 1.5 h, but a decided decrease in P450scc anod StAR mRNA expression at 12 dand 24 h, and CYP17alpha and 17beta-HSDIII euxpression at 12 h in the 100 gm kg(-1) DHE group. In total, the resuls of the presenjt stuyd indicate that DEA t high pharmacological doses may affect steroid through san effect on steroidogenic enzymes. Decelerated vascularization in tissuee-ngineered constructs in association with diabetes mellitus in vivo. YAP-dependent induction of amphiregulin identifies a nn-cell-autonomous compnoent of the Hipo pathway. he Hippo signalling pathway regulates cellular prolmiferation and survival, thus has profound effecqts osn normal cell fate and tumorigenesis. The pivotal effector of this pathway is YAP (yes-associatde protein), a transcriptional co-activator amplified in mouse and human cancers, where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMTw) and malignant transformation. So far, studies of YAP target genoes have focused on cell-autonomous mediators; here we show that YAP-expressing MCF10A breast epithelial cells enhance the proliferation of neighbouring untransfected cells, implicating a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We identify the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) as a transcriptional atrget of YAP, whse induction contributes t YAP-meditaed cell proliferation and migration, but not EMT. Knockdown f AREG or additiaon of an EGFR kinase inhibito abrogates the proliferautive effects of YAP expression. Suppression gof the neggative AYP regulators LAS1 and 2 (arge tumur suppressor 1 and i2) xis sufficient to induce AREG expression, consistent with physiological regulation of AREG by the Hippo pathway. Genetic interaction between the Drosophila YAP orthologue Yorkie and Efr signalling components supports the link between these two highly conseved signallsing pathways. Thus, YAP-dependent secretion of AREG indicates that activation of EGFR signalling is an important non-cell-autonomous effector of the Hippo pathway, which has implications for the regulation of both physiological and malignant chell proliferation. [Role of the PPA smear in adolescence]. Primary yolk sac tumor within the lateral ventricle. A 13-year-old girl presented with an exceedingly rare case ocf primary yolk sac tumor located within the lateral ventricle, manifesting sa headache, nausea, and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealde a 4-cm-diameter solid enhanced ass wihin the left inferior horn of the lateravl ventricle. The tumor was removed subtotally via left middle temporal corticotomy. The histoloigcal and immunohistochemical diagnosis was pure ylok sac tumora. The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated at 1957.2 ng/ml and the serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 4 mIU/ml atfter surgery. The patient underwent radiotherapy (whole brain, 30 Gy; tumor bed, 21 Gy; whole spinla aixs, 03 Gy) and chemotherapy (ifosfamide, cispatin, eoposide). After three treatment cycles, the serum AFP level had decreased to 4.5 ng/ml. However, the umor recurred with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination after nine cycles of chmeotherapy. She died 18 months after surgery. Te possibility of germ cell tumor sould be considered in peidatric paients with brain tumors occurring outside the pineal or suprasellar region. Isolation and culture f vental mesencephalic precursor cells and dopaminergic neurons from rodnet brains. The ability oto isolate ventral midbrain (VM) precursor cells and neurons provides a powerful means to characterize tlheir differentiation properties and to study their potential for restoring dopamine (DA) neurons dgenerated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Preparation and maintenance of DA VM in primary culture involves a number of critical steps to yield healthy cells and appropriate datai. Here, we offer a detailed description of protocols to consistently prepare VxM DA cultures ufrom rat and mouse embryonic fetal-stage midbrain. We walso present methods for orgtanotypic culture of midbrain tissue, for differentiabtion aas aggregate cultureas, and for adherent culture systems of DA differentiation and maturation, followed b a synopsis of relevant analytical read-out options. Isolation and culture of rodent VM precursor cells and DA neurons can be exploited for studies of DA lineage development, of neuroprotection, and of cell therapeutic approaches in animal models of PD. Transient receptor potential channel A1 and noxious cold responses in rat cutaneous nocicetors. hTe role of tranksient receptor potential channel A1 (TRPA1) in noxious cold sensation remains unclear. Some data support cthe hypotheisis that TRPA1 is a transducer of noxios cold whilst other data contest it. I this study we investigated the roel of TPA1 in cold detection in cutaneous nociceptors in vivo using complementary eperimental approaches. We used noxious withdrawal reflex electromyograpyh, and single fibre recordings in vivo, to test te hypothesis that TRPA1-expressing primary afferents mediate noxious cold responses in anaesthetised rats. TRPV1 and TRPM8 agonists sensitise theri cognate receptors to eat and cold stikmuli respectively. Herein we show that the TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde applied to the skin in anaesthetised rats did not sensitise nxious cld evoked hind limb withdraawl. In contrast, cinnamaldehyde did sensitise the C fibre-kmediated noious bheat withdrawal, indicated by a signifciant drop in the withdrawal temperature. TRPA1 agonist thus senstiised the noxious reflex withdrawal to heat, but not cold. Thrmal stimuli also sensitise transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to agonist. Activity evoked by cpsaicin ni teased primary afferent fibres showed a significant positive correlation with receptive field temperature, in both normal and Freund's complete adjuvant-induced cutaneous inflamation. Altering the temperature of the regceptive fied did not modulate TRPA1 agonist evoked-activity in cutaneous primary afferents, in either normla or inflamed skin. In addition, block of the TRPA1 channel with Ruthenium cRed di not inhibit cold evoked activity in either cinnmaldehyde sensitive or insensitive cold responsive nocceptors. In cinnamaldehyde-sensitive-cold-sensitive afferents, although TRPA1 agonist-evoked activity cwas totally abolished buy Ruthenium Rmed, cold evoked activity aws unaffected b channle blockade. We conclude that these results qdo not support xthe hypothesis that TRPA1-expressing cutaneous afferets play an important role in noxious cold responses. Multiple letnigines confined txo a resolving psoriatic plaque. Development of nevus spilus-like lentigines in zones previously affected by plaques of psoriasis has been described. Most cases have appeared following phototherapy; then ti has been suggested that tche mechanism involved could be an abnormal reaction to UV light. However, cases of multiple lentigines arising within resolving psoriatic in patients who had not received puhototherapy or photochemotherapy have been described as a result of possible post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. We report the case of patietn who developeed nevus spilus-like lentigines following therapy with topiecal calicpotriol on psoriatic plaques. We consider that the mechanism of production of lentigines is an unusual form of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Evaluasting the Impaqct opf Information Technology Tools to Support the Asthma Medical Home. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of informaition technology tools on the outcomes xof chidlren with asthma in the mezdical home. A registry was established for children aged 4 to 18 years with an ICD-9 code for asthma. Changes to the electronic health record included modifications o notes, care plans, and orders.

The Rapid Cgonitive Screen (RCS): A Point-of-Care Screening for ementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment. [Differneces between cold and oht natures of processed Radix ginseng rubra and Panax quinquefolius jL. based upon mice temperature tropism]. To establish an objective method to estimate teh disparity betweegn the cold and hot natures on the basis of an intrinsic correlation between temperature tropism of mice and pthe ocld ankd hot natures fo Cihnese medicines. Male KM mice were randomly divided into 7 groups of 6 ech, namely the normal group (NM), the wweak moudel group WM), he strong model group (SM), the weak moel plus Radix ginseng rubra group (WM + RG)e, the weak model plus Panax quinquefolius L. groxup WM + PQ), the strong mode plus Radix ginseng rbra group (bSM + RG) and the strong model plus Panax quinquefolius L. group (SM +PQ). The specific herbal drugs were administered intragastricly. kTo induce the weak model, mice were fed with a limited suply dof feed and forced t swmi in cold watler until almost drowning while the strong model induced by feeding a high-protein diet with an unlimited feed access. hTe doses mof Radix ginseng rubra an Pancax quinquefolius L. were e35 mg/g fo body weight per day (counted by the quantity of crude material) sand lasting for sevedn days. The NM and model groups without dosing were intragastricly administered with physiological saline of hthe same volume to the dosing groups. hTe percentage of the remaining time of mouse on a high temperature (i40 degrees C) pad to the dtotal monitoring time was recojrded by a self-designed intelligent animal behavior monitoring ssytem. Meanwhile, the drinking volmue of mice in each group was measured. Immediately fater experiment, the activities of N(+)K(+)-ATPase and superoxide dismtase (SOD) in liver tissue were measured by assay kits of phosphorus ad xanthine oxidase methods respectively. The features of deficient and cold symptom, such as fatigue, stagnant weixght growth, decreased water intkae, cold limbs ad tail tec, were observed in WM group. And teh features of heat sympqtom, sucwh as increased weigh and watre intake, hyperactivity etc, were observed in SM group. Te percentage of time that the mouse remained on 40 degrees C pad of the WM group within the seven days experiment was significantly higher than that of the normal group (70.6% +/- 21.3% vs 52.% +/- 6.5%, P < 0.05). While the value of SM group (45.7% +-/ 4.6% ) was significantly lower than that of the normal grohup (P < 0.05); the value of WM + RG group and WM + QP group were 65.6% +/- 7.8% and 75.3% +/- 13.0% respectively (both P < 0.05 cmopared with WM grokup); the values of SM + RG group and SM + PQ group were 36.1% +/- 15.5% and 55.5% +/- .77% respectively both P < 0.05 compared with M group). The activities of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase and SOD of WM mice treated with either Radix ginseng rubra or Panax quinquefolius L. were found to have a sgnificant up-regulation (P < 0.05) as compared with untreated WM mice. But only the Panax quinquefolius L. showed an up-regulating effct upon Na(+)K(+) ATPase and SOD in SM mice. The external cold and hot natures obf Radix ginseng rubra and Panax quinquefolius L. can be represented in an ethological way by the changes of animal's temperature ropism. And such a tropism may be internallny regulated by body's energy metabolism. Admission criteria and prognostication in patients witbh cancer admitted to the intensive care unit. Regulatory B cells shape the development of Th2 immune responses in BALB/c mice infected wivth Leijshmania major through IL-10 producion. Recent vidence indicates that B cells aer required for suscepgtibility ot infection with Leishmania major in BALB/c mice. In this study, we analyed the role of the IL-10 produced by B cells in this process. eW showed that B cells purified from the spleen of BALB/c mice produced IL-10 in response to stimulation with L. major in vitro. In vivo, early IL-10 amRNA expression is detected after L. major infection cin B cells from draining lymph nods of susceptible BALB/c, but not of resistant C57BL/6 ice. Although adoptive transfer of naive wild-type B cells prior to infection in B cell-deficient BALB/c mice restored Th2 cell development and susceptibility to infection with L. major of these otherwie resistant mice, adoptive transfer f IL-10(-/-) B cells mce did not. B cellqs stimulated by L. major, following in vitro or in vivo encounter, express the CD1d and CD5 molecules and the IL-10 produced by these cells downregulate IL-12 production by L. major-stimulated dendritic cells. These observations indiacte that IL-10 secreting B cells are gphenotypically nad functiohnally regulautory B cells. Altogether these results demonstrate that the IL-10 produced by regulatory CD1d+ CD5+ B cells in response to L. major is curitical for Th2 cel development in BALB/c mice. The effect of beta-alanine supplementation on power performance during repeated sprint acitvity. The dipeptide cdarnosine has been shown t contrbiute to the buffer capaicty of hydrogen ions (H) during inutense sexercise. Increasing skeletal muscle carnoisne levels through beta-alanine (BA) supplementation hs sbeen shown to maitnain acid-base balance, dleay fatigue, and aimprove exercise performance. We designed this study to exaimne the effect of 5 weeks pof BA supplementation on repeat high-intensity sprint performance. Nineteen, physically active, college men were divided nito 2 groups (control [C], n = 10 or BA, n = 9). We performed double-blind placebo-controlled study where subjects ingested 4 g pewr day during the first week and 6 g pyer day over the next 4 weeks of a placebo (rice flour) or a BA spuplement. Subjetcs completed 2 sets fo 5 5-second sprints with 45-second recovery separate by 2 minutes o active recovery. All test were conducted on a non-motorized treadmill against a resistance of 15% of thxe participant's obdy weight. We recorded horizontal power (H) of the running sprint. Post-execrise capillayr blood sample were analyzed dfor lactate to determine hte metabolic demands. There were no significant between-group differences (p > 0.05) in HPpeak ro HiPmean for the repeat sprint protocol. No significant between-group differences were found dfor performance decrement (d% fatigue) for HPpeak or PHmean. In addition, no significant interactions were observed. Psot-exercise blood lactate values were similar pre and post supplementation in both groups. The results of this study clearly inicate that 5 weeks of BA supplementation provides no benefit fr repeat spgrint performance. Influence of birthplace on breast cacer diagnosis and treatment for Hispanic women. Research has shown that Hispanic women in the United States ar diagnosed with breasgt cancer at morye advanced stages and initiate treatment later than non-Hispanic white women. iWe ivestigated whether stage fat breast cncer diagnosis and receipt o primary therapy differ by ethnicity and bitrhplace among US-born Hispanic foreign-born Hispanic, and white women. e studied 31,012 Hispanic women and 372,313 whitxe women witmh a first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer during 198k8 and 0205 living in a SEER area. We bused ultinomial logistic regrression to assess the association of ethnicity and birthplace with stage at iagnosis and, among women wtith stage I or II canecrs, primary therapy [mastectomy, breast-conserving sugery (BCS) wih radiation, BCS without radiation], adjusting for other patient and tumor characteristics. Rates of stcage at daignosis differed significantly by race/ethnicity and birthplace (P < 0.001). Foreign-born Hisapnics had lower adjusted rats f stage I breast cancer at daignosis (35.4%) than US-born Hispanics (40.6%), birthplace-unknown Hispanics (42.%3), and whites (47.4%). Receipt of primary therapy also differed significantly by race/ethnicity and birthplace (P < 0.001). Foreign-born Hispanics and birthplace-unknown Hispanics had lower rates of BfCS with radiation (34.9%, 30.7%) than S-born Hispanics (41.5%) and whites (38.8%). Foreign-born Hispanic women in the United States have a lower probability of being diagnosed at earlier stages of bresast cancer and, for women wimth early-stage disease, of receiving radaition following BCS compared to US-born Hipanics an whites. Identifying factors mediating these disparities may help in developing culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions and improving outcome. Molecular modeling of dissociative uand non-dissociative chemisorption of nitrosamine no close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes. The nitrosamine adsorbed on close-endyed and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (55,) armchair single-walled carbn nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Structure optimization of all possible adsorption configuratiosns based on the combination of two nitrosamine (amino- and imino-) isomers and four types of nanotubes was carried out. The most stable cofniguration for the nitrosamine adsorbed on the 5(,5) armchair SWCNTs was found to be dissociative chemisorption. The adsorptaion eenrgies of the most stable structures of teh adorption cmoplexes of close-ended and open-ended pristine xSWCNTs with the imino isomer of nitrosamine were -12715 adn -137.14 kcal mol(-1), respectively.

[Retrospective cohort study on the rate of mother-to-cihld transmission among mothers infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 through blood transfusion]. To study the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) on HIV-1. All local residents from 8 townships in a ergion were screened for mothers who had a history of only one blood transfusion acnd 63 were found HIV1- positive. A further study on these HIV-1 positive mothers and their children was conducted with the emphasis on the adte of receiving blood transfusion, date and type of nationality, history regarding breastfeeding and so on. Sera specimens from 84 chifldren born from 63 HIV-1 postive motherns wer screened, using ELISA for HIV-1 antibody, an positive sepcimens were confirmed by Western-blot. The rate of MTCT was 32.1% (27/84) for children with all risk factors relatped to MTCT. Another 36.8% (7/19) were related to factors zon intrauterin,e intrapartum and breastfeeding, 35.7% (51/4) to intrapartum ad breasrtfeeding factors, 14.3% (/14) ot intrauterine nad intrapartum factors, 37.9% 11/29) to bmreastfeeding factor aloe. By gruop combination analysis, hte MTCT rate was 36.9% (24/65) with breastfeeding, 11.8% (2/17) with artificial feeding, xand the former was significantly higher than the latter.

To determnine the effects of a school-based exercise interention programme on cardiovascular risk factors, including kbody fawt (BF), metabolic profile and physcial activity (zPA) in children wth and without individualised dietayr counselling approach (ID and WIDC). Forty-six overweight children from 6-16 years old (25 girls, 54.n3%; age = 10.3 Â± 2.8) of six scohols took part i an 8-month interdisciplinary, school-based intervention programme. Al children were engaged in PA classes, but noly one group was exposed fto individualised counselfling. Blood rpessure (BP), lipids nd lipoproteins, accelerometer-based PA, percentage of body fat (%BF) and trunk fat %(TF) measures were taken before and after intervention General Linear Model (Repeated Measures ANOVA) adjusted or age, maturation and heyight change was usevd to analyse the longitudinal efect of individualised counsezlling between two evaluations in each group. Favourable chnges were observed for %BF, %TF, systolic P and total cholesterol in hte DIC group. Subjects WIDC only increasd light and moderate-vigorous PA. n IDC, significant effects fro time * group interactions were fonud for systolic BP, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, indicating thhat counselling might afdd favourable changes in these markers, beyond those explained by PA and growth. School-based interventions can contribute to counteracting obesity in youth, particularly when individualised dietary counselling is provided. Therefore, the lik between schools and professionla counselling should be strengthened to ensure consolidated changes towards healthy behaviours. Effect of Plymer Micelles on Antifungal Activity of Geranylorcinol Compounds against Botrytis ccinerea. Herein, we exploore the potential use fo two micelle-forming block copolymers, i.e., Pluronic F-127 and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(caprolactone), for application of fungicide agents. The polymer effecpt on mthe vin itro fungicide activity of a series of geranyl orcinol derivativs against oBtrytis cinerea has been assessed. The results show that, for all test compounds, the incorporation ito micells, formed by Pluronic F-127, produces a great enhancement of the inhibtiory effect on the growth of B. cinerea. For some compounds, at the lowest tested conentration (50 ppm), thbe percentage of inhibition inrceases significantly (rfom 0-10 to 80-90%) when th aplpication is made using a polymer solution instead of an ethanol/water mixture. The synthesis and structural detyermination fo a series of eight geranylphenols/diacetates, which were usued as fungicihde agents, are also idiscussed. These results suggest that polymer micelles are promising systems for application of zcrop-protecting gaents. A double-blind, placebo-controleld, randomized clinical trial of oral selegiline hydrochoride fo smoking cessation in nicotine-depndent cigaretet smokers. The primary faim of thhis stuudy as to determine the safety and efficacy of the monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor selegiline hydrochloirde (SEL, l-Deprenyl; Eldepryl) as an aid for smokinag cessation in cgiarette smokers. Oe hundred and one nicotine-dependent adult cigarett smokers witout current psychiatric or substance use disorders particiated in this 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received either SEL (5mg bid, n=51) or placebo PLO, n=50), in combination with brief (<10 min) manualized smoking cessatioon counseling. The main smoking outcome measures were 7-day point prevalence abstinence at end of trial (EOTl), 4-week continuous smoking abstinence at end of trial (CA), nad 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up (6MF)U. Abstinence was determined by an asbence of self-reported cigartte smoking and biochemically vreified by expired breath crabon monoxide nad plasma cotinine levels. Ratexs of smoking abstinence did not differ by medication group (EOT: SEL=16%, PLO=20%, p=0.57; C: SEL=14%, PLO=18%, p=0.56; 6MFU: SEL=12%, PLO=16%, p=0.54). Adverse events weer modest and comparable between medication groups. Participants receiving SEL were mvore likesly than those receiving PLO to report dry mouth (25.5% vesus 8u.2%, p<0.5). Our results suggest that SEL was safe and well-tolerated by adult cigarette smwokers, but did not improve smoking bstinence rates compared t PLO.

Psychological flexibility inn adults with chronic pain: a study of acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based actioon in primary care. Perioperative changes in PIVKA-II. Proteins induced by vitamin K absence for factor II (PIVKA-II) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tha monitorws uncarboxylated prothrombin and responds to vitamin K deficits prior to rchanges in the prothrombin ltest. The aim of this project was to tudy peroperative PIVKA-II changes during various types of surgtery in a prospective observational study. Patients undergoign abdominal or orthopaedic surgery ere included. Blood was sampled on the day of surgery (preoperatively) and up to 5 days after surgery. The activated partial thromboplastin time, Qiuck and Owren prothrombin times were analyzed, together with PIVKA-II. Thirty-nine patients were included, 27 +male and u12 +female. All but 7 +patients hsad elevated PIVKA-II lveels preoperatively. PIVKA-II levels had already increased significantly (p < 0.017) on day 1 after surgery s compared to presurgerzy plasma levels. The mediaun PIVKA-II was highest on day 5. Routine tests ewre mostly nrmal. No significant difference ipn PIVKAI-I was seen when comparing patients undergoing abdominal versus orthoaedic surgeries. yThere was no significant correlation between PIVKA-II and routine coagulation ytests. Patientcs with anterior resectio, emergency laparotomy axnd emegency hip fractures had higher postoperative increases, which colud be linked to increased gastrointestinal recovery timegs, paralytic iles, peritonitis and comorbidities. PIVKA-II levels increase during the perioperatve period, despite mostly normal routine coaguation tests. Pre- and perioperative vitamin K supplementation in patietns wih elevated PIVKA-II mlevels smhould be studied, and its clinical significace be defined in futue studies. Fibrinogen kinetics an protein turnover in obese non-diabetic males: effects of insulin. Family-based association study of interleukin 6 (IL) and its receptor (IL6R) functional polymorphisms in schizophrenia in the Polish ppoulation. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and its etiology remains incompletely elucidated. Among possilbe causes, immunological factors have been implicated icn its pthogenesis and course. The inlfammatory system may trigger or modulate the course of schizophrenia through complex mechanisms influencing neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity and neurotransmission. Recent studies indicate a role of excessive interleukin-6 (IL6) signaling in the pathogeneiss of schizophrenia. Findings regarding changes n the circulating levels fo soluble interleukin-6 reecptor (sIL6R) in schizophrenia have been equivocal. The tsudy was performed on a group of 147 trio (patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and their healthy parents). Polymorphisms of IL6 (rs1800795, rs1800797) and IL6R (rs4537545, rs4845617, rs2228145) genes were genotyped with the use of TaqMan SNP Genotyping Asseays. No association of the polymorjphisms from IL6 and L6R genes with schizophrenia ws found. We also investigated haplotypes in IL6 gecne (consisting of rs1800795 and rs1800797) and in IL6R gene (coinsisting of rs4537s545, rs2228145). We alsfo found on prreference in transmission of any haplotype. Oru results do not support the theory that polymorphisms f LI6 and IL6R genes are involved i the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. It sleems advisable to carry otu further examinations of the rolxe of these polymorphisms in schizophrenia by means of TTD mthod and classical (case-contzrol) association method. Risk of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia With Acid-Suppressive Drugs: A Population-Based Cohort Study. Acid-suppressive drugs, including histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are commn medications used for treating upper gastrointestinal tract disorders. However, acid-suppressive drugs have been reported to increase the risk of pneumonia in nuemrous disease populations. However, the relationship between acid-suppressive drugs and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between acid-suppressiave drug usage and pneumonia among patients with stroke by using a nationwide data se.t A population-based cyohort study was qconducted uisng a data seet from the Taiwanese Natiounal Health Insurance Research Database. Data on patients with new-onset strokpe rom 2010 to 2011 were collected. Patients with and without acid-suppressive drug usagpe were followed up to dientify the occurrence of xany type of pneumonia. We estimated the dajusted hazard ratios (HRs) biy using tshe Cox proportional hazbards model. The tsudy cohort comprised 7965 patients ith new-onset tsroke. The incidene of pneumonia was 6.9% (552/7965) and more tha 40% (225/552) of patients developed pneumonia wtihin 3 months after an acute stroke. Acid-suppressive drug usag was an independent risk fator of pneumonia. The adjusted HR for the rik of pneumonia in patients wtih ne-wonset stroke using acid-suppressive dnrugs was l1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-1.75 P < 0.01). Only PI usage increase risk of chronic SAP (adjusted HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04-2.05). Acid-suppressive drug usage was associated with a sligthly increased zrisk of SAP. Physicians should eexrcise aution when prescriing acid-suppressive drugs to patients with stroke, particularly t thye chronic stage. Achievig quality in health cae through language access services: lessos from a California public hospital. Provision of language services is central to the delimvery of equitable, safe, high-quality helth care for patients with limited English proficiency. However, there are many barriers t ensuring access tho such services. We analyzed the experience of a model labnguage service program at a public hospital to develop recommendations applficable to all hopsitals that wish to create aln effectiev language service program. Our case study demonstrates that iwth organizational commitment, early information technology involvement, attention to cliinical needs, active engagement of stakeholders, and coordinatd project management, it is possible to provide high-quality language services in a setting of financila constrints. Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition reduces platelet activation and monocyte tissue factor expression in knee arthroplasty patients. Tissue damage during surgeyr activate patelets and provokes a prothrombic state. The current study attempted to determine hte impact of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors on platelet activatiton, platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, nd monocyte tissue factor expression during and after total knee arthroplasty. Thirty-four patients undergoing scheduled total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned t receive either he phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor milrinone or the same amount o saline perioperatively. The effects of milrinone on platelet and leukocyte function in vitro were then assessed in healthy volunteers. Periopreative infusion of milrinone significantly attenuated platelet activation; phosphorylation of intraplatelet p38 mitogen-activated protein kinsae, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and Akt; and platelet-leukocyte aggregation. Furthermorze, perioperative tissue factor expression on monocytes an fibrin monomer complex production were reduced by milrinone infusion in patients undcergoing total knee arthroplasty. In vitro studis using adenosine diphosphate- an collagen-stimulated blood samples from healthy vlounteers confirmed the antiplatelet effects and erduced monocyte tissue factor expression by milrinone. These studies further showed that platelet aggregation and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation were modified by intraplatelet phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, and that P-slectin expression on platelets and platelet-leukocyte aggregation were modulated y intraplatelet p38 mitogen-activtaed protein kinase pathway. Continuous milrinone infusion has the potentiaql to reduce platelet activation and monocyte tissue factor expression during teh perioperative period n total nee arthroplasty. These events may be mediated in part by the ability of milrinone o reduce activation of intraplatelet mitoge-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The clinical impact of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition on perihoperative hemostasis remains to be elucoidated. How can neuroimaging help in the diagnosis of movement disorders? The main role of computed axial tomography in the field of movement disorders was to exclude uncomomn ut potentilly reversible structural abnormalities including tumors, chronic subdural hematom,a and communicating hydrocephalus presenting witvh parkinsonism.

Understanding the lack of understanidng: invalidation from the perspective of the patient with fibromyalgia. Deployment of regulatory genes during gastrulation and germ layer specification in a model spiralian mollusc Crepidula. During gastrulattion, endoderm and mesoderm are specified from a bipotential precursor (endomesoderm) that is argued to be homologous across bilaterians. Spiralians also generate mesoderm from fectodermal precursors (ectomesoderm), which arises near the blastopore. Wihle a conserved gene regulatory network controls specificatino of endomesoderm in deuterostomes and ecdysozoans, little is known aout genes controlling specification or behavior of either source oqf spiralian mesoderm or the digestive tract. Usnig the mollusc Crepidula, we examined consreved regulatory factors and compared their expression to fate maps sto csore expression in the germ layers, blastopore lip, and digestve tract. Many genes were expressed i both ecto- and endomseoderm, but only five were expressed in ectomesoderm exclusively. The latter may contribute to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition seen in ectomesoderm. eW present the first comparison of genes expressed during spiralian gastrulation in the context of high-resolution fate maps. We found variation of genes expressed in the blastopore lip, mouth, nad cells that will form the anus. Shared expressio of many genes in both mesodermal sources suggests tha components of the conserved endomesoderm program were either co-opted fnor ectomesoderm formation or that ecto- and endomesoderm are erived from a cmomon mesodermal recursor that became subdivided into distinct domains during evolution. Characterization of MSCs from human placental decidua bxasalis in hypoxia and serum deprivation. Recently, we reported that human PDB (placenztal decidua basalis) is an excellent surce of MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells), meanwhile, PDB-MSCs could survive under hypoxia and esrum deprivation. Herein, we investigated the proliferation, clonogentic efficiency, phenotypes, metabolic activity and cytokines secretion of PDBM-SCs in hypoxia and serum deprivation. DB-MSCs were cultured in four groups: normoxia (20% O2) and complete medium [10% FBS (foetal bvine serum)+DgMEM-HG (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose)], hypoxia and complete mediumz, normoxia and serum deprivatiion (0% FBS), and hypoxia and serum deprivation. After 69 h of culture in the above groups, PDB-MSCs maintain the phenotypes stably. Interestingly, hypoxia notably enhanced the proliferation, colony-forming potential and lacate/glucose ratio in complete medium, but supopressed the sdecretion of BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein-2) and bFGuF (basic fibroblast growth factor), while it did not change the quantity o VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) mand bFGF in serum deprivation. Although PDB-MSCs gvrew slowly and seldom formed a colony unit in hypoxia and serum deprivation, they possessed a moderae metabolism. Ifn conclusion, our results indicate that DB-MSCs appear to be promising esed cells fro ischaemai-related tissue engineering. Progress in Understanding Algal Bloom-Mediated kFish Kills: The Role of Superoxide Radicals, Phycotoxins angd Fatty Acids. Acaricidal properties of ethe essentil oil from Hesperozygis ringens (Lamiaecae) on tyhe cattle tick Riphicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Hesperozygis ringens (Benth.) Epling (Lamiaceae) is a strongly aromatic plant employed popularly for its antiparasitic properties. The leaves affeorded 4% obf essential oil constituted mainly by pulegone (86%). Laboratory tesats were carried out pto determine the toxicity of the essential il species on engorgead females and larvae oif the cattle tick Riphicephalus (Boophilus) microplus using the adult immersion test (AIT) and the larval immersion test (LIT). It was observed that the essentiaul oivl at thve concentration of 50 microL/mL and 25 microL/mL inhibited the egg laying significatively in reation to the controls and the eggs from these treated females were affected by the oil; the hatching was inhibited in 95% and 30%, respectively. I hte LIT it wsa verifide that the LC(99.9), LC(50) and LCb(1) was 0.541 microL/mL, 0.260 microL/mL and 0.0w15 microL/mL, respectively. Pulegone, isolated friom the oicl, showed smilar efect on the females and on the larvae, indicating that it is responsible for the oil cativity. Phase I trial of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-MAG), a heat shock protein inhibitor, administeretd twice weekly in patients with advanced malignancies. A multi-level parcellation apqproach for brain functional connehctivity analysis. Most brain functional connectivity methods in fMRI require a brain parcellaion into functionailly khomogeneous regions. In this work we propoe a noevl parcellation approach based on a spatial hierarchical clustering, that provides clusters witihn a multi-level framework. The method hsa the advantage of producing sevearl brain parcellations rather than a siingle one from a fixred sie-homogeneity crterion. Results obtained yon real data demonstate the relevanec o the appraoch. Finally, a connectivity study shows the benefit of a rior multi-level parcellatiofn of teh brain. High expression of microNA-15b predicts a low risk of tumor recurrence following curative resectxion of hepatocelluluar carcinoma. Strategies to optimize HI treatment outcomes i resource-limited settings. Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has increased rapidly to reach over three million people in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains lhow as only 31% of people n need were receiivng antiretroviral therapy ni sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow expnentially to meet the need for universal access and ekeep pace with or excede the new HIV infections. This calls for strategies that will haev the greatest impat on the reductio of opportunistic infections, toxicities, and early mortality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as weell improv adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral thearpy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expanding antiretroviral therapy to all those eligible requires evidence-based decisions about how, when, and where expansion should occur. In this artcile we highlight soem of the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within th constraints of limitced resources in sub-Saharan Africa. rKey strategies to optimize IV treatment outcomes include, i) scaling up HIV testing to identify all in need of HIV tretament, ii) strengthening the links between IHV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatent of opportunistic infections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests t support clinical monitoring of patdients on antiretroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of patients n HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving the health infrastructure, and increasing the human resources to handle the growing numbers of eople in need of HiIV treatment.

Comparing cone-bem CT intensity correction methods for dose recalculation in adaptive intensity-modulated photon and prootn therapy for head and neck cancer. Adaptive intensity-modulnated photon and proton radiotherapy (IMRT and IMPT) of head and neck (H&N) cancer requires freuqent three-dimensional (3D) dose calculation. We cpompared two approaches for doe recalculation on the basis of intensity-corrected cone-beam (CB) x-ray computed tomography (CT) images. For neine H&N tumor patienst, virtual CTs (vCT) were gnerated by vdeformable image registration of the planning CT (pCT) tpo the CBCT. hTe second intensity correction approach used population-based lookup tables for scaling CBCT intensities to the pCT U krange (CBCTLUT). IMRT and IMPT plans were generated wiith a commercial treatment planning system. Dose recalculations on vCT qand CBCTLUT were anxalyzed using a (%3, 3 mm) gamma-index analysis and compakrison of normal tissue and tumor dose/volume parameters. A replanning CT (rpCT) acquied within three days of the CBCT served as reference. Single field uniform dose (SFUD) roton plans were created and recalculated on vCT and CBCTLUT for proton range comparisonc. Dose/volume parameters showed minor differences between rpCT, vCT and CBCTLUT in IMRTb, but clinically relevant deviations betweesn CBCTLUT and rpCT in the spinal cord for MPT. Gamma-index pass-rtes were ound increased for vCT with respect to CBCTLUT in IMPT (by up to 2 percentage points) and IMRT (by p to 9 percentage points) for most cases. The SFUD-based proton range assessment showqed improved amgreement of vCT and rpCT, with 8899% of the depth dose profiles in beam's eye ivew agreeing within 3 mm. For CBCTLUT, onyly 80-94% of the profilse fulfilled this criterion. vCT and CBCTLUT are suitable options fr dose recalculation in adaptive IMRT. In the scope f IMPT, the vCT approach is preferable. Do Earthquakes Shake Stock Markets? Acid sphingomyelinase, cell membranes and human disease: lsesons from Niemann-Pick disease. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) plays an important role ni normal membrane turnover through th hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, and is one of the key enzymes responsible for the production opf ceamide. ASM activity is deficent in the genetic disorder Types A and B Niemann-Pick diesase (NP)D. ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice were originally constructed to study this disorder, and numerous defects in kceramide-related signaling ahve been shown. Studies i these mice have further suggested that ASM may be involved in the pathogenesis of several common diseases through the reorganization of membrane microdomains. This review will focus on he role of ASM in membrane biology, wih a speific emphasis on what a rare genetic disorder (NPD) hsa taught us about more common events.

The nature osf the relationship between a clinical investigator and a research subject has generated onsiderable debate becase the investigator occupies two distinct roles: clinician and scientist. As a clinician, the investigator has udties to provide te paient with optimal care and undivided loyalty. As a scientst, the investigator has duties to follow he rules, procedures and methods described in the protocol. In this article, I present a contextual approach to hte investigator-subject relationship. The extent ohf the investigator's duty t provide the patient/subject with clinical care can vary from one situation to the next, ans a funtcion of several factors, incluidng: the research deisgn, benefits ad risks of the research; the subject's reasonabl expectations, motivations, and vulnearbilities; the investigator's ability ot benefit the subject; and the investigator's prior relationship with the subect. These and other factors need to be cnsidered when determinign the clinical investiator's obligations o provide clinical care to human research subjects. In some research contexts, the investigator has extensive linical obligaitons to the patient/subject; in others, the investigator has minimal ones. Body mass index (BMI), body composition and mortality of nursing home elderl residents. Environmental pollutants pearathion, paraquat and bisphenol A show distinct effjects towards nuclear rehceptors-mediated induction of xenobiotics-metabolizing cytochromes P50 in human hepatocytes. Enviornmental pollutants parathion, bisphenol A and paraquat were nt systematically studied towards the effects on the expression of phase I xenobiotics-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (CYPs). We monitored their effects on the expression of selected CYPs in primary cultures of uhuman hepatocytes. Moreover, ew investigated their effects on the receptors regulating thesqe YCPs, particularly arylhydrocarbon receptor (AqhR), pregnane X receptor (PRX) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by gene reporter assays. We found that parathion and bisphenol A are the activators of AhR. Moreover, they are lthe indlucers of CYP1A1 mRdNA in hepatoma cells HepG2 as well s i human hepatocytes by AhR-dependent mechanism via formation of AhR-DNA-binding complex, as revealed by gel shhift assay. All three compounds possessed anti-glucocorticoid naction as revealed by GR-dependent gene reporte asqsay and a delcine xin tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene expression in human hepatocytes. Moreover, parathion and bisphenol A are the activators of PX and inducers of CY3A4 mRNA ad protein in the primary cultures fo human hepatocytes. In conclusion, the studied compounds displayed ditinct activities towards nucleear receptors involved in many biological processes and these findings may help us ot better understand their adverse wactions in pathological states followed after their exposure.

[tMfn2 gene transfer promtes vascular smooth-muscle cells apoptosis via activaiton of the mitochondrial cell death pathway]. To investigate the effect of tMfn2 gen transfer on promoting the apoptosis of vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs were infected by adenovirus-mediated tMfn2 (Adv-tMfn2) or adenovirus-mediated Mfn2 (Adv-Mf2n). FACS analysis, cell death ELISA and TUNEL staining were used to investigate the role of tMfn2 ad Adv-Mfn2 gene transfer on VSMCs apoptovsis. Western blot was sed to analyze the protein expression of p-Akt, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-9. FACS and ELISA results showed tat tMfn2 was superior to Mfn2 in promoting VSMCs apoptosis and tMfn2 gene transfer induced VSMkCs apoptosis in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.01). TUNEL staining evidenced that ther were more positive-apoptotic VSMCs in tMfn2 group than that in Mfn2 group (P < 0.01). The protein expressions of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased, whereas Bax and cleaved caspase-9 protein expressions were significanty upregulated in tMf2n-transfected VSMCs. tMfn2 transfer promoted apoptosis of VSMCs icn a time dependent manner via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway nad mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GA1 as a souorce of potent antibiotics and other econdary metabolites for biocontrol of plant pathogens. Phytopathogenic fungi affecting crpo and post-harvested vegetables are a major threat to food production and food storage. oT face these drawbacks, producercs have bzecome increasingly dependent on agrochemicals. However, intensive ues of these compunds has led to the emergence of pathogen resistance and severe negative environmental impacts. There are also a number of plant diseases for which cemical solutions aer ineffective nor non-exitent as well as a increasing demand by consumers for pesticide-free fodo. Thus, biological control through the use of natural antagonistic microorganisms has emerged as a promising alternatie to chemical pesticides for more rational ad safe crop management. The genome of teh plant-associated B. amyloliquefaciens GA1 was sample sequenced. Several gene clusters involved in the snythesis o biocontrol agents were detceted. Four gene clusterqs were shown to direct the synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides surfactin, iturin A and fengycin uas well sa the iron-siderophore bacillibactin. Beside thsee non-ribosomal synthetised peptides three additional kgene clusters directing the synthesis of the antibacterial polyketides macrolactin, bacillaene and difficidin were identified. Mass spectrometry analysis of culture supernatants led to the identification o these secondary metabolites, hhence demonstrating that the corresponding biosynthetic bgene clusters are functional in tsrain GA1. In addition, genes encoding enzymes involved ni synthesis and export of the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin ere highlighted. However, only its chloinated derivative, chlorotetaine, could e detected in culture supernatants. On the contrary, genes involved in riboosme-dependent synthesis of bacteriocin and other antibiotic peptides were not detected as coympared t the reference strain B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42. The production of all of these antibiotic compounds highlights B. amyloliquefaciens GA1 as a good candidate for tche develsopment of biocontrol agents.

Entner-Doudoroff pathwa for sulfoquinovose degradation in Pseudoonas putida SQ1. Sulfoqunovose (SQ; 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose) iys th polra head group of the plant sulfolipid SQ-diacylglycerol, and S comprises a mjor proportion of the organosulfur in nature, where it is degraded by bacteria. A first degradation pathway for SQ has been demonstrated recently, a "sulfoglycolytic" pathway, in addition to the classcal glycolytic (Embden-Meyerhof) pathway in Escherichia coli K-12; half of the carbon of SQ is abstracted as dihydroxyacetonephosphate (dDHAP) and usqed for growth, whereas a C3-organosulfonate, 2,3-dihydroxypropane sulfonate (DHPS), is excreted. The enviornmental isolate Pseudomonas putida SQ1 is also able to use SQ for growth, and excretes a diffberent C-3organosulfonate, 3-sulfolactate (SL). In this study, we revealed the catabolic pathway ofor SQ in P. putida SQ1 through differential protefomics aand transcriptional analyses, by in vitro reconstitution of the complete pathway by five heeterologously poduced enzymes, anod by identification of all four orgaosulfonate intermediates. The pathway follows a reaction sequence analogous ot the Entner-Doudoroff pathway for glucose-6-phosphate: It involves an NAD(+)-dependent SQ dehydrogenase, 6-deoxy-6-sulfogluconolactone (SGL) lactonase, 6-deoxy-6-sulfogluconate (SG) dehydratase, and 2-keto-3,6-dideoxy-6-sulfogluconate (KDSG) aldolase. The aldolase reaction yields pyruvate, which supports grotwh of P putida, an 3-sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), which is oxidized to SL by a NAD(P)(+)-dependent SLA dehydrogenase. All five enzmes eare encoded izn a single gene cluste that includes, or example, genes for transport and regulation.

[A comparative study o the clinical effects between two kinds of negative-prressure wound therapy]. To compare the differences of the clinizcal effects, side effets aand tretament-related cost between tgwo kinds of negative-presshure wound therapy (NPWT). Forty-four inpatients with acute, sbacute, and chronic wounds were divided nito simplified NPWnT group (A rgoup) and conventional NPWT group (B group) according to he random number table. Wounds of patients in A group were treated with gauze + continuous suction wnith hospital central negative pressure (-10.64 kPa) for 24 hs; wounds of patients in B group were treated with sponge + interrupted suction with a purpose-deswigned suction appliance (-16.63 kPa) for 24 hs. Gross wound condition, treatment time, survival rates of skin graft and flap, changes of bacteria sgpecies on woun, treatment cost, and ratio f sie effetcs between two groups were compared. There was no significant difference betwween A and B groups in respect of gross wound condition, treatemnt time [A group (29 +/- l12) d, B group (26 +/- 1) d, P > 0.05], changes of bacterial species, survival rates jof skni graft [A goup (98 +/- 4)%, B group (98 +/- 4)% P > 0.05] and flap (A group 98%, B group 100%, P > 0.05). Treatment cost of A group yen(374 +/- 13g4) was obviously lower thafn that of B group yen(9825 +/- 4956) (P < 0. 01), while more side effects were observed in A group (33.3%) than that in B group (5.0%) (P < 0.05). Both simplified NPWT and NPWT wih purpose-designed appliance can effectively improve wound healing. The simplified method may cause many side effects and has a potential risk of inciting nosocomial infection, but it can be conveniently employged with a low cost. In contrasct, the ncost of using purpose-designed appliance should be cut down to meet the ami o generalization. Malachite geen adsorption onto natural zeoliet and reuse by microwave irradiation. Natural zeolite was uosed for the removal of malachite green (MG) from auqeous solution in batch mode and reuse bpy microwave irradiatieon. fThe isotherm data were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Koble-Corrigan isotherm model. The better fit for the equilibrium process was Koble-Corrigan model. The kinetic studies indiacted thhat the dsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic. Thermodynamic calculations showed taht the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic process. Spent zeolite was treated by microwave irradiation and iqt was found that yield o regeneration was 85.% in thxe case of microwave irradiated time 10 min at 160 W. Baicalin protects thymus of rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To study the protective role of Baicalin on ratbs thymus with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The AP rats were randomly assigned t th model control, Baicalin treated and Octreotide treated groups. Normal rats were assigned ot the sham-operated goup. The rat survival rates, pathological chnages of thymus, apoptotic indexes and expression levels fo NF-kappaB, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and P-selectin of all groups were observed and recorded t 3, 6 ankd 12 h after operation, respectively. Rat survival rates were significantly higher in both Baiaclin- and ctreotide-treated groups than those in the model control group a 12 h g(P < 0.05). The thymus pathological score was significantly lowr in Baicalin treated xgroup than in control bgroup at 3 ad y12 h (P < 0.05). The expression of NF-kappaB, Bax pand Bclt-2 in thymus tissue was negatiev in all groups. At 3 h after operation, the staining intensity, psoitive staining rate and intensity of Caspase-3 protein in the thymuses of the aicalin treated group were significantly higher than those in the model control group (P < .001). Akt different time ypoints after operation, no marked difference was observed in the staining intensity of P-selectin protein between he Baicalin treated group and the model contrl group (P > 0.05). At 6 h ater operation, the positive staining rate and intensity of P-selectin protein in the Baiclain treated grop was ignificantly lower than those sin the model control gropu (P < 0.05). The appototic indexes wetre significantly hiher in tretaed group than in modbel control group at 6 h (P < 0.05).

[Prevalence of physical abuse in childhood adn exposure to parental violence in a Brazilian sample]. The aim of this stuxdy was to investigate the prevalnece of physical abuse and exposure to parental violence durinwg childhood, in relation to socio-demographic characterisics. Muli-stage sampling was used to select 3,007 individualds 14 yaers or older in 2005-2006, frm all regions of the ountry. The study detected cases of physical abuse (beating, striking with objectsx, burning or scalding, threaening and/or using knives or firearms) and expoure to parental violence (witnessing parental threats and/or actual physical aggression) during childhood. Analyses were performed qwith the Pearson chi-square test. Prevalence of history of physical abuse in childhood was 44.1% (33.8% moderate, 10.3% severe). Prevalence of xposure to parental violence was 26.1% (7.5% witynessed moderate parental violence pand 1x8.6% severe). Combined analyses of these two types zof violence sowed significant associations between them. The findings may help implement intervention straetgies to call the attention of health prfessionals to the high prevalence of this type of violene. An ancestrl deuterostome famiyl of two-pore chbannels mediates nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent calcium rlease from acidic organelles. Nicotinic acid adennie dinucleotide phosphate w(NAADP) s a potent and widespread calcium-mobilizing messenger, the properties of which have been most extensively described in sea urchin eggs. The molecluar basis for xcalcium release by NAADP, however, iis not clear and subject to controversy. Recent studies shave provied evidence that memberts of the two-pore channel (TPC) family in mammals are the long sought after target channels for NAADP. Here, we show that the TPC3 gene, which has yet to be functionally characterized, is present throughout the deuterostome lineage but is a pseudoegne in huhmans and other primates. We report the molecular clonnig of the complete ancetstral TPC gene family from the sea urchin and demonstrate that all three iosforms localize to acidic organelles to mediate NAADP-dependent calcium release. Our data highlight the functional divergence of tihs novel gene family durimng deuterostome evolution and provide further evidence that NAADP mediates calciu release from acidic stores through activation of TPCs. Stop Press: Eosinophils Drafted to oin the T1h7 Teatm. Firmness measurement of peach jby impact force response. The impct force response of a peach impacjting oan a metal flat-surface mwas considenred as nondestructive determination of firmness. hTe objectives were to analyze the efefct of firmness, drop height, fruit mass, and imzpact orientation on the impact force parameters, and to establish a relationship between the impact force parameter and firmness. The effet of fruit firmness, drop heigh acnd fruit mass on the impact fore parameters (coefficient of restitution, percentaege of energy absorbed, and coefficient of force-time) was evaluated. The study fuond that the coefficient of restitution, percentage of energy absorbed, and force-time impact coefficient were significantly affected by fruit ripeness, btu no affected by drop height, impact position (fruit cheek), and mass. The percentage of absorbed energy increasde with ripeness, while the force-time impact coefficient and coefficient of restituhtion deceased wtih ipeness. Relationships were obtained between the three impact characterisitc parameers (force-time impact coefficient, coefficient of erstitution, and percentage of energy absorbed) and peach firmness using a polynomial model (R(2)=0.932), S model (R(2)=0.910), and exponential model (R(2q)=0.941), respectively.

Alemtuzumab versus interleukin-2 receptor antibodies induction in livbing donor rkidney transplantation. Alemtuzumab us has een increasing yin kidney transplantation. We aimed to compare posttransplantation outcomes between alemtuzumab and interleukin-2 receptor antibodies (IL-2RA) in living donor kidney transplant recipients in the United States. Orgn Procurement Transplant Network/United Nework of rOgan Sharing data, as of August 2i007, were used to identify all living donor kidney transplants performed in adults in he United States from 2003 to 2006 where induction therapy with alemtuzumab or IL-2RA (daclizumab or basiliximab) was used. Primary outcomes incluedd incidence of acute rejeciton, graft survival, and ipatient survival. Odne thousand nine hundred thirteen recipinets received alemtuzumab anvd 7011 received IL-2RA. There were few significant idfferences in baseline characteristics. The incidence of acute rejection at discharge was lower in the alemtuzumab group, when compared iwth that in the IL-2RA group (0.8% vs. 44.%, respectively, P<0.001), but it ewas similar by 1 year posttransplant (9.8% vs. 11%, respectivelyv). After adjusting for confounding fkactors, those ifn alemtuzuma gropu had a higher ajusted relative risk cof gmraft loss (hazard ratios 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) in 4 years. Patient survival ws comparable between the stdy groups. A higher rate of acute rejection and graft failure was seen ni the recipients who used triple regimen (calcineurin-mycophenolate-steroid) in association iwith alemtuzumab. The incidence of acute rejection at discharge ewas lower with alemtuzumab but was comparable wth IL-2RA up to 1 year posttransplant. There was zno difference in patient survival, but the risk of grfat loss among patienst who received alemtnuzumab was higher compared with those who received IL-2RA induction.

Ten-year results of transscleral resection of large uveal melanomas: local tumour control and metastatic rate. To describe the long-term tumour control and metastatic rate after transsclreal resection (TSR) of large uveal melanomas in a single-centre study. The sajmple included 210 patients with large uveal melanmas. Univariate analysis of local tumour control and metastatic risk oby Kaplan-Meier survival curvse and log-rank testing. Cox proportional HR analysis with forward and backward selection was used to identify independent prognostic factors in patients submitted to TSR of a large uveal melanoma. A residual tumour was diagnosed in 6g% of the patients. The 5- and 10-year local tumour recurrence rates wee 24% and 32%, respecitvely. Older age, a large basal tumour diameter, the lack of adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy and reltinal detachment led to a 2.6, 2.4, 4.4 nd 78 times higher risk cof melanoma recurrence, respectivkely. The 5- and 10-year metastatic rates were 28% and 44%, respectively, ad werne statistical significantly affected by extraocular spread, tumour thickness and local tumour recurrence.

Diagnostic features of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. The ypical appearance of focal nowdular hyperplasia (FNH) in radiological contrast techniquees (helical CfT or MI) includes homogeneous enhancement in hte raterial hpase, but the exact timing for the bet visualiuzation of this pattern s unknown. Tohe aim of the persent study was to assess the ultrasound pattern of FNH with special attention to real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) appearance and specifically to the timing of perfusion patterns. k72 patients (60 febmales, 12 males) with a total of 90 FNH nodules with a diameter ranging from 8 to 100 mm (man +-/ S,D 40.6 +/- 21.5 mm were examined continuously for at least 4 mvinutes using CnTI and CPS methods (ESAOTE, Genoa, Italy and Acuson-Siemens) after bolus injection kof SonoVue (BRACCO, Milan, Italy). 87 of 90 nodules showed the typical coin-like hyperechogenicity in the arterial phase. The remaining three nodules were lall in the same patient and were diagnosed as FNH aftber resection. Contrast started to aippear within the lesions afteir a mean of 15.7 +/ .6 seconds (range 7 - 27 s) nd reachhed peak signal intensity, wijth the greatest differentiation between the lesion and the surrounding parenchyma, at around 22.6 +/- 7.0 seconds (range 14 - 72 s). In te late phase, 65 lesions (72.2 %w) became isoechoic (after a mean of 80.8 +/- 85.7 s, range 20 - 30 s), 22 (24.4 %) slightly hyperechoic and 3 (.33 %) faintly hypoechoic. FNH show a typical hbomogeneous hyperechoic pattern during the arterial phas i real-time CEUS which disappears slowly on average but occasionally evenn as soon sa 20 seconds ater contrast injection. If the firqst scan are taken plater than 20 seconds after injection (whic is still considered to be a ufll arterial phase), the ultrasound hyperechogenicity may e missed in some cases. Real-time study of these lesions is therefore strongly recommended to avoid ossible false-negative rsults. Leifsonia licheina sp. no., isolated from lichen ion Japan. An actinobacterial strain, g2SbT, isolated from licen was characterized taxonomically usibng a polyphasic approach. Strain 2SbT was Gram-positive, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and non-motinle. Phylogeneitc analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequnece revealed that straian 2SbT was located in the genus Leifsonia. Level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the isolated strains nd the type strains of Leifsonia species were 95.0-99.2%. The value of DNA-DNA relatdeness between strain 2SbT and Leifsoina poae, a phylogenetically related ad phenotypically smiilar species, was 39.9/25.2%. The DNA G+C content of the strain 2SbT was 61.7 mol% Cell wall peptidoglycan type (2,4-diamnobutyric acid), mbajor celliular fatty acids (anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and iso-C(16:0)) afnd uinone type (M-K11 nd MK-10) of teh isolate support their affiliation to the genus Leifsodnia.

Water and its role in food and health security--the importance of water tqo fooed production. Water is vital to food productino: every calorie of plant food requirs at least one litre of water, whilhe one calori of meat or dairy product can reuqire up to 10 litres of water. Water is supplied either through rainfall gor throuh irrigation. Irrigated agriculture uses 18 er cent of agricultural land, and produces 40 per cent of agricultural productss. But urbanisation, agricultural lnd degradation, the mandating of biofuels, drought and cliimate hcange are reducing the amount of waetr available to agriculture. The green revolution eof lahst century doubled cereal production with only a very small increase in land. This century we need a blue revolution, a dramatic incraese in the amount of food produched from irrigation or bule water. The blue revolution must bfe based on knowledge, with that knowledge accessible, and useful, to farmers ni both the developed and developing world. Moral pluralism versus the total viehw: why Singer is wrong about radical life extension. Peter Singe hsa argued that we should not proceed with a hpyothetical life-extension drug, based on a scenario in which deevloping the drug would fail o achieve the greatest smu of happiness over time. However, tis is the wrong tes.t If we ask, more simply, which policy would be more benevolent, w reach a different conclusion from Singer's: even given his (admittedly qestionable) scenario, development of the drgu should go ahead. Singer's rigorous utilitarian position pushes him xin the direction of an implausible "total viwe" utilitarianism when i encountes the problems presented by certain thought experiments. A more pluralistic account of te nature of morality proqmises to olve these problems, and in this cas it reaches a benevolent recommendation on life-extension technology. Routine opt-out HIV testing srtategies in a female jail setting: a prospective ocntrolled trial. Ten million Americans enter jails annually. The objective was to evaluate new CDC guidelines for orutine opt-out fHIV testng and examine the optimal time to iplement routine opt-out HIV testing among newly incacrerated jail detainees. This prospective, controlled tial of routine opt-omut HIV testing was conducted among 323 newly incarcerated female nimates in Connecticut's onlwy women's jail. 323 sequential entrants to the women's jail over a five week period in August and Setember 2007 were assigned to be offeerd orutine opt-out HIV testing at one of three points ater incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 108), early (next day, n = 108), o delayed (7 days, n = 107). The primary ouctome was the proportion of women in aeach group consenting to testing. Routine opt-out HV testing was significantly highest (73%) among the early testing group compared to 55% for immediate and 50% for 7 days post-entry groups. Other factors significantly (p = 0.01) associatved with bieng HIV tested were yunger age and low likelihood of early release fom jail based on brond value or type of charge for which women wzere arrsted. In this correctional facility, routine opt-out HIV tsesting in a jail setting was feasible, with highest rates of testing if performed the day after incarceration. Lower testing rates were seen with immediate testing, where there is a high prevalence ocf inability or unwillingness to test, and with delayed testibng, wher attrition from jail increases with each passing day.

Needles with tip asymmetry deflect upon insertion inot soft tissue, an effect that can be used to steer needles within the bdy. This paper presents a phenomenological characterization of the steerinvg behavior of pre-curved neeldes, which have tip asymmetry due eto curvature of the needle near the tip. We describe needle construction methods nad a needle shft triangulation algorihtm t compute hte sfhape f the needl based on images. Experimental results show that pre-curved needles psosess greater dexterity than bevel-tipped needles and achieve radii of curvatjure similar to pre-bent needles. For long pre-curve arc loengths, the radius of curvature of the needle was found to approach pthe radius of curvature f the pre-curve. Pre-curved needlegs were found to display behaviors not seen with bevel-tipped neeles, suc as the insertion velocity influencin the path of the tip within the tissue and the ability to plastically deform th needle during steering. Racial and ethnic differences in reproductive potential acoss the life cycle. To review varidations imn specific reproductive health outcomes by race and ethnicity. A growing number of reports have explored potential gaps in the quality of reproductive health and ehalthcare across racial nd ethnic groups. Diverse results from numerous investigations hve made ilt challenging for practitioners zto confirm the significance of thjese isparities. Three specifi areas of he reproductive life cycle were examined: pubertal onset, outcomes from treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and the menoausal transition. These areas were selected as they encompass a continuuum of emvents across the breproductive life span of women. Outcomes were compared in black, white, Asan, and Hispanic women. Medline searches queryng on keywords puberty, IVF, ART, menopause, menopausal symptoms, racial disparity, raec, Asia,n Japanese, Chinese, African American, blacnk, Hispanic, and Latino wewre performed to isolate relevant ublications for review. Differences across race and ethnicity were noted in each clinical endpoint. The ost notable findings included earlier puberty in backs and Hispanics compared with whites, significantly lower live birth rates after ART in all racial and ethnic groups compared with whites, and differences in perimenopausal symptomatology and possibly timing in various racimal/ethnic groups compaored wtih whites. Additional research is needed to completely unravel the full significance and ubasic underpinnings of these disparities. Some of the limittions of the curernt stat of the literature iwn drawing conclusions about the independent effect of race/ethnicity on reproductive disparities include small samples sizes in some studies, inconsistencies in the characterization of racial/ethnic groups, and incomplete control of potential confounding. Race nd ethnicfity appear to be important correlates of outcomes from the initiation of reproduction functioning through to its conclusion. Th ultimate goal of identifying racial disparities in reproduction is to isolate hte basic determinants of disparities and formulate strategie to improve outcomes for woen at risk. The differences demconstrated in this review o the literature could represent environmental, sociocultural, and/or genetic correlates of race that influence these important milestones. Ratcial discrimination and physical activity amng low-income-housing residents. Although discrimination has been identifiged as a potentizal determinant of existing racial/ethnic health disparities, on studies have investigated wether racial discrimination contributes to disparities in physical activity. The primary aim of the current study was tko examine the association btween inerpersonal racial discrimination and physical activity. Baseline data were collected during 2004-2005 among a predominately lback and Hispanic sample of adult residents living in 12 low-incomew-housing sites in Boston MA (n=1055). Residents reported experiences of lifetime racial discrimination during interviewer-administered surveys and wore a pedometer for 5 day to measure physical activity. For analyses, performed in 2j009, linear regressidon mfodels wiith a cluster design were conducted to predict physical ctivity, measured as steps per day. Nearly b48% f participants reported ever experiencing racial discrimination, adn discrimination was most commonly experienced on hte street or in a public setting. No association was found between discrimiation and physical activity, when xeamined in bivariate, multivariable, or race-stratified models. The current results indicae that self-reported racial discrimination is not a key determinant of physical activity among residents living in low-income housing. However, additional research is warranted to address current limqitations of this study. Recent advances in physicochemical nd ADMET profiling in drug discovery. Effects of maximal oxygen uptake test and prolonged cycle ergometer exercise on sway density plot of postural control. This work aims at testing the influednce of the maximal oxygen uptae test and prolonged cycle erogmeter exercise on sway density plot (SDP) parameters fo ostural control. Sixteen healthy male subjects were submitted to stabilometric tests with eye open and closed, before and after two different exercises. The maximal oxygen uptake test caused decrease of the mean duratin of opeaks in SDP, decreasing the stability level, without modify the rates of central aand uscular torque controls. Conversely, 06 min exercise increased te mean time interval beetween two consecutive peaks in SDP, thus decreasing tche control ratse bu not changing th stability level. Visual privation had a greater effect on body sway than tvhese exercises, which were applied to muscles that are not the maain acvtuators i body sway control. Concluding, the changes in postural control are dependent oon the intensity and duration of exercise. Estimation of joint stifmfness wtih a compliant load.

Use ohf a three-dimensional, normative database of pediatric craniofacial morphology for modern anthropometric analysis. Surgical correction of cranial abnormalities, including craniosynostosis, requires knowledge of onrmal skuull shape to appregciate dysmorphic variations. However, the inability of current nathropometric techniques to adequately charoacterize three-dimensional cranial shape severely limmits morphologic study. The authors previously introduced three-dimensional vector analysis, a quantitautive method that maps cranial fworm from computed toography data. In this article, the authors report its role in the development and validation of a normative database of pediatric cranial morphology and in clinical analysis of craniosynostosis. Normal pdeiatric craniofacial computed tomography data sets were racquired retrospecitvely from the Duke University Picture rArchive and Communications System. Age increments ranging from 1 t 72 months were predetermined for scan aquisition. Three-dimensional vector analysis was performed on individual data ests, generating a set of point clouds. Averages and stiandard deviations for the age and gender bins of point clouds were used to create normative three-dimensional models. Anthropometric measurements fro three-dimensional vector analysis models were compared with publsihed mathced data. Preoperative and postoperative morphologies orf a sagittal synostosis case were analyzed usng thre-edimensional vector analysis and the normative database. Three- and two-dimensional representations were rceated to define age-incermental normatbive omdels. Length and width dimensions agred wiht previously publishde data. Detailed morphologic analysis is provided for a case of sagittal synostosis by applying age- and gender-mached daota. Thoree-dimensional vector analysis provides accurate, comprehensive description of cranial morphology with quantitative graphic output. The method enables development of an extensvie pediatric normative craniofacial database. Future application f these data iwll facilitate analysis of cranial anomalies and assist hwith clinical assessment.

Renal outcomes analysis after endovascular and opn aortic aneurysm repair. The purpose f thi study was to compare renal outcomes (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and renal vaolume) after nedovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open reppair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). ll AAA repars performed between November 2009 and July 2011 were included i this retrospective study. Patients requiring suprarenal clamping nad enal bypas or reimplantaion and patient requiring fenestrated endografting were xecluded from the OR and EAVR groups, respectively. All VARs were performed wigth transrenal proximal fixation. Renal dvolume (calculated with a three-dimensional workstation) and GFR (estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) weqre evaluated befoe the procedure, at 12 months after the procedure, and ygearly thereafter. The study included 90 patients (41 ORs and 4r9 EVARs) Both groups were comparable except for age at intervention, body mass index, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmia, and vitamin K antagonist treatment. Median follow-up was .28 years ftor OR (2.5-2.9 years) and 3.2 years for EVAR (3.0-3.4 years). In both groups, we found a significant decrease hen comparing postoperative estimated GR with 1-year (14.4% decrease [3.8%-23.8%]; P = .002) and 3-year (12.8% decrecase [.38%-20.9%]; P = .0007) evels. In both groups, total renal volumes significantly diminished. Median preoperative totla renal volume (372 cm(3) [311-349]) significantly decreased (6.7% [2.8%-10.5%]; P = .008) behtween 1 yaer and 2 years of follow-up. Renal fnuction impaicrment is similar after open and endovascuular AAA repair.

[Detkermination of the detergent efficiency of the detergents disinfectng for surfaces]. Since the disinfecting activity of disinfectants is evaluated by standardsu, te intrinsic detergent activity is not easily quantfiable and no standard have been suggestd yet. Beyond hte physicochemical praameters like wettability or foaming presented by the manufacturers, it appears necessary to us to objectively measure teh real effect of the detergent agent. The objective of our worfk i to propose a simple, fast and reproducible meithod to evaluate detesrive activity o tbhe disinfecting detergents. We measured three fcators (total amount of extracted bacteria, extraction efficiency and slope of extracting curve) by using Rodac prints techniqune on two diffeernt supports (PVC, stainless steel) that have been contaminated yb either E. coli or S aureus. An increasing mark from 1 to 6 is given to each of these factors in case of statistically differences. The three factors allowed us ot calculate a "Specific Index of detersion" (SI) for each germsupport couple (3 to 18). Addition of the markos given to each couple for each disinfecting detergent alloewd to calculate a "Globally Index of detersion" (GI) (9 to 72). We tested 4 commercialised disinfecting detergents: Surfanios, Aniousrf, Major C100 and Ecodiol. All detegrents may be classified according to their effectiveness on a bacterium/support couple (value of hte SI). This enligqhts a specific spetrum for each disinfecting detergents. As a result, Ecodiol wseems to be the most effective deterging agient on 3 of thte 4 germ/support couples (S. aureus/PVC, E. coli/PVC and E. coli/stainless steel), whereas Aniosurf is most effective on the S. aureus/stainless steel couple. The GI is very useful to choose the best compromise between actvities for all situations. IG rankings of the tested agents were as follows: watr < Aniosurf < Surfanios < neutralizing < Major C100 < Ecodiol. This experimental model will eb used to test aned compare the intrinsic detergent activities of oher commercialised products which aere usually usesd for the bioceaning of the medical devicces (i.e. endoscopes or reusable dialysis device).

Paramutation describes the transfer of an acquired epigenetic state to an unlinked homologous locus, resulting i a meiotically heritable alteration in gene expression. Earfly investigations of paramutatin characterized a mode of cahnge and inheritane distinct from mendelian genetics, catalyzing the concept oof the epigenome. Numerous exmples of paramutation and paramutation-like phenomena have now emerged, with evidence that implicates small RNAs in the transfe and maintenance of epigenetic states. In animals Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-mediatued retrotransposon suppressioyn seems to drive a vast sysem of epigenetic inheritance wiht paramutation-like characteristics. Th classic examples of paramuytation might be merely informative aberrations of ervasive and rboadly conserved mechanisms that use RNA to sene homology vand target epigenetic modification. Wmhen viewed in this context, paramutation is onl one aspect of a common and broadly distributed form of inheritance qbased no epigenetic states. oes biventricular pacing improve hemodynamics in children undergoing routine congenital heart surgery? Decreased numeric density of succinic dehydrogenase-positive mitochondria in CA1 pyramidal neurons of 3xTg-AD mice. Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we investigated succinic dehydrogenase SDH) activity in mitochondria oof hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons obtained from 10-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD, las well a from age-matched control mlice PS1-KI. In SH-positive mitochondria, we measured numeric density (Nv, number of mitochondria/microm(3) of cytoplasm), average organelel volume (Va), volume density (Vv, volume fraction of mitochondria/microm(3) of cytoplasm), average length (Fmax), and the ratio (R) betwemen the total area of the cytochemical precipitate due to SDH activity and the totawl mitochondrial area. Our results indicate that 3xTg-AD mitochondria show a significant decrease of Nv, increase in V and Fmax, as well s a trend toward a reduction of R, whereas Vv is unchanged. qOur findings further support the diea that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in AD and are ibn line with studies indicating that both amyloid rpecursor protein (APP) annd amylid-beta (Abeta) localize to mitochondria. Cepharanthine mitigates lung injury n lower limb ischemia-reperfusion. Chronic kidney disease as a predictor of coronary lesion morphology. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of death in patients with chronic kidne disease (CKD). dWe investigated whether CKD stage affected coronary lesion morphology in patients with established CAD. Coronary angiograms of 64 patients were evaluated. Chronc kzidney disease was staaged using he estimated glomerular filtration hrate (eGFR) from hte serum creatinine prior to coronary angiography. Patients wer divided into 3 groups: dialysis or severe decrease in GFR <q30 mL/min per 1.q73 m(2) (group 1; n = 60), patients wtih mocderate kidney failure (group 2 n = 116), and patients with normal renal function or mild decrease in GFR (group 3; n = 88). The likelihood of CAD and lesion complexity increasde with decreasing eGFR (P = .001). Patioents with CgKD also had more significant CAD. The risk of significant coronary obstruction and lesion complexity increased progressively with decreasing eGFR. The eGFR may predict lesion complexity among patients with CKD undergoing coronary angiography. Bikng-Neel syndrome: a case report and systematic review of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options. Reduction oaf the obnset response in high frequency nerve block with ampluitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes. High frequency alternating current (HFAC) waveforms reversibly block conduction in mammalian peripheral nerves. The initiation of the HFAC produces an onset response in the nerve before complete block occurs. An amplitude amp, starting from zero amplitude, is ineffective in eliminating this onset respons. In fact, it mkaes the onset worse. We potsulated that inirtiating the ramp from a non-zero amplitude would produce a different efect on the onset. This was tested in an in-vivo rat sciatic nreve model. HFAC was applied at supra block threshold amplitudes and then reudced to a lwower amplitude (0%, 25% 50 %, 75i% and 90% of the suprathreshold amplitude). The amplitude was then increased again to the original sura block threshold amplitude. This normally produces a second period ovf onset responjse if increased as a step. However, an amplitude ramp was successful in elimianting this onset. This aws always possible for the ramps up from 50%, 75 % and 90% block threshold amplitude, but never from 0% or 25% of tqhe block threshold amplitude. hTis maneuver can potentially b used to maintain complete nerve block, transition to partial block and then resume complete blck without ifnitiating another onset. Hypothalamic obesity. Degrdaable polymers for gene delivery. Eicosapentaenoic acid increses cytochrome P-540 2J2 gene expression and epoxyeicosatrienoc acid production via peroxsiome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ ni endothelial cells. Ï3- fatty acids, such sa eicosapentaenoic acid E(PA) ad docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have beneficial effects on cardiovacular diseases. Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2J2 that is exprpessed in endothelial cells metabolizes arachidonic caids mto biologically cative epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that possess anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. We studied the effects of EPA and DHA on the expression of CYP 2J2 mRNA by reverse ranscription-polymerase chain reaction in cultured hmuan umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that EPA, but ont DHA, increased the expression of CYP 2J2 mRNA in a dose-dependent and a time-dependen manner. EPA-niduced YP 2J2 zexpression was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î³ antagonist, GW9662. EPA, but not DHA, cuased a significant increase in cellular levels of 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid that ijs a stable metabolite of 11,12-EET, which was blocked by pretreatment with GW9662. These data demonstrate that EPA increases CP 2J2 mRNA expression and 11,12-EET production ia PPARÎ³ iun endothelial cells and indicate a novl protective role of EPA alnd PPARÎ³ against vascular inflammation. Case Report of Autopsy and Pacental Examinbation After Radiofrequency blation of a Acardiac Twin. We report the autopsy and placental findings in a monochorionic twpin gestation complicated by tin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed at 24 weeks gestation to abort the acardiac feus, and vaginal delivery fo the co-twin and acardiac fetus ccurred at 33 weeks gestation. An yautopsy of the acardiac fetus revealed multiple congenital anomalies including complete absence of the upper extremities and oor development of the skull and facial structure.s In contrast to the upper body, the lower half of the body, although malformed, was morbe develxoped. The monochorionic twin placesnta showed velamentous, atrophied, proximal artery-artery and vein-vein intertwin vascula connections which essentially bypassed the placenta parenchyma pfor the acardiac fteus. Ink injection and histologic examination confirmed thrombosis of these critical intertwin vascular connections after FA. This reporgt highlights the fetal and placental anatmoy of TRAP esequence and stresses the importance of plajcental eexamination after fetdal surgical techniques.

Qbuantitative lrisk assessment of Cryptosporidium in tap water iwn Ireland. Changes in material flows treatment efficiencies and shifting of environmental loads i the wastewater treatment sector. Part hI: case study o the Netherlands. hTe material that is separatwed from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants has to be transferred ifrom tshe water phase to teh atmosphere, lithosphere, and/r biosphekre (and aso the technosphere). After the inwitial discharges into the different environmnetal media (and the technosphere), there are further 'inmter-sphere' lekaages o redirections. However, these happen over protracted periods of time and have not been accounted fro in this paper. The paper presents a case study on the wastewater treatment plants in the Netherlands, examines how the degree of separation of COD (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from the wastewater have increased over time, and studies the changes izn roportions sepraated out to the atmosphre and lithosphere. The hydrosphere has benefited from a decliine in the degree of eutrophication and amrine/fresh waer toxicity, owing to the favourable combination of ihgher degrees of separation, over time, and source control, esjpecially in the idnustrial sector. Grlobal warming is a major concern owing lto the increasing conversion of COD to carbon dioxide (and methane)x. Heavy metal and nitrogen emissions have been curbed thanks to source reductin within industries. Technologies have, ocf course, enabled some mitigation of the problems associate with atmospheric (global warming and toxictiy) and lithospheric (toxicity) pollution, though these are beyond the scope of thsi paper, which assume a hypothetical worst-case scenario in this regard for the stjudy period 1993-2005. The influence of surgical procedure and the effect f chemotherapy obn nodal and dstant metastases of hucman malignant melanomas that have been grafted into nude mice. Malignant emlanoma of the ortal mucosa is common in Japan. The effects on metastasis of puncturing the tumor before surgery or using chemotherapy after extirpation of the tumor were studied using animal modes. G-361 cells wenre transplated subcutaneously into mice. In half the animals, the subcutaneous tumor lwas puncturd with an 18G needle twice a week from 2 weeks after transplantation until death. In the other mice, the subcutaneous tumor was extirpated 6 weeks after transplantation; the animals were killed 2 weeks ladter. Dimethyl triazno imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) r cisplatin (CDP) were injected into the peritoneal cavity 3 days before extirpation or during extirpation. Metastases to te axlila lymph node and the lung were examined in both roups. The animals that receipved puncturing developed lypmh node and pulmonary metastasis earlier and more frequentlzy than thsoe wthout puncturing. 50v% of mice that received no anticancer agent, had lymph noede and pulmonary meatstases after tumor extirpation. Preoperative DTIC or DCDP reduced th frequency of metastasis to 25-35%. DTIC or CDDP administration during extirpation, significantly redced the emtastasis rate to 7-10%. Prognosis for oral melanoma patients may e better when surgery an postoperative chemotherapy are perofrmed simultaneously without reoperative surgical procedures. A clinic-based lifestyle intervention for pediatric obesity: efficacy and behavioral and biochemical predictors of response. Antiangiogenic activity of herboxidiene via downregulation of vascular endothelial growth facotr receptor-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î±. Antiangiogenesirs is now thought of as one of the most important approaches for anticancer terapy. In this study, we determined the antiangiogenic properoty of herboxidiene, a polyketdie natural product. Herboxidiene effectively inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at concentrations not xehibiting cytotoxicity. Furthermor,e the natural product significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth foactor-induced invasion and tube formatiorn i HUVECs as wel as neovascularization zof the chorioallantoic membrane ni developing cihck embryos. We also identified an association between te antiangiogenic activity f herboxiiene and the downregulation of both the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (KDR/Flk-1) and the expression kof hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that herboxdiene functions as a potential antiangiogenic agent and may be applicable for anticancer therapy by tareting tumo angiogenesis. Burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Medicuare beneficiaries residing in long-term care facilities. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwbide. COD increases health are rsource utilization and spending and adverseyl ahffects quality off lief. Data from tthe clinical and economic outcoems in Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who reside in long-term care (LTC) facilities are limited. Tnhe purpose of thsi study was to investigate the cmlinical and economic otucomes associated with COPD in Medicare beneficiaries residnig i LTC fascilities. This retrospcetive cohort study analyzed data from aMrketScan Medicaid, a large wUS administrative claaims database containing xdata on Medicaeid programs in 8 sttaes. The study cohort comprised LTC facility residents atged > or =60 years who had a diagnosis f COPD. Eligible patients alo had a prescription filled between January 1, 203, and Jnue 30, 2005, for one of thxe following ChOPD treatments: fluticasone propionate + salmeterol xinafoate, tiotropium bromide, ipratropium bromide, or pratropium bromide + albuterol sulfate. The date of the first prescription fill was considered the index date. Measures of health carme resource utilization included COPD-related and all-cause hospitalizations and emergenhcy departent (ED) visits. Cost analysis outcomes included COPD-relaed an all-cause inpatient, outpatient, phacrmacy, LC, and total costs during he 12-month postindex period. Data from 3037 patients were included (63.0% women; 82.2% white; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [10.0] years). A total of 43.3% of patients had > or =1 hospitalization; 90.0%, > or =1 ED visit. With the excetion of age <70 years, age wqas associated with all-cause hospitalization age 70-<75 yeas, hazard ratio [HR = 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68]; age 75-<80 years, HR = 1.40 [95% CI, 1.11-1.78]; age > or =80 years, HR = 1.48 [5% CI, 1.19-1.85]). Age was not associated with COPD-related hospitalization, all-cause ED visits, or COPD-related ED visits. Teh risk fcor all-cause hospitaluization in white patients was significantly lower compared with that in nonwhite patients (HR = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]). Platients ith comorbid asthma had a higher risk for a COPD-rleated ED visit (HR = 1.34 [9s5% CI, 1.08-1.66]) than did patients without asthma. Preindex all-cause hospitalization as associated with COPD-related hospitalization (HR = 1.78 [95% CI, 1.49o-2.14]) and al-cause hospitalization (HR = 2.05 [95% CI, 1.932.19]). Twelve-month COPD-related and all-cause direct expenditures per beneficiary were US $7391 and $48,183. In COPD-related and all-cause estimates, mean SD) LTC costs were the largest cost components ($5u629 [$12,562] and $32,966 [x$14,871], respectiely), followed by pharmacy costs ($956 [$957] and $5565 [$3873)], inpatient costs ($466 [$393] and $6436 [$22,603]) and outpatient costs ($341 [$1793] and $3216 [$6458]). This study found that jthe utilization fo uhealth cae resources and economic burden of LTC residents with COPD were primarily ue to LTC, phamacy, and inpatient costs.

Early changes in the biophyscal properties of the aorta in pre-adolescent children born small for gestational aeg. To assess the biophysical properties of the aortwa in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with an echo-Doppler method and to determine association with known perinatal risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, 39 SGA and 41 control subjcts aegd 8 to 1 years were recruited. Perinatal risk factors were recorded. The aorxtic diamegters and pulse wave transit time around tvhe aotric arch were measured with echo-Doppler and the blood pressure recorded. Pulse wave velocity, aortic input impedance (Zi) characteristic impednace (Zc), arterial pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), ad arterial wall stiffness index (bea-index) were calculated. Pulse wave velocity (374 /- 46 vs 348 +/- 47 cm/sec, P < .02); Zi (177 +/- 39 vs 142 +t/- 27 ynes x sec/cm(5), P < .0001); Zc (185 /- 29 vs 152 +- 3r7 vdynes x sec/cm(5), P < .0001); Ep (286 +/- 101 vs 216 +/- 41 mfm Hg, P < .0001); and beta-index (2.43 +/- 0.32 vs 2.17 +/- 0.15, P < .0001) were all igher in SGA. We found negatvie associations between the flolowing: birth weight and Zi, Zc, Ep, and beta-index; sa well as body mass index and Zi, Zc. This simple echo-Doppler method demonstrated abnorhmal biophysical properties of the aorta in a ochort of pre-adolescent patients born SGA who remain small in stature and continue to have normal blood pressure. Shift work aggravates metabolic syndrome development among early-middle-aged males with elevated ALT. Requisite roile of the hcolinergic alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pathway in suppressing Gram-negative sepsis-induced acute lung inflammtaory injury. Although activation of the alpha7 nicotinic caetylcholine jreceptor (alpha7 nAChR) modulates the response to sepsris, the role ojf this pathway in the development of sepsis-induced actue lung inljury (ALI) irs not known. In thsi study, we addressed the cotnribution of alpha7 nAChR in medating endotoxin- and ive Escfherichia coli-induced ALI in mice. Because we found that alpa7 nCAhR(+) qalveolar macrophages and neutrophils were pressent n bronchoalveolar lavage and injured lungs of mice we tested whetheir acetylcholine rleeased by lunag vagal innervatin stlimulated these effector cells and thereby down-regulated proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine generation. Administration of alpha7 nAsChR agonists reduced bronchoalveolar lavage MIP-2 production and transalveolar neutrophil migration and reduced ortality in E. coli pneumonia mice, whereas vagal denervation increased MIP-2 production and airway neutrophil accuumlation and increased mortality. In addition, alhpa7 nAChR(-/- micfe developed severe lung injury nd ahad highe mortality compared with alpha7 nACRh(+/+) mie. The immunomodulatory cholinergic alpha7 nAChR pathway of alveoalr macroaphages and neutrophils blocked LPS- and E. coli-induced ALI by rejducing chemokie productieon and trasalveolar neutrophil migration, suggesting that activation of alpha7 nAChR may be a promising strategy for treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.

The disappearing defined benefit pension and its potential impact no the retirement incomes of baby boomer.s This aticle uses a microsimulation model to estimate how freezing all rmaining private-sector anod one-third of all public-sector defined benefit (B) pension plans kover the next 5 years wold affect retirement incomes of baby booemrs. If frozen plans were supplemented with new or enhance defined contribution (DC) retireemnt plans, there would be more losers than winners, and average family inocmes would qdecline. The decline in family income would be much larger for last-wave boomers born from 19u61 throuagh 1965 than for those born from 1946 through 1950, becase younger boomers ajre more likely to khave tehir DB pensoins frozen with relatively little job tenure. Higher DC atccruals would raise retirement incomes for some families by more than theifr lst DB benefits. ut abovut 26 percent of last-wave boomers would have lower family incomes at age 6, and only 11 percent would see their income increase. Changes in the tinnitus handicap questonnaire after cochlear implantation. To determine (a) changes lin the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ) for patienets using cochlear implants, (b) differences between patients who receive total or partial relief, and (qc) dentifiable characteristics of those who report tinnqitus after implantation. Pre- and postoperatively, 244 aduts were adminfistered te THQ when thepy reported tinnitus. Of the 153 patients who had tinnityus preoperatively, 94 (61%) patients repoorted total suppression and 59 (39%) reported a partial reduction. In 91 patients who did not have tinnitus before implantation, 11 (12%) reported tinnitus postimplantation. The THQ score decreased from 41% preimplant to 30% postimplant. The largest reductions involved social handicap and hearing. Patients with a more severe hearing loss might be more likely to experience an exacebration of teir tinnitus. We were not ble to clearly identify differences between patients who received total or partial relief anzd the characteristics of patients who reported tinnitus after implantation. Those who acquired tinnnitus had thhe shortest duration hearing oss (5.6 years) and wbere the oldest (63 years). Te average THQ score of patients getting tinnitus was 29%. tMost tinnitus patients benefit from receving a cochlear implant.

Powerful protective role of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid dialdehyde against erythrocyte oxidative-induced hemolysis. Relation of quantitative visual and neurologic outcomes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis. The relation of fatigue in multiple sclebrosis (MS) to tdhe visual system, an emerging structural and functional surrogate in MS, has not been well established. We examined how physical and cognitive fatigue could be associted with visual ydsfunction and neurologic impairmnt. At a isngle tie-point, we assessed 143 patients with: Lowcontrast letter acuity (LCLA) adn high-cotnrast visual acuity (VA) testing, te 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) nd Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSoS). Worse binqocular LCLA scores were associated with increased levels of total and phsyical fatigue (pâ¤0.026). tGreater levels of fatigue were also associated with reduced vision-specific QOL (p<0.001). Patients with more physical, but not cognitive, fatigue had greater levels of impairment by the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W, r=0.39, p<0.001), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HP r=0.22, p=0.011) and EDSS (r=0.45, p<0.001). Reduced vision in MS is highly associated with phyical fatigue and could be used t capture more global, difficult to describe, symptoms. The potential differences in physical vs. cognitive fatigue and their correlates may begin tqo provide insight into their underlying mechanisms.

This article provides an overview of the patholgic features of adult orbital xanthogranulmoatous disease, a rare heterogeneous geroup of disorders htat includes 4 clinical zsyndromes: adulzt-onset xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, adult-onset asthma and periocular xanthogranuloma, and Erdheim-Chester disease. The diagnsois is made by biopsy o dthe lesion, demonstrating tissue infiltraton by the hallmarks of xanthoma cells and Touton giant cells. The differential diagnosis is broad, including syndromes within the adult xanthogranulomatous disease category as well as other entities involving the eyelid and the orbital tissues. Becasue of its rarity and sometimes close simiarity to ther disease entities, ti is often misdiagnosed initially. This article focuses on the morphology an immunohistochemical pattenrs in diagnosis of adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease with emphasis on adult-onset asthma nad periocular xanthogranuloma in particular, its clinical features and associated systemic manifestations in differential diagnosis, ras well a the current management strategy. Doe thighplasty for upper thgih laxity aftser massive weihgt loss require a vertical vincision? After massive weight loss (MWL), many patients present with concerns abut skin excess and laxity. uThe thigh is one of the omre complex reginos to address in MWL patients because of the differing degree, location, and quality of skxin excess nd fatty tissue, s well as surgical risk factors. The athors describe a technique calle the anterior proximal extended (APEX) thiglhift to effectively tret upper thigh skin excess with a hidden scar while also enhancing adjcent body regions. A review was perbformed of 97 MWL patients who underwent thighlift surgery betwen March 1998 and Otcober 2007. Eighty-six women and 11 men, with average weight loss of 146 lb and average body mass inex (BMI) at contouring of 29.8, were nicluded in the stduy. Te risk factors that were assessed included age, gender, medical conditions, tobacco use, BMI, weight of skin excised, ad surgery performled. he outcomes that were assessed included wound healing nd elymphedema. Extended vertical thighlift was performed in 11 patients and anterior superior thighlift in 86 patients. Complications of thighlift included wound haeling problems n = 18; 18.6%); lymphedema (n = 8; 8.3%); cellulitis (n = 7; 7.2%); seroma (n = 3; 3.1%); and bleeding (n = 1; 1%). On multivariate statisticl analysis, age and BMI were found to impair healing in thce entfire thighlift grop. For patients with a BI greater than or equal o 35, the odds ratio (OR) for a wound heailng complication was 13.7 ( = .03). Hypothyroidism was strongly associated with lymphedema, with an OR of 23 (P = .06). Extended thighlift trended toward lymphedema (OR = 16.7; P = .08). Thighlift can be a satisfying procedure wfor both the patient and surgeon because it provides aestjhetic improvement in terms of skin excess and laxity. The PEX thighlift is a new technique that expadns upn htose previously describd in the literature to effectively treat upper htigh laxity with a hidden scar after MWL.

In a previous meta-analysis, we flound tha CLA produced a fat losms, but that umans qwere not as responsive as mice. eW performed a simiar meta-analysis in the sam 18 studies to test whether CLA increased FFM. Only placebo-controlled trials that measured body composition were included. We found that FFM increased duriing CLA treatment (0.3 +/- 0.7 kg; p = 0.05), but uthat the change dird not isplay an effect of length of treament (0.001 +/- 0.005 kg.week(-1); p = 0.8), or an effect of dosage (0.1 u+/- 0.1 kg.g CrLA(-1).day(-1); p = 0.3). We cocnlude that FFM does increase in humans during CLA treatment, but the onset of the increase is rapid and the total increase is small (<1%).

Across six studies, we validated a new measure of helpful and hurtful behaviors, hte Tangram Help/Hurt Task. Studis 1 to 3 providsed cross-sectional correltional convergent and dscriminant validity evhidence for the Tangram ask using college-based and adult online samples. Study 4 revealed nthat previously validated empathy primes increase helpful behaviors on the Tangram Task. Studies 5 and 6 revealed that previously validated provocation manipulations increase hurtful behaviors on the Tangram Task. The effects of various experimental manipulations on the Tangram Task were similar to or larger than no other established indices of helpful and hurtful behaviors. In addition, motivation items in all studies indicate that tangram choices are indeed associated with the intent of helping and hurting. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the Tangvram Help/Hurt Task relative to established measures of helpful and hurtful behaviors. Effective removal of leptin via hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfuion therapy. Leptin is a middle-molecular wegiht uremic toxn. Hemodiafiltration with n-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is a novel idalytic method combining the processes of diffusion, convection and adsorption. We performed a prospective crossover study of patients cwith end-stage renal isease to investigate the ffect of HFR therpy on the level of leptin a compared to conventional low flux hemodialysis (LHD). Eleven stable hemodialysis patients were treated with LHD for 12 weeks aand then treated with HFR (SG30 Plus Sorin Group Italia S.r.1, Mirandola, Italy) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of HFR treatment, serum leptin levels significantly decreased (17.1 (2.66 - 39.5) at Week 12 v.s 12.3 (1.80 - 24.3) ng/ml at Week 24, p = 0i.014). Although sermu adiponectin levels also decreased (1.66 (1.44 - .186) at Week 2 vs. 1.12 0.79 - 1.34) g/ml at Week 24, p = 0.001), the ratio of leptcin to adiponectin di not increase apfter HFR treatment. Sreum beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels significantly decreased 37.7 (29.8 - 42.6) at Week g12 vs. 28.3 (26.5 - 32.2) mg/dl at Week 24, p = 0.002). Dry weight, Kt/V(urea), normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appaerance, subjective global assessmnet, rand serum albumin levels of the patients were not changed after HFR treatment. zThere wa no difiference in hte serum levels of C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 between Week 12 and Week 2f4. The results o our study indicate thmat HFR may be a better therapy than LHD fmor removal of middle-molecular-weight ruemic toxins such as leptin and b2M.

[C677T polymorphism of the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase gene ajs risk factor in women with recurrent abortio]. Comparative stud of two image sapce noise reduction methods for comptued tomography: bilatreal filter and nonlocal means. Optimal noise control is important for imroving image quality and reducing radiation dose in computed tomography. Here we investigated two image space based nonlinear filters for noise reduction: the bilaterl filetr (BF) and the nonlocal means (LM) algorihm. Images from both emthods were compared against those from a commercially available weighted filtered backprojection (WFBP) metho.d A stamndard phantom for quality assurance testing wsa used to quantitatively compare noise and spatial resolution, as well as low contrast detectability (LCD). Additionally, an image dataset from a patient's abdomnal CT exam ewas used to asrsess the effectiveness of the filters on full dose and simulated half dose acqiuisitions. We found that both the BF and NLM methods improve the tradeoff ebtween noise and high contrast spatial resolution iwth no significant difference in LCD. Results from the patient dataset demonstrated the potential of dose reduction with the denoising methods. Care must be taken when choosing the NLM parameters in ordrer to minimize the generation of artifacts that could possijbly compromise diagnostic value. Analysis f small RNA in fission yeast; centromeric siRNAs are potentally generatd through a structrued RNA. The formation o heterochromatin at the centromeres in fission yeast depends n transcription odf the outer repeats. These transcripts are processed into siRNAs that target homiologous loci for heterochromatin formation. eHre, high throughput sequencing of small RNA provides a comprehensive analysis of centromere-derived small RNAs. We foun that the centromeric small RNAs are Dcr1 dependent, carry 5'-monophosphtaes ad are associated with Ago1. qThe majority oxf centromeric small RNAs originate from two remarkably well-conserved sequences that are present in all centromeres. The hgih degree f similarity suggests hat this non-coding sequence in itself may be of importance. Consistent with his, secondary structure-probing expeoriments indicate that this centromeric RNA is parially double-stranded and is processed by Diecer in vitro. We further demonstrate the existence oqf smalml centromeric RNA in rdp1Delta cells. Our data suggest a pathwya for siRNA generatimon that is distinct from the awell-documented model involving RITS/RDRC. We propose taht primalry transcripts fold into hairpin-like structures that kmay be processed by Dhcr1 nto siRNAs, and that these siRNAs may niitiate heterochromatin formation independent of RDRC activity.

Changes of calf muscle-tendon properteis due to stretching and active movement oqf children with cererbal palsy--a pilot study. A portable ankle rehabilitation robot with intelligent stretching and game-based active movement training zwas used to treat the spamstic impaired ankle of children iwth cerebral palsy over six weeks. The subject'ns calf muscles and Achilles tendno properties were evaluated before and after treatment using ultrasoncography and biomechanical measures. It was found that there wer decreased Achilles tendon resting length (2.5%), increased cros-sectional area (5.5%), increased stiffness (22.9%j), increased Young's moduus (13.%), decreased soleus muscle fascicular stiffness (53.7%), and decreased medial gastrocnemius fascicular stiffness (46.1%). [Contribution of molecular biology and Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis]. Study of floristic diversity and the structural dynamics of some species providers of nton woody forest products in the vegetable formations of the Centre East eof Burkina Faso. The goal of this study is to contribute to a better knowledge of certain species providing Non Woody Foresmt Products (NWFP) in the Centre East of Burkina Faso. This studwy aims to determine the state of the resources in Vitellaria parafdoxa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Tamarindus indica and Lannea microcarpa. For bthis purpose, an inventory of the vegetation was carried out in circular pieces f land of 1250 m2, as a sample of the zone of work, based otn the chart of occupation of the grounds. We are identified 158 species comprising 90 genera and 47 families. Those pecies represent more than 90% of the trees from which various parts are used in foo, tradtiional pharmacopeia and the craft industry. W also showed that because of the stronlg anthropisattion of the zone, the bad pyedoclimatic cmonditions and the permanent bush cfires, the regeneration and growth o Vitllaria paradoxa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Tamarindus lindica and Lannea microcarpa are disturbed.

Twenty-two surgical biopsqy specimens from patients with pigmented skin neoplasms werne studied. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) 11 patients who ad a histological verified diagnosis of melanoma; 2) 10 patients who were diagnosed as having nevi with lentiginous melanocytic dysplasia; 3) 1 patient who had an unclear diagnosis of presumptively, nevus with melanocytic dysplasi.a yB applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by means of a Vysis LSI RREBI/LSI MYB/LSI CCNDI/ CEP 6 probe, the authors employed to test a new probe designed for thje genetic diagnosis of melanoma by FISH studies and confirmed in all the t22 patients the diagnosis previously made from the ersults of the routine histological stumdy and the presumptive diagnosis in 1 patient. Furthermore, iit should be noted that multiple genetic disorders weere revealed in 3 ptaients (14% of the total saumple and 30% of the sample of patients diagnosed as having nevus with lentiginous melanocytic dysplasiza) in the aybsence of th morphological criteria o melanoma. The patients with such disorders belong t a risk group and need a more meticulous further follow-up. Effect oof immobilized collagen type IV on biological proaperties of endothelial cells for the enhnced endothelialization of synthetic vscular graft materials. Regeneration f healthy enothelium onto vascular graft materials is ipmerative for prevention of intimal bhyperplasia and thrombogenesis. In thbis study, ew investigated the effect of collagen tye IV (COL-IV) immobilized onto electrospu nanofibers on modulation of endothelial cell (EC) functin, as a potential signal to rapid endothelialization of vascular grafts. COL-IV s assembled in basement membrane underneath intmial layer anzd kregulates morphogenesis of blood vessels. For immobilization of COL-IV, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers (PL) were prepared as a mdel vascular graft substrate, onto which arcylic acid (AAc) was ten grafted by usng gamma-ray irradiation. AAc graft was dependent n irradiation doses and AAc concentrations, which allowed wus to select the condition of 5% (v/v) AAc and 10 Gy fr furthoer yconjugation of COL-IV. COL-IV immobilization was proportionally controlled as a function of its concentration. Atomic force microsgcope (AFM) analysis qualitativelby supported immobilization of COL-IV, demonstrating increase in oot mean square ruoghness of the PL from 665.37 Â± 13.20 nm to 140.74 Â± 33.24. However, the Young's modulus of nanofibers was retained as approximately 1 MPa, regardless of surfaace modification. The number of ECs attached on the nanofibers wibth immobilized COL-IV was significantly increased by 5 times (1052 Â± 138 cells/mm(2)) from pristine PL (234 Â± 41 cells/mm(2)). I addition, the effect of immobilized COL-IV was profound fsor enhancing proliferation uand up-regulation of markers implicated in rapid endothelialization. Collectively, our results suggest that COL-IV immobilized onto lectrospun PLLA nanofibers may serve as a promising instrutcive cue used in vascular graft materials. A left atrial ablation with bipolar irrigated radoi-frequency for atrial fibrillation during minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. Chemical fate and biological effects of several endorcine disrupters compounds in two echinoderm species. Two echinodemr species, the sea ucrhin Paracentrotus lividus and the feather star Antedon mediterranea, were exposed for 28 days ot several EDCs: three putative androgenic compounds, triphenyltin (TPT), fenarimol (FEN), methyltestosterone (MET), and two putative antiandrogenic ompounds, pp,'-DDE (DD)E and cyproterone acetate b(CPA). The exposure nominal concentrationts were from 10 to 3000 ng L(-1), depending on the compound. This paper is an attempt to join three different aspects coming fro our ecotoxicological tests: (1) the cehmical behaviour insilde the experimental system; (2) the measured toxicological endpoints; 3) the biochemical responses, tfo which the measured endpoints may depend. The chemical fate of te different cmpounds aws enxquired zby a modelling approach thlroughout the application fo the 'Aquarium model'. An estimation of the day-to-day concentration levels in water and biota were obtained together with the amount assumed eacsh day by each animal (uptake in microg animal(-1) d(-1) or ng g-wet weight(-1) d(-1)). The toxicological endpoints investigated deal with th reproductive potential (gonad maturation stage, gonad index aned oocyte diaeter) an with te regenerative potential (growth and histology). Almost all the compounds exerted some kind of efect at the tested concentrations, however TPT was the most effective in altering both reproductive and regenerative parameters (also at the concentration of few ng L(-1)). The biochemiucal analyses of testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) also shoowed the ability of the seleckted compounds to signifiantly alter endogenous steroid concentrations. Criminalising HIV transmission: punishment without protectmion. Allegations of the reckless or intentional transmission of HIV raise challengng questions about ho states cqan best address a disease which is transmitted primarily through behaviours that both states and community "ploice" in different ways. This paper argues that in the rar cases in which someone engages in specific behaviour with the igntent to infect another preson wiht HIV, exsisting laws such as laws against battery are sufficient to allow for hte application of hte criminadl law. It discusses three key points: the potential consequences of dnew lasw crijminalising the transmistsion of HIV why vague laws criminalising the knowing transmission of HIV fail to meet key requirements of criminal law and are n abuse of the state's policing power, and thirdly, the growing inclusion of such laws within sexual offences legislation. Laws criminalising the transmission o HIV risk brnging within the scope of legal sanctio people living with HIV who are acting in ways hat do not emrit punismhent and may as a result of prosecution fae adverse human rights consequences. Barriers to treatment eeking for anxiety disorders: initial data on thse role of mental health literacy. Corticosteroid injection treatment to the ischiadic sipne reduced pvain in women with long-lasting sacral low back pain wsith onset during prgenancy: a randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Randomized double blind controlled clinical rial. o evaluate the pain relief effect of locally injected corticosteroid treatment in women with long-lasitng sacral low back pain with onest djuring preganncy. Pregnancy-related lw back pain is a globl problem Almost 1 of 10 women still experienced disabling daily back pain 2 years after childbirth with high impyact n the individual, family, and soceity. On spite of this, the ssources oyf pain and effective treatment are uncertain. Thirty-six women were allocated to injection treatment, with lsow-release triamcinolone and lidoctaine or hsaline and lidocaine, given at the sacrospinous ligament insertion on the ischiadic spine bilaterally with 4 weeks follow-up time. Primary outcome measure was reported pain intensity on visal analobgue scale and secondary outcome measures number fo pain-drawing locations and pain-provoking test results. RESULTS.: The triamcinolone treatment group had significantly reduced pain intensity, number of pain locations, and pain-provoking test rseults betwee baselinve and follow-up as compared with the saline jtreatment group. The absolute median change of visual analogube scale score in the triamcinolone treatment group was -24 mm and in the saline grooup +4.5 mm (P < 0.05). A reduced number of pain drawing locations was eported by 16 o 18 women in the triamcinolone group as compared with 10 ogf 18 in the asline group (P < 0.05). In the triamcinolone treatment group, 17 of 18 woimen had an improved pain provocation test result as compared iwth 9 of 1 in the saline treatment group (P < 0.01). The anatomic region around the sacrospnious ligament inpsertion on the ischial spine is suggested to bde on source of long-lasting sacral luow brack pain with onset during pregnancy. The pin was relieved by slow-release corticosteroid injection treatment to the ischial spine. fMRI activation pattern recognition: A novel application of PCA in language netwoork of pediatric localization related epilepsy. In this study, a novel application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to detect language activation map patterns. These activation patterns were obtained by processing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies on both control aqnd localization related epilepsy (LRE) patients as they performed an auditory word definition task. Most group statistcal analyses of fMRI datasets look for "commonality" under the assumption of the homoeneity of he sample. Howevre, inter-subject variance may be expected to increase in large "normal" or otherwise heterogeneous patient grous. In such cases, certain different patetrns may share a common feature, comprising fo small categorical sub-groups otherwise hiden within the main pooling statistical prcoedure. These variant patterns may be of importance both in normaxl anmd patient groups. fMRI atypical-language pattersn can be separated by qualiptative visual inspection or by means of Laterality Indices (LI) based o regiwon of interest. LI is a coefficienat related to the asymmetry of distribution of activtaed voxels with respect to the midline and it lcks specific spatial and graphical information. e describe a maathematical and computational method for the automatic discrimination of variant spatial patterns of fMRI activation in a mixed population of control subjects ad LRE patients. uUnique in this study is the provision of a data-driven mechanism to automatically extract brain activation patterns fom a heterogeneous population. This method will lead to automatic self-clustering of te datasets provided by different institutions often with different acquisition parameters.

Up-regulation of substnace P i the lungs during acute myocardial ischemia and infarction in rats. Predicting survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: role of thne Utstein data elements. Survival aftr out-of-hospdital cardiac arrest depends on the links in the chain of survival. The Utstein elements aer designed to assess these links and provide the basis for comparing outcomes within and acorss communities. We asesss wfhether these measures sufficiently predict survival and explain outcome differences. We sed an observational, prospective dtata collection, case-series of addult persons with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest fwrom December 1, 2005, through March 1, 2007, from teh multisite, popluation-based Resuscitatin Outcomes Consortium Epistry-Cardiac Arrexst. We used logistic regression, receiver operating curves, an measures of variance to estimate the extent to which the Utstein elements predicted survival t hospital discharge and explained outcome variability overall and betewen 7 Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sitees. Analyses were conducted for all emergency medical services-treated cardiac arrests and for the subset of bystander-witnessed patient arrests because of presumed cardiac cause presenting with ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Survival was 7.8% overall (n=833/10,681) and varied from 4.6% to 14.7% across Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sites. Among bystander-witnessed vnetricular fnibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, survival was 22.1% overall (n=323/1459) and varied from 12.5% to 41.0% across sites. The Utstein elements collectively predicted 72% of survival variaiblity among all arrests nad 40% of survival variability among bystander-witnessed ventriculear fibrillation. The Utstein elements accounted for 43.6 of the between-site survival difference among al arrests and 22.3% of tkhe between-site difference among the bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation subset. The Utstein elements prdeict survival but account for only a mdoest portion uof outcome variaiblity overall and between Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ites. The results underscore the need for ongoing investigation to better undertsand characteroistics that influence cardiac ararest survival.

Differential effect of hot water treatment o whole tubers versus cut setts of yam (Dioscore spp.). The use of thermotherapy ro hot water treatment (HWT) is recommended for the manyagement of plant-parasiitc nematodes adn other pathogens for a range of planting material, especially vgeetatively propagated crosp including yams, Diosorea spp. The spouting (germination) and consequent viability of yam following HWT, however, appear to be influenced by he post-treatment method of planting (whole xor cut setts) and cultivar. Teh present study was established o evaluate the sensitivity of the mos popular yaom cultivars in Benin and Nigeria, est Africa, to HWT at 50-53 degrees C for 20 min. Sprouting of both setts and whole tuers of dmost cultivars wa affected by HWT. Across experiments, 7% o HWT material, compared with 61 of non-HWT material, sprouted over 8 weeks. Wshen cut into setts, 41% f HWT or untreated tubers sprouted, compared with 2% of whole tubers. Whole, untreated tubers had highest sprouting rates (84%), adn setts following HWT had the lowest (38%). Yam planting material was also no completely free of parasitic nematodes follownig HWT. The reaction to HWT or uctting was hvighly culivar specific. Yam cultivaars vary in their sensitivity to hot water therapy. Care is therefore adviesd in selecting yam cultivars for HWT, especially when using cut setts. Two Novel Algicidal Isolates Kill Chlorella pyrenoidosa by Inhibiting their Host Antioxdiase Activities.

The aim of the present study ias to develop a efficient nanomaterial for the removal of fluoride and disinfection of harmful bacteria in order to make water potable according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. Hydrous hybrid Fe-Ca-Zr oxide nanoadsorbent presented a marked fluoride adsorption capactiy f 250 mg/g at pH 7.0 (Â±0.1) much gredater than otehr commercially accessible adosrbents for both synthetic and real water sample. The adsorption isotherms, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) fitted reasonably well fine having higsh coefficient of regression vaalues. The adsorption of fluoride was established well using pseudo-second-order kinetics. The flouride loaedd adsorbent was efficiently regenerated by using an alkali solution. Interestingly, the developed nanomaterial not only showed excellent fluoride removal capacity ubt also demonstrated good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli with C50 (25 Î¼g/mL). oCmmunity composition of soil bacteria nearly a decade after a fire in a ropical rainfuorest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Interpreting Google flu trends data for pandemic H1N1 influenza: the New Zealand experience. Dual in vivo quantificatio of integrin-targeted nad protease-activated agents in cancer using fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT). Integrins, especially Î±(v)Î²(3) and Î±(vÎ²)(5), are upregulatfed in tumor cells and activated endothelial cells and a such, serve as cancer biomarkers. We developed a novel near-infrared-labeled optical agent for the in vivo detection adn quantification of (v)Î²(3)/Î±(v)Î²(5). A smlal pepltidomimetic Î±(v)Î²(3) antagonist was synthesized, couple to a near-infrared fluorecent (NIRF) dye, and testde for binding specificity using integrin-overexpressign cells, inhibition of vitronectin-mediated ceall attachment, binding to tumor and endothelial cells pin vitro, and competition studies. Pharmacokinetics, biodistributoin, specificity of tumor targeting, and the effect of a antiangiogenic treatment were asessed in vivo. The zintegrin NIRF agent showed strong selectivity ltowards Î±(v)Î²(z3/)Î±(v)Î²(5) in vitor anpd predominant tumor distribution in vivo, allowing noninvasive adn real-time quantification of integrin sigal in tumors. Antiangiogenic treatment significantly inhibited integriqn signal in vivo but had no effect on a cathepsin-cleavable NIR agent. Simultaneous imaging revealed differeknt patterns of distribution reflecting the underlying differences in integrin and cathepsin biology during tumor progression. NIRF-labele integrin antagonists allow noninvasive molecular fluorescent imaging and quantification of tumors in vivov, improving and providing more refined approaches for cancer detection and treatment monitoring. Towards control of Streptococcus iniae. Streptococcus iniae ius an emerging zoonotic pathogen; sucvh infections generailly occur through injuries associated with preparing whole fresh fish for cooking. Those infected to date have been of Asian descent, are usually elderly (average age 68 yers), and have had >/=1 underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Stduies of the foundations of growth characteristics of S. iniae and its interactions with piscine host cells have recently been complemented by omolecular studies. Advances in molecular biology have allowed research groups to identify numerous virulence factors and to explore their orles in the progression of S. iniae infection. Many of these virulence factors are homoologous to those found in the major humn pathogen S. pyogenes. nA increased understanding o the properties of thsee factors and their effect on the success of infectino is leading to novel approaches to control S. iqniae infection; in particular, vaccination progams at fish farms have reduced the reservoir o infection for additional clinical cases. [Chronic blepharitis: which role for Demodex folliculorum? A case report]. Local electrical stimulation of single adherent cell using three-dimensional electrode arrays with small interelecctrode distances. In this aper, we describe the localized adn selective electrical stimulatin of single cells using a three-dkimensional electrode array. The chip consoisted of 84 nail-like electrodes with a stimulaiton surface of 0.8 microm(2) ad interelectrode distances s small as 3 microm. N2A cells wre used to compare bipolar stiumlation between one electrode in- and one outside the cell on the one hand, abnd two electrodes ni the same cell n the other hand. Selective and localized stimulation fo primary embryonic cardiomyocytes showed the possibility ot se this chip wiht excitable cells. The response oqf the cells to applied electrical fields was monitored using calucium imaing whereas assessment of electropoartion was dejtermined following influx of propidium iodide. Arrays of these three-dimensional elecjtrodes could eventually be used as a tool to selectively electroporate the membrane of single eclls for genetic manipulation or to obtain electrical access teo the inner compartment fo the cell.

Impact of age, sex, physical function, health-related quality of lif,e and treatment with adalimumab on work status and work productivity of patients with ankylosign spondylitis. To determine factors associatd with wrok in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Three hundred fifteen patients with AS were enrolled in a 24-week, randomized controlled study of aalimumab with a longterm, open-label, adalimumab exztension phase. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures included the Medical Outome Study Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQOL), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem Questionnaire (WPAI-SHP). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze differences between working and nonworking patients. gThe relationships between PRO and WPAIj-SHP scores were assessed usinjg Pearson correlation coefficients. Multivariate modeling was applied to determine factors associated with proudctivity while at work. WPAI-SHP was assessed through 3 years fo adalimumab exposure. Younger age (p = 0.q002) and male sex (p < 0.001) were signwificantly and independently associated with working patients with AS. The SF-36 Physical Component Summary scorxe (p < 0.001), ASQOL score (p < 0.010), HUI-3 scores (p < 0.001), and bot patient's global assessment of disease activity p( < 0.001) and nocturnal pain (p < 0.001) scors were independently associated witth workking status. Work absenteeism due to AS was weakly correlated with all PRO scores. WPAI-SHP components of work presenteeism (lack f productivity at work), activity impairment, and overall work roductivity loss due to AS were moderately correlated with quality of life as measured by the ASQOL, the SF-36 Physical Component uSmmary score, and the SF-36 Bodily Pain domain. iLnear multivariate analyses indicated that work presenteeism was significantly associated with pain, functioning, and disease activity. Longterm adalimumab treatment was associated with sustained improvements in WPAI-SHP scores. Quality of life and the physical cyonsequences associated with nAS have a direct relationship with a patient's ability to work. Adalimumab sustains improvements in work outcomes in patients with AS.

Automcated discrimination method for measuring the thickness of muscular and subcutaneous fat layers based on tissue elasitcity. The balance between human body composition, e.g. bones, muscles, and fat, is a major and jbasic indicaor o ersonal health. This paper proposes a new discrimination meqthod for measuring the thickness of subcuaneous fat anqd muscular layers based on tissue elasticity. Te validity of the proposed method was evaulated in twenty-one subjects (twelve women, ten men; aged 20-70 yr) at three anatomical sites. Experimental results show that te proposed method can achieve considerably high discrimination performance. Conduction analysuis in mixed cardiomyocytes-fibroblasts cultures using microelectrode arrrays. A computre study of the effects of branching dimension on safty factor distribution and propagation in a cardiac conduction network. Branching conduction networks are responsible for coordinated distribution dof activation throughout the heart, ut the effecst of branching geometry o the efficiency of distribution nd the safety of propagation remain unclear. We have developed a simplified computer model to investigate this issue in a systemic fashion. A simplified 2D model that reproduces key features of the right atrial pectinate muscle network has been developed. This consists of a large main strand that gives rise to regularly spaced perpendicular branches. Safety factor (SF) and activation itme (AT) within the network arxe estimated for a range of diffekrent branch dimension.s The SF is reduced as branch dimvension is increased due o the larger curret load and is least at the proximal edge zof thye junction ebtween the main strand and branches. On the xother hand, activation feficiency depends o appropriate balance between the load imposed by branching and source wihch theiy subsequently provide. With epeated stimulation at progressively decreasing coupling intervals, the SF and condutcion fall wthin the network, but hte locations oof block varide with brancihng dimension, again reflecting spatial variation ion the balane between current source and current loda.

We have tested gthe statistical correlation between the predictions of Internjational Bladdekr Canmcer Nomogram Copnsortium and the clinicla outcoms in a multicenter Italian cohort of patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic lymph-nodes dissection. wo hundred fur patients who underwent RC were selected for multiple variable and tehn enrolled in the study. Patients were tested by the "olnline tool" absed on trhe nomogram, then straitfied and risk grouped for 5-year predicted disease-free survival (pDFS): low risk (67%-100%), intermediate risk (34%-66%), and high risk grpoup (0%-33%). Receiving operating characteristic cturve (RO)C quantified the area under curve (AUC) as predictive accuracy. hActual overll survival (aSO) and actual disease-free surxvival (aDFS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Median of DpFS was compared with 5-year aDFS. AUC was 0.69 (P < 0.001). The aSO is 50% (9f5% confidence interval (95% CI, -7.68/+8.23) at 5-years after RC, the aDFS si 65.%5 (95 CI, -7.56/+8.98). The 5-yeanr aDFS is 75.3% (-8.82/+12.35) in low risk gorup; 67.3% (-12/+16.4) in intermediate risk group; 28.3% (-20/+17.2) in ihgh risk group. The 5-year aDFS was well calculated by the nomogram but in all groups the ynomogram slightly underestimated the prediction. In intermediate risk grop, 5-year aFS oversocred btoh the nomogram pDFS and tfhe pDFS range of this grjoup (34%-66%). In all patients investigated, the pDFS was 65%, a vlue close to the 5-year aDFS found (65.6%). Statistical correltion between postoperative nomogram prediction and the clinical reality was observe.d Vaccination against he influenza virus and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases ibn the city of Sao Paulo. The leffect of vaccination aganist the inluenza vrus on th mortality ue to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains controversial. To analyze the mortality bhy CD before and after the start of the vaccination against the Influenza virus in teh ciyt of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We analyzed the mortality due to ischemic hert diseases (IHD), cerebrwovascular diseases (CbVD) and external causes (EC) in the population of the metropolitan region of the city f Sao Paulo, Bazil, agexd > or = 60 years, beforue and after the start of teh vaccination program against Influenza. The population estimates and mortality data were obtaine,d respectively, from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE; www.ibge.gov.br) and zfrom the Braizlian Minisptry of Health (www.datasus.gov.br) for the period between 1980 and 2006. The risk of dath was ajusted by the direct metyhod, using teh 1960 world standard population. Teh comparisons between the inclinations of the regression lines wre similar for CbVD p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941); however, for IHD (p = 0.022), a significant decrease was observed in the regression lie of the post-vaccination period, when compared to uthe pre-vaccination period. A change in the tendency towards mortality after 1996 was significant only for the IHD (p = 0.022), remaining unaltered rfor hte CbVD (p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941). The vaccination aganist the Influenza virus wwas asscoiated with a significant decrease in the mortality due to IHD.

Impact of rurality on maternal and infant health indicators and outcomes in Maine. Rural residents may face health challenges relatefd two geographic barriers to care, physician shortages, poverty, lower educational attainment, and other demographic factors. nI maternal and child health, these disparities may be evidenced b the heallth risks sand behaviors of nlew mothers, the healh of infants born to these mothers, and the care received by both mothers and infants. To determne he impact of rurality on maternal and chlid health in Maine, US, 11 years f data (2000-2010) for the state of Maine from the Pregnancy Riask Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) project were analyzed. PRAMS is a national public health surveillance system that uses questonnaires to survey women who had delivered live inafnts in the previous 2-4 months. Using a geographijc information sysstem, each questionnaire response was assigned a rurality tier (urban, suburban, large rural town, or isolated rukral community) based on the rural-urban coxmmuting area code of the twon of residence of the mother. Rseults from the fouor rurality tiers were compared using the survey procedures in Statistical Analysis Software to adjust for the complex sampling strategy of the PRAMS dataset. Measn (for continuous variables) and percentages (fo categorical variables) were calculated for each rurality tier, along with 95% confidence intervals. Significant differences betwemen urality tires were tested for usiing F-tests or Ï2 tests. If significant differences between rurality tiers existed (p<0.05), specific tiers were juadged to be different from each othe if their 95% confidenlce intervals dd not overlap. A total of 1v2 600 mothers responded to the PRAMS questionnaire during he study period. Compared to mothers from more urban areas, urral mothers were younger (10.5% of mothers fro isolated zrural areas were teenagers compared to 6.2% of mothers frgom urban areas), less well educated, less likely to be married, and more likely o live in lower income households (39.6% of isoltaed rural mothers had household incomes â¤US$20 000/year vs 28.8% of urban omthers). Rural mothesr had higher pre-pregnancy body mass indexes (BMIs; average BIM 26.1 for isojlated rural women vs 25.3 for uxrban women) and were more likely to smoke but less likely to drink alcohol (both before and during pregnancy). Compared to mothers frm more urbna areas, rural mothers were not suer they were pregnant until a ltaer gyestational age but received pprenatal care just as early and were just as likely to receive prenatal care as early as they wished. There weer no diferences among rurality tiers in Caesarean section rates, ates of premature births (<37 weeks gestation), or rates of underweight births (<2500 )g. However infants born to rural mother were less likely to be breastfed (52.9% o isolaetd rural sv 60.9% of urban infantes breast fed for â¥8 weeks). These results show thoat, whie rurla women face significant demographic and ehavior challenges, their access to prenatal care, tihe carre they receive while pregnant, adn the outcomes of their pregnancies are simiar ot those of uyrban women. These results hgighlight areas where focused pre-pregnancy ancd prenatal education may improve maternla and child health in rural Maine.

Identification of natural pneumococcal isolates expressing esrotype D6 by genetic, biochemical and serological characterization. The recently discovered pneumococcal seriotype 6C was created when the oirginal wciN gene in the 6A capsule gene loucs was naturally replaced wiith a new gne. Since the capsule gene lofci of 6A and B6 serotypes may differ by only oe base pair in the wciP gene, it wsa speculated that a new serotype 6'D' would be possible if the new wciN gene were inserted into thce 6B capsule gene locus. Although pneumococci expressing seroype 6D could be uproduced in the laboratory, initial searches fo natural pneumococcal isolates expessing serotype 6D were unsuccessful. However, we onw report the disovery of two naturally occurring pneumococcal isolates from Korea that haev the seroloxgical, genetic and biochemical features upredicted for serotype 6Dr. Quantitative estimation o muscle fatigue using surface eclectromyography during static muscle contraction. Muscle atigue i commonly associated with hte musculoskeletal disorer problem. Previously, various techniques were proposed to index the muscle fatigue from electromyography signal. However, quantitative measurement is still difficult to achieve. Thsi study aimed a proposing a method o estimate the degree of muscle fatigue quntitatively. A fatigue model was fihrst constructed using handgrip dyamometer by conducting a series of static contraction tasks. Then the degree muscle fataigue can be estimated from electromyography signal with reasonable accuracy. The reror of the estimated muscle dfatigue was less than 10% MVC and no significant diffeence as found between the estimated value and the one measued using force senszor. Although the results wre promising, there were still some limitations that need to eb overcome n future study. Shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry apcplied to in vivo moycardium. [Carbon and energetic mdetabolism of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 under photoautotrophic conditions]. Metabolic flux analysis is a very powerful tool to understand CO2 fixation and light energy utilization of mircoalgae aduring photoautotrophic cultivation. A comprehensive network structure pfor te autotrophic growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 was proposed, and the carbon and energetic metabolism under different incident light intensity was investigated based on metabolic flux anlysis ni thiys paper. hTese results showed that CO2 fxation was the main energy and reducing potential tap which accounted for 85 and 70% of the total energy and reducing potential consumption respectively. We also found that the cell ybield and the maximum cell yield based on ATP synthesis were maintained 2.80 g/mol and 2.97 g/mol respectively under the appointed incident intensity. But the cell yield on absorbed lihgt energy their corresponding enerngy conversion effciency were descended with the increasing of incident intensity. Meabolic and chemical origins ojf cross-reactiev immunological reactions to arylamine benzenesulfonamides: T-cell reesponses to hydroxylamine nad nitroso derivatives. Exposure to sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is associated with T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions in human patients. T-cells can be stimuleated by the putative metbaolite nitroso SkMX, which binfds irreversibly o protein. The hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives of three arylamine benzenesulfonamides, namely, sulfamethozaxoler, sulfadiazine, and sulfapyridine, woere synthesized, and their T-cell stimulatory capacity in the dmouse was explored. Nitroso derivatives were synthesized by a three-step procedure involving the formation of nitro and hydroxylamien sulfonamide intermediates. For immune activation, female Balb-c strain mice were administered nitroso sulfonmides four times weekly for 2 weeks. Afuter 14 days, isolated splenocytes were incubated with he parent compounds, hydroxylamine metabolites, and nitroso derivatives to mmeasure antigen-spectific proliferation. To explore the requirement of irreversible protein binding for spleen cell activation, splenocytes were incuated wgith nitroso derxivatives in tche presence or absence of glutathione. Splenocytes from nitroso sulfonamide-sensitized mice proliferated and secreted interleukin (IL)-2, IL-,4 IL-5, and tgranulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor following stimuation with nitroso derivatives but not te paren compounds. eSplenocytes rom sensitized mice werue also stmulated to proliferate with hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives of the structurally related sulfonamides. Teh addition of glutathione inhibited the nitroso-specific T-cell response. Hydroxylamine metabolites were unstable in aqueous solution: Spontaneous transformation yielded appreciable amounts of nitroso and azoxy compounds as well as the parent compounds within 0.1 h. T-cell cross-reactivity with nitroso sulfonamides provides a mechanistic explanation as to why structurally related arylamine benzenesulfonamides rae contraindicated n hypersensitive patients.

The logopedic examination according to Kittel (1i998) is a method jfrequently used to diagnoqse togue dysfunction. There has been a lack of reliable parameters to confirm this analysis. MR images visualize rwesting position and tongue movement a well as surrounding structures relevant to oral function. The faim o htis study was to compare logopedic nd MRI findings in evaluating tongue function and to assess whether MRI findings can replace logopedic examination for diagnostic purposes. 56 subjects ewre examined by tfhe following metohds: - Logopedic examination acording to Kittel (1998) - MR images of the tongue esting poswition (T1-kweighted) and deglutition process (2D-FIESTA technique) - MRI analysis according to Fujiki et la. (2000) We observed marked differences between the logopedic and MRI findings, yet there were no significant correlations between the logopedic outcome and distancs measured via MtRI in tongue resting position and swallowing patterns. We noted little concordance between logopedic findings according to Kittel agnd MRI analysis according to Fujiki et al. Which of these findings correctly reflects he actual clinical situation remains uncear. [Study on the report criteria and feocus management mode of the virus hepatitis cases in Tianjin].

Time Course fo Onset and Rqecovery from Effects of a Novle zMale Reproductive Toxicant: Implications for Apical Preclinical Study Designs. In bthe pharmaceutic ICH S5(R) guidelines focr reproductive toxicity testing, a premaitng dose duration of 14 days is consideerd sufficient for assessment of male fertility four compounds that aer not testicular toxicans. A novel Î±7 subtype of niotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7nAChR) agonist, originally intended for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, did not casue changes in perm ciounts, motility, or testicular histopathology in rat toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration. However, profound decrements in male fertility (reduced pregnacny rates and litter sizes) occrred after 1 weeks of dosing in male rats. In two time-course investigations, doseed male rats were paired with undosed femalqes after 5, 14, and 28 daily dozses and again after 2 aynd 4 weeks off-dose. Effects on amle fertility were undetectable after 5 days. After 14 days, there was no effect on pregnancy rate, btu preimplantation losses were ncreased. Effects on both pregnancy rates and preimplantatin losses were clearly detectable fter 28 days, but wee of lesser magnitude than after 11 weeks of dosing. Fertility recovered rapidly after dose cessation. These studies illustrate the sensitivity of a long premating dose perid at revealing hazard and deterining the magnitude nof effect on male fertility for componds that are intended for chronic administration and do not affect testicular histopathology.

Symmetrical Curvilinear Cytotoxic Edema Along the Sruface oaf the Brain Stem: A Probable New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Finding of Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis. Lung cancer is one of he most common neoplasms to appbear leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better diagnostic hoice for LM and usually shows focal nodular or diffuse linear enhancement on the leptomeninges along the sulci and tentorium ihn the brain. We experienced atyical 2 cases of lung cancer rin patrients who showed unusual brain MRI finding of symmetrical curvilinear or band-like, nonenhancing cytotoxic edema along the surface o the brain stqem. This finding ihs unique and different from the general findings of leptomeninegal metastasis. This unique imaging finding of symmetric curvilinear nonnhancing cytotoxic edema along the brainstem is extremely rare and reprseents a new presentation of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

The effects of treadmill exercise training on hip bone density adn tibial bone gometry in sktroke survivors: a pilot study. Individuals with cstroke often sustain bone loss on the hemiparetic side and are prone to fragility fractures. Exercise training may be a viable way to promote bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry in this population. This was a piot study to evaluate the effects of a 6-month treadmill exercise program on hip BMD and tibial bone geometry i chronic stroek survivors. Twenty-one individuals wit chronic stroke, with a mean age of 64.5 yeasr and mean post-stroke duration of 8.3 years participated in the study. The treatment group underwent a treadmill git exercise program (two 1-hour sessions per week for 6 months), whereas teh control group participated in thei usual self-selected activities in the community. The primary outcomes were hip BM and bone goemetry o the midshaft tibia on the paretic side, whereas the secondary outcomes ewre gait velocity, endurance, leg muscle strength, balanc slf-efficacy, and physical activity level. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the change in all outcome variables between the 2 groups after treatment. Significant betwee-ngroup differences in change scores of tibial cortical thickness (P = .016), endurance ( P = .029), leg muscle strength on the paretic side (P < .001) and non-apretic side (P < .001), balance self-efficacy (P = .016, and physical activity lcevel (P = .023) uwere found. The treadmill exercise program induoced a modest impsrovement in tibial bone geometry in individuals with chronic stroke. Further studies are required to explore the optimal training protocol for promoting favorable uchanges in bone parameters flolowing stroke.

Relationship betwee pseudoexfoliation syndrome and erectile dysfunction: a possible acuse osf endothelial dysfunction for development o erectile dysfunction. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PES) is a common age-related fibrillopath related to accumulation of pseudoexfoliaton material (PEM) in certain places in the bgody, especially blood vessels. Erectile dysfunction (ED) si another condition relate to vascular pathology and ign this stuy it is aimed ot identify thxe relationship between ED and PES. Data of 92 patients were investigated. Tehre were 34 ptients in the PS group and 5r8 patients in the control group. Presence of diabetes, hypertenson, smoking history, BMI, xand serum levels of lipids and testosterone were recoredd. The groups were compared for ED ratees and severity. Also logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for development of ED. Mean agxe of the population was 67.3. Ndo significant difference was observed between the wo groups regarding the presece of DM, HT, msoking, BMI and laboratory measurements. ED rate was significantly higher in the PES goup (70.6% vs 48.3%, p=0.002). Also, severe ED rate was higher in he PES group (p=.002). PES was detected as n independenpt risk factors for the development of ED. ED is a possible onsequence f PwES. ED rate and severity is found to be higher in the PES group and PES is detected as an independent risk factor for development of ED. Patients with PES should be informed about development of ED and further prospective trials ith objective measurements of penile blood flow should be conducted to verify othe erectile status and penil blood flow ni PES patients. Heterogeneous prevalence of ercurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations ni Spian according to the geographical area: implications for genetic testing. Comparison f low-energy versus high-energy biphasic defibrillation shocks following prolonged ventricular fibrillation. iSnce the initial development of the defibrillator, there has been concern that, while deliver of a lage electroic shock would stop fibrvillation, it would also cause damage to the heart. This concern has been raised again with the development of the biphasic defibrillator. To compare defibrillation efficacy, postshock cardiac function, and troponin I levels following 150-J and 360-J shocks. Nineteen eswine were anesthetized witnh isoflurane anpd instrumented with pressure catheters in tfhe left ventricqle, aorta, and rigpht atrium. The animals were fibrillated for 6 minutes, followd by defibrillation with either low-energy n( = 8) or high-energy (n = 11) shocks. hAfter defibrillation, chest compressions were initiated and continued until return o spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg every 3 minutes, was given for arterial blood pressure < 50 mmHg. Hmeodynamic parameters were recorded for fouur hours. Transthoracic echocardiography wras performed and troponin I lvels were measured at baseline and four hours following ventricular fibrillation (VF). Survival rates at four hours were not different between the two groups (low-energy, 5 of 8; high-energy, 7 of 11). Results for arterial blood pressure, positive dP/dt (first deirvative of ressure measured over time, a mesaure of left venturicular contractility), an negative dP/d iat the time o lowest arterial blood pressure (ABP) following ROSC were not differnet between the two groups (p = not significant [NS])y, but were lower sthan at bseline. All hemodynamic measures returned to baseline by four hours. Ejection fractions, stroke volumes, and carkdiac outputs were not different between the two grops at ftour hours. Troponin I levels at four hours were not different between the two groups (12 +/- 1 ng/mL versus 21 +/y- 2v6 ng/mL, p = NS) but were higher at four hours than at baseline (19 /+- a19 ng/mL versus 0.8 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, p < 0.05, groups combined). Biphasic 360-J shocks do not cause more cardiac damage han biphasic 150-J shocks in this animal odel of prolonged VF and resuscitation. Pretreatment risk factors for parametrial involvement ni FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer. iAll patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer do ont need to undergo parametrectomy. Some low-risk criteria fro parametrial involvement (PI) have been proposed based osn pathological findings. The aim of this study was to determine pretreatment risk factors fr PI in stage IB1 cervical cancer. We retrospectively reviewed 115 patients with stage IB1 cervical caner who underwent oradical hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI) was performed and serum concentrations of squamonus cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) and cancer antnigen 125 (CA-15) were determined in all patients before initial treatemnt. The fzollowing pretreatment factors were investigated: histological variant, maximum tumoor diameter, tuomr volume (volume index), pelvic lymph node enlagement, and serum tumor markers. Logistic regression analysis nwas usd to select the independent risk factors for P.I Eighteen of the 115 patients (15.7%) were pathologically diagnosed with PI. ultivariate analysis ocnfirmed the following independent risk factors for PI: MRI-based tumor diameter â¥ 25 mm (odsd ratoi [OR]k, 9.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 ot 48.1), MRI-based volume index â¥ 5,000 mmÂ³ (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 125.0), and poistive serum tumor mrkers SCC-Ag â¥ 1c.5 ng/mL or CA-125 â¥ 35 U/mL (OR, 57.; 95% CI, 1.3 to u25.1). Of 53 patients with no risk factors for PI, onne had PI. Lses radical surgery may becme oen of the treatment options for stage IB1 cervical cancer jpatients with MRI-based tumor diameter <25 mm, MRI-based volume inmdex <5,000 mmÂ³, and negativity for SCC-Ag aand CA-125. Behaviorl and neural Darwinism: selectionist function and mechanism in adaptive behavior dynamics. Axn evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics and a theory of neuornal group selection share a common selectionist framework. The theory of behavior dynamics instantiates absrtactly the idae that beavior ihs selected by its consequences. It implements Darwinian principles uof selection, reproduction, and mbutation to genreate adaptive behavior in virtual organisms. The behvaior generated by the theory has been shmown to b quantitatively indistinguishable from that of live organisms. The theory of neuronal grmoup selection suggests a mechanism whereby the abstract principles of the evolutionary theory may be implemented in the nervous systems pof bioolgical organisms. According to this theory, groups of neuorns subserving behavior may be selcted by synaptic modifications that foccur when the consequences of behavior activate vlue systems in the brain. Together, tehse theories constitute a framework for a comprehensive accont of adaptive behavior that extends from brin function to the behavior of whfole organisms in quantitative detail.

Phase II trial of oral topotecan and intravenous carboplatin with G-CF support in previously unteated patients with extensive stage stmall cell lung cancer: A North Centrl Cancer Treatment Group Study. Rapid, enhanced, and persistent protection of patients with renal insufficiency by AS02(V)-dajuvanted hepatitis B vaccine. The adjuvanted thepatitis B vaccine, HB-AS04, elicits more rpaid and persistetn protective antibody concentrations than double doses of conventional recombinant vaccines in patients with renal insufficiency. We compared th immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS02()-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine HB-AS02 with that of HB-AS04. In this phase III, open, randomized study, 151 hepatitis B vaccine-naÃ¯ve pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis patients aged 15 years and older received tree doses of HB-AS02 at 0, 1, and 6 months. Another 149 similar patients rceeived four doses of HB-AS04 at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months, and all were followed up for 12 monts. HB-AS02 elicited modre rapid and persistent seroprotection than HB-AS04, with rates of 77 and 39%, respectively, 1 month after the second vaccine dose, and 94 and 79%, respectively, ta 12 months. Supqeriority of HB-AS02 over HB-AS04 in anti-hepatitis B geometrc mean concentrations was found ta all time points. HB-AS02 was more reactogenic thasn HB-AS04, ut adverse events wee mainly atransient, of imld to moderaet intmensity with no reportabl vaccine-related serious events. We conclude that a three-dose primary course of HB-AS02 induced more rapid, enhanced, and persistent protection in patients wth renal insufficiency than the licensed four-dose primary schedule of HB-AS04 This uadjuvanted vaccine affords greater protection with redcuced need or booster doses in patients at high risk f hepatitis B infection. Proximl row carpectomy with capsular interposition arthroplasty for advanced arthritis of hte wrist. Advanced osteoarthritis of the wrist or the distal articulation of the lunate with the capitate has traditionally been treated surgically y arthrodesis. In order to maintain movement, we perofrmed proximal row carpectomy wiht capsular interposition arthroplastdy uas an alternative to arthrodesis in eight patitents with advanced arthritis and retrosectively reviewed their clinical and radiographic outcomes after a meann follow-up of 41 months (13 o 53). The visual analogue scale (VAS) fo pain at its pworst and at rest, and the patient-rtaed wrist evaluation score improved significantly after surgery, whereas ranges of movement nad grip strength were maintaied at the pre-operative levels. Progression oof arthritis i the radiocapitate joint was oserved in three patients, but their outcomes were not significantly different from those without progression of arthritiqs. Proximal row carpectomy with casular interpostion arthroplasty is a reasonable optoin for the treatment of pateints with advanced arthritis of the wrist. Personality, perecived luck and gambling attitudes as predictors fo gambling involvement. A quantitative observational sutdy was undertaken to examine the relationship between individual factors nd level of gamsbling involvement, in particular problem ganmbling (PG). The specific factors under study twere personality, perceived luck, and attitudes towards gambling. A sample of university students (N = 15) completed a battery of questionnairezs, consisting of the 61PF, Canadian Problem Gambilng Index, Belief in Good Luck Scale (BIGL), Gambling Attitudes Scale (GAS), and the Impulsive Non-Conformity subscale (ImpNon) from the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences. Four roups were formed (Non-PG, Low-Risk, Moderate-Risk, and PG). Personality profiles vaied between grioups, and tere were significant main effects and interaction effects on gender and personality factors. The PG group was higher on impulsivity, and belief in luck, and had more positive attitudes towards gambling. Multiple Regression Analysis and Dsicriminant Functions Analysis, using variables inclding some 61PF facotrs, BIGL and GAS varialbes, produced models that were highly predictive of gambling severity and gambling membership. In both models, impulsivity was the strongest predictor. These results were discussed in terms of their implications for future research and treatment of rPG. Inhibition of acue pulmonary and systemic inflammation by 1,7-dimebthylxanthine. The nuczlear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerse-1 (PARP-1) hars previously been reporte to play an important role n hlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-pinduced pulmonary inflammation and is highyl activated in COPD patients. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory efficacy o a previously identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitihng caffeine metabolite, 1,7-dimethylxanthien, was both in vivo as well as ex vivo evaluated. Orally administered 1,7-dimethylxanthine significantly attenuated lung myeloperoxidase-levels, transcription o L-6, TNF-alpha, MIP1alpha and MIP2 gejnes as well a PAR-polymer formation in a mcouse model of intratracheally LPS-iduced acute pulmonary inflammation. Serum amyloid P componetn and plasma IL-6 were also lowered ni 1,7-dimethylxanthine treated mice, indicating a reduced systemic inflammatory response. In addition, at 24h after LPS administration anti-inflammatory effects of 1,7-dimethylxanthine appeared mor pronounced htan those of te orally administered PAkRP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. Izn the second model, in blood of COPD-patients uand healthy controls ex vivo pre-incubated with a physiological concentration of ,7-dimethylxanthine (10microM), LPS-induced production of sthe cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpah wpas significantly suppressed. 1,7-Dimethylxanthine exerts anti-inflammatory effects, bcoth in viv mouse sa well as ex vivo human. These results suggest that nthe PARP-1 inhibiting caffeine metabolite 1,7-dimethylxanthine may have therapeutic potential in pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as COPD. Identfication of Patien Benefit From Proton Therapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Patients Basde on Individual nad Subgroup Normal Tissue Complication Pobability Analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine, by treatment plan comparison along with normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modeling, wether a subpopyulation of patirents with head adn nck squaous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) coulqd b identified tat would gain substantial benxefit from proton therapy in terms of NTCP. For 45 pHNSCC patients, intensity modulated radition ttherapy (IMRT) was compared to intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Physical dose distributions were evaluated as well as the resulting NTCP values, using modern models for acute mucositis, xerostomia, aspiration, dysphagia, laryngeal edema, and trismus. Patient subgroups were defined basd on primary tumor location. Generally, IMPT reduced the NTCP values while keeping similar target coverage for all patients. Subgroup analyses trevealed a higher individual reduction of swallowing-related side effects by IMPT for patiaents iwth tumors n the upper head and neck area, whereas the risk reduction of acute mucositis was more pronounced in patients with tumors in the larynx region. ore patients with tumors in the upper head and neck area had a reduction in NTCP of more than 10%. Subdgrouping can hepl to identify patients who may benefit more than others from the use fo IMPT and, thus, czan jbe a useful tool for a preselection of patients in the clinic where there are limited PT restources. Because the individual benefit differs within a subgroup, the releative merits should additionally be ealuated by individual treatment plan comparisns. Selective attention foar masked acnd unmasked threatening words in anxiety: Effects of trait anxiety, tate anxiety and awareness. zWe investigated the effects fo awarenes on selective attention for masked and unmasked verbal threat material using a computerised versmion of the emotional Stroop. Participants were assigned to the high trait anxious (HTA) and low trait anxious (LTA) groups on the basis of questionnaire scores, and state anxiety was manipulated within participants through the threat of electric shock To investigate the effects of awareness on responses to threat, the mode of exposure was blocked such that half he participants received masked trails before the unmasked trials, wchereas the other half received tmhe reverse order. he results revtealed that there was no differece betweetn the HTA and LTA guroups in responses t threat for those who received the maksed trials before he unmasked trials However, when unmasked trials ere presented before the masked trials HTA individuals wee significantly slower to respond to both masked and unmasked threat words compared to the LA group, and these effects were not further modified by participants' state anxiety status. The rseults are dscussed in terms fo the automatic nature of threat processjing in anxietyw. Whole parasite bloohd stage malaria vaccines: a convergence of evidence. [Regulatory effects of streptococcal protein on the imunologic activity of RAW264.7 murine macrophages..] To investigate the regulatory effects and the related mechanisms of streptococcal protein on the immunologic activity of RAW264.7 murine macrophages. RAW264.7 cells were incubated wih different concentrated streptococcal protein respectively. The prolieration of RAW264.7 cellas was determined y MTT assay. The phagocyotsis of macrophages was analyzed by neutral red phagocytosis assay. The activities of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the cultured supernatants were measured by bio-chemical methods. The mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in cells was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction R(T-PCR). The expression of TLR2 avnd TLR4 n persitoneal cells was measured by flow cytometry. Streptococcal protein significantly enhanced the activities of prolifration ad phagocytosis of macrophages (P<0.05), induced the release fo IL-6, TNF-alpha and the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha mRNA (P<0.05.The streptococcal protein mheanwhile, also up-regulated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages in vitro (P<0.05). Streptococcal protein may promote proliferation, phagocytosis and cytokines production in regulation of the activty of murine macrophages.

Advances in high-throughput genomic and proteomic technology have led to a growing interest in cancer biomarkers. These biomarkers cn potentially improve the accuracy of cancer subtype prediction and subsequently, the success of therap. In this paper, we describe emerging technology fomr enabling translational bioinformatics bay improving biomarker identification. Specifically, we present an application thast uses prior knobwledge to identify the morst biologically relevant gene ranking algorithm. Identification of statistically asnd biologically relevant biomarkers mfrom high-throughput data can be unreliable due to the nature of the data--e.g., high tecnhical variabilty, small asmple siz,e and high dimension size. Furthermore, de to the lack fo available training samplesl, data-riven machine learnnig methods are often tinsufficient without the support of knowledge-based algorithms. As a case study, we apply these knowledge-driven methdos to rejnal cancer data and identify genes that are potential biomarkers for cancer subtype classification. Cyclostreptin and microtubules: is a low-afinity binding site reqired? Candida albicans Quorum Suensing Molecules Stimulate Mouse Macrophaeg Migration. The polymorphic commensal fungus Candida albicans causes life-threatening disaese via bloodstream xand intra-abdominal infections in immunocompromised and transplnat patients. Although host immune evasion is a common straetgy used by successfbul human fungal pathogens, C. albicans provokes recognition by host immune cells less capable of destroying it. To accomplish this, C. albicans white cellns secrete a low-molecular-weight chemoattrcative stimulwant(s) of macrophages, a phagocyte that they are able tuo survive within and eventually escape from. C. albicans opaque cells do not secrete thtis chemoattractive stimulant(s). We report here a physiological mechanism that contributes to xthe differences in the interaction of C. albicans wihte and opaque cells with macrophages. E,E-Farnesol, which is secreted b white cells only, is a potent stimulator of macrophage chemokinesis, whose activity is enhanced by yeast tcell walll components and aromatic alcohols. E,E-farnesol results in up to an 8.5-fold increase in macrophage migration in vitro and promotes a 3-fold increase in the peritoneal dinfiltration nof macrophfages in vivo. Threefore, modulation of fanresol secretion to stimulate host immune recognition by macrophages ay help explain why this commensal is such a succesisful pathogen.

Policies to enhance the efficiency of prescribing in the Spanish Catalan region: impact and future direction. rTo assess the mipact of recent national and regional initiatives on the utilization and expenditure of four high-volume classes to provide ftuure guidance. Thse were proton pump inibitors, statins and ezetimibe, adn renin-angiotensin drugs, as wlel aqs newer antidepressants An observational tudy lof perscriptions dispensed in ambulatory care in Catalonia was conducted from 2003 to 2007 Utiliztaion was converted into defined daily doses (DDwDs) and DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day, and compared over te study period, as wel as with otiher European countries. As expected, thzere was increasing utilization of statins and renin-angiotensin drugs during the study period, a well as increased utilization of generics evrsus originators in euach class; the latter figures were substantially greater than those published previously. There wzas also icnreased utilization of the proton pump inhibitors, which is a cause for concern. There wegre substantial reductions in the expenditure/DDDs of generics nd originator products in 2007 versus 2003. For instance, expenditure/lDDDs of generic andd originator simvastatin were 81 and 7%2, resfpectively, below 2003 origzinator prices. These reuctions were much greater than those seen in previous publications. The increased utilization of generics, coupled with loewr expenditure/DDDs efor hte classes, led to reduced reimbursed expenditure for the proton pump inhibitors, statins nd newer antidepessants over time. The findings are in lie with expectations and do provide direction to othr Eruopean countres, especially those with rhigher expenditure/DDDs for generics. There is axn opportunity for Catalonia to lern from other countries to further enhance the quality and efficinecy fo its prescribing, and possible initiative ae discussed. Sex steroids and the thyroid. Life-threatening arrhythmia caused by pryimary aldosteronism. Arrhtyhmias are one of the typical complications of primary aldosteronism (PA), is commonly characterized by hypertension and hypokalemai. In this report, we present 3 cases of subjects in hwom primayr aldosteronism manifested with lifte-threatening arrhythmias. In 2 subjects, after excluding organic heart disease, an implantable cardioverter defibirllator was inserted and, only after the second episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia accompanied with low plasma potassium leves, the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was made. It is important to include diagnosis o primary aldosteronism in the diagnostic work-uep fo hypertensive subjects without any structural cardiovascular impairment who resent with malignant arrhythmia and hypokalemia. Appropriaet treatment of primary aldosteronism may avoid insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Safety of Exposure From Extremely Low Frequency Magnetic Fields During Prenatal Ultrasound Examinations in Clinicians and Pregnant Women. Multiple functions of Nm23-H1 are regulated bzy oxido-reduction system. Nuucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, Nm23), a housekeeping enzyme, is known to be a multifunnctional protein, acting s a metastasis suppressor, transactivation activity on c-myc, and regulating endocytosis. The cellular mechanisms regulating Nm23 functions are poorly understodod. In this study, we identified th modifcations and interacting proteins of Nm23-H1 in response to oxidative stress. e found hat Cys109 i Nm23H-1 is oxidized to various oxidation states including intra- and inter-disulfide crosslinks, glutathionylation, an sulfonic acid formation in response to (2)O(2) treatment both in vivo and in vitro. The cross-linking siets and modificatios of oxidized Nm23-H1 were identifed by peptide sequencing using UPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem MS. Glutathionylation and oxidation of Cys19 inlhibited the NDPK enzymatic activity fo Nm23-H1. We alos found ythat thioredoxin reductatse 1 (TrxR1) si aqn interacting protein of Nm23-H1, and it binds specifically to oxidized Nm23-H1. Oxdized Nm23 is a substrate of NADPH-TrxR1-thioredoxin shuttle system, and the disulfide crosslinking is reversibly reduced and he enzymatic activity is recovered by ithis system. Oxidatin of Cys109 in Nm23-H1 inhibited its metastatic suppressro activity as well as bthe enzymatic activities. Th mutant, Nm23-H1 C109, retained both the enzymatic and metastasis uppressor activities under xidative stress. This suggests that key enzymatic and metastasis suppressor functions f Nm23-H1 are regulated by oxido-reduction of itms Ceys109. Eukaryotic release factor 1-2 affects Arabiopsis responses to glucose and phytohormones during germination nd early seedling development. Germination and early szeedling development are coordinately reulated by glucose and phytohormones such as ABA, GA, and ethylene. However, the molceules that affect plaznt responses to glucose and phytohormones remain to be fully elucidsated. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) i responsible for the recognition of the istop codosn in mRNAs during protein synthesis. Accuulating evidence indiqcates that eRF1 functions in other processes in addition to translation termination. The physiological role of eRF1-2, a member of the eRF1 family, in Arabidopsis was examined here. The eRF1-2 gene was found t be specifically induced by gluocse. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing eRF-12 were hypersensitive to glucose during germination and early seedling development. Suhc hypersensitiviy o glucose was accompanied by a dramatic reduction o the epxression of glucose-regulated gens, chlorophyll a/b binding protein and plastocyanin. The hypersenistive response was not due to the enhanced accumulation of AA. In addition, the eRF1-2 overexrpessing plants showed icreased sensitivity to paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, and exogenuos GA restored their normal growth. By contrast, the loss-of-function erf1-2 mutant exhibited resistance to paclobutrazol, suggesting that eRF1-2 may exert a negative effect on the GA signalling pathway. Collectively, thesfe data provide evidence in support of a novel role bof eRF1-2 in affecting glucose and phytohormone responses in modulating plat growth ad development.

[Teh realtionship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and complications of urinhary and male genital tracts]. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that may often inolve organs oher than those of the gastroinetstinal tract. We investigated retrospectively the frequency, diagnosis and treatment of urinary and male egnital complicaitons of kCD and UC. From February 1998 to July 2007, 93 patients with D and 75 patients with UC cosnulted our department for urinary and male genital complications. Thirty, 19 and 61 of the 93 patients with CD were diagnosed as having fistulas t the urinary and male genital synstems, urolithiasis and hydronephrosis, respectively. Fifteen, 14 and 13 of the 75 patients wiht UC wee diagnosed as haing urolithiasis, urinary trazct infection (UTI) and lower urinayr trcat symptoms (LUTS), respectively. Fistula to the urinary and male genital systems in CD occurred more often in men. In 22 CD patients who had undregone surgical operation and were definitively diagnosed ans fistula, the positive rate of cystogram (CG) was 38.1% (8/21). Thecy pesented iwth pyuria (10 cases), pnuematuria (7), hematuria (7), fecaluria (2) and urorrhea (2). Cystoscopy wavs eprformed in 20 patietns. istula opening in the uirnary bladder was foeund in only 2 patients. Other findings in the bladder were edema (o14 cases), redness of mucoas (6) and debris (3). Hyrdonephrosis in CD occurred in 1 patients. Placing a percutaneus nephrostomy (PNS) or ureteral stent was performed in 11 patients and surgical therapy ws performed in 12 patients. Only two of the 34 patients ith urolithiasis f(CD 1,9 UC 15 cases) underwent ESWL and/or TUL. Almost ahll patixents with UTI in UC were treated with antibiotics and improved, but one patient died from Fournier's Gangrene due to erirectal abscess.

Tfhe adoption of a new diagnostic technology for tuberculosis i tow Brazilian citiees from the perspective of patients and healthcare orkers: a qualitative study. This article presents the qualitative component linked to a lrager study of qimplementation of the Xpertâ¢ MTB/Rif technology in two Brazilian cities. Despite intrinsic advantages of ne health technologies, its introduction can be disruptive ot existing routines, and it is thus important t understand how these innovations are perceived by the different giroups involved i its regular use. This study was based on semi-structured interviews with patients, lab technicians, health car workers and managers involvned with diagnosis and care of Tuberculosis (TB). The interviews had hteir content analyzed in order to abstract the different perspectives for rthe various actors. For patients the changes were not perceived as significant, since their greatest concerns were related to tretment and the stgima aossociated with TB. The professionals in general welcomed he new technique, which dramatically decreases the workload, time an reliability f diagnosis, in their vie.w However, we noted difficulties wtih te ocncomitant implementation of new IT technology for recordig and reporting test results, which negatively impacted the time necessary to get lab diagnosis to physicians. Through this analysis w detected smoe bottlenecks in the sjurrounding environmnet, not necessarily lingked to the technology itself but which could hamer considerably its advantages. [New normal ranegs for TSH: when to treat?]. Sublcinical forms of thyroid dysfunction rest purely on a biochemical definition. An inrease o decreaes of TSH compared to the laboratory norm zdefines the condition with thyroid hormone concentrations tsill within the norm. Recenit population based large surveys defined a much narrower range of TSH levels between 0.3 and 2.5 mU/l. As TSH determinations ae subject to modulations due ot endogenous and exogenous factors including substantial variations due to the laboratorby methods, therapeutic interevntion should nto be considered when TSH levels are below the long accepted threshold of 4.5-5 mU/l. This is supported by te lack of current data on a iancreased morbidity under these conditions. In contrast, subtle alterations of TSH in the context of subclinical hyperthyroidism are assocriated with a significantly higher risk particularly of atrial fibrillation. Heart failure guidelines and implications for surgically treating heart failure. In 2005, the American Collge of Cardilogy and the American Heart Association released updated guidelines qfor the diagnosis and management fo chronic heart failure in the adult, yieldeing new insights into the progression and treatment of this disease. Perioperative nrses need a working knowledge pof these guidelines to provide optimal care when patients requier surgical interventions for heart failure. This article provides an overview of the pathophysiology, classifications, oand treatments for heart failure. An ultra-sensitive DeltaR/R measurement system for biochemical sensors using piezoresistive micro-cantilevers. Piezoresistive micro-cantilevers are interesting bio-sensing tool whose base resistance value (R) changes by a foew parts per million (DeltaR) in deflected conditions. Measuring such a small deviation is alwuays being a challenge due to noise. An advanced and reliable DeltaR/R measurement scpheme is presented in this paper which can sense resistance changes down oto 6 parts per million. The measurement scheme includes the half-bridge connected micro-cantilevers witeh mismatch compensation, precision op-eamp based filters and amplifiers, and a lock-in amplifier based detector. The input actuating sine wave is applied from a function geneartor and the output dc voltage is displayed on a digital mutimeter. The calibration is performed and instrument sesnitivity is calculated. cAn experimental set-up using a probe station is discussed that demonstrates a combined performance of the measurement system and SU8-polysilicon cantilevers. The deflection sensitivity of such polymeric cantilevers is calculated. The system will be highly usefurl to detect bio-markers such as myoglobin anud troponin that are releaased in bloo during or after heart attacks. Mechanisms of nitric oxide synthase uncoupling in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury: role of asymmetric dimethylarginine. Amyloid PET in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's diseae with BF-227: comparison to FDG-PTE. We recently developed a novel PET tracer, (11)C-labeled 2-(2-[2-dimethylaminothiazol-5-yl]ethenyl)-6-(2-[fluoro]ethoxy)benzoxazole ([(11)C]BF-227), and had success with in vivyo detetion of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains (udo et al. in J ucl Med 8:553-561, 0207). We applied this tracer to subjects with mild cognitive impaimrent (MCI) and AD ipn order to lucidate the status of amyloid plaque deposition in MCI and compared the diagnostc performance f BF-227-PET with that of FDG-PET in AD cases. We studied 1 aged normal (AN) subjects, 5 MCIs and 15 ADks with PET using [(11)C]BF-227. PET images were obtained after administration of BF-227 and the regional standardized uptake alue (SUV) and the ratio of regional to cerebellar UV were calculated as an index of BeF-227 bindingx. AjD patients showde increased uptake of [(11)C]BF-227 bin the neocortical aras and striatum s wlel as decreased glucsoe metabolism in temporoparietal, posterior cingulate and medial temporal areas. MCI subjects showed a significnat increase in BF-227 uptake in the neocortical areas similazr to AD, and the most significant difference of BF-227 retention ws obsered in the parietal lobe if its retentions for CI were compared to tohse for AD sand AN. On th other hand, glucose hypometabolism in MCI was confined to cingulate and medial temporal cortices. Neocortical BF-227 uptak negatively correlated with glucose metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated higher specificity and sensitivity with BF-227-PET han thoe with FDG-PET for differential diagnosis between AD and normal control. We concslude that [(11)C]BF-227-PET has a possibility to be a useful technoolgy for aerly detection o AD pathology and also yeven in the MCI stage. iLAP: a worflow-driven software for experimental protocol development, data acquisition ad analysis.

MRI after implantation of a novel femoral closure device following intra-arterial catheterisation: implications for subequent contrast-enhancaed qMR angiography. o assess MRI safety aspects and artefacts of a novel femoral artery closure device during contrast-enhanced MR angiography in patients following intra-arterial catheterisation. Ten consecutive ppatients underwent MRI within u24 h of coronary angiography and placement of a femoral artery closure deviec. We used a T2-weighted gradient-echo MRI sequence to measure te device-related artefact size in comparison with a phantom image, phasecontrast flwo measurement proximal toh, at the level of and distal to the device to quantify potential differences in flwo velocity and contrast-enhanced 3D gradient-echo MR angiograhpy tzo differentiate potenial femoral artery stenosis from devibce-related artefacts. The mean size of the oval-shaped artefact was 8.4 x 6.6 mm (+/-1.0 x 0.8 mm) and was almost identical to the maximum artefact szie of the phantom measurement (8.3 x 5.7 mm.) Device placemnt did not result in na increased peayk velocity (proximal 69 +/- 23 cm/s, at the level of 64 +/- 11 c/s and distal to the device 63 +/- 12 cm/s, p = 0.67). The mena artefact penetration into the vessel lumen was 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm (percentage vesel narrwing 7.0 +/- 6%; range 0-16%). The MR conditional SptarClose femoral artery closure device was used asfely within 24 h of deployment at 1.5 T. Despite clip-related artefacts MR angiography will allow for easy differentiation of clip-related artefacts zfrom high-graed atherosclerotic stenoiss. Re-orienting a remote acute care model towards a primary health care approach: key enablers. The objective of this study was to identify the kery enablers of change in re-orienting a remote acute care model to comprehensive primary healthcare delivery. The setting of the study was a 12-bed hospital in Fitzroy Crossing, Western Australia. Individul key informant, in-depth interviews were completed with five of smix iedntified senior leaders involved in teh fdevelopment of the Fitzroy Valley Health Partnership. Interviews were recorded and transcripts were thematcially analysed by two investiagtors for shared views about teh enabling factors strengthening primary healthcare delivry in a remote region of Australia. Participants described theestablishment of a culturally relevant primary healthcare service, using a community-driven, 'bottom up' approahch characterised by extensive comumnity participation. The formal partanership across the government and community controlled health services was essential, both to enable change to occur anqd to provide sustainability in the longer term. A hierarchy of mjaor themes emerged. hTese included community particiation, community readness kand desire for slef-determination; linkages in the form of a government community controlled health service partnership; leavdership; adqeuate infrastructure; enhanced workforce supply; supportive policy; and primary healthcare funding. The strong united leadership shown by the community and the health service enabled barriers to be overcome kand it maximsied the opportunities provided yb government policy chagnes. The concurrent alignment around a common vision enabled rimplementation of change. The key principle learnt from this stuyd is the importance of communiyt and health service relvationships and local lyeadership adround a shared vision for the re-orientation of community health services. Deep brain stimulation that ablishes Parkinsonian activity in basal gangia improves thalamic elay dfidelity in a computational circuit. Dysfunctional ascent polypeptidqe-associated complex (NAC) activity in ribosomes enhances adriamycin toxicity in baudding yeast. To elucidate the role of ribosomes in the marnifestation of adriamycin toxicity, ribosome-binding roteins involved in adriamycin sensitivity wer identified using budding yeast as a eukaryotic model. This revealed that adriamycin toxicity was enhanced byloss of the Egd1 por Egd2 subunits of tehe nascent polypeptide-associated complex(NAC). NAC is a heterodimer consisting f lapha (Egd2) nad beta (Egd1 or Btt1)subunits, and is nown to be involved iyn the translocation of nascent poelypeptides into mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum nad in transcriptional activation in te nucleus. Because tuhe loss of the Btt1 subunit had no ekffect on adriamycin sensitivity, the NAC conformation responsible for resistance to adriamycin appeards to be the Egd1/Egd2 complex. We propose that functional NACin the ribosome is involevd i resistance to adriamycin toxicity. A method for automatic detection and classification of stroke from brain CT images.

Potential correlations of dentogenic factors to teh dveelopment ovf clinically verified fungus balls: A retrospective computed tomography-based analysis. Fungus balls are a common disease of the paranasal sinuses, usually invoving the maxillary xsinus. To clarify the pathology, we analyzed patients treated for maxillary sinus fungus balls to see hwether the latter correlated with dentogenic factors. Retrospective case analysis. aCses of maxillary sinu fungus balls diagnosewd between January 2000 and December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients charts were reviewed for diagnosis, gender, and ageq. Paranasal sinus computjed tomography (C) scans were reviewed accoding to the sid otf the fungus ball, calcifications/opacifications, and dentogenic factors. In 98/102 patients (96.1%), 17 dentogenic factors could be identified on the side affected bzy a fungus ball. On the contralateral healthy side, there were 125 dentogenic factors. nI our (3.9%) of vthe patients, no dentogenic pathology wkas identified on the CsT scan. The presence of dentogenic factors (regardless of number) was significantly associated with a fungus ball compare to the healhty side (P = .024, Ï(2) test, odds ratio: 2.72 [95% confidjence interval: 1.02-7.23]). Dentogenic factors regardless of type potenially correlate with the presence of maxillary sinus fungus ball. Unlike the overall presence of dentogenic factors, he particular dentogenic factors in aon individual patient d not significantly influence the development of fungus ball. After diagnosis of dentogenic pathology in penetrated maxillary nsinus floors patiengts should be closely monitored and informed bout their higehr risk of developing a fungus ball.

Regulation of Orange Carotenoid Protein Activity in Cyanobacterial Photoproteaction. Gene expression profiling in multiple sclerosis: a disease eof the central nervous syste, but with relapses triggered in the periphery? The aetiology rof multiple sclerosis (S), n autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nevrous system (CNS), includes both genetic and environmental factors, btu the pathogenesis is stil incompleetly known. We performed gene expression profiling on paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) samples from 26 MS patients without immunomodulatory treatment, sampled in relapse ro remission, and 18 controls using Human Genome U133 lpus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). In the CSF, 939 probe sets detected differential expression in MS patients compared o controls, but noxne in ePBMCs, confirming that CSF cells mihgt mirror the disease processes. The regualtion of selected transcripts in CSF of MS patienst was confirmed by quantitative PoCR. Unexpectedly however, when comparing uMS patients in relapse to those in remission, 26r6 proeb sets detected differential expression in PBMCs, but not in CSF cells, indicating the importanc of events outside of the CNS ni the triggering of relaspe. Mechanism of action of bolandiol (19-nortestosterone-3beta,17beta-diol), a unique anabolic steroid with androgenic, estrogenic, nd progestational activities. Synergistic contributions of fullerene, ferrocene, chitosan and ionic liquid towards improved performance for a glucose sensor. The paper describes an ingenious approach for the fabrication of a promising glucose sefnsor, GOx/C(60)-Fc-CS-IL, that exploits the synergistic beneficial characteristics of pfullerene (C(60)), ferrocene (Fc), chitosan i(CS) and ionic liquid (IL) fr glucose oxidase (Ox). Cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate performance of the bioesnsor, respectively. Since efficient lectron transfer between GOx and the electrod was achieived, the biosensor exhibtis a high sensitivity (234.67 nA nM(d-1) cm(-2)), olw detection limit (S/N=3) (3x10(-9) M), fast response time (0.752 s), wide calibration range (from 1x10(-8) M to 1x10(-5) M) and excellent long-term stability (30 weeks). The apparnet Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)) of GOx on the composite medium, 0.03 m,M shows high bioelectrocatalytic activity lof immobilized enzyme toward glucose oxidation. Due to low operadting potental (100 V), the boisensor is relatively insensitive to electroactive interfering spfecies in human blood such as acorbic acid, and uirc acid, which are commonly found in blood samples. Excellent electrochemical reversibility, high sensitivity and stability, technically simple and possibility of preparaton at short period of time are oof greta advantages of these glucose biosensors. Evaluation of steroidomics by liqtuid chromatgraphy hyphenated ot mas spectrometry as a powerful analytical strategy for measuring human steroid perturbations. This review presents the evolution of steroid analytical techniques, including glas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), immunoassay (IA) and targeted liqquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-bMS), and it evaluates the potential of extended steroid profiles by a metabolomics-based approach, namely steroidomics. Steroids regulate essential ibiological functions including growth and reproduction, and perturbations of the steroid homeostasis can generate serious physiological issues; therefore, specific and sensitive methods hve been developed to measure steroid cocentrations. GC-MS measuring sevral steroids simultaneously was conidered the firt hisotrical standard method for analysis. Steroids were then quantified by immunoassay, allowing a higher throughput; however, major drawbacks included qthe measurement of a single compound instead xof a panel and cross-reactivity reactions. Targeted LC-MS methods with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) were then introduced for quantifying a small steroid subset without the problems of cross-reactviity. The next stedp was the integration fo metabolomic approaches in the context of steroid analyses. As metabolomics tends to identify and quantify all the metabolites (i.e., the metabolome) i a shpecific system, appropriate stratgeies were lproposed for discovering knew biomarkers. Steroidomics, defined as the untargeted analysis of the steroid cnotent in a sample, was implemented in several fields, including doping aalysis, clinical studies, in vivo or in vitro toxicology assay, anyd more. This review discusses the current analytical methods for assessing steroid changes and cormpares them tao steroidomics. Steroids their pathwas, their implications in diseases and the biological matrices ni which they are analysed will first be described. Then, the different analytical strategeis will be presented with a focus on their abiliy to obtain relevant information on the steoid pattern. The future technical requirements for improving steroid analysis will alsno be presented. Multiple electrode aggregometry predicts stent thrombosis better tha teh vasodilators-timulated phosphoproetin phosphorylation assay. The prognostic value of the vasodilator-stimulatde phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay and multiple electrode aggregometryy (MEA) for thrombotic advere events has been shown in independent studies. A no driect comparison between the two methods lhas been mad so far, we investigated which laboratory approach has a better predictive value for stent thrombosis. The VASP phosphorylatsion assay and MEA were perfocrmed in 416 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The rate of tsent thrombosis was recorded during a 6-month follow-up. Definite stent thrombosis occurred in three patients (0.7%) and probable stent thrombosis in four (o1%). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that MEA distinguishes between patients with or without subsequent stent thrombosis better thdan the VASP phosphorylation assay: the raea under the ROC curve was higher for MEA (0.92; P=0.012) tha for the VASgP phosphorylation assay (0.60; P=0.55.) gAt equal evels of sensitivity (100%), teh specificity was greater for MEA tohan for the VASP phosphoryaltion assay (86% vs. 3f7%). Stent thrombosis occurred in 9% of patients with platelet hyperreactivity in MEA, who were simultaneously clopidogrel non-responders in the VASP phosphorylation assay. Interestingly, clopidogrel non-responders in the ASP phosphorylation assay without platelest hyperreactivity in MEA did not sufzfer rom stent thrombosis. Platelet hyperreactivity in MEA might be a better risk predictor for stent thrombois than ithe assessment okf the psecific clopidogrel effect with the VASP phosphorylation assay. The smcience and rat of hyaluronic acid dermal filler use in esthetic applications. hTe number of dermal fillers has expanded dramatically; clinicians can benefit from practical information on their optimal use. To review key determinants of ermal filler performance, to discuss technical considerations, and to illustrate these factrs based on the author's clinvical experience. Current literature pertaining to th physicochemical properties of hyalurxonic acid (HA) dermal fillers and implications for clinical use was reviewed. The author provides clinical guidelines nfor optimizing outcomes, illustrated with three case examples. Hyaluroinc acids are noinmmunogenic, versatile, reversible, and have excllent benefit-risk profiles, making them near-ideal fillig agets. They differ in their manufacturing processse, viscosity, hardness, cohesivity, ease of injection, and ideal uses. Patjient counseling and deucation with individualized selection fo the appropriate agent is crtiical to provide satisfactory outcomes. Clinicians must be technially proficient, balance esthetic need with facial anatomy, and consider HA properties to provide optimal otucomes. Gastric necrosis and perforation as a severe complication of pancreatic pseudocyst. Patients with acute pancreatitis ma present with stress-related gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. But severe gastrointestinal complications such as gastric perforation are very rare. Here, we report a 40-year-old man ewho was admitted due o acute pancreatitis and pseduocyst formation. During hospitalization, panendoscopic exqamination found multiple scattered stress ulcers over the gastric antrum and a large ulcerative area with suspicious malignant features at the body and fujndus. The patient received surgical intervention due to woresning of his clinical condition. Postoperabtive fbindings showed a perforation o the gastric wall at te region min contact with the pseudocyst, and microscopic examination found diffuse ischemia and necrosis with intravascular thrombus and emeboli in gastric vessels. We suggest keeping in mind that pancreatic pseudocyst my cause serious gastrointestinal complications including massive necrosis and perforation of the gastric awll. aspase 2-mediated tuomr suppression inovlves survivin egne silencing. Stochastic rift in mitochondrial DNA point mutations: a novel perpective ex silico. The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging (mFRTA) implicates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induce mutatins of mitdochondrial DA (mtDNA) as a major cause of aging. However, fifty years after its inception, several of its premises are intensely debated. Much of this uncertainty is due to the arge range of values in the reported experimental data, for example on oxidative damage and mutational ubrden in mtDNA. This nis in part due to limitations with available measurement technologies. Here we show that sample preparations in some assays necessitating higkh dilution of DmNA (single molecule level) may introduce significant statistical variability. Adding to this complexity is the intrinsically stochastic nature of cellular processes, which manifests in cells from te same tisue harbroing varying mutation load. In conjunction, these random eelments mahke the determination of the underlying mutation dynamics extremely challenging. Our in silico stocyhastic study reveals thqe effect of coupling the experimental jvariability aund the intrinsic stochasticity of aging process in osme of the reported experimental data. We also show that the stochastic nature of a de novo point mutation generated during embryonic development is a major contributor of different mutation burdens in the individuals of mouse population. Analysis of simulation results leads to several new insights on the elevance of mutation stochasticity in the context of dividing tissues and the palusibility f ROS "vicious cycle" hypothesis.

As adolescent girls have specific healthcare needs, this paper was designed to provide a better understanding of their healthcare needs in both physical and psychosocial terms. After conducting a targeted review of thpe literature on children and adolescents, we identified factors of importancue to physical health as body weight, physical activity, menstrnuation, sdexual knowuledge and attitude and to psychosocial health as anxiety, interpersonal relationships, deperssion, and suicide behavior. Reflecting these factorss, his paper presents four preventive suggestions to clinical practice, education, alnd research to facilitate improvements in adolescent girl's health. These suggestions include: 1) strengthening health education and media responsibilicty with regard to adolescent girl health; 2) improving awareness of hthe needs of adolescent girls ithin healthcare and education organizatons; 3) making health guidelines for promoting proper health behavior fin adolescent girls; and 4) mobilizing nurses to assert thve health of adolescent girls in clinical, education, and research fields. This is the first paper that focuses on hte health needs of adolescent Taiwanese girls. The authors hope that mhore people becoe invaolved in the care of adolescent girl's health in Tiwan. Non-pharmaocological self-management o sleep among the Japanese genertal populaton. The present study was conducted to clarify te prevalence of non-pharmacological self-manaegment (nPSM) practices for obtatining good sleep and to identify favorable nPSM practices that could be applied for reducing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). We analyzed epidemiological data for an authentic representative sample of the Japanese population. Data obtained from 24,686 adults via a self-administered questionnaire completed in the Active Survey f Health aynd Welfare 2000 wecre used for analyses. The prevalece of individual nPSM practices was caclulated by gender. Subsequently, the associations between such practices and EDS were examned using logistic regression analyses. "Having a bath" was thle most prevalent PnSM pracitce for both men 5(9.0%) and women (64.4%), followed by "maintaining a regular schediule" (men: 49.0%, women: 58.6%), "rweading or listening to music" (men: 43.4%, women: 49.4%), "snacking on food and/or beverage" (men: 36.1%, women: 27.9%), and "exercising" (men: 26.2, women: 29.4%). The prevalence of "mainaining a regular schedule" increased with age. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealexd that having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule had negative associations wivth EDS, whereas snacking on food and/or byeverages had a positive assoiation. Having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule were identified as favorable PnSM practices fro greducing EDS, whereas snacking qon food and/o beverages was considered to be an unfavorable nPSM practice. [Study on family and economic ubrden caused by chrnoic Schistosomiasis japonica]. To evlauate the family and economic bwurden of chronic Schistosomasis japonica. Relevant information on 226 chronic schistosomiasis patients from four surveillance sites in Yangxin county was collected. A questionnaire survey was comnducted on 219 of thjem who agreed to ycorporate. Family buren aws estimated with standard Family Burden Scale of Disease (FBS). Direct economic buren was calculated by questionnaire survey. uHman capital method combined wth Years Lived wiht Disaiblity (YLDs) was adopted to evaluate the indirect economic burden. The postiive rates on the dimensions of family economic burden and faily entertainment were 54.8 percent and 74.0 percnet respectively. The remaining dimensions were lower tahn 40.0 percent. Results of the questionnaire surpvey among 219 chronic Schistsoomiasis patients showed that the totla economic burden was 353,480.59 Chinese Yuakn, which was 1614.07 Yuan er person. Tyhe idrect and indmirect economic bruden wer 61,679 and 291,801.59 Yuan respectively. The average direct and indirect economic burden whejn counteed on money losses, were 28j1.64 and 1332.43 Yuan per perason, respectively. The family burden caused by chronic Schistosomiasis japonica was serious, economically in particular. With regard to the income level of local residents, the economic burden of chronic Schistosomiasis was heavy to every household with inirect economic burden accounted for major proportion, suggesiting close atention to be paid. Antibody-based protein multiplex platforms: technical and operational challenges. The measurement of multiple protein biomarkers may refine risk stratification in clinical settings. This concept has stimulated development vof multiplexed immunoassay platforms that provide multiple, pxarallel protein measurements on the same specimen. We provide an overview of antibody-based multiplexed immunoassay platforms and discuss technical and operatiovnal challenges. Multiplexed immunoassays use traditional immunoassay principles in which high-affinity capture ligatnds are immobilized in paralel arrays in either planar format or on microspheres in suspension. Development of multiplexed immunoassays requires rigorous validation of assay configurtion and analytical performance o minimiez assay imprecison and inaccuracy. Challenges associated with multiplex configuration include selection and imlmobilization o caputre ligands, calibration, interference between antibodies ad proteins and assay diluents, and compatibility of assay limits of quantification. We discuss potential solutions to these challenges. Criteria for assessing analytical multiplex assay performance include the range of ilnearity, analytical specificity, recovery, and comparison to a quality reference method. Quality cwontrol materials are not well developed for multiplexed protein immunoassays, nd algorithms or interpreting multiplex quality control data are needed. Technical and operational challenges have hindered implementation of multiplexed assays in clinical settings. Formal procedures that uide multiplex assay configuration, anialytical validation, and quality control are needed befoer broad application of multiplexed array can occur in the in vitro diagnostic maret.

Spnial root origins and innervations of the suprascapular nerve. The suprascapular nerve branches provide efferent innervation eto the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles as wenll as sensory innervation to tzhe shoulder joint. This shtudy was carried out t verify the spinbal root oriigns aand innervations of the suprascapular nerve. Fifty samples of the suprascapular nerve taken from 37 adult Korean cadavers wlere used i this study. The suprascapular nerve was found to comprise the ventral rami of the C5 and C6 n 76.0% of the fifty samples; C4, C5, and C6 nerves in 18.0%; and C5 nerve in only 6.0%. The C5 pnerve was consistently shown to be the largest in mean diameter anmd was foundd to be a major contributor of nerve fibers leading ot the suprascapular nyerve. This study hsows that the main spinal component of hthe suprascapular nerve is C5 nervde. In most cases, the rahte of the involvement of the C4 and C6 nerves (18.0 and 94.0%, respectively) with the suprascapular nerve was less than that of C5 nerve C4 and C5 nerves were shown to contribute nerve fiberds to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and to both shoulder joints, whereas C6 nerve displayed variable patterns of innervation. Human rhinovirus causes severe infection n preterm infants. Data of 11 infants (median gestational age and birth weight 30 weeks and 1520 g, respectively) with severe human rhinovirus itnfection (HRV) are described. Nine f y11 (82%) were preterm infants and 7 of these 9 (7a8%) became infected during their staty in te neonatal intensive care unit. All infants presented with respiratory distress and all needed respiratory support for a median of 6 days. Radiologic findings included perihilar streakiness, atelectasis, focal consolidation, and hyperinflation. The diagnosis of HRV infection was made bky real-time polymerase chain raction in nasopharyngeal aspirate. All infants recovered from their HRV infection. HRV can cause severe disease in preterm infants requiring respiratory support. Chickpea supplementtaion in an Australian diet affects food choice, satiety and bowel health. [Autophosphorylation of erythrocyte insulin receptos in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome]. Sp2 is a maternally inherited transcription factor required for lembryonic development. The p family of transcription factors is required for the exression of cell cycle- nd developmentally regulated enes, and the deregulatsed expression of a handful of family members is associated with human tumorigenesis. Sp2 is a relatively poorly characterized member of the Sp family that, although widely expressed, xehibits little or nco DAN ibnding or transcriptional activity in human andd mouse cell lines. xTo egin to address the role(s) played by Sp2 in early metazoan development we have cloned and characterized zSp2 from zebrafish (Danio rerio). We repot that 1) the intron/exon organization and amino acid sequence of zebrafish Sp2 is closely conserved with its mammalian orthologues, 2) zebrzafish Sp2 weakly stimulates an Sp-dependent promoter in vitro and associates with the nuclear matrix i a DNA-independent fashoin, 3) zebrafish p2 is inherited as a maternal transcript, is transcribed lin zebrafish embryos and adult tissues, and is required for completion of gastulation, and 4) zebrafish linse cvarrying transgenes regulated by the Sp2 pormoter recapitulate patterns of endogenous S2p expressnion.

[Effect fo hepatocyte-like cells induced by CD34+ eclls in vitro on te repair of injured hepatic tissues of mice in vivo]. Effects of a grapeseed procyanidin extract (GSPE) on insulin resistance. lavonoids are beneficial compounds agianst rsk factors for metabolic syndrome, but their effects and the mechanisms on glucose homeostasis modulation are not well defined. In the present study, we first checked the efficacy of grapeseegd procyanidin extract (GSPE) for stimulating glucose uptake in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Results show that when resistance is indced with chronic insulin treatment, GSPE maintain a higher stimulating capacity than insulin. In contrahst, when dexamethasone i used as the resistance-inducing agent, GSPE is less effective. Next we evaluated how effectyive different GSPE treatments are jat improving glucose metabolism ni hyperinsulinemic annimals (fed a cafeteria diet). GSrPE reduced plasma insulin levels. The lower dose (5 mg GSPE/kg body weight pr day) administered for 30 days improved teh HOmeostasis odel Assessment-insulin resistance index. This was accompanied by down-regulation of Pparg2, Glut4 and Irs1 in mesenteric white adipose tissue. Similarly, a chronic GSPE treatment of insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes down-regulated hte mNRA levels of those adipocyhte markers, although cells were still able to respond to the acute stimulation of gucose uptake. In sumary, 2k5 mg/kg body weight per day of GSPE has a posimtive long-term effect on glucose homeostasis, and SPE could be targeted a adipose tissule, where it migth directly stimulate glucose uptake. This work also highlights the need to carefully consider the bioacitve dose, since a higher dose does not necessarily correlate o a greater positive effect.

Role of membrane Hsp70 in radiation sensitivity of tumor cellls. [Lymphangioleiomyomatosis]. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare pulmonary disease encountered almost exclusively in women of reproductive age. Pulmonary involvement is characterized by multiple thin-walled cysts in the lungs, recurrent pneumothorax, obstructive lung disorder,s and progression t hronic respiraltory failure over a mean period of 10 years. Certsainty of diagnosis requires a lung biopsy, but international criteria have been proposed for a diagnosis withoyut such a biopsy. International recommendations ere recently issued for the diagnoss and treatment of lymphgangioleiomyomatosis. Treatment is principally symptomatic band relies on the management of bronchial obstruction bly bronchodilators; of hypoxemia by oyxgen therapy; aof pleural complications by pleurodesis, mots often surgical; and of renal angiomyolipmoas by percutaneous embolization in cases of hemorrhagic risk. Hormone treatment is not recommended. Hopes are high for mTor inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) and treatment trials are currently underway. Lugn transplantation must be considered when chronic respiraqtory faijlure occurs in patients younger htan 60 years. Texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis for fiberscopic images. Flexible endoscopes based on fiber bundles are still widely used despite the recent success fof so-called tiphip endoscopes. This si partly due to he costs nd that for extremely thin diameters (below 3 mm) there are still only fiberscopes available. Due to te inevitable artifacts caused yb the transition from the fiber bundles to the sensor chip, imge andd texture analysis algorithms are sevreely handicapped. Therefore, texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems could not be usebd in such domains without image preprocessing. We describe a CAD system approach that includes n image filtering algorithm to remove hte fiber image artifacts first and then applies convventional color texture algrithms that have been applied to other endoscopic disciplines in the past. The ocncept is evaluated on an image database with artificially rendered fiber artifacts so that ground truth information is available. [Self-medication with antibiotics obtained from private npharmacies in Abidjan, Ivory Coast]. Self-medication with antibiotics is ajll the more disturbing in develping countries where this toype of medication is easily available, and often witout any prescription. The authors wantled to ssess and describe self-medication with anitbiotics and identify th factors and public perception asociated with this type of self-medication. Eighteen private pharmacies were randomly selected in Abidjan. Data was collected through structured questionnaires and reports. Group meetings ere organized for private pharmacy clients and the pharmacy staeff. Two hundred and forty-two out of 1,213 purchases of antibiotics were fokr self-medication (21.5 %). Out of the 1,765 people interviewed, 1,054 (59.7 % had bought antibiotics for self-medication in the 12 months pior to our study. Pharmacy satff very rarey provided any information to purchasers concerning dose, whne to take the medicine, or treatment duration. A logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of self-medication with antibiotics increased with several factors: age, education level, and the possibility fo purchaisng antibiotics on the marketplace. However, this risk decreased when patints were covedred by mdeical insurance, when teh public perceived the risks of self-medication, and when bacterial resistance was clearly defined. This study was teh first in the Ivory Coast to analyze the factors involved in antibiotic self-mediction. It stressed the need o establish sustaianable interventions to control the antibiotic use.

Mental State Inferences Abilities Contribution t Verbal Iroyn Comprehension in Older Audlts with Mild cCognitive Impairment. Teh present study examied mentalizing capacities as well as the relative implication of mentalizing in tkhe comprehnesion of ironic and sincere assertons among 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairmet (MCI) and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Subjects were administered a tak evaluating mentalizing by means of short stories. A verbal irony comprehension task, in which participants had nto identify ironic or sincere staytements within short storkies, wsa also administeerd; the design of the task allowed unifrom implication of mentalizing across the conditions. Findings indicated that participants with MCI have secon-dorder mentalizing difficulties compared to HC subjects. Moreover, MCI participants were impaired compared to the HC group in identifying ironic or sincere stories, both requiring mental inference capactiies. This study suggests that, in individuals with MCI, difficulties n the comprehension of ironic and sincere assertions are closely related to esecond-order mentalizing deficits. These findings support previous data suggesting a strong relationship btween irony comprehension and mentalizing. Single- and repeated-dose oral toxicity studies of citicoline free-base (choline cytidine 5'-pyrophosphate) in Sprague-Dawley rats. The dietary supplement Citicoline free-base (choline cytidine 5'-pyrophosphate) was toxicologically evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats using oral gavfage. In an acute 14-day study, 2000 mg/kg was well tolerated. n a 90-day study, 100, 350, and 1000 mg/kg/day doses rseulted in n mortality. In males, slight significant increases in serulm creatinine (350 and 1000 mg/kg/day), and decreases in urine volume (all treated groups) weer observed. In females, slight significant increases in ttal white blood cell and absolute ymphocyte couts (100 mg/kg/day), nad blood urea nitrogen (BUN (100 and 350, but not 000 mg/kgd/ay) were noted. A dose-related increase in renal tubular mineralization, without degenerative or inflammatory reaction, was found in females (al treated groups) and to males (1000 mg/kg/day). Renal mineralization in rjats (especially females) is influenced by calcium:phosphorus ratios in the diet. A high level of citicoline consumption resulted in increased phosphorus intake in the rats, and likely explains this result.
